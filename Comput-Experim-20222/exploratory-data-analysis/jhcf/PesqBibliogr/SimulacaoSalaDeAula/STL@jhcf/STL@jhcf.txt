AB Virtual Interactive Student-Oriented Learning Environment (VISOLE) is a constructivist pedagogical approach to game-based learning. It encompasses the creation of a near real-life online interactive world modeled upon a set of multidisciplinary domains, in which each student plays a role in this "virtual world" and shapes its development. With sophisticated multiplayer simulation context and teacher facilitation, VISOLE aims at providing opportunities for students to acquire subject-specific knowledge in a multidisciplinary manner as well as sharpen their generic skills for problem solving. With a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of inquiry, an evaluative study on VISOLE was conducted in Hong Kong, involving the deployment of VISOLE in 16 schools (with 254 students and 28 teachers). Notwithstanding, the positive quantitative findings (the students' advancement in the knowledge and problem-solving generic skills concerned) of the study, the qualitative data revealed that some phenomena which emerged during the VISOLE process impeded the students' learning process. On the other hand, some of the teachers, who also observed the same impeding phenomena, initiated or suggested some new interventions to mitigate these phenomena. The findings threw light on the issue of how to enhance the current design of VISOLE.

AB dUsually students learn more if the method of instruction matches their learning style Since Physics and Chemistry deal with three-dimensional (3-D) objects the ability to visualize and mentally manipulate shapes is very helpful in their learning In fact much of what Physics and Chemistry students know takes the form of images However little attention has been given to the pedagogical effectiveness of visual stimuli in those disciplines Computers are being increasingly used as teaching tools The new approaches include simulations multimedia presentations and more recently virtual environments Computer-based worlds are useful to visualize physical and chemical processes allowing for better conceptual understanding Since 3-D virtual environments need to be explored and evaluated in science education we have created a virtual environment (Virtual Water) for studying phases of matter phase transitions and atomic orbitals at the final year of high school and first year of university levels Based on that work we discuss the implications of visual learning in designing strategies to cater for differences in learning modes Our study indicates that 3-D virtual environments may help students with high spatial aptitude to acquire better conceptual understandings However only some parameters (interactivity navigation and 3-D perception) have shown to be relevant and only for some topics On the other hand stereoscopic visualizations do not seem to be relevant with the exception of crystalline structures.

ID DESIGN
AB Programming is being included in educational curricula around the world to develop computational thinking. However, there is no consensus on what processes this thought implies, nor on how to intervene and evaluate its development. Therefore, the objective is to propose a teaching strategy for programming and robotics, which really develops this thinking and can be applied to solve problems, from a maker perspective that facilitates the transfer of knowledge to real contexts. To this end, a robotics course has been taught, insisting on the cognitive processes of this thinking that are commonly used in problem solving (abstraction, data processing, creation of an algorithm), and encouraging the use of a computational strategy, using the processes of this thought not employed in problem solving (decomposition of the problem, automation, parallelism, simulation). To measure it, digital tests have been created based on the multiple complex-systems approach, used in PISA 2012. The results indicate that computational thinking is applied more easily to the execution of the algorithm than to the representation of the problem. This finding allows us to establish a programming learning process that facilitates the development of computational thinking, to solve any problem by applying a computational strategy: focusing first on applying this strategy to the creation of the algorithm and then to the representation of the problem.

AB This paper explores data retrieved from Educational Immersive Virtual Worlds to describe pre-service teachers' skills and perceptions about the simulation tasks. This project had 10 participants who were immersed for 3 years in the Technology and Pedagogical Models in Immersive Worlds island, a multi-user virtual environment in Second Life and Open Simulator. In this project, we evaluated how three-dimensional virtual environments can facilitate the achievement of teaching and learning processes. Based on quantitative and qualitative methodologies, two data collection instruments were applied. Through observation grids and personal log books, professional performance of the 18 pedagogical challenges implemented was collected. The statistical analysis shows that the students improved their technology skills and educational aspects about good practices in classes, regardless of the type of platform used. The analysis through Constant Comparing Method reported a positive assessment of the use of virtual environments, especially about the use of teaching strategies. Main conclusions regarding the pedagogical context reflect the importance of peer assessment on teaching performance, as well as the complexity of role-plays as intellectual challenges to enhance pre-service teachers' skills. The main difficulties identified during the development of the activities were technical in nature, reporting hardware and connectivity issues.

TI INNOVATIVE EDUCATIONAL SCENARIOS IN GAME BASED TEACHING AND LEARNING

DT Article
DE educational game; teaching innovative; business game; 3D visualization;
   computer assisted
AB The didactical game can be considered part of an educational scenario in teaching and learning. This article aims to show how fundamental concepts from the economicmathematical modeling area can be visualized, how to organize knowledge in coherent scenarios, presented in an educational game manner, to gain the attention and influence students' spirit of competition.
   At the same time, benefitting from the 3D visualizations, the graphical interfaces for navigating in multidimensional spaces or projections are defined and thus imagination used for mental models construction is stimulated and human intuition is capitalized in the process of knowledge discovery, assisted by computer with analytic algorithms type. Exploration becomes a game feature and can be pursued both numerically and visually. 3D environments give realism to visualizations that are found in games, facilitating realimaginary relationship throughout the game and enhancing learning motivation.
   The innovative character of teaching is given by the method in which the teacher creates his own educational scenario by considering specific learning objectives, age particularities of students, time and space-related resources, the technical requirements of the game and the evaluation method. The paper makes several references to such projects, developed by the authors and implemented in working with students. Game based on demonstration ( using simulation, modelling or visualization) coordinates users to obtain relevant information; the multiple representations of knowledge are so used and compared through a multitude of examples.

ID MULTIPLE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
AB Assessment can help teachers to examine the effectiveness of teaching and to diagnose the unfamiliar basic concepts (or attributes) of students within the testing scope. A web-based adaptive testing and diagnostic system can achieve the above objective efficiently and correctly. From a diagnostic point of view, the major concerns are to diagnose whether or not an examinee has learned each basic concept well in the testing scope, while also limiting the number of test items used (the testing length) to as few as possible, which will be directly related to the patience of the examinee. In this paper, we consider a test item selecting optimization diagnostic problem to reveal the mastery profile of an examinee (that is, to diagnose each basic concept's learning status (well learned/unfamiliar) in the testing scope) with a short testing length and a limited test item exposure rate. This paper uses the techniques of Group Testing theory for the design of our test item selecting algorithm. Two test item selecting strategies, the bisecting method and the doubling method, are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed methods was evaluated by experimental simulations. The results show that both of the proposed algorithms use fewer test items and a limited test item exposure rate compared to the conventional methods.

TI Transportation Engineering Instructional practices Analytic Review of
   the Literature
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID EDUCATION; FRAMEWORK
AB Instructional practices in transportation engineering education are evolving, and only some of these changes have been documented in the literature. This paper provides a systematic review of journal articles and refereed conference papers that address innovations in transportation engineering education; the focus is on novel instructional practices and their influence on student learning. The literature review finds 46 articles for analysis, with an increasing frequency of those publications over time. Instructional practices described in these papers include simulation, visualization, problem-based learning, and other active-learning techniques. Most of these articles were written by individual researchers or a team of researchers at a single institution, and few of the articles cite one another; this finding suggests a need for more effective dissemination. Techniques for measuring student learning include in-person interviews, a variety of survey types (typically multiple choice or open-ended), concept maps, and direct assessment of student work. These techniques are implemented mostly as postassess-ments, but in some work, a pre- and postcourse experimental design is employed. It is clear that more rigorous evaluation of student learning, resulting from changes in teaching practices, should be considered. This analytical review of the literature provides a resource for transportation engineering educators to identify pedagogical practices that are relevant to their courses and suggestions for how to measure the effect of these techniques on student learning.

AB Interactive learning content is a key to the success of online learning materials. Hence, many systems for creating and delivering interactive content has been developed in academia. In practice, however, teachers have to choose the suitable system from the multitude of available choices, thus limiting themselves to the features of that system. Furthermore, educational researchers have data collected in different formats by different systems. In this paper, we describe how we worked around these issues when implementing a new introductory computer science course using the ViLLE learning environment. The new course consists of six main topics, each of which is covered on a lecture and an online tutorial. The tutorials contain textual material together with numerous automatically assessed exercises with visual and immediate feedback. As we developed the course material, we integrated two educational systems - JSAV for algorithm simulation exercises and js-parsons for program construction tasks - into the ViLLE environment in order to use them on the course. This was enabled by the use of the framework for creating exercises into the ViLLE learning environment. The framework aims at easing the inclusion of interactive exercise into the environment by exercise system developers. In the paper, we briefly describe the course, the ViLLE exercise framework and out technical solution, as well as student results from the course and feedback on the exercise types.

AB In education, the role-playing represents an active-participatory training strategy based on the simulation / dramatization of specific behaviors taken from real life situations. In Science education, the role-playing can be exploited in order to facilitate a deeper understanding of the contents subsumed in this area. Using this method, it is provided a sustained involvement of students, who learn to approach diverse perspectives of a number of problem situations, identifying and testing various alternatives as solutions.
   The roles have multiple meanings formative valences in terms of developing: (a) communication skills; (b) empathic ability; (c) initiative; (d) problem solving skills; (e) reflection; (f) group work; (g) argumentative ability; (h) decision making etc. In any circumstances, the success of this method depends more on the teacher's skill, who gives evidence in the design and conduct of role acting, offering in this way, a genuine opportunity for students' training.
   In the PROFILES Project, a part of the teachers who graduated the "PROFILES - Education through Science" Continuous Professional Development Programme, proposed role-playing activities, in order to encourage students to be actively involved in the lessons, with the view to facilitate their understanding. In this respect, the paper tries to emphasize on several role-playing activities, with particular aspects illustrated in Physics, Chemistry and Biology lessons.

AB We investigated whether students' understanding of line graphs can be improved by means of dynamic visualisations. The visualisations were designed to help students relate motion phenomena and line graphs to one another. In an initial study three groups were formed: the first group learned on the basis of simulated motion phenomena and dynamic line graphs; the second group additionally had dynamic iconic representations available to them; the third group was also presented with dynamic stamp diagrams. Contrary to our expectations, students were not able to make use of the visualisations in order to improve their understanding of line graphs. We hypothesised that students did not receive sufficient support in comprehending the visualisations. In a second study two groups were investigated. While the first group learned on the basis of simulated motion phenomena and dynamic line graphs, the second group additionally had dynamic iconic representations as well as dynamic stamp diagrams available to them. It was possible for the students in both groups to ask questions and to receive assistance from a teacher as well as from peers while learning from the visualisations. The results demonstrate that the pedagogical measures enabled the students to successfully make use of dynamic visualisations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Teachers' Professional Development (TPD) training programs should engage teachers by providing stimulating authentic experiences. To this direction, educational games, simulations and 3D virtual worlds can be seen as engaging realistic and immersive spaces with major advantages. Towards this, a virtual TPD training program based on the 3D world of Second Life (SL) was designed and implemented for in-service teachers. The aim is to deliver a virtual learning environment so as to engage teachers in activities for developing a global identity, being open and flexible to other cultures and interacting in multicultural contexts. The proposed TPD training program is based on the theoretical approach of Creative Problem Solving and de Bono's 'Six Thinking Hats' method. On the program, participants are engaged in interactive activities, such as discussion and role playing based on the initiative 'Learning to Live Together' of Arigatou International institution which highlights the value of respect, peace and the sense of global community. We conducted a quasi-experimental research with using a pre/post-test and authentic assessment appraising the participants' reactions, in order to examine creative problem solving skills. The findings revealed that trainees after the completion of the TPD training program tend to improve their creative problem solving skills.

AB Education has an irreplaceable role in human society. Like human society itself, education has gone through many stages of development that corresponded to the level and means of a particular era. One of the dominant features of today is certainly the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Today we can talk about the information revolution. It is understandable that its impact is also applied in the area of education.
   For the upcoming generation, it is already completely natural to work with information in electronic form. The Internet becomes the primary source of unlimited knowledge, it is enough to know how to work with the technologies. Their development is growing at an incredible pace. The future is most likely to be dominated by intelligent machines and systems that do the most work for man. Developing such technologies requires people with high-quality education. E-learning now enables students to engage fully in the learning process, to participate in simulations and tests as never before. E-learning reduces barriers to access to education, opens up the opportunities to educate a wide range of people, uses new technologies to achieve better access to education, provides the student with a greater control over his/her education. From a pedagogical point of view, e-learning is a combination of educational philosophy, a set of educational and learning strategies, and confidence in information and communication technologies as a means of mediating content. The philosophy of e-learning is not about providing information. It is aimed at the student and the emphasis is transferred from teaching to learning. Rather than being only information and content providers, eLearning lecturers should concentrate on encouraging students to become more active and apply their knowledge and not just reproduce it. Emphasis is placed on learning and students have more freedom to become responsible for their education.
   The digital environment today offers lots of information and communication tools. The digital multimedia world also offers a person who is interested the freedom of how to get to new knowledge. Working with information requires the student to think about learning strategies to avoid getting lost in the overflow of information in hypermedial form. Everyone has a different "trajectory" of education, it differs in the structure of knowledge, in motivation, and so on. The best thing is to learn something that you are very much interested to study. Individual interests and learning techniques are currently supported by a wide range of telecommunication-based education technologies.
   The inflow of new technologies, however, raises the question of their effective use - does not the clever helper to achieve the goal become the goal itself?
   The paper presents selected technologies that innovate and will continue to innovate learning processes in the upcoming years, whether it's e-learning, m-learning, the application of virtual and advanced reality, gamification, simulation and personalization. Personalized learning and a generally broad computerization of learning places the requirement on effective identity management - a simple yet safe solution.

AB This Higher education institutions are under significant pressure to provide affordable and sustainable approach that will prepare undergraduates with the skills they will need after graduation to achieve success in the 21st century European marketplace. Adaptive educational environment is among the new technology-based tools that have emerged with a promise to help educational institutions to prepare students better by providing them with valuable experimental learning and practical training opportunities that are uniquely suited to enable educational environment to increase students' engagement for higher-order knowledge formation and practical beneficial skills. Additionally, universities are now offering study programs with courses that combine elements of face-to-face instruction and online learning, known as "blended-learning" concept. The quality of teaching and learning in Slovak universities has long been a concern for governments, and continues to grow in importance. This article also presents the national project data from the stage of modelling a new advanced personalized educational multimodal virtual environment to the creating a culture of innovation for support students' practical key competences development as an impact of new educational technologies. This paper presents an advanced educational model based on a creative diversity and problem solving techniques to move through the stages of a problem solving/creative process, each stage carried out at low to high level and using any creative style, as well. The paper is aimed to techniques as specific learned methods that allow students to use their existing cognitive resources - level and style to best advantages in the whole creative and innovation cycle to help an individual student to use what she/he actually holds, but in more effective ways through the learned managed personal behaviours. Experimental exercises in the process solution for a selected group of mechatronics students use the modular chain of typical technology applications based on virtual modelling, simulation and instrumentation environment to create a dynamic model of innovative product or technology using representative mathematical system description with a simple or more complicated stimulus in the simulation. For this innovative concept, we present assessed element in the individual student's cognitive strategy applying her/his knowledge about successful project presentation delivery by providing the tutors and students forum best practices for problem solving stage. For the purposes of this article, an adaptive educational environment is presented from an institutional perspective and local industrial companies. The article discusses the didactical model based on the synergy of a course content and students key competences using blended learning and project-based concept leaving enough opportunity for students to practise by a single individual experiences or by a group under which task performance is accomplished more efficiently. Ultimately, the findings suggest that adaptive educational environment to support university students' practical key competences brings essential advantages and vital benefits from the three-key-partnership educational concept (3KP) as a result of experiences to stimulate student's engagement and support deeper and practical learning through the synergy of the variety of educational experimental tools and effective model of didactics.

AB This research conducted quasi-experiments in four middle schools to evaluate the long-term effects of an intelligent web-based English instruction system, Computer Simulation in Educational Communication (CSIEC), on students' academic attainment. The analysis of regular examination scores and vocabulary test validates the positive impact of CSIEC, and in most cases, the positive impact is statistically significant. The reliability is ensured by the spectrum of the students from Grade 1 to Grade 3 in three junior high schools and from Grade 1 to Grade 2 in one senior high school, and of the teachers with or without blended learning experience, as well as by the various school locations from rural to urban areas in four provinces of China. The learning content-oriented design and the instant feedback feature of the web-based system, as well as its regular integration into the English class, contributed to its reliable positive effect on students' learning performance in ordinary examinations. This is the research's implication for instructional design. The conclusion of this paper could serve as a reference to the technical feasibility and pedagogical benefit of regular usage of appropriate Computer Assisted Learning system in the mainstream subject of middle schools. The multiple quasi-experiments in divergent school settings to ensure the results' reliability distinguish this research from previous ones that just implemented one single experiment in one school.

AB This article aims to characterise the research on science teachers' professional development programs that support the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and the main trends concerning the theoretical frameworks (theoretical foundation, literature review or background) that underpin these studies. Through a systematic review of the literature, 76 articles were found and divided into two axes on training science teachers and the use of digital technologies with their categories. The first axis (characterisation of articles) presents the category key features that characterise the articles selected (major subjects, training and actions for the professional development and major ICT tools and digital resources). The second axis (trends of theoretical frameworks) has three categories organised in theoretical frameworks that emphasise the following: (a) the digital technologies, (b) prospects of curricular renewal and (c) cognitive processes. It also characterised a group of articles with theoretical frameworks that contain multiple elements without deepening them or that even lack a theoretical framework that supports the studies. In this review, we found that many professional development programs for teachers still use inadequate strategies for bringing about change in teacher practices. New professional development proposals are emerging with the objective of minimising such difficulties and this analysis could be a helpful tool to restructure those proposals.

   GOALS
AB Using virtual reality (VR) in educational settings is becoming increasingly popular. The feasibility of replacing an instrumentation-based organic chemistry lab with a VR experience has been evaluated. A VR laboratory experience was designed to teach students how to use an infrared spectrometer and elucidate an unknown structure from the resulting infrared spectrum. The resulting first-person VR experience is immersive and realistic, with a teaching assistant guiding the user along the steps required to complete the experiment, including feedback as needed. The VR experience was developed in WondaVR with selections made using gaze navigation. The resulting product was tested with a group of students, and the outcomes for short- and long-term recall were compared with a group of students that did the same experiment in a traditional lab. Results indicate that there are no significant differences in learning outcomes between the two groups, which indicates the possibility of using this tool to offer this organic chemistry lab experiment via distance education. Students that tried the VR experience reported a high degree of satisfaction with the product and no significant usability barriers. These VR experiences could be useful for students who are unable to be present in lab due to disabilities, attendance challenges such as pregnancy, or safety concerns.

AB The Periodic Table of the Elements (PTE) is arguably one of the most central topics in chemistry. This article provides a critical review of current teaching practices of the PTE to high-school students and undergraduate university students. It also provides a new teaching model, the "periodic universe", for understanding of the PTE through building on its foundational periodicity. Students learn through a guided re-creation of the PTE from simple periodic simulations and interdisciplinary processes. The periodic-universe teaching model directs students to conceptualize, rather than memorize, relationships between the elements by predicting patterns in progressively challenging simulated worlds. This mixed-method research project consists of both quantitative (n = 58) and qualitative (n = 15) responses from university undergraduate students, demonstrating the utility of inquiry-based learning of the PTE for novice chemistry students. Herein, we position the periodic-universe teaching model in the current educational literature of inquiry and interdisciplinary studies by outlining the function of the model and illustrating its effectiveness on the basis of empirical analysis with undergraduate students in a postsecondary-education setting. The results indicate that knowledge of the PTE increases after instruction with the model, and that nonchemistry-major students have increased engagement, understanding, and appreciation of the importance of periodicity to chemistry when presented with the periodic-universe teaching model.

AB Purpose: To evaluate current applications of e-learning in radiology.
   Material and methods: A Medline search was performed using PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD) for publications discussing the applications of e-learning in radiology. The search strategy employed a single combination of the following terms: (1) e-learning, and (2) education and (3) radiology. This review was limited to human studies and to English-language literature. We reviewed all the titles and subsequent the abstract of 29 articles that appeared pertinent. Additional articles were identified by reviewing the reference lists of relevant papers. Finally, the full text of 38 selected articles was reviewed.
   Results: Literature data shows that with the constant development of technology and global spread of computer networks, in particular of the Internet, the integration of multimedia and interactivity introduced into electronic publishing has allowed the creation of multimedia applications that provide valuable support for medical teaching and continuing medical education, specifically for radiology. Such technologies are valuable tools for collaboration, interactivity, simulation, and self-testing. However, not everything on the World Wide Web is useful, accurate, or beneficial: the quality and veracity of medical information on the World Wide Web is variable and much time can be wasted as many websites do not meet basic publication standards.
   Conclusion: E-learning will become an important source of education in radiology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines three questions related to the dissemination of innovations in higher education, drawing on a review of the literature on the nature of innovations and on a case study of an innovative online project that has been widely disseminated. The first question seeks to review the question of what constitutes an innovation in teaching and learning in higher education. The second and third questions seek to understand the process of dissemination of such innovations in teaching and learning, and to shed some light on what developers of innovations might do to maximize the take up of innovations.
   The project in the case study has been clearly demonstrated to have been widely disseminated beyond both the origin of the project and in new marketplaces. The project was publicised using a multi-faceted distribution mechanism involving presentations at institutions and conferences, publishing of articles, and production of templates which facilitate adoption of the project. The project also facilitated participation by others, enabling them to see first hand the potential benefits of engaging with it. The outcome of these activities has been a wider adoption or scaling up of the project than is usual. This appears to have been the result of academics' perception of the value to students of their participation in such a learning activity, the ease of adaption of the project to different contexts, and the enthusiasm of adopters for promoting high quality learning experiences.

AB The educational model in higher education has changed in the last 10 years, common strategies and methods of teaching are replaced by digital techniques that enable a better understanding of complex issues that can be treated in a Master Degree in Engineering or Sciences. These techniques also provided on-line learning with minimal presence of the teacher who acts as an intermediary between information and the student. The tools used range from the documentation repository, with no interaction with the student, which would be the 1.0 environment, to information platforms with more interaction, like forums, interactive multimedia, simulations and finally the teacher's blog. Finally, the OCW (Open Course Ware) for self-learning should be the last step of the documentation generated for conventional courses, reviewed and revised every year. In the dynamic environments of teaching, the teacher must act as a dynamizer and direct the independent and critical learning of the students, and should also select appropriate strategies, depending on the subject, which can be more profitable. All this technology is available to make this 2.0 stage, a reality now, and it should be adopted by public colleges and universities so that they can survive in a changing world. In this paper we analyze teaching experiences in implementing these concepts in technical education programs in two universities (Masters), La Laguna (ULL) in Tenerife and UPM in Madrid, both in Spain.

AB We present here our experience of several years with virtual bright youth at the Dov Lautman Unit for Science Oriented Youth at Tel Aviv University. The campus staff specializes both in teaching structured courses in different fields, and in conducting hands-on competitive and multidisciplinary network events, in which thousands of young people participate each year. The wide-ranging activities are multilingual and are based on simple technological means that are accessible to youngsters and provoke their curiosity such as the Internet, messaging software and cell phones.
   Learning takes place by means of unique modules providing an enriching, active, challenging and fascinating intellectual experience. We offer exclusive programs, with added value resulting from the encounter between the students and lecturers and researchers from the academic faculty and the rich and diverse world of content that the University offers.
   This is a virtual learning model that comprises a number of practical tasks for which the students receive instructions: experimentation, programming, simulation, role-playing or riddle solving. It requires making use of theoretical material appearing on the website or available on the Internet.
   In the course of the tasks the instructor gives the students online advice and guidance, and after each task there is a chat session. The courses allow a different kind of learning, covering a wide range of subjects. An ongoing course demands an additional dimension of commitment and seriousness on the part of the students. The more active the students, the more benefit they reap from the e-learning program. To succeed in the course, students have to put in independent work and "virtual attendance" at all the meetings. Students have to be active in forums and discussion groups, to learn the theoretical content, and to submit assignments. At the end of the course, a grade and a certificate of participation is issued.
   We offer a wide range of course topics, including astronomy, medicine, psychology, physics, sociology, chemistry, biology, anthropology, archaeology and others. They are presented as a single topic course or as a multidisciplinary course.
   We also offer an innovative study model which includes a physical encounter between participants. Proceeding is a "virtual thriller": a joint virtual adventure. They deal with a variety of tasks in different subjects, search websites, and use Internet simulations. Gradually the course website publishes investigation updates and reveals new pieces of information. Occasionally the participants receive online expert advice, and interview the "characters" of the virtual plot.
   The Virtual Campus of the Unit for Science Oriented Youth holds culminating virtual events and competition days for groups of students from all around the world. The meetings are challenging serve as a peak activity for youngsters who have been involved in enrichment activities throughout the school year. The use of the Internet as a tool to reduce distances makes it possible to invite pupils from all around the world, of different cultures and social background, to have access to the leading universities and edge-cutting science.
   As reported by the schools and graded by repeated enlisting in the program and constant elevation in number of virtual participants, both the pupils and faculty benefit unprecedently from the Virtual Campus program.

AB This study aims to evaluate multiple aspects of a problem-solving-based educational adventure game, Boom Room (c). The learning effectiveness, game acceptance, and flow experience of the game were empirically investigated. The game was designed and developed for teaching knowledge of computer assembly. Sixty-seven university students in Taiwan were asked to complete a pre-test before playing the game and a post-test after playing the game. These students also provided evaluations of not only the usefulness, ease of use, and design elements of the game but also their experience with various flow dimensions of the game. A 2-stage cluster analysis was also conducted to explore the potentially different groups of students by categorizing them in accordance with their performance, degree of game acceptance and flow states. The results suggest that this game is beneficial for students with insufficient background knowledge of computer assembly, allowing these students to obtain vital knowledge of this topic if they achieved a sufficient acceptance of the game and an adequate flow experience from their game-playing experiences. The various dimensions of flow that were experienced by these students were significantly correlated with game acceptance. Suggestions for future study, game design, and instructional practice are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research indicates that computer games share many characteristics with problem-solving activities, such as the construction of a problem context, multiple paths to a specific goal, collaboration between multiple participants, unknown outcomes as well as elements of competition and chance. Taking advantage of game technology for offering truly immersive and interactive learning experiences has now become a real possibility. Such game-based educational environments involve synchronous student interaction mediated through a computer network, and they benefit the students by stimulating the different modalities of learning, i.e. visual, audio, read/write and kinesthetic.
   This paper presents the development of a game-based virtual laboratory environment for gear train design, which goes beyond static demonstrations or conventional computer simulations. This virtual laboratory environment provides the students with the flexibility to perform many experiments related to the fundamental law of gearing and the concepts of the planetary motion of gears. In this virtual laboratory environment, the students, the instructor and the teaching assistant are represented by and interact as virtual characters (avatars). The scripted scenario for the laboratory exercise was piloted in the Fall 2010 semester in 'ME 358 Machine Dynamics and Mechanisms', a junior-level course for mechanical engineering majors. Assessment tools such as pre- and post-experiment tests are an integral part of the game-based laboratory environment and form the basis for providing different levels of support to the students at every step of the laboratory exercise. Furthermore, the game environment can be equipped with functionality for monitoring the students' progress and learning outcomes, thus enabling skill-based assessment.

AB Background and purpose: The purpose of this project was to impact pharmacy students' personal and professional development through simulation of a board of pharmacy disciplinary hearing regarding addiction.
   Educational activity and setting: The mock board hearing was conducted as part of the required curriculum. Faculty obtained materials from a prior board hearing. The actual respondent, lawyer, former executive director, and a board agent participated. Students served as board members and president, asked questions of the witnesses, and deliberated per board procedure. After the event, student learning and perceptions were assessed through knowledge-based, opinion-based questions, and open-ended questions.
   Findings: Of the 141 students who attended the event, 97% completed the assessment. The average score on the knowledge-based questions was 95%. Ratings of perceptions and reflections of the experience were used in tandem to understand the experience. In general, students indicated the experience was positive and impactful towards their education. Students indicated they felt that the experience allowed them to better understand addiction and empathize with someone called before the board. In fact, there were fundamental differences in perceptions regarding the "addicted person," going from a penalizing and stigmatized perspective to one of caring and compassion.
   Summary: Students were knowledgeable about the board and its regulatory process after the event. More than knowledge, students indicated fundamental changes in their views of addiction. Other institutions may consider implementing similar exercises to engender empathy and professionalism regarding drug addiction and regulatory compliance.

AB Using game design and programming to foster computational thinking acquisition has proved to be a successful strategy in recent years. In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.

AB What is the best approach to educating students is, evidently, the pivotal question in educational research. In the general debate on this question, clear positions are often taken for example, whether teacher-led instruction or more student-directed approaches should be followed. In the current narrative review, this central question and the different stances taken are explored for a specific field of learning, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) domains. The current article starts with an argument as to why the traditional, more directive teacher-led educational approach to STEM learning may not always lead to deep conceptual knowledge and proposes exploring more engaged forms of learning. More specifically, a particular arrangement for engaged learning, inquiry learning, is taken as an example in this exploration. It is argued that the effects of educational methods are influenced by a multitude of (interacting) factors related to student and teacher characteristics, context, domain, frequency of use, timing, and probably more. Therefore, this article tries to outline a more nuanced and balanced stance towards choosing educational approaches. A picture is presented to show that adopting and combining different approaches, at both the lesson and the curricular levels, may be necessary to reach optimal levels of learning. Existing and upcoming technologies may play a decisive role in realizing this more complex, but also more realistic view of learning in STEM.

AB Workshops are a common method of training for adults to teach new methods or techniques that are required in order to be successful in their working environment. Specific skills and transferable knowledge for effective goal-oriented training and real world application are commonly the key learning objectives. The task faced by an instructor is ensuring that the workshop is effective in providing an opportunity for the participants to obtain the needed skills and knowledge.
   Whether applying Knowles' experiential learning theory, Brookfield's critical thinking strategies, Gardner's theory of multiple intelligence or Fleming's VARK modalities, merging such teaching strategies as simulations, reality based learning, clicker technology, PowerPoint, role play and case scenarios are key to presenting an effective workshop. The right mixture of teaching strategies allows for adults to problem solve while critically applying the total sum of their experience in a custom designed learning environment based on individual learning and sensory modality preference.
   In our paper, we will provide an overview of the characteristics of an adult learner and the relevance of these characteristics to workshop learning. In our conference presentation and paper, we will present the importance of a critical thinking component in workshop presentations. In our conference presentation and paper, we will discuss how workshop teaching methods can be tied to the participants' learning styles in order to achieve the necessary learning for effective workshop outcomes. Finally, this paper will discuss merging various teaching modalities and strategies with today's technologies in providing an enhanced workshop learning experience.

TI Approaches to the Development of Language Intelligence in Multimedia
   English Teaching from the Perspective of Game Theory
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING

DT Article
AB At present, the majority of English language learners use computers as an aid to support their learning. However, the existing software is relatively homogeneous, which can only correct the pronunciation errors of the English language. Due to the massive number of problems in the software itself, it is difficult for English language learners to correct the errors that occur in their pronunciation properly. In this study, a scoring mechanism is established from the game theory perspective of language intelligent development in combination with multimedia-assisted teaching from three perspectives, that is, acoustics, rhythm, and sense of speech. The output of deep learning is simulated by using network parameters based on language intelligent development to assess the language. Meanwhile, the teaching data and materials for the English language are uploaded and answered online in real time. In this way, students can have access to the course content shared by the teacher, which has a certain auxiliary effect on the English language learning of the students. With the aid of multimedia technology, an excellent English teaching model can be used to enhance the English language learning ability of students effectively and improve their interest and initiative in English learning with the English learning of students as the main body. It can be seen from the results of the simulation that students' learning efficiency in exploring English language independent learning can be improved effectively mainly by making use of the reference database and aligning it with expert knowledge for error identification.

AB Taking advantage of the vast history of theoretical and empirical findings in the learning literature we have inherited, this research offers a synthesis of prior findings in the domain of empirically evaluated active learning strategies in digital learning environments. The primary concern of the present study is to evaluate these findings with an eye towards scalable learning. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have emerged as the new way to reach the masses with educational materials, but so far they have failed to maintain learners' attention over the long term. Even though we now understand how effective active learning principles are for learners, the current landscape of MOOC pedagogy too often allows for passivity leading to the unsatisfactory performance experienced by many MOOC learners today. As a starting point to this research we took John Hattie's seminal work from 2008 on learning strategies used to facilitate active learning. We considered research published between 2009 and 2017 that presents empirical evaluations of these learning strategies. Through our systematic search we found 126 papers meeting our criteria and categorized them according to Hattie's learning strategies. We found large-scale experiments to be the most challenging environment for experimentation due to their size, heterogeneity of participants, and platform restrictions, and we identified the three most promising strategies for effectively leveraging learning at scale as Cooperative Learning, Simulations & Gaming, and Interactive Multimedia.

TI A comparison of two methods of active learning in physics: inventing a

AB A common approach for introducing students to a new science concept is to present them with multiple cases of the phenomenon and ask them to explore. The expectation is that students will naturally take advantage of the multiple cases to support their learning and seek an underlying principle for the phenomenon. However, the success of such tasks depends not only on the structure of the cases, but also the task that students receive for working with the examples. Two studies used contrasting cases in the context of teaching middle-school students about projectile motion. Using a simulation and the same set of cases for all students, students completed a traditional "compare and contrast" approach, or an instructional method called "inventing," where students try to produce a single general explanation. The results show that inventing led to superior learning. Examination of student worksheets revealed that the "compare and contrast" instruction led students to focus mostly on the level of discrete, surface features of the phenomenon. Rather than trying to account for the variation across cases, students simply noticed each instance of it. In contrast, the inventing task led students to consider how the variations across the cases were related. As a result, "invent" students were more likely to search for and find the unifying functional relation. Driving towards an overall explanation is a fundamental tenet of science, and therefore, it is worthwhile to teach students to do the same.

AB Computer Based Instruction is no longer uncommon in the education arena in Malaysia. This instructional approach has been applied in the process of teaching and learning for many subjects, but little was applied to sports subject. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a multimedia sports courseware in teaching movement skills, which will be developed based on the Simpson's Psychomotor Domain Taxonomy. Integrated with a video analysis technology and simulation, the courseware would be developed for all sport subjects in the sports science syllabus. This paper highlights the analysis phase of the study, which investigated students' problems in learning movement skills. In particular, the problems were divided into four types of construct (teaching strategy, learning materials, individual differences, external and internal factors). This paper also seeks to identify the dominant construct that might optimize the learning outcomes. Overall, 83 undergraduate students majoring in sports science in one Malaysian university were involved. The instruments used were questionnaire supported by some interviews. Quantitative data were analyzed using the SPSS 16 while qualitative data were analyzed through content analysis. The results from this initial study will be used to develop the courseware and facilitate the discussion on how it will be adopted in the process of preparing materials for the learning of movement skills. Additionally, this courseware could also promote students to a more advanced learning process that can trigger positive effects in their movement skills learning. In fact, it may also discover a young sports talent.

AB Three Dimensional Multi-User Virtual Environments (MUVEs) are promising tools in education because of the unique affordances they offer. These learning affordances imply certain actions that in turn can lead to corresponding learning activities. There seems to be a lack of reports on which of the affordances of MUVEs for learning and teaching are used and how they are enacted by relevantly designed learning activities. This study investigates the learning activities conducted in Second Life, the most popular and widely used among the "sandbox" type MUVE platforms, as reported in 205 empirical studies, by associating them with the learning affordances they enact. As necessary step towards this goal, the study proposes a new classification of learning affordances of MUVEs and a new concrete set of learning activities based on the literature review. Learning affordances include free navigation, creation, modeling and simulation, multichannel communication, collaboration and cooperation and content presentation and/or delivery. By using the open, axial and selective coding offered by the grounded method, the learning activities that emerged from the exhaustive empirical review, are well associated with the proposed six learning affordances, validating in return the functionality of the proposed set of learning affordances. The five more general learning activities, resulting from the selective coding, are content creation, content exploration and interaction with content, social interaction, gaming, participation in representations of real life events and situations. Further research on other MUVEs is needed to establish this framework.

ID NEPHROLOGY; EDUCATION; GAME
AB Background and objectives Despite the increasing prevalence of childhood kidney disease worldwide, there is a shortage of clinicians trained to provide peritoneal dialysis (PD). E-learning technologies may provide a solution to improve knowledge in PD. We describe the development of a virtual PD simulator and report the first 22 months of online usage.
   Design, setting, participants, & measurements The PD simulator was developed and released on OPENPediatrics in January of 2016. A prospective study of international, multidisciplinary healthcare providers was conducted from January of 2016 through October of 2017. User action data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and linear regression. Paired t tests compared user pre- and post-test scores. User satisfaction was assessed by survey.
   Results The simulator was accessed by 1066 users in 70 countries. Users spent a median of 35 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] 14-84) in the simulator. Users who completed the structured learning curriculum (n=300) spent a median of 85 minutes (IQR 46-95), and those who completed the entire simulator (n=63) spent a median of 122 minutes (IQR 69-195). Users who completed the simulator were more likely to scroll through text and access the simulator in multiple sessions. The 300 users that completed testing showed statistically significant increases in the post- versus pretest scores, with a mean increase of 36.4 of 100 points, SD 19.9 (95% confidence interval, 34.1 to 38.6, P<0.001). Eighty-seven percent (20 of 23) of survey respondents felt the simulator was relevant to their clinical practice, and 78% (18 of 23) would recommend it to others.
   Conclusions This is the first reported virtual PD simulator. Increased test scores were observed between pre- and post-tests by clinicians who completed testing, across disciplines, training levels, and resource settings.

AB The World Wide Web is becoming increasingly important in the provision of education, as recognised by several high profile UK government reports. Improved tools for developing Web-based teaching and learning materials, together with focused training by individuals, institutions and national programmes, have led to a greater confidence in network technologies by educators at many levels. Higher education institutions have been leading players in the UK in the development of innovative ideas for exploiting the educational potential of the Web. This paper presents examples of several techniques in evidence in UK higher education which demonstrate some of the key innovations in teaching and learning, focusing on the themes of multimedia and interactivity. Some of the pedagogic and technology issues associated with these techniques are identified, and the way in which integration into the curriculum can be achieved is explored. This integration takes many aspects of the learning process into account, from the delivery of information and references, through demonstration, example and practice, to learning by reflection and assessment. In particular, the way in which the Web encourages the trend away from directed teaching and towards self-paced and distance learning is investigated. The Web is shown as supporting the learning process in many more ways than its traditional information delivery role. Three main areas explored are: (1) Virtual environments, where real-life scenarios are reconstructed to bridge the gap between theory and practice; (2) interactive simulations, which allow the investigation of changing experimental conditions without the cost and effort of laboratory equipment; and (3) assessment, which can provide valuable feedback to teachers and learners alike, exploiting both interactive and multimedia elements to give added value to online educational materials.

AB Background: Numerous instructional methods are used in medical education, including interactive lectures, problem-based learning (PBL), case-based learning, and bedside teaching. Bedside teaching provides students with a real-life experience interacting with patients. Therefore, researchers have been working to create computer programs with virtual patients (VPs) that simulate live patients, which aim to improve medical student clinical reasoning skills without the need of live patients. Aims: To study the perception of medical students at King Saud University (KSU) of the Diagnostic Reasoning program (DxR) as a learning tool in the hybrid curriculum. Study Design: Cross-section study conducted at the College of Medicine, KSU, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. Methods: The data was collected from third, fourth, and fifth year medical undergraduate students of both genders, from November 2014 until March 2015. Results: The results were divided into ten categories according to five themes: learning, specialty, assessment, authenticity, and implementation. In correlation with our reviewed literature, one of the primary targets of virtual patients is to stimulate relative thinking and problem solving. The students claimed that it was an enjoyable experience that allowed them to practice their skills in history taking, physical examination, ordering investigations and treating accordingly. It was also found that student satisfaction increased relative to the number of cases they attempted (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The study evaluates the medical students' perception of DxR in the system-based hybrid curriculum at KSU. Our findings show that DxR leads to positive knowledge and skill outcomes. Students believed that further DxR training workshops should be implemented in order to improve software usage.

AB The present study proves the role of virtual e-learning facilities in the initial training of the teachers. The evolution of science and technique facilitated a rapid development of e-learning technologies, which have generally been generated for other fields of education (adult education, continuous training of different professional categories, including the one of teachers, developing educational software for students, support and recovering technologies for children with disabilities) and less for the initial training of the teachers. Even if e-learning facilities have been less used in the field of initial training of teachers, they can be successfully used in the shaping and development of the educational practical skills. These technologies do not replace the traditional "face to face" teaching, but they become additional to and they increase its efficiency. The research carried out at the ascertaining level, detailed in the experimental part, emphasizes the importance of these technologies from a double perspective, namely: on the one hand the opinions of the trainers of the future trainers (the teachers), and on the other hand the assumptions of the students future teachers. In a considerably proportion, students think that the value of e-learning facilities (maps, dictionaries, encyclopedias, on-line didactic games, software, books, educational forums, chats, video conferences, tutorials, simulations, blogs, sites etc.) increase the interest and attractiveness of the courses and practical lectures, decrease the teacher's effort in the process of teaching and the students' effort in the process of learning. According to the things mentioned, we highlight new dimensions of an active and interactive teaching and learning, by virtual technology: the students learn to learn and learn to teach in the same time.

   Design/methodology/approach-The software was developed using the software development life cycle, and was tested by students enrolled in various bachelor degrees at three stages of development within the technology acceptance model, action research and design research methodology frameworks, using mixed methods of quantitative and qualitative analysis.
   Findings-The learning system was generally well-accepted, with usefulness (72 +/- 18, mean +/- standard deviation, 0-100 visual analogue scale) rated higher (p < 0.001) than ease of use (57 +/- 22). Ease of use ratings declined across the three versions as modules were added and complexity increased. Students with prior experience with 3D interfaces had higher intention to use the system, and scored higher on identification of anatomical structures. Students with greater kinaesthetic learning preferences tended to rate the system higher. Haptic feedback was considered the best aspect of the system, but students wanted higher spatial resolution and lower response times.
   Originality/value-Previous research relating to haptic devices in medical and health sciences has largely focused on advanced trainees learning surgical or procedural skills. The present research suggests that incorporating haptic feedback into virtual anatomical models may provide useful multisensory information in learning anatomy at the undergraduate level.

AB Introduction: Three-dimensional (3D) computer graphics are increasingly used to supplement the teaching of anatomy. While most systems consist of a program which produces 3D renderings on a workstation with a standard screen, the Dextrobeam virtual reality VR environment allows the presentation of spatial neuroanatomical models to larger groups of students through a stereoscopic projection system.
   Materials and methods: Second-year medical students (n = 169) were randomly allocated to receive a standardised pre-recorded audio lecture detailing the anatomy of the third ventricle accompanied by either a two-dimensional (2D) PowerPoint presentation (n = 80) or a 3D animated tour of the third ventricle with the DextroBeam. Students completed a 10-question multiple-choice exam based on the content learned and a subjective evaluation of the teaching method immediately after the lecture.
   Results: Students in the 2D group achieved a mean score of 5.19 (+/- 2.12) compared to 5.45 (+/- 2.16) in the 3D group, with the results in the 3D group statistically non-inferior to those of the 2D group (p < 0.0001). The students rated the 3D method superior to 2D teaching in four domains (spatial understanding, application in future anatomy classes, effectiveness, enjoyableness) (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Stereoscopically enhanced 3D lectures are valid methods of imparting neuroanatomical knowledge and are well received by students. More research is required to define and develop the role of large-group VR systems in modern neuroanatomy curricula. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB There has been a long-standing dispute about the efficacy of computer assisted instruction (CAI) with regard to the interpretation of effect size estimates in reviews using techniques of meta-analysis.  It has been claimed that the data used to calculate these estimates come from studies which are methodologically flawed.  The aim of this study was to provide an updated meta-analysis on the learning effect of (CAI) over a broad range of study features with particular attention focused on the effectiveness debate.  Using standard procedures, the results and estimates were similar to previous reviews and showed a learning benefit for CAI.  The mean effect size for CAI was (.24) for the years 1987-1992, with more recent studies showing an average of (.33).  Although moderate, these estimates tended to raise the average student from at least the 50th and 60th percentile.  However, studies which controlled for teacher and materials, and were of longer duration, and studies using pencil and paper equivalents of CAI showed no learning advantage over traditional forms of instruction.  It is suggested that what accounts for the typical learning advantage of CAI in this meta-analysis and others is the better quality instruction provided by CAI materials.  These materials seem versatile enough to be used effectively over a broad range of subjects and educational settings.  While the materials did not seem to improve substantially over the past two decades as reflected by effect sizes, these estimates did not include the newer multimedia technology.  It is concluded that educational approaches should be judged by a number of criteria including achievement gains and when this is done CAI may far surpass other forms of instruction.

AB Introduction Project-based learning (PjBL) is a teaching methodology designed to engage students in solving real-world problems, acknowledging that students are active agents of their learning process. This methodology has historically been popular in architecture and industrial sciences; however, its use in teaching veterinary anatomy is scarcely published. Methods Using information and communication technologies, the PjBL methodology was implemented in a first-year veterinary anatomy course. The methodology included teamwork and the selection of a routine object in the veterinary clinic at the beginning of the academic semester. The project's goal was to analyze the object and associate it with both a domestic animal species and an anatomical region, along with making and presenting a video or a simulation model about the object. Results More than 80% of students prefer active learning classes compared to traditional classes. In addition, 66% and 86% of students indicate that PjBL allowed them to improve their understanding of theoretical content for the first and second years of post-implementation, respectively. Students' self-assessment indicates that more than 80% of the students (first and second year post-implementation) felt they were responsible for the execution of the project, able to conduct research, and able to develop autonomous learning skills. After 2 years of PjBL implementation, failure rates in the course decreased by 21%. Discussion In general, PjBL results show that veterinary students prefer active learning activities that allow them to learn in a team-based learning process as well as to develop soft skills such as self-learning, responsibility, and teamwork.

AB This investigation provides detailed descriptions of preservice secondary science teachers' technology-enhanced inquiry instruction and their developing TPACK. Prior to student teaching, 27 preservice teachers were introduced to general guidelines for integrating technology to support reform-based science instruction. This instruction was in the context of a 2-year Master of Teaching program. Of the 27 preservice teachers, 26 used technology for inquiry instruction during student teaching. Our goals were to describe how these 26 preservice science teachers: (1) used educational technologies to support students' investigations and (2) demonstrated their developing TPACK through technology-enhanced inquiry instruction. Multiple data sources (observations, lesson plans, interviews, and reflections) allowed for characterization of participants' technology integration to support inquiry instruction and their decision-making related to the use of technology to support inquiry. Results indicated that participants incorporated technologies appropriate to the content and context to facilitate non-experimental and experimental inquiry experiences. Participants developing TPACK was evidenced by their selective and appropriate use of technology. Appropriate technology use for inquiry included the following: (1) to present an engaging introduction, (2) to facilitate data collection, (3) to facilitate data analysis, and (4) to facilitate communication and discussion of results. These results suggest that using digital images to facilitate whole-class inquiry holds considerable promise as a starting point for teachers new to inquiry instruction. Results of the present study may inform science teacher educators' development of content-specific, technology-enhanced learning opportunities that: prepare preservice teachers for the responsibility of supporting inquiry instruction with technology, facilitate the transition to student-centered instruction, and support TPACK development.

AB Massively Multiuser On-line Learning (MMOL) Platforms, often called "virtual learning worlds", constitute a still unexplored context for communication-enhanced learning, where synchronous communication skills in an explicit social setting enhance the potential of effective collaboration. In this paper, we report on an experimental study of collaborative evaluation in an MMOL setting with 21 graduate students enrolled in university courses in technology-mediated teaching and learning. This study was carried out using a prototype of a 3D MMOL platform built around an interactive space called "MadriPolis". This space was used to recreate an adequate scenario for a collaborative experience about Learning Object evaluation using the mainstream Learning Object Review Instrument (LORI), which is based on a Convergent Participation Model (CPM). The same experience was carried out using a conventional LCMS (Learning Content Management System) platform with the aim of contrasting the outcomes and interaction patterns in the two settings. This study makes use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) measures to describe the interactions between tutors and learners. By dwelling on the advantages of immersive environments, SNA indexes revealed that these interactions were rather dense and that student participation was rather broad-based in the case of the MMOL The results suggest that MMOL platforms could be used in collaborative evaluation tasks as a means to enhance both tutor interaction patterns and the strength of the group's relationship.

AB Background: Clinical reasoning is a complex skill students have to acquire during their education. For educators it is difficult to explain their reasoning to students, because it is partly an automatic and unconscious process. Virtual Patients (VPs) are used to support the acquisition of clinical reasoning skills in healthcare education. However, until now it remains unclear which features or settings of VPs optimally foster clinical reasoning. Therefore, our aims were to identify key concepts of the clinical reasoning process in a qualitative approach and draw conclusions on how each concept can be enhanced to advance the learning of clinical reasoning with virtual patients.
   Methods: We chose a grounded theory approach to identify key categories and concepts of learning clinical reasoning and develop a framework. Throughout this process, the emerging codes were discussed with a panel of interdisciplinary experts. In a second step we applied the framework to virtual patients.
   Results: Based on the data we identified the core category as the "multifactorial nature of learning clinical reasoning". This category is reflected in the following five main categories: Psychological Theories, Patient-centeredness, Context, Learner-centeredness, and Teaching/Assessment. Each category encompasses between four and six related concepts.
   Conclusions: With our approach we were able to elaborate how key categories and concepts of clinical reasoning can be applied to virtual patients. This includes aspects such as allowing learners to access a large number of VPs with adaptable levels of complexity and feedback or emphasizing dual processing, errors, and uncertainty.

AB Since 1990, the Air Force has been engaged in a long-term research effort, Fundamental Skills Training project (FST), to bring stare-of-the-art intelligent tutoring technology to bear on growing literacy skills problem in areas such as mathematics, writing, and science.
   Specifically, the FST project was implemented to help school children attain basic literacy skills. To accomplish the goals of the project, three intelligent tutoring systems, the Word Problem Solving Tutor (WPS), MAESTRO, the Writing Tutor, and the science tutor, Instruction in Scientific Inquiry Skills (ISIS) were developed. These three tutoring systems have been evaluated in field studies involving 47 schools and adult educational systems in 7 states across the nation. These studies have involved 40-50 teachers and as many as 3,000 students each year to evaluate the effectiveness of the software in enhancing critical thinking skills.
   ISIS is a simulation-based cognitive tutoring system constructed to teach junior and senior high school students scientific inquiry skills and substantive knowledge in ecology. ISIS has been designed to allow students to explore knowledge and domain space and construct knowledge while the tutor encourages and rewards these actions. Students using ISIS are taught under an instructional system that provides an exploratory environment, authentic data, appropriate and timely feedback, and a series of progressively difficult Skill Instructional Modules (SIMs). The primary goal of the science tutor, consistent with major science initiatives and standards, is to increase the level of scientific functioning. This paper focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of ISIS, in a series of large-scale field studies conducted over three years. In addition, this paper discuses the effectiveness of the tutor and the impact of formative and summative evaluations on the design of subsequent versions.

AB Within the frame of the regional project 'Acariss' (Italian acronym for: Increasing the knowledge on Environment and Risks of Pollution involving Schools with Experimental activities), scientific partners (Institute of Biometeorology of CNR and Polo Sant'Anna Valdera) and psychologists of the University of Florence have developed scientific didactic modules for pupils of the secondary schools aiming to increase their knowledge on environment using a more attractive way than the usual frontal lessons.
   The modules are structured according the 5E Model of Inquiry Based Learning (IBL) and the thematics ranged from meteorology, carbon cycle, greenhouse effect, simulation models and climate change.
   Each module took about 6-8 hours for developing the five steps which are listed below:
   - Engagement of pupils on a specific environmental issue;
   - Exploration of the problem;
   - Explanation of the observed phenomenon;
   - Elaboration of the concepts;
   - Evaluation of what was learned.
   The used IBL model was actually a guided approach in which teachers and scientists have been assisting students during the development of the whole module.
   As the approach was new for most of the schools, in the first year, ACARISS aimed to get the point of view of the teachers. A questionnaire with open and multiple choice questions was developed and submitted to the teachers. The questionnaire aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of this methodology and identify the difficulties met in the application of each step of the module.
   Teachers' suggestions and answers have been used for the module revision in order to improve the module application in the real school context. Preliminary results of the questionnaires seem promising. The introduction of experimentation in science teaching with the presence of scientists is considered a valuable factor for making teaching more attractive.

AB This paper addresses the graduate-level control engineering curriculum change performed at the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana (UPB), Medellin, Colombia. New proposed methodologies include active learning activities using a new multipurpose experimental test bed that was developed with industrial components. The renovated graduate-level control engineering related courses include: Continuous Processes, Discrete Processes, Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms, Linear Control, Nonlinear Control, and Optimal Estimation. The new experimental station was developed for teaching, research, and industrial training activities for the School of Engineering at the UPB. In this work, we report the use of the station in an Optimal Estimation course to replace a traditional homework/exams evaluation approach with an applied work that required independent study, the implementation of different observers in a real lab-scale industrial plant, and a paper-style written report. Increasing independent study activities resulted in academic discussions that are valuable for the learning process of the student. The use of the experimental station and the real comparison of estimation algorithms, implemented by using industrial controllers and high-level programming environments, provided the student skills that cannot be acquired by using only simulations in which real implementation restrictions/challenges do not appear. This work represents one of the first approaches for the implementation of the new curriculum model at the UPB for graduate education. The methodology used in the Optimal Estimation class promoted independent learning, critical thinking and writing skills through significant learning activities.

AB Contribution: This paper adds to existing literature on teaching basic concepts of electricity using computer-based instruction; findings suggest that students can develop an accurate understanding of electric circuits when they generate multiple and complementary representations that build toward computational models.
   Background: Several studies have explored the efficacy of computer-based, multi-representational teaching of electric circuits for novice learners. Existing research has found that instructional use of computational models that move from abstract to concrete representations can foster students' comprehension of electric circuit concepts, but other features of effective instruction using computational models need further investigation.
   Research Questions: 1) Is there a correlation between students' representational fluency and their ability to reason qualitatively on electric circuits? and 2) Is the quality of student-generated computational representations correlated to their conceptual understanding of electric circuits?
   Methodology: The study comprised two cases in which 51 sophomore-engineering students completed a voluntary assignment designed to assess their representational fluency and conceptual understanding of electric circuits. Qualitative insights from the first case informed the design of a scoring rubric that served as both the assessment and the data collection instrument.
   Findings: The results suggest that a multi-representational approach aimed at the construction of computational models can foster conceptual understanding of electric circuits. The number and quality of students' representations showed a positive correlation with their conceptual understanding. In particular, the quality of the computational representations was found to be highly, and significantly, correlated with the correctness of students' answers to qualitative reasoning questions.

AB Student performance, student progress and student potential are critical for measuring learning results, selecting learning materials and learning activities. However, existing work doesn't provide enough analysis tools to analyze how students performed, which factors would affect their performance, in which way students can make progress, and whether students have potential to perform better. To solve those problems, we have provided multiple analysis tools to analyze student performance, student progress and student potentials in different ways. First, this paper formulates student model with performance related attributes and non-performance related attributes by Student Attribute Matrix (SAM), which quantifies student attributes, so that we can use it to make further analysis. Second, this paper provides a student performance estimation tools using Back Propagation Neural Network (BP-NN) based on classification, which can estimate student performance/attributes according to students' prior knowledge as well as the performance/attributes of other students who have similar characteristics. Third, this paper proposes student progress indicators and attribute causal relationship predicator based on BP-NN to comprehensively describe student progress on various aspects together with their causal relationships. Those indicators and predicator can tell how much a factor would affect student performance, so that we can train up students on purpose. Finally, this paper proposes a student potential function that evaluates student achievement and development of such attributes. We have illustrated our analysis tools by using real academic performance data collected from 60 high school students. Evaluation results show that the proposed tools can give correct and more accurate results, and also offer a better understanding on student progress.

AB Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent restrictions, universities have had to adapt their curricula substantially to new schemes in which remote learning is of the essence. In this study, we assess the feasibility of developing a mobile app supplementary to the distant teaching paradigm for the "Cardiology" module of the "General Pathology" subject in undergraduate Medical Education, and we evaluate its impact and acceptability. A cohort of volunteer second-year medical students (n = 44) had access to the app, and their opinions on its utility (1-10) were collected. Additionally, the students were invited to refer their expected satisfaction (1-10) with a blended learning methodology overlapping this new tool with the traditional resources. The average expected satisfaction had been compared to the average satisfaction obtained by just the traditional methodology in other modules from the same subject. Through a qualitative approach, we defined the strengths and weaknesses of the tool. Seventy-seven percent of the participants rated at 8/10 or more the potential learning value of the application and, if used as a supplement to traditional teaching, it would also statistically improve the satisfaction of students (6.52 vs. 8.70, p < 0.001). Similarly, the qualitative data corroborated the benefits of such innovation. Multidisciplinary collaborations are encouraged to develop teaching innovations, although further research should aim to better define the effectiveness of learning with these resources.

AB It is widely acknowledged that image thinking is significant in medical education. The colorful pictures and animations need to be presented for the users (observers) to make the content easier to be understood. By the appropriate matching of pictures and text, readers are able to associate the text with the image on the screen to reach better understanding. In this case, 3d and dynamic images will take the place of the plane and static ones. The study software applied the image processing software and animation software, such as Photoshop, Flash software. 3d max software is used for processing and preparation the simulation stereo skeleton. the Java language of Cult 3D models help give the characteristics of model rotating and zooming in and out; Using multimedia interactive software, Neobook, makes sure interactive amity of interface and establishes a good interactive operating environment between the users and 3d models. For the basic medical education which has higher visual thinking demand, multimedia education has already be widespreaded and used. This software has interactive function and three-dimensional content, 3d instead of static, dynamic replace static state. It is not only keeping the traditional advantage (such as the logical arrangement of content, strictly text description, etc.), but also providing the learning reference material to the users which has intuitive visual experience, independently and freely self-selection, flexible processing. It is beneficial to understand and learn related contents. This study software shows rich and colorful pictures, 3d dynamic display contents, animation process of image to the users, so as to increase understanding and grasping the contents on human spine. It has multiple functions such as help studying and teaching.

AB NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) has expanded into the largest university in Norway after a fusion process involving 3 other higher education institutions. Today it consists of three campuses located in Trondheim, Alesund and Gjovik. The three locations are situated from each other at large enough distance so as to make commuting impractical. An introductory course in mathematics is taken by large numbers of students admitted to all three locations - that is about 500 to 600 in Trondheim and 100-150 in the other two locations. The paper investigates the different strategies and elements that might be included in order to obtain a good learning scenario which supports synchronized multi-campus class interaction and teaching. Some of the elements to be taken into consideration are: good planning, production, adaption and distribution of teaching materials, learning management systems features, flipped learning, blended learning, real-time feedback / monitoring / assessment of the students, training and support for both students and teachers. The individual elements can take many forms. For example, teaching materials could be small instructional videos, three dimensional simulations depicting function graphs and surfaces, micro lectures and quizzes and so on. The main aim of the designed learning scenario is to bridge the geographical gaps by applying a novel blend of pedagogy and technology in order to create and support a learning space which enables students' active learning and promotes efficient cross campus collaboration and communication. One important pillar of the design is the PST (Pedagogy - Space - Technology) framework which can be used in the whole process starting with design and continuing with the implementation, use and evaluation.

AB Design-based research studies are conducted as iterative implementation-analysis-modification cycles, in which emerging theoretical models and pedagogically plausible activities are reciprocally tuned toward each other as a means of investigating conjectures pertaining to mechanisms underlying content teaching and learning. Yet this approach, even when resulting in empirically effective educational products, remains under-conceptualized as long as researchers cannot be explicit about their craft and specifically how data analyses inform design decisions. Consequentially, design decisions may appear arbitrary, design methodology is insufficiently documented for broad dissemination, and design practice is inadequately conversant with learning-sciences perspectives. One reason for this apparent under-theorizing, I propose, is that designers do not have appropriate constructs to formulate and reflect on their own intuitive responses to students' observed interactions with the media under development. Recent socio-cultural explication of epistemic artifacts as semiotic means for mathematical learners to objectify presymbolic notions (e. g., Radford, Mathematical Thinking and Learning 5(1): 37-70, 2003) may offer design-based researchers intellectual perspectives and analytic tools for theorizing design improvements as responses to participants' compromised attempts to build and communicate meaning with available media. By explaining these media as potential semiotic means for students to objectify their emerging understandings of mathematical ideas, designers, reciprocally, create semiotic means to objectify their own intuitive design decisions, as they build and improve these media. Examining three case studies of undergraduate students reasoning about a simple probability situation (binomial), I demonstrate how the semiotic approach illuminates the process and content of student reasoning and, so doing, explicates and possibly enhances design-based research methodology.

AB Learning bone anatomy of the skull is a complex topic involving three-dimensional information. The impact of the use of human dry skulls and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging was investigated in the teaching of undergraduate dental students. Sixty-four first-year students in the University of Hong Kong were randomly divided into eight groups. Four teaching methods were tested: (1) CBCT followed by standard lecture, (2) CBCT followed by lecture with skulls, (3) standard lecture followed by CBCT, and (4) lecture with skulls followed by CBCT. After each, students were given a multiple-choice questionnaire to assess their objective learning outcome (20 questions) and a questionnaire for their subjective satisfaction (10 statements). Surveys were assessed with Cronbach's alpha, Kendall's tau-b, and principal components analysis. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test and a one-way ANOVA (significance alpha = 0.05). Standard lecture followed by CBCT showed the highest learning outcome score (81.6% +/- 14.1%), but no significant difference was present among four teaching methods. Cone beam computed tomography followed by lecture with skulls scored the highest overall subjective satisfaction (4.9 +/- 0.8 out of 6), but no significant difference was present among teaching methods. Nevertheless, students' perception of learning was positively influenced by the use of skulls (P = 0.018). The timing of administration of the CBCT did not affect students' subjective satisfaction or objective learning outcome. Students perceived to learn more by using skulls, but their objective learning outcomes were not significantly affected. A discrepancy seems to exist between students' perception of learning and their effective performance.

AB Anatomy has historically been a cornerstone in medical education regardless of nation or specialty. Until recently, dissection and didactic lectures were its sole pedagogy. Teaching methodology has been revolutionized with more reliance on models, imaging, simulation, and the Internet to further consolidate and enhance the learning experience. Moreover, modern medical curricula are giving less importance to anatomy education and to the acknowledged value of dissection. Universities have even abandoned dissection completely in favor of user-friendly multimedia, alternative teaching approaches, and newly defined priorities in clinical practice. Anatomy curriculum is undergoing international reformation but the current framework lacks uniformity among institutions. Optimal learning content can be categorized into the following modalities: (1) dissection/prosection, (2) interactive multimedia, (3) procedural anatomy, (4) surface and clinical anatomy, and (5) imaging. The importance of multimodal teaching, with examples suggested in this article, has been widely recognized and assessed. Nevertheless, there are still ongoing limitations in anatomy teaching. Substantial problems consist of diminished allotted dissection time and the number of qualified anatomy instructors, which will eventually deteriorate the quality of education. Alternative resources and strategies are discussed in an attempt to tackle these genuine concerns. The challenges are to reinstate more effective teaching and learning tools while maintaining the beneficial values of orthodox dissection. The UK has a reputable medical education but its quality could be improved by observing international frameworks. The heavy penalty of not concentrating on sufficient anatomy education will inevitably lead to incompetent anatomists and healthcare professionals, leaving patients to face dire repercussions.

AB Didactic lessons are only one part of the multimodal teaching strategies used in gross anatomy courses today. Increased emphasis is placed on providing more opportunities for students to develop lifelong learning and critical thinking skills during medical training. In a pilot program designed to promote more engaged and independent learning in anatomy, self-study modules were introduced to supplement human gross anatomy instruction at Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall University. Modules use three-dimensional constructs to help students understand complex anatomical regions. Resources are self-contained in portable bins and are accessible at any time. Students use modules individually or in groups in a structured self-study format that augments material presented in lecture and laboratory. Pilot outcome data, measured by feedback surveys and examination performance statistics, suggest that the activity may be improving learning in gross anatomy. Positive feedback on both pre- and post-examination surveys showed that students felt the activity helped to increase their understanding of the topic. In concordance with student perception, average examination scores on module-related laboratory and lecture questions were higher in the two years of the pilot program compared with the year before its initiation. Modules can be fabricated on a modest budget using minimal resources, making implementation practical for smaller institutions. Upper level medical students assist in module design and upkeep, enabling continuous opportunities for vertical integration across the curriculum. This resource offers a feasible mechanism for enhancing independent and lifelong learning competencies, which could be a valuable complement to any gross anatomy curriculum.

AB Purpose: Modern teaching concepts for undergraduate medical students in Germany include problem based learning as a major component of the new licensing regulations for physicians. Here we describe the usage of a web-based virtual outpatient clinic in the teaching curriculum of undergraduate medical students, its effect on learning success, and student reception.
   Methods: Fifth year medial students were requested to examine 7 virtual orthopaedic patients which had been created by the authors using the Inmedea-Simulator. They also had to take a multiple-choice examination on two different occasions and their utilisation of the simulator was analysed subjectively and objectively.
   Results: One hundred and sixty students took part in the study. The average age was 24.9 years, 60% were female. Most of the participants studied on their own using their private computer with a fast internet-connection at home. The average usage time was 263 min, most of the students worked with the system in the afternoon, although a considerable number used it late in the night. Regarding learning success, we found that the examination results were significantly better after using the system (7.66 versus 8.37, p < 0.0001). Eighty percent of the students enjoyed dealing with the virtual patients emphasizing the completeness of patient cases, the artistic graphic design and the expert comments available, as well as the good applicability to real cases. Eighty-seven percent of the students graded the virtual orthopaedic clinic as appropriate to teach orthopaedic content.
   Conclusion: Using the Inmedea-Simulator is an effective method to enhance students' learning efficacy. The way the system was used by the students emphasises the advantages of the internet-like free time management and the implementation of multimedia-based content. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Audiovisual cognitive artifacts in all their forms are increasingly used in flipped, blended, MOOCs and conventional teaching and learning processes. During the health emergency due to the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, they were in many cases, in schools and universities, the only response to the need to follow up on training processes, which were compulsorily remote, becoming the educational media par excellence. This work concerns the use of educational technologies, specifically two audiovisual didactic texts, carried out in compliance with international multimedia design standards, to support conventional face-to-face didactic activities, in the field of professional health training (Laboratory for the simulation of radio-pharmacy activities, at the University of Ferrara, Italy). It is functional research to verify, on the one hand, the reinforcement of declarative knowledge (through a questionnaire administered in person immediately after the videos had been viewed) and, on the other hand, the perception of the effectiveness of the educational resources used (through a questionnaire administered online one week after the video had been viewed) for the reinforcement of procedural knowledge. All the instruments were administered to the entire group of students attending the degree course for medical radiographers (21 subjects), divided into two groups: the first group consisting of 11 subjects who still had to carry out the practical internship period; the second group consisting of 10 subjects who had already completed the internship. The final objective is twofold: (1) to contribute to the research area of video-based learning aimed at experimentally verifying the design principles underlying multimedia learning; (2) to verify the application of this methodology within laboratory teaching of medical degree courses and the health professions in order to meet educational needs in terms of improving the learning processes of complex manual procedures.

AB In the article the authors describe the structure and content of the electronic educational and methodological complex for students "Physics: social and humanitarian direction of specialized education" in the form of a website. The complex was developed on the basis of application software, Internet resources and cloud services and is freely available. Examples of didactic and methodical materials of the complex are: materials for multimedia support of physics lessons, didactic tools based on cloud-oriented technologies for studying separate sections of physics, tasks for organizing independent activities of students in studying physics (historical and ideological character), tasks for online knowledge control, materials for the survey, survey and methodological tips for teachers. The authors theoretically substantiated the methodological feasibility of using Microsoft Power Point application software to develop multimedia accompaniment to the topics and sections of the high school physics course. It is proposed to include didactic tools in EUMK to increase interest in the study of physics (gaming - to repetition, consolidation of knowledge and self-esteem, word clouds to sections, highlighting physical phenomena and processes, physical quantities and units of measurement, mental maps for generalization of knowledge, repetition of educational material) based on Internet resources, in particular, Web 2.0 LearningApps, StudyStack, EDpuzzle, Kahoot, Quizizz, services to create a word cloud, memory cards. The authors selected interactive simulations and models that are appropriate to include in the system of didactic tools for organizing independent activities of students based on the analysis of the content of the phet.colorado.edu website and the 3D models of the Mozaik Education portal. Didactic and basic principles of organization of the electronic educational and methodical complex on the subject, which are the basis for the development of the author's complex, were highlighted. The offered complex has passed approbation in social and humanitarian classes of secondary education establishments.

AB How do students use multimedia tools to support their learning during a gross dissection course? We investigated this question in the anatomic dissection course for first year medical students at the University of Munich (n = 850) by giving all. participating students access to an anatomical multimedia CD-ROM. The use of this multimedia learning tool. was voluntary and it was not essential for the end-of-course examination.
   After the examination, two questionnaires (return rate first questionnaire n(1) = 347, similar to 41%; return rate second questionnaire n(2) = 644, similar to 76%) were given to the surveyed students with the following content: evaluation of the multimedia Learning too[, details about the usage of different kinds of available learning media, and finally an evaluation of the media used for teaching during the course. Furthermore we collected personal data from participants such as age, gender and the score achieved in the examination.
   Classical, textbooks and anatomical atlases were used by 84% of students for preparation. The multimedia learning tool, was used by 34% as an additional media for learning. The multimedia learning too[ was not used alone. The data showed differences with regard to gender and performance of students, but not relating to age. Students rated the computer-specific features, e.g. three-dimensional (3D) models, virtual simulations, and an interactive quiz module, as major reasons for using the multimedia learning tool.
   Our results show that medical students use anatomic multimedia learning toots primarily as an additional medium for learning, and thus lead to the conclusion that the main learning media are stilt textbooks and anatomic atlases. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB Davids MR, Chikte UME, Halperin ML. Development and evaluation of a multimedia e-learning resource for electrolyte and acid-base disorders. Adv Physiol Educ 35: 295-306, 2011; doi:10.1152/advan.00127.2010.-This article reports on the development and evaluation of a Web-based application that provides instruction and hands-on practice in managing electrolyte and acid-base disorders. Our teaching approach, which focuses on concepts rather than details, encourages quantitative analysis and a logical problem-solving approach. Identifying any dangers to the patient is a vital first step. Concepts such as an "appropriate response" to a given perturbation and the need for electroneutrality in body fluids are used repeatedly. Our Electrolyte Workshop was developed using Flash and followed an iterative design process. Two case-based tutorials were built in this first phase, with one tutorial including an interactive treatment simulation. Users select from a menu of therapies and see the impact of their choices on the patient. Appropriate text messages are displayed, and changes in body compartment sizes, brain size, and plasma sodium concentrations are illustrated via Flash animation. Challenges encountered included a shortage of skilled Flash developers, budgetary constraints, and challenges in communication between the authors and the developers. The application was evaluated via user testing by residents and specialists in internal medicine. Satisfaction was measured with a questionnaire based on the System Usability Scale. The mean System Usability Scale score was 78.4 +/- 13.8, indicating a good level of usability. Participants rated the content as being scientifically sound; they liked the teaching approach and felt that concepts were conveyed clearly. They indicated that the application held their interest, that it increased their understanding of hyponatremia, and that they would recommend this learning resource to others.

AB Background: Serious games can be a powerful learning tool in higher education. However, the literature indicates that the learning outcome in a serious game depends on the facilitators' competencies. Although professional facilitators in commercial game-based training have undergone specific instruction, facilitators in higher education cannot rely on such formal instruction, as game facilitation is only an occasional part of their teaching activities.
   Objective: This study aimed to address the actual competencies of occasional game facilitators and their perceived competency deficits.
   Methods: Having many years of experience as professional and occasional facilitators, we (n=7) defined requirements for the occasional game facilitator using individual reflection and focus discussion. Based on these results, guided interviews were conducted with additional occasional game facilitators (n=4) to check and extend the requirements. Finally, a group of occasional game facilitators (n=30) answered an online questionnaire based on the results of the requirement analysis and existing competency models.
   Results: Our review produced the following questions: Which competencies are needed by facilitators and what are their training needs? What do current training courses for occasional game facilitators in higher education look like? How do the competencies of occasional game facilitators differ from other competencies required in higher education? The key findings of our analysis are that a mix of managerial and technical competencies is required for facilitating serious games in higher educational contexts. Further, there is a limited or no general competence model for game facilitators, and casual game facilitators rarely undergo any specific, formal training.
   Conclusions: The results identified the competencies that game facilitators require and a demand for specific formal training. Thus, the study contributes to the further development of a competency model for game facilitators and enhances the efficiency of serious games.

AB Game-based learning can have a positive impact on medical education, and virtual worlds have great potential for supporting immersive online games. It is necessary to reinforce current medical students' knowledge about radiological anatomy and radiological signs. To meet this need, the objectives of this study were: to design a competition-based game in the virtual world, Second Life and to analyze the students' perceptions of Second Life and the game, as well as to analyze the medium-term retention of knowledge and the potential impact on the final grades. Ninety out of 197 (45.6%) third-year medical students voluntarily participated in an online game based on self-guided presentations and multiple-choice tests over six 6-day stages. Participants and non-participants were invited to perform an evaluation questionnaire about the experience and a post-exposure knowledge test. Participants rated the experience with mean scores equal to or higher than 8.1 on a 10-point scale, highlighting the professor (9.5 +/- 1.1; mean +/- SD) and the virtual environment (8.9 +/- 1.1). Participants had better results in the post-exposure test than non-participants (59.0 +/- 13.5 versus 45.3 +/- 11.5; P < 0.001) and a lower percentage of answers left blank (6.7 +/- 8.4 versus 13.1 +/- 12.9; P = 0.014). Competitive game-based learning within Second Life is an effective and well-accepted means of teaching core radiological anatomy and radiological signs content to medical students. The higher medium-term outcomes obtained by participants may indicate effective learning with the game. Additionally, valuable positive perceptions about the game, the educational contents, and the potential benefit for their education were discovered among non-participants.

TI Women, adult literacy education and transformative bonds of care
SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADULT LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE adult literacy; transformative teaching and learning; dialogical care
ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Drawing on a research project: 'FE in England - Transforming lives and communities' (sponsored by the University and College Union) to explore the intersection between women, literacy and adult education, this paper argues for the place of research in affirming localised understandings of education that cut across the grain of contemporary educational reform. In the context of the increasing dominance of a 'skills' discourse in education in the UK and reductions in funding targeted at adult education, this research project exposed how further education can still challenge and address hurt and often spoiled learning identities and counteract the objectification of the skills discourse through creating catalysing bridging bonds of care. The research data illustrate that further education offers organic transformative tools for consciousness-raising (Freire, 1995) and a caring space where hope can act as a change agent that fuels women learners' lives and teachers' practice (Duckworth, 2013; Duckworth & Smith, 2017, 2018b).
   To support the discussion, our paper draws on a range of learners and teachers' narratives to expand on the conceptualisation of adult education as a bridging space for a curriculum informed by an ethic of what we term dialogic caring. We also develop a theoretical position that anchors the research in learners and practitioners' experience as an empirical antidote to the simulations (Baudrillard, 1994; Lefebvre, 2004) conjured up by the decontextualised knowledge production activities that marketisation has imposed on educational institutions. We position education research as having an important role to play in revealing powerful often hidden social practices and lived human experience beneath the neoliberal, globalised 'grand narratives' of international competition. To that end, we mobilise the term transformative teaching and learning to signify educational experiences that are not only student-centred, but which defy, counteract and work against the neoliberal educational imaginary. We align our research approach with adult literacy education and critical pedagogy as working towards social justice and against deficit generating educational structures that marginalise women, their families and communities.

AB Objectives: The features that contribute to the apparent effectiveness of three-dimensional visualisation technology [3DVT] in teaching anatomy are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the role of stereopsis in learning anatomy with 3DVT.
   Methods: The review was conducted and reported according to PRISMA Standards. Literature search of English articles was performed using EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL EBSCOhost, ERIC EBSCOhost, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases until November 2019. Study selection, data extraction and study appraisal were performed independently by two authors. Articles were assessed for methodological quality using the Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias. For quantitative analysis, studies were grouped based on relative between-intervention differences in instructional methods and type of control conditions.
   Results: A total of 3934 citations were obtained of which 67 underwent a full-text review. Ultimately, 13 randomised controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. When interactive, stereoscopic 3D models were compared to interactive, monoscopic 3D models within a single level of instructional design, for example isolating stereopsis as the only true manipulated element in the experimental design, an effect size [ES] of 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26-0.80;P < .00001) was found. In comparison with 2D images within multiple levels of instructional design, an effect size of 0.45 (95% CI 0.10-0.81;P < .002) was found. Stereopsis had no effect on learning when utilised with non-interactive 3D images (ES = -0.87, 95% CI -2.09-0.35;P = .16).
   Conclusion: Stereopsis is an important distinguishing element of 3DVT that has a significant positive effect on acquisition of anatomical knowledge when utilised within an interactive 3D environment. A distinction between stereoscopic and monoscopic 3DVT is essential to make in anatomical education and research.

AB Objective: The primary aim of this overview was to synthesise results from studies including digital education and its effect on knowledge or learning outcomes, student satisfaction, student enrolment, attendance rate, course completion rate, clinical practice, health outcomes for patients and cost-effectiveness in health-care education. A secondary aim was to report on successful instructional design strategies, and barriers or contextual factors influencing the effectiveness of online learning course delivery in healthcare education.
   Method: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews (SRs) for digital education interventions delivered to health-care students and practitioners.
   Results: We scanned 848 titles, reviewed 247 abstracts and assessed 49 full-text articles against pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. This overview includes data collected from 31,730 participants across 16 SRs. The quality of evidence included in the SRs ranged from very low (n=2), low (n=6) to moderate (n=8). The best available SRs were of moderate quality (7.4 of 11 AMSTAR). SR authors did not report other teaching methods as being superior to digital learning. In most cases (n=9), digital education when used in addition to traditional methods augmented knowledge acquisition. Other SRs (n=7) did not show statistically significant differences across interventions including digital education as a replacement, or additive resource to traditional intervention.
   Conclusion: Student enrolment, attendance rates, course completion rates, cost-effectiveness and changes in clinical outcomes for patients are underreported in the existing evidence. Although the quality and quantity of data are limited, evidence-based instructional design for digital education is becoming more possible, especially as educators establish learning activities that track to learning objectives for knowledge acquisition in health care.

AB Computer-assisted learning is a hot topic and is evolving parallel with the rapidly growing computer technology. Today, modern computers with sophisticated software are able to create a new dimension in the application of many important pedagogical principles and philosophies, Modem computers with excellent multimedia applications are capable of simulating a realistic situation that enriches the educational environment, improves the learning process, and brings new challenges to the process of "learning by doing." The use of computers in medical industry and in medical education lags far behind other applications in the industrial world. Although a great many computer-assisted learning programs have been developed in the last decade and patient simulation has been attempted, there are no computer programs in the market that are capable of simulating the realism of the patient-doctor relationship. cyberActive Technology Ltd. has been able to complete this mission. The computer software cyberPatient(TM) developed by cyberActive Technology Ltd. is able to realize this long-term dream of medical students and educators. The discrepancy between theoretical and practical medical knowledge in the classical medical education was greater than in any other aspect of science. In classical medical education, diseases were taught beginning with etiology and pathogenesis to signs and symptoms. In practice, the patient comes to the doctor with complaints, and the doctor has to think backward to find out about the etiology and pathogenesis. This discrepancy created enormous difficulties for interns and young doctors with respect to the application of theoretical medicine to medical practice. This was one of the reasons why medical schools turned to a new problem-based learning curriculum. The new curriculum, however, has brought new challenges and problems of its own. Some of the problems include patient availability, increased demands for teachers, and, in turn, significant increases in the costs of medical education. Intensive use of computers may be a solution for problem-based learning. The aim of this article is to give an overview of computer-based learning and its place in the future of medical education.

   Adaptive Assessment; Online Education
AB The technological innovations created paradigm shifts in online education. In the near future, many routine-oriented jobs will be filled with artificial intelligence. Educators have a daunting task to prepare their students for jobs that not yet been created. The digital generation requires from educators to reconsider preconceived notions about assessment and introduce authentic performance-based assessment in the online environment. In contrast with the traditional educational assessment methods focusing on standardized tests, memorization and recall of information, alternative assessment fosters the development of creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills by using authentic real world tasks to support exploration, discovery, and problem-based learning for students with diverse learning styles. There are a multitude of alternative assessment strategies to help students develop the intrinsic motivation that will allow them to become lifelong learners. Blogs, journals, wikis, and digital portfolios are excellent tools for self-reflection and personal growth. The process of engaging online learners in the production of podcasts and video projects can motivate students to acquire in-depth knowledge of the subject they study. Involving students in peer review promotes collaborative learning, creative expression, reflection, and higher-order thinking skills. Educational games, simulations, and virtual environments change the way educators teach and assess their students. Traditional tests do not offer struggling students immediate feedback on their exact level of achievement. Adaptive assessment adjusts the difficulty of questions based on a student's response and customizes assessment for each student by providing a more accurate measurement of their skills, knowledge, abilities, attitudes, personality traits and educational achievements backed by automated psychometrics. The artificial-intelligence based assessment tools highlight the strengths and weaknesses of student knowledge, provide them with comprehensive reports, and offer students immersive learning environments for improving their knowledge to a desirable level. Rewarding student proficiency with digital badges engages students in learning and provides credentials for acquiring new skills. Fostering student intrinsic motivation and innovation by using creative assessment strategies prepares students for the fast-changing, culturally diverse, and the interconnected modern world.

AB Game-based learning may present a way of creating immersion and engagement for the learner through simulated experiences in a narrative environment, and may support the development of 21st. century skills of communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking. Role playing games have had a long history of usage in language learning and as a multidisciplinary activity in schools during theme weeks. Through the concept of serious digital games, which offers learning through digital simulations and immersion in virtual worlds, game-based learning has been deployed increasingly in education where games have been used for specific subjects. The use of live role-game playing in schools offers novel and innovative ways to work with the game genre, with the teachers contributing as game authors and game masters. A current project on live action role-game playing looks at how role-game playing can be used to present an entire curriculum within a narrative framework in order to enhance the learners' motivation and zest for learning while developing 21st century learning skills. The exploration of how live action role-game playing can function as an overarching framework for learning may offer fresh insights into game-based learning in terms of multimodality, flexibility in the design of games and the role and interactivity of the learner and teacher. A unique residential school dedicated to teaching all subjects in grades 9-10 through live role-game play was studied for a year. The study employed qualitative and processual methodologies in order to capture the interactions between students' learning experiences and the role-game based learning designs as well as the way they constitute a creative and collaborative learning environment. This paper presents the preliminary results of the project and discusses its implications for design and redesign of learning environments in the schools along with the roles of learners and teachers in the development of game-based learning as a framework for creative, inclusive and collaborative learning.

AB The spreading of the Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) has involved new concepts in the management of construction projects generating a new demand for trained professionals with deep understanding of their principles and collaborative skills. In this order of ideas, a query arises as a non-negligible concern about how to teach and prepare students for this challenge. This paper presents a teaching and learning proposal for project development in the subject of final design project (8th-semester civil engineering-Universidad de los Andes), through the adoption of integrated project delivery (IPD) principles for their professional development through the project-based learning (PBL) methodology in accordance with the needs of the industry. The main objective of the course is to promote the professional and personal skills needed to thoroughly develop a design project, in order to solve a tangible social need identified in the municipalities and communities across the country and aligned with their development plans. It is a requirement that the students explicitly and holistically frame their project under the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic and environmental, and the project has to be ambitious enough so that it can involve all areas of the Civil Engineering program. The students develop and deliver the project in the real phases of the design lifecycle of an integrated civil project during the course: conceptual project, basic project, project draft, design project and the final deliverable which includes a complete and detailed descriptive-constructive memory, a complete design memory of all systems, the financial viability and construction schedule established to a high level of precision and a 3D BIM model with complete details. Students often take a step further and perform 4D and 5D simulations, as well as virtual reality applications. As a result, the students recognize the value of this methodology that allows a full rapprochement to a real world situation with innovative solutions and multidisciplinary teams.

AB Studies exploring how students learn and understand science processes such as diffusion and natural selection typically find that students provide misconceived explanations of how the patterns of such processes arise (such as why giraffes necks get longer over generations, or how ink dropped into water appears to flow). Instead of explaining the patterns of these processes as emerging from the collective interactions of all the agents (e.g., both the water and the ink molecules), students often explain the pattern as being caused by controlling agents with intentional goals, as well as express a variety of many other misconceived notions. In this article, we provide a hypothesis for what constitutes a misconceived explanation; why misconceived explanations are so prevalent, robust, and resistant to instruction; and offer one approach of how they may be overcome. In particular, we hypothesize that students misunderstand many science processes because they rely on a generalized version of narrative schemas and scripts (referred to here as a Direct-causal Schema) to interpret them. For science processes that are sequential and stage-like, such as cycles of moon, circulation of blood, stages of mitosis, and photosynthesis, a Direct-causal Schema is adequate for correct understanding. However, for science processes that are non-sequential (or emergent), such as diffusion, natural selection, osmosis, and heat flow, using a Direct Schema to understand these processes will lead to robust misconceptions. Instead, a different type of general schema may be required to interpret non-sequential processes, which we refer to as an Emergent-causal Schema. We propose that students lack this Emergent Schema and teaching it to them may help them learn and understand emergent kinds of science processes such as diffusion. Our study found that directly teaching students this Emergent Schema led to increased learning of the process of diffusion. This article presents a fine-grained characterization of each type of Schema, our instructional intervention, the successes we have achieved, and the lessons we have learned.

AB Effects of multiple external representations on teaching and learning have been widely researched; however, relatively little is understood about how different types of representations used for item presentation influence students' performances in computer-based assessments, particularly in those evaluating complex abilities. We designed a multimedia-based assessment for secondary school students that focused on scientific inquiry abilities (i.e., questioning, experimenting, analyzing, and explaining). Through the participation of 1218 students (561 8th graders and 657 11th graders), the balanced arrangement of test booklets, and the use of a generalized partial credit Rasch model, this study aimed at investigating how the modality of representations for item presentation (i.e., dynamic and static) and type of visual information (i.e., context and content) conveyed by the representations affected the item difficulty of the multimedia-based assessment. The results showed that overall items became slightly more difficult for students when the item presentation was static. Also, the interaction effect between modality and grade was significant; when item presentation was changed from dynamic to static, the items became easier to the 8th graders, whereas they were more difficult to the 11th graders. The results suggested that older students might have more cognitive resources to retrieve information from dynamic displays to solve the assessment tasks successfully. Additionally, while all interactions between modality and type of information on items with context visuals were not significant, there were significant interactions on four items with content visuals. A further examination of the items suggested that the tasks and the phenomena involved in the items may influence how modality affected the item difficulties when content visuals were used. These results implied that researchers need to pay special attention on the design of content visuals because they appear to be more influential than context ones to students' performances of science assessments.

AB Background: Virtual Patients are a well-known and widely used form of interactive software used to simulate aspects of patient care that students are increasingly less likely to encounter during their studies. However, to take full advantage of the benefits of using Virtual Patients, students should have access to multitudes of cases. In order to promote the creation of collections of cases, a tablet application was developed which makes use of electronic health records as material for Virtual Patient cases. Because electronic health records are abundantly available on hospital information systems, this results in much material for the basis of case creation.
   Results: An iPad-based Virtual Patient interactive software system was developed entitled Casebook. The application has been designed to read specially formatted patient cases that have been created using electronic health records, in the form of X-ray images, electrocardiograms, lab reports, and physician notes, and present these to the medical student. These health records are organised into a timeline, and the student navigates the case while answering questions regarding the patient along the way. Each health record can also be annotated with meta-information by the case designer, such as insight into the thought processes and the decision-making rationale of the physician who originally worked with the patient. Students learn decision-making skills by observing and interacting with real patient cases in this simulated environment. This paper discusses our approach in detail.
   Conclusions: Our group is of the opinion that Virtual Patient cases, targeted at undergraduate students, should concern patients who exhibit prototypical symptoms of the kind students may encounter when beginning their first medical jobs. Learning theory research has shown that students learn decision-making skills best when they have access to multitudes of patient cases and it is this plurality that allows students to develop their illness scripts effectively. Casebook emphasises the use of pre-existing electronic health record data as the basis for case creation, thus, it is hoped, making it easier to produce cases in larger numbers. By creating a Virtual Patient system where cases are built from abundantly available electronic health records, collections of cases can be accumulated by institutions.

AB Background: Computer-based teaching (CBT) is a well-known educational device, but it has never been applied systematically to the teaching of a complex, rare, genetic disease, such as Hunter disease (MPS II).
   Aim: To develop interactive teaching software functioning as a virtual clinic for the management of MPS II.
   Implementation and Results: The Hunter disease eClinic, a self-training, user-friendly educational software program, available at the Lysosomal Storage Research Group (http://www.lysosomalstorageresearch.ca), was developed using the Adobe Flash multimedia platform. It was designed to function both to provide a realistic, interactive virtual clinic and instantaneous access to supporting literature on Hunter disease. The Hunter disease eClinic consists of an eBook and an eClinic. The eClinic is the interactive virtual clinic component of the software. Within an environment resembling a real clinic, the trainee is instructed to perform a medical history, to examine the patient, and to order appropriate investigation. The program provides clinical data derived from the management of actual patients with Hunter disease. The eBook provides instantaneous, electronic access to a vast collection of reference information to provide detailed background clinical and basic science, including relevant biochemistry, physiology, and genetics. In the eClinic, the trainee is presented with quizzes designed to provide immediate feedback on both trainee effectiveness and efficiency. User feedback on the merits of the program was collected at several seminars and formal clinical rounds at several medical centres, primarily in Canada. In addition, online usage statistics were documented for a 2-year period. Feedback was consistently positive and confirmed the practical benefit of the program. The online English-language version is accessed daily by users from all over the world; a Japanese translation of the program is also available.
   Conclusions: The Hunter disease eClinic employs a CBT model providing the trainee with realistic clinical problems, coupled with comprehensive basic and clinical reference information by instantaneous access to an electronic textbook, the eBook. The program was rated highly by attendees at national and international presentations. It provides a potential model for use as an educational approach to other rare genetic diseases.

AB Background: Dementia prevalence is increasing globally and yet evidence suggest that gaps exist in dementia-specific knowledge among health and social care practitioners. Technological modes of educational delivery may be as effective as traditional education and can provide practitioners with increased accessibility to dementia training. Benefits of digitally based dementia education have been established including pedagogical strategies that influence dementia knowledge and care attitudes. This review aimed to appraise and synthesise contemporary experimental evidence that evaluated technology-enabled dementia education for health and social care practitioners. Outcomes based on Kirkpatrick's Model were learner satisfaction; knowledge, skills, and attitudes; behaviours; and results.
   Methods: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Web of Science were among 8 bibliographic databases searched from January 2005 until February 2020. Keywords included dementia and education (and terms for technological modes of education, learning, or training). We included experimental and quasi-experimental studies. Medical Education Research Study Quality Instrument established the overall quality of included studies and pragmatic application of Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool established individual study quality and highlighted methodological features of educational research. Narrative synthesis was conducted as heterogeneous outcome data precluded meta-analysis.
   Results: We identified 21 relevant studies: 16 evaluated online dementia education and 5 evaluated computer-based approaches. Most studies used before-after designs and study quality was moderate overall. Most studies reported knowledge-based outcomes with statistically significant findings favouring the training interventions. Positive effects were also observed in studies measuring skills and attitudinal change. Fewer studies reported significant findings for behavioural change and results due to training. Case-based instruction was a frequently described instructional strategy in online dementia education and videos were common information delivery modes. CD-ROM training and simulation activities were described in computer-based dementia education.
   Discussion: Future emphasis must be placed on teaching and learning methods within technology-enabled dementia education which should be role relevant and incorporate active and interactive learning strategies. Future evaluations will require contextually relevant research methodologies with capacity to address challenges presented by these complex educational programmes and multi-component characteristics.

AB Background: Virtual Patients (VPs) are web-based representations of realistic clinical cases. They are proposed as being an optimal method for teaching clinical reasoning skills. International standards exist which define precisely what constitutes a VP. There are multiple design possibilities for VPs, however there is little formal evidence to support individual design features. The purpose of this trial is to explore the effect of two different potentially important design features on clinical reasoning skills and the student experience. These are the branching case pathways (present or absent) and structured clinical reasoning feedback (present or absent).
   Methods/Design: This is a multi-centre randomised 2x2 factorial design study evaluating two independent variables of VP design, branching (present or absent), and structured clinical reasoning feedback (present or absent). The study will be carried out in medical student volunteers in one year group from three university medical schools in the United Kingdom, Warwick, Keele and Birmingham. There are four core musculoskeletal topics. Each case can be designed in four different ways, equating to 16 VPs required for the research. Students will be randomised to four groups, completing the four VP topics in the same order, but with each group exposed to a different VP design sequentially. All students will be exposed to the four designs. Primary outcomes are performance for each case design in a standardized fifteen item clinical reasoning assessment, integrated into each VP, which is identical for each topic. Additionally a 15-item self-reported evaluation is completed for each VP, based on a widely used EViP tool. Student patterns of use of the VPs will be recorded.
   In one centre, formative clinical and examination performance will be recorded, along with a self reported pre and post-intervention reasoning score, the DTI. Our power calculations indicate a sample size of 112 is required for both primary outcomes.
   Discussion: This trial will provide robust evidence to support the effectiveness of different designs of virtual patients, based on student performance and evaluation. The cases and all learning materials will be open access and available on a Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike license.

AB The article suggests the structure of a virtual learning environment, which is a tool for supporting and activating student-centered education in Publishing and Printing specialty. Based on the analysis of theoretical and practical works on virtual learning systems and virtual learning environments, studying the characteristics of student-centered learning and the specificity of the image of the modern student of the "digital generation", features of the subject matter of the specialty, a modular structure of the virtual learning environment has been developed. The structure is based on the idea of internal and external resource integration of such components as the basic platform (that is, the educational platform implemented by Moodle) and seven on-line content-oriented resource components (in the context of its printing and multimedia needs). The substantive content of the basic educational platform and on-line resource components of the educational content with examples of their content are considered. In the above resource components, the implementation of virtual and virtualized forms of organization of classes and corresponding teaching aids, means of interaction (individual and collective), methods of increasing the motivation of the "digital" student to learn and methods of enhancing his cognitive activity are carried out. It has been found that to support the student-centered learning process, it is necessary to provide a virtual learning environment with separate and at the same time interrelated components of two groups: 1) to support learning based on on-line interaction (proposed components of this group: individualization of professional interaction, teamwork and support of collective communication, support of interpersonal communication, free communication) and 2) components of resource support training (the proposed components of this group: improving the efficiency of the current operations of the professional direction, information on the specialty and collection of media content, emulation and simulation of objects and processes, cloud environments). The article contains an example of the implementation of a basic educational platform and an on-line component providing support for the process of visualization in the 3D space of creative microprojects of students of Publishing and Printing specialty.

AB Information technology has provided new innovations to sustain constructing an artificial educational environment by means of computers. Certain artificial environments sometimes go beyond natural environments, such as simulations and virtual reality, which is a sophisticated educational technology emerging for less than a decade (Hamit, 1993). Virtual reality is distinguished by unique sorts of interaction, that responds to users' behaviors and actions. Unlike traditional multi-media, virtual reality offers a distinctive level of interaction. Hence, virtual reality is considered to be a new model of computer-based learning, that provides the individual learner with a wider range of scientific vision (Chow & Andrews, 2007). This kind of educational technology provides an advanced individualized learning perfectly meets the educational needs and provides a high level of flexibility and freedom from constrains of time and place (Barbour & Reeves, 2009). One of the most important features of Virtual reality is the easily and continuous material update aiming to attain learning objectivity and interest (Al-Shanak & Doumi, 2009).
   With the increasing popularity of virtual educational technology, globally and locally, the development of virtual learning environment became an important field of science which has its own basics and principles. On observing the reality of science education in Arab region today, the learner is constrained to the theoretical method in acquiring knowledge, rarely allowed to apply these knowledge practically. This is due to several reasons including; the lack of laboratory devices, the risks that may result from applying some scientific experiments, and the high cost of materials (Al-Raid, 2008).
   The above display demonstrates the need to apply virtual learning environment in teaching science. The current paper will tackle this issue, highlighting the following themes:
   - What is meant by: virtual reality, virtual environment, and virtual learning?
   - What are the characteristics and features of virtual learning systems?
   - What are the characteristics and possibilities of virtual learning environment of science?
   - What is a virtual lab?
   - Why the need arises to virtual labs?
   The importance of the paper: The importance of the current study is demonstrated in its relevance and advantage to various aspects of educational process, which could be stated as follows:
   - The current paper contributes to present definitions to the following terms: (virtual reality, virtual education, virtual laboratory, virtual instructor).
   - Investigates the importance of scientific virtual environment.
   - Presents recommendations and suggestions.

AB We present here our experience of several years with virtual bright youth at the Unit for Science Oriented Youth at Tel Aviv University. The campus staff specializes both in teaching structured courses in different fields, and in conducting hands-on competitive and multidisciplinary network events, in which thousands of young people participate each year. The wide-ranging activities are multilingual and are based on simple technological means that are accessible to youngsters and provoke their curiosity: the Internet, messaging software, cell-phones and so on.
   Learning takes place by means of unique modules providing an enriching, active, challenging and fascinating intellectual experience. We offer exclusive programs, with added value resulting from the encounter between the students and lecturers and researchers from the academic faculty and the rich and diverse world of content that the University offers.
   This is a virtual learning model that comprises a number of practical tasks for which the students receive instructions: experimentation, programming, simulation, role-playing or riddle solving. It requires making use of theoretical material appearing on the website or available on the Internet. In the course of the tasks the instructor gives the students online advice and guidance, and after each task there is a chat session. The courses allow a different kind of learning, covering a wide range of subjects. An ongoing course demands an additional dimension of commitment and seriousness on the part of the students. The more active the students, the more benefit they reap from the e-learning program. To succeed in the course, students have to put in independent work and "virtual attendance" at all the meetings. Students have to be active in forums and discussion groups, to learn the theoretical content, and to submit assignments. At the end of the course, a grade and a certificate of participation is issued.
   The Virtual Campus of the Unit for Science Oriented Youth holds culminating virtual events and competition days for groups of students from all around the world. The meetings are challenging and serve as a peak activity for youngsters who have been involved in enrichment activities throughout the school year. The use of the Internet as a tool to reduce distances makes it possible to invite pupils from all around the world, of different cultures and social background, to have access to the leading universities and edge-cutting science.

AB A learning pill is a "reusable learning objects", that is, a digitized entity, which can be used, reused or referenced during technology, supported learning or small chunks of learning (granules, objects) that are labelled (meta-tagged within IMS standards) so systems can automatically mix and match them to assemble and deliver individualized learning experiences. They present a hierarchy of learning objects, which ranges from simulation through topical unit and reusable learning object (RLO) to information objects.
   Learning pills are a new way of thinking about learning content. Traditionally, content comes in a several hour chunk. Learning objects are much smaller units of learning, typically ranging from 10 to 15 minutes. Are self-contained - each learning object can be taken independently and reusable - a single learning object may be used in multiple contexts for multiple purposes. Can be aggregated - learning objects can be grouped into larger collections of content, including traditional course structures. Are tagged with metadata - every learning object has descriptive information allowing it to be easily found by a search.
   A learning pill in the University of Vigo has a 1024P+P format. It enables us to combine a computer desktop image and the video image of the lecturer or presenter in the same video. The end product is a video with resolution at 1024x768 including the lecturer, his/her voice and the PC background used for the presentation in all its resolution, with any program used and the mouse pointer movements.
   In the case of engineering disciplines, learning pills are well received by students not only if their content is about fundamental concepts on chemical engineering but in the following cases: case studies, use of computer programs, problem resolution.
   In the case of problem resolution we are now working in a new kind of learning pill called "mixed learning pill" because we have detected the time that takes the numerical resolution is very large in relation to the "key steps" description. By means of a short postproduction, we can reduce or accelerate the calculations time to focus our learning pill on key steps, combining the use of or excel or matlab screencast recordings for the calculations with PowerPoint slides for the key steps.
   Finally, to evaluate competences reached by students, according to the Bologna Declaration in the European Space for Higher education a new tool that complement the knowledge pills in order to help the student the knowledge level reached, teachers are preparing test under the flashcard format.

DE Gamification; Active Methodologies; System Dynamics
AB The fast development of information and communication technology ends into a new social schema. These multiple changes in our environment derive in new learning necessities, and its consequent learning methodologies. Therefore, an existing need to update and integrate a new curriculum, which would take into consideration the needs of students, and the use of information communication technologies is required. In this framework, the gamification offers the opportunity to increase the interest in students, as well as to motivate them, connect and empower their communication and sharing.
   The main goal of this paper is to present the use of an active methodology in Mondragon University (Master of Business Innovation and Project Management). The educational model in this university is based on Project Based Learning (PBL). This methodology establishes its principles on a model that organizes learning around projects. These projects are complex tasks, focused on real challenging questions or problems, that engage students in design, problem-solving, decision making, or investigative activities. This process gives students the opportunity to work strongly with the companies of the region, and be currently immersed in the labor market.
   In this context Gamification seems to be the most effective approach to increase student engagement, motivation, and in-class participation. This term involves the application of game elements and player incentives to non-game environments. Its success depends on the game mechanics employed and their effects on user motivation and immersion. Nowadays learners are digital natives and have new profile. They grew up with digital technologies and have different learning styles, new attitude to the learning process, and higher requirements for teaching and learning. Due to this new paradigm, teachers have to use different teaching methods and approaches that allow students to be active participants with strong motivation and engagement to their own learning.
   This work aims to present the case study developed in the master of analysis. Students were asked to elaborate a Business Model (BM) for a new product or service in groups of five people. Group Model Building (GMB) and System Dynamics (SD) simulation were used to promote discussion about the different possible future scenarios that could appear in this process.
   The results suggest that the use of problem-solving methods, such as GMB, helps to achieve a deeper learning. This methodology engages systems thinking perspective, and learners obtain a holistic understanding of the challenges to be solved in class. In addition, this technique based on trial and error, enhances a faster and more effective learning in comparison to the traditional lessons.

AB Purpose - The aim of this paper is to synthesize two conceptual frameworks on school learning in order to create a theoretical foundation for differentiated education supported by information and communication technology (ICT). One of the main problems in school education is that there are large differences between pupils. As prior knowledge determines learning outcomes, a large proportion of students do not benefit from uniform instruction. Several methods have been proposed to differentiate teaching and adjust it to students' individual needs, but the lack of useable instruments to identify these needs has limited the success of such efforts.
   Design/methodology/approach - We integrate the results of two different theoretical traditions. (1) One class of theoretical approaches has dealt with the issue of providing students with learning opportunities adjusted to their individual needs under the constraints of mass education characterised by heterogeneous classes. Several experiments have been conducted in this vein under the umbrella of individualization, personalization, differentiation and similar concepts. (2) Another class of theories deals with the concept of 'assessment for learning', which means that assessment is embedded in the teaching-learning processes to provide students with immediate feedback. We use this unified theory to build a complex, assessment-based, differentiated teaching system utilizing the possibilities of ICT. The first phase of the project has already been completed: an online assessment platform was created (the eDia) and item banks were developed for the assessment of reading comprehension, mathematics and science. In the current phase of the program, we integrate assessments into everyday teaching and learning processes.
   Originality/value - Several elements of the complex instructional/developmental system introduced in this paper have already been explored previously, but an innovative system of this kind has not yet been built. The item banks are based on an innovative assessment framework that distinguishes three dimensions in each assessment domain: (1) a psychological dimension that assesses how students' cognitive functions and their specific and general thinking skills develop, (2) application of their knowledge in new contexts and (3) progress in learning disciplinary knowledge defined in the curricula. The assessment items utilize the full range of multimedia, including video and simulation.
   Practical implications - The online assessment system has already been in use for several years and aids teachers greatly in identifying students who need special assistance with objective data. The system now under construction will provide students with personalized and playful developmental exercises. Early interventions may prevent school failures.

AB The last couple of years people are starting to get really excited about Virtual Reality (VR). With their first experience they see the great promise of VR, the possibility of creating any experience we can think of. To be able to do this in the safety of the classroom sounds like there is a great potential for this technology. But what is the real effectiveness of VR in education?
   To answer this question a literature study is conducted. Within this study we look at the measured effects of the use of VR. Related research is also taking into account to see what we can learn about the possible effects of learning with VR. Usually when new technology is introduced in education it is not solely based on research. Social development also plays a part. Therefore trends are taken into consideration regarding the research question.
   The theoretical framework around the use of VR in an educational setting is based on the published findings of the 7th International Conference, Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality 2015. This is completed with research that contributes to these findings. To gather related research VR is studied as a form of interactive multimedia. From this point on we look at the specific features that VR has to offer in comparison to other forms of multimedia and see what the possible effects of those features are on learning. To see where VR stands based on the current trends we look at Gardner's 2015 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies and the market around VR technology.
   The extent of literature on using VR in education is relatively small and the focus isn't always at the right place. There is a focus on measuring the gain of explicit knowledge, while a lot of researchers claim that VR is more effective in acquiring implicit knowledge. Or the focus is on the description of the technological characteristics of VR systems and not on the actual learning experience. There are some positive effects measured on the use of VR in education, but it's too early for conclusions about the true effectiveness.
   From related research we can find different advantages on learning. First there are the benefits of learning with multimedia. This is based on absorbing information, but VR is a full immersive experience. This way of learning in a simulation can even have a bigger effect on the learning outcomes. Due to the interactive nature of VR students can actively engage within the learning experience and receive instant feedback on their actions which can also be beneficial to learning.
   In Gardner's 2015 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies we can see that VR is five to ten years away from being adopted by the general public. Looking at the big investments some companies have done in VR technology this could happen sooner. Devices like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and the Playstation VR are all set to be released this year. The main market these companies focus on is the gaming industry. Because lots of students play videogames they'll be quickly introduced with VR and the experience of being in a virtual environment. Learning in such an environment will be a logical step from the students perspective.
   Combining these findings around literature on VR in an educational setting, related research and the trends on VR we can conclude that the use of VR in education could have a positive effect on learning. Therefore, although future research is necessary, we should start implementing the use of VR in education.

AB Cartoons constitute a form of amplification through simplification that can be used in many ways to heighten the message the educators want to pass in-class or core concept use. The effectiveness of interactive cartoons usage enhances students' concentration on a science topic which is being discussed in class, and overall is a basic element of the learning process and in creating an active learning environment. Also, animations allow students to engage in three learning styles simultaneously - visual, auditory and kinesthetic - which increases their knowledge comprehension. However, the use of animation, such as in 3D dimension or in simple simulation, it has provided visual cues for students to enhance their cognitive processing. So, animation can reinforce the process of visualization as an effective cognitive strategy to enhance conceptual understanding. In parallel 3D visualizations that runs in all browsers, without the adequate plugins or programs by giving the students the freedom to rotate them or change their sizes, observe the kind of information that they want and have difficulty to optimize or understand it, could provide a smart didactic tool in the academic unity. To this end "new" multidimensional teaching techniques must be adapted to attract undergraduate students interest to study basic concepts of Chemistry, which in turn reconstruct their scientific knowledge and overcome the difficulties they face in that demanding learning process. Concepts such as atomic orbitals, hybridization, chemical bonds, state of matter, intermolecular forces, some of them that they have being taught in secondary education, create them misconceptions. For that reason, digital material enriched with cartoons, animation, 3D and 2D graphics and digital educational games, was created. Combinations with 3D visualizations (in the case of atomic orbitals i.e. px, py, pz or hybrid orbitals sp, sp(2), sp(3)) assisted with cartoons (in a form of avatar Curie - Einstein - Darwin or as supplementary tool), educational games i.e. with flipping cards that demand the cross-matching of the right concept with the adequate graphic, animations with cartoons aided to explain the hybridization of carbon C etc., where constructed from scratch. In this digital material we focused on the main presumption that the undergraduate students must have the ability to intervene through the controlled movement and also choose windows - android, computer or tablet with the one that are familiar too. With the proper use of educational strategies and techniques of this specifically designed education material in Chemistry, we aiming to increase the active participation of students in the learning process, enabling them to control the pace and the way of learning.

AB In recent years, vocational education and training (VET) has changed its perspective from transfer of knowledge towards competency development. This occurs, because the transfer of declarative knowledge is not sufficient to develop skills which are necessary to solve complex tasks in a working environment [1], [2]. Therefore, it is crucial for competence measurement to create authentic action situations to improve the validity of tests, which should result in a higher adaptability of test results on reality and everyday situations (cp. [3]). Video elements have the potential to increase the validity of tests for competency measurement significantly, and therefore ensure that test results reflect the test persons skills for actual problem solving ( [4], [5]).
   The quality of technical equipment used in institutions of VET is constantly improving. Computers and electronical test centres allow the application of video elements on a large scale for training and education. While there is a variety of research on the use of videos in teaching (cp. [6]), the determinants of design and use of video elements for assessments is hardly examined (cp. [7], [8]). This is the motivation of this contribution.
   For a study on the vocational competencies of qualified medical employees, a computer-based competency test was designed and applied based on ILIAS, a digital learning management system. Nearly 1,000 test persons have been assessed. The purpose of this contribution is to empirically examine the effects of different aspects of video design on the behaviour of the participants, using the results of this competency test.
   First, criteria for classification for the test items and videos are elaborated. Second, the effects of these criteria are tested statistically using correlation analyses. The analyses are based on the data of 21 videos and the related items. Statistical criteria include the parameters of the items and determinants of difficulty levels as well as motivational and emotional aspects. As a result, the contribution shows the effects of different aspects of video design - like the charisma of the actors or the presence of superiors - on the difficulty of the item and the motivation of the test persons. Furthermore, technical aspects - like the length of the videos or the format of the items - are considered.
   The results are a contribution to the research on test design and the use of video elements in competence measurement. Practically, the findings may be used to improve the construction of video-based items. The results are not limited to the context of VET, they may be relevant for all areas of education.

AB The lean NPI game was developed as an educational game that enables learning through design simulation. The game runs on a global scale, is fully scalable and can be taught in many different levels of experience. Currently the programme reaches over 400 students per year worldwide but there is potential to exceed this via a number of innovative e-learning and online teaching methods.
   Working as part of multi-disciplinary teams, participants with differing skill sets can experience key elements of a business operations environment. By playing the game repeatedly, both participants and instructors have the benefit of improving performance by refining techniques, learning from past mistakes and collaborating with others. A critical element of review is incorporated as part of a feedback loop in order to allow for reflection and improvement.
   Whilst the game has been running successfully for many years there is now an opportunity to take the learning journey one step further, by developing creative opportunities using current technology to increase both the range and the depth of the learning experiences for the participants and the facilitators.
   Technology plays a critical role in business operations; its incorporation into the game can become a vital enabler of the learning journey.
   The use of current technology provides the capability of creating realistic scenarios regarding interactions between participants and facilitators. Such initiatives will increase both the range and the depth of participants and facilitators, who will be in a position to recognise the challenges of developing new products in either physical or virtual teams. The use of established pedagogical theories has been employed to guide the development of the project in order to achieve key objectives.
   Possibilities of using software technologies will be explored, in an attempt to simulate a real world experience for participants and facilitators. The Problem Based Learning basis of the game can continue through the use of these technologies.
   Collaborative software tools, such as video conferencing, web-based technologies and document sharing tools; will be tested to find different ways team members can interact, both locally and remotely, with the supplier, customer and each other.
   The 'social network' of the workplace is considered an important area for efficient collaborative working, and the ability to demonstrate this through the use of collaborative software will add to the learning experience.
   Visual tools will be examined to discover how they can be utilised by teams to enable a more structured project management process.
   Finally, the potential of using social media to enrich student learning journey will be investigated for their effectiveness as an enhancement to learning.

ID STUDENTS
AB Nowadays higher school teachers should possess a wide range of teaching skills to be good professionals, as university students have a strong professional motivation, and place high demands on the interaction with the teacher and his or her competence. Therefore, organizational and substantive issues of training qualified teachers for higher schools become topical, and many universities in different countries are developing training programs for preparing future teachers.
   The purpose of our study was to investigate the effect of the training program for pre-service university lecturers applied in St-Petersburg State University. We assume that one of the effective ways of preparing of prospective university teachers is the development of their reflective teaching skills by means of special training program. Our program based on the principles of activity and involvement, and on encouraging participants to take responsibility for learning. It relied on the multi-strategy which included informing of participants, training simulations, case studies, focus group discussions and reflection of teaching skills, manifested both in simulated situations of teaching and in the real teaching experience.
   The sample included 45 postgraduates (mean age 27.3 +/- 1.9) who had primary teaching practice and intention to work as a university lecturer. We used the questionnaire and eighteen 10-point scales (representing the necessary qualities of university teachers, including competence, communicative skills, motivation, didactic skills, etc) to study the self-assessment of participants, Eysenck Personality Inventory to study their emotional stability and extraversion/ introversion, and Yusupov technique to study their empathy. The final work of participants, with reflective writing of the experience, and the individual program of their further professional growth were subjected to content analysis. The effect of the program was also revealed by expert estimates. SPSS-20 was used for data processing.
   Results showed a high appreciation of the training program by participants. They got the greatest experience in reflection of their communicative teaching skills including the skills of analyzing of a teaching situation and their own behavior, contact with students, raising interest and activity of the audience, and skills of self-presentation; they mentioned as a very essential point the awareness of the individual temperamental characteristics, and the acquisition knowledge of the difficulties in communicating with students and ways of resolution of conflict teaching situations. Among further directions of professional growth the participants noted the necessity of development of communicative, organizational and public speaking skills, acquisition of modern educational technologies, and also the development of self-regulation skills, including self-control, coping with stressful situations, and care about health. Another direction was concerned with self-development, including the increase of self-confidence, development of self-knowledge and broadening of outlook.
   Based on the results obtained in the study, and expert assessment some additions and improvements in the program were made.

DE Computational thinking; scalable game design; computer training;
   systematic development
AB In Mexico there are very few studies on the effect of educational programs in the area of computing at the basic and medium level. However, a study on the use of educational software in primary schools [Salinas, 1998] confirmed that the development of computational thinking skills through educational software programs is unsatisfactory in primary students at the public level, since the activities in the computing area are more focused on learning to acquire information, rather than developing their computational thinking, as it is almost non-existent the teaching of programming. In 2014, the Institute of Innovation and Technology Transfer and the Tec de Monterrey (ITESM) made an adaptation of the Scalable Game Design (SGD) from University of Colorado and the research group of Alex Reppening, to develop a pilot project in Nuevo Leon, which was applied in the Computer Science Education Week 2014. SGD contains a set of projects in simulation and games that allow the gradual increase in computational thinking skills to the participants. In 2015, the Scalable Game Design Project was formally implemented: Chic@s Code, an innovative project that develops logical thinking in a fun way, by integrating girls and boys from primary and secondary school, regardless of their origin or previous experience in activities of video game programming. The objective is to introduce methodology and systematic teaching of computer science, besides motivating the interest in science and technology, boosting participation of the students in other activities, such as the State and national Science Fairs and the Computer Science Education Week. The metrics managed to measure the impact in girls and boys are based in the Number of Children Trained in Programming Tool (NCHP), one is the Short Term version (NCHP-ST), and other is the Long Term version (NCHP-LT). The NCHP-ST activities are carried out during the year at events such as Tec-Monterrey's Semana-i, the B-Tec event, "Hour of Code", in which students perform an activity of approximately four hours, designing and programming of the Frogger game online or use the autonomous version Agent Cubes 2.5 where schools were attended or received at Tec de Monterrey facilities. The NCHP-LP activity takes place from August to November, directly presented by the teacher assigned to the group by the Ministry of Education, previously trained in the technological and pedagogical tools to implement Chic@s code, and advised by a Tec de Monterrey professor. By 2017, 17,017 students, 5,022 (NCHP-ST) and 11,995 (NCH-PLT) were trained under the program. The contributions demonstrated by the project over 3 years of implementation are:
   a) Systematically develop computational thinking in a large number of children,
   b) Retention of children's attention when using the SGD program,
   c) Evaluation with computational instruments of learning outcomes and
   d) Training for teachers using new methods of teaching computer science.

AB Background: Computer-based learning (CBL) has been widely used in medical education, and reports regarding its usage and effectiveness have ranged broadly. Most work has been done on the effectiveness of CBL approaches versus traditional methods, and little has been done on the comparative effects of CBL versus CBL methodologies. These findings urged other authors to recommend such studies in hopes of improving knowledge about which CBL methods work best in which settings.
   Objective: In this systematic review, we aimed to characterize recent studies of the development of software platforms and interventions in medical education, search for common points among studies, and assess whether recommendations for CBL research are being taken into consideration.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature published from 2003 through 2013. We included studies written in English, specifically in medical education, regarding either the development of instructional software or interventions using instructional software, during training or practice, that reported learner attitudes, satisfaction, knowledge, skills, or software usage. We conducted 2 latent class analyses to group articles according to platform features and intervention characteristics. In addition, we analyzed references and citations for abstracted articles.
   Results: We analyzed 251 articles. The number of publications rose over time, and they encompassed most medical disciplines, learning settings, and training levels, totaling 25 different platforms specifically for medical education. We uncovered 4 latent classes for educational software, characteristically making use of multimedia (115/251, 45.8%), text (64/251, 25.5%), Web conferencing (54/251, 21.5%), and instructional design principles (18/251, 7.2%). We found 3 classes for intervention outcomes: knowledge and attitudes (175/212, 82.6%), knowledge, attitudes, and skills (11.8%), and online activity (12/212, 5.7%). About a quarter of the articles (58/227, 25.6%) did not hold references or citations in common with other articles. The number of common references and citations increased in articles reporting instructional design principles (P=.03), articles measuring online activities (P=.01), and articles citing a review by Cook and colleagues on CBL (P=.04). There was an association between number of citations and studies comparing CBL versus CBL, independent of publication date (P=.02).
   Conclusions: Studies in this field vary highly, and a high number of software systems are being developed. It seems that past recommendations regarding CBL interventions are being taken into consideration. A move into a more student-centered model, a focus on implementing reusable software platforms for specific learning contexts, and the analysis of online activity to track and predict outcomes are relevant areas for future research in this field.

AB This study examines the timing using computer-enriched instruction (CEI), before or after a traditional lecture to determine cross-over effect. period effect, and learning effect arising from sequencing of instruction. A 2 x 2 cross-over design was used with CEI to teach central limit theorem (CLT) Two sequences of graduate students in nursing participated in this study Sequence A was given the CEI and handout first, followed by a traditional lecture and handout. Sequence 13 was given a lecture and handout first, followed by the CEI and handout. A pre-test and posttests (posttest1 after the first presentation and posttest2 after the second presentation) were given to measure instructional outcomes All tests were 10 multiple choice questions with four options and only one option was the correct answer
   No significant difference in scores was seen in posttest1 between students in sequence A (6 1 +/- 2 5) and B (6 5 +/- 2.1) (p = 0.52 by unpaired t-test, p = 080 after adjusted for pre-test score by ANCOVA). No significant carryover effect was seen (p = 0.66). A significant period effect was observed, in which 7.7 for period 2 was greater than 6.3 for period 1. the difference of 1.4 with 95% Cl between 08 and 2.0, p <0.0001. When the course material was taught twice, traditional lecture had a higher average score (7 3) than CEI (6.6) and the difference between two teaching methods was 0.7 with 95% Cl between 0.1 and 1.3, p = 0 02) Sequence A's increase (2.1) represented a preview effect of CEI and sequence B's increase (0 8) represented a review effect of CEI. The study time needed for the first presentation was the same for the two teaching methods (55 min): the study time needed for the first presentation was always longer than that of the second presentation, regardless of which teaching method was being used. When comparing the subjective rating on two teaching methods between two sequences, sequence A students rated traditional lecture significantly better than sequence B students did in regards to satisfaction (p = 0.0003), clarity (p = 0.002), understanding (p = 0.02). About two-thirds of sequence A students preferred CEI followed by the lecture, and 43.8% of the sequence B students preferred the lecture followed by CEI
   In conclusion, when CLT was taught once, CEI and traditional lecture were equivalent in terms of the test score (posttest') and teaching time. When CLT was taught twice, traditional lecture had a higher average test score than CEI. Preview effect of CEI in CLT was suggested because of higher difference in test score in sequence A than sequence B. and better subjective rating of traditional lecture in sequence A than in sequence B.

AB A marked increase in the number of computer programs for computer-assisted instruction in the medical sciences has occurred over the past 10 years. The quality of both the programs and the literature that describe these programs has varied considerably. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the published literature that described computer-assisted instruction in medical education and to assess the quality of evidence for its implementation, with particular emphasis on obstetrics and gynecology.
   STUDY DESIGN: Reports published between 1988 and 2000 on computer-assisted instruction in medical education were identified through a search of MEDLINE and Educational Resource Identification Center and a review of the bibliographies of the articles that were identified. Studies were selected if they included a description of computer-assisted instruction in medical education, regardless of the type of computer program. Data were extracted with a content analysis of 210 reports. The reports were categorized according to study design (comparative, prospective, descriptive, review, or editorial), type of computer-assisted instruction, medical specialty, and measures of effectiveness.
   RESULTS: Computer-assisted instruction programs included online technologies, CD-ROMs, video laser disks, multimedia work stations, virtual reality, and simulation testing. Studies were identified in all medical specialties, with a preponderance in internal medicine, general surgery, radiology, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, and pathology. Ninety-six percent of the articles described a favorable impact of computer-assisted instruction in medical education, regardless of the quality of the evidence. Of the 210 reports that were identified, 60% were noncomparative, descriptive. reports of new techniques in computer-assisted instruction, and 15% and 14% were reviews and editorials, respectively, of existing technology. Eleven percent of studies were comparative and included some form of assessment of the effectiveness of the computer program. These assessments included pre- and posttesting and questionnaires to score program quality, perceptions of the medical students and/or residents regarding the program, and impact on learning. In one half of these comparative studies, computer-assisted instruction was compared with traditional modes of teaching, such as text and lectures. Six studies compared performance before and after the computer-assisted instruction. Improvements were shown in 5 of the studies. In the remainder of the studies, computer-assisted instruction appeared to result in similar test performance. Despite study design or outcome, most articles described enthusiastic endorsement of the programs by the participants, including medical students, residents, and practicing physicians. Only 1 study included cost analysis. Thirteen of the articles were in obstetrics and gynecology.
   CONCLUSION: Compute in assisted instruction has assumed to have an increasing role in medical education. In spite of enthusiastic endorsement and continued improvements in software, few studies of good design clearly demonstrate improvement in medical education over traditional modalities. There are no comparative studies in obstetrics and gynecology that demonstrate a clear-cut advantage. Future studies of computer-assisted instruction that include comparisons and cost assessments to gauge their effectiveness over traditional methods may better define their precise role.

AB Interactive media referent to interactive computer graphics and advanced information visualization technologies (AIVT) have supported researchers' investigation about how stimulating individuals' cognition and learning skills through using bi-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) digital environments and simulations at higher education. On the other hand, there have been educational challenges such as how to introducing to and encouraging students to learn and use AIVT for understanding sciences concepts at k-12 education levels. And throughout these actions stimulating and amplifying individuals' cognitive, learning and technical skills across and related to researching, reading, writing, producing and visualizing 2D and 3D digital content through applying accessible web-based interfaces and technologies. This use case has addressed these educational challenges through an analysis of a human computer interaction (HCI) and beyond referent to a three hours interactive and exploratory learning by doing and transdisciplinar thinking workshop at k-12 education level supported by an accessible Web3D based AIVT, called X3DOm framework. X3Dom multimedia features, plus the possibility of integrating them in a blog created during the workshop, allowed individuals using this AIVT framework as a learning, teaching and reflective tool. This through applying a combination of web-based scripting languages, computer programming techniques, diverse school curricula's scientific concepts, computer graphics, a personal computer, a smartphone, 2D and 3D web-based interfaces, a low cost text editor and a image editor programs, a sheet of paper used for drawing and making calculations, an internet connection, web browsers, and interactive 3D information visualizations. This paper presents a qualitative analysis of the mentioned workshop within a transdisciplinar view. The analysis has support of the distributed cognition approach, including an integration of ethnographic and action research data collection techniques such as field study, participatory observation and still images gathered in a natural environment. In addition, a conceptual interactive interdisciplinary knowledge based learning framework that encompasses a combination among distributed cognition, immersive education, constructionism, transdisciplinarity and the field of digital humanities (DH) features has sustained this empirical use case implementation and analysis. Similar to aims and achievements in a related work, in terms of stimulating individuals' cognitive and learning aspects based on using a combination of HCI, 3D digital spaces and techniques as well as scientific knowledge. This analysis of the use case has indicated an inclusive potential for employing accessible Web3D based AIVT, such as the X3Dom framework, to producing digital content based on learning and applying curricula's scientific concepts such as math, geometry, arts, languages and information technology in real time, since k12 levels. This interactive learning/teaching approach can and has been an effective way for subjects acquiring information and enhancing understanding during the learning by doing and transdisciplinar thinking processes. These processes can and have encouraged critical thinking and problem-solving, recalled and/or enhanced individuals' digital literacy performance and cognitive skills such as attention, spatial thinking, reading, writing, communicating and researching abilities.

AB Fast paced transformations in Engineering Technology (ET) area require new and enhanced learning and teaching strategies in engineering technology education. More than ever, the educational advance is leaning towards meeting the demands of industrial world. Engineering Technology curricula needs to adjust to novel technologies by enabling students to acquire meaningful and relevant practices. Laboratory activities should be incorporated into dry-lectured courses, being vital to ET programs, since they are ultimately enhancing the understanding process, leading towards developing experience-led engineering technology degree. Laboratory activities are the main promoters of creativity and critical thinking, a place where students develop, practice and improve the required skills, and a place where theory meets the real-like scenarios.
   One way to lead the students to become creative and innovative is building a systematic approach of the knowledge to be conveyed during class time by combining laboratory activities with a well-structured in class lecture. Based on this perspective, we developed a series of experimental activities to complement the existent lecture material. While most of engineering or ET programs offer different classes for the theoretical and experimental approach in teaching mechanics courses, our approach is to combine the two of them in one course. During laboratory activities, students are fully involved in creating and analyzing the experiments based on prior knowledge gained from previous courses as well as in class lectures (delivered prior to each lab activity and closely linked to each lab activity). In this way the student has the opportunity of becoming an active learner and applying what he learned in lectures. The main purpose of this paper is to describe the efforts of developing the lecture/experimental activity package and also the preliminary results of beta-testing of this package. Upon successful implementation, the newly improved course will be offered starting next AY 2012-2013. The efforts of building a new laboratory for mechanical experiments will also be described.
   We propose several mechanical experiments such as: tensile test: a metal bar (tensile specimen) is loaded in longitudinal tension; elastic behavior of metal in torsion: strains are measured on the surface of a metal tube or solid shaft loaded in pure torsion; elastic-plastic behavior of a simply supported beam. The objectives of the experimental activities are to correlate theory with practical approaches and to enable students to better understand the applications of theoretical concepts presented (i.e. strain and shear stress, Young's Modulus etc.). Students will observe, and analyze several phenomena such as the bar's behavior to fracture and the material's stiffness, strength and ductility, they will use load deflection data to measure of Young's modulus, the tensile stress at yield and ultimate load carrying capacity of the beam. All these experiments will be also enhanced by modern simulation software and data acquisition hardware that will generate real-like industrial scenarios. Therefore, student will gain a broader perspective over the subject taught with a more in-depth understanding, enabling them to use this knowledge in other courses such as manufacturing, dynamics, quality control, sensors and measurements etc. In this way, the course gains multi-and interdisciplinary character, enabling students to acquire necessary skills in developing their future projects including "Senior Design".

AB The aim of this work is to give a brief account of an ongoing work at the University of Porto (U. Porto) which aims to promote and disseminate the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) inside all the educational activities and also encourage the development and use of innovational services.
   Based on this innovation goal through its unit for New Technologies in Education (NTE) the University adopted in 2003 a pilot-project to develop pedagogical contents for Learning Management System (LMS). The main idea was to complement face-to-face classes with a online teaching/learning component - in this paper the online courses should intended a blended-learning support for presential courses. The most important and more common pedagogical support gave by the office to those teachers interested in blended-learning methodology are the personal work meetings with them, usually followed by presentations of the platform to the students on their first presential class. After a few years with more than 774 online courses the NTE office, composed of a multidisciplinary team of eight persons, gives not only technical and pedagogical support to the academic community that is using the institutional e-learning platform - Moodle U.PORTO - but also makes available other services, encourages and supports their use.
   Despite all the obstacles inherent in the implementation of a Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) strategy in a traditional and large university like U. Porto, the office is engaged in supporting e-assessment. Although the online assessments that have been taking place are individual experiences, they are of major importance since they allow the identification of problems and definition of the necessary improvements. All the online assessments have been performed in Moodle.
   Aware of the importance of e-contents as a way to enhance students' knowledge the office provides a service of educational multimedia objects development for teachers that have online courses. The objects are developed by a small sub-team and the most common types of multimedia contents requested are videos sessions, animations, graphic works, and some simulations.
   A free of charge videoconference studio and a telepresence room, both managed by NTE, are also available to the academic community. The persons from the office who are responsible for those infrastructures also provide technical support for Educast - software for web broadcast - and Colibri - software that allows web conference. In the last few years the office have presented and is trying motivate more discussion on pedagogical issues like digital accessibility or the viability of e-portfolios as an instrument to meet the changing needs of teaching and learning. So to improve the knowledge and performance of teachers and students in ICT issues - and therefore promote the NTE services described above - the office has conducted continuing education courses, workshops and small events some of them with guest speakers experts in areas such as comparative judgment assessment, e-assessment or electronic portfolios.
   The feedback obtained over the years has shown that the existence of an office that works so closely to the academic community facilitates not only the implementation of projects like these but also allows create foundations for more innovation.

TI Understanding when students are active-in-thinking through
   modeling-in-context
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID AUTOTUTOR
AB Learning-in-action depends on interactions with learning content, peers and real world problems. However, effective learning-in-action also depends on the extent to which students are active-in-thinking, making meaning of their learning experience. A critical component of any technology to support active thinking is the ability to ascertain whether (or to what extent) students have succeeded in internalizing the disciplinary strategies, norms of thinking, discourse practices and habits of mind that characterize deep understanding in a domain. This presents what we call a dilemma of modeling-in-context: teachers routinely analyze this kind of thinking for small numbers of students in activities they create or customize for the needs of their students; however, doing so at scale and in real-time requires some automated processes for modeling student work. Current techniques for developing models that reflect specific pedagogical activities and learning objectives that a teacher might create require either more expertise or more time than teachers have. In this paper, we examine a theoretical approach to addressing the problem of modeling active thinking in its pedagogical context that uses teacher-created rubrics to generate models of student work. The results of this examination show how appropriately constructed learning technologies can enable teachers to develop custom automated rubrics for modeling active thinking and meaning-making from the records of students' dialogic work. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Many immersive educational technologies, such as digital games and simulations, enable students to take consequential action in a realistic context and to interact with peers, mentors and pedagogical agents. Such technologies help students to be active-in-thinking: engaging deeply with, reflecting on and otherwise making meaning of their learning experience. There are now many immersive educational technologies with integrated authoring tools that enable teachers to customize the learning experience with relative ease, reducing barriers to adoption and improving student learning. Educational technologies that support learning-in-action typically contain student models that operate in real-time to control the behavior of pedagogical agents, deliver just-in-time interventions, select an appropriate content or otherwise measure and promote active thinking, but these student models may not work appropriately if teachers customize the learning experience. Much as there are authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the curriculum of a given learning technology, there is a need for authoring tools that allow teachers to customize the associated student models as well. What this paper adds This paper presents a novel, rubric-based approach to develop automated student models for new activities that teachers develop in digital learning environments that promote active thinking. Our approach combines machine learning techniques with teacher expertise, allowing teachers to participate in the design of automated student models of active thinking that with further development could be scaled by leveraging their skills in rubric development. Our results show that a rubric-based approach can outperform a machine learning approach in this context. More importantly, in some cases, the rubric-based approach can produce reliable automated models based on the information that a teacher can easily provide.
   Implications for practice and/or policy If integrated into authoring tools, the rubric-based approach could allow teachers to participate in the design of automated models for educational technologies customized to their instructional needs. Through this design process, teachers could develop a better understanding of how the automated modeling system works, which in turn could increase the adoption of educational technologies that promote active thinking. Because the rubric-based approach enables teachers to identify key connections among concepts relevant to the pedagogical context, rather than general concepts or linguistic features, it is more likely to facilitate targeted feedback to help promote the development of active thinking.

AB There are limited opportunities for undergraduate nursing students to take part in hands-on critical care. A course was developed to expose students to the critically ill patient in the intensive care unit environment and introduce skills that students may not have the opportunity to engage in during their clinical hours. Led by two faculty currently practicing in critical care, this course used multiple learning modalities, including high-fidelity simulation; didactic teaching; online discussion; and narrative, reflective writing, to teach critical care concepts and entry-level skills.

AB Educational simulations often require players to maintain a high degree of engagement for play in the simulation to continue. Student motivation and engagement is tied to affective factors, such as interest and self-efficacy. As such, game designs and teachers who implement them should promote student interest and self-efficacy in play. In this study, a responsive online professional development (ROPD) program was provided to teachers as they implemented a multi-classroom socio-scientific simulation game for middle school social studies classrooms called GlobalEd 2. A series of ANOVAs revealed that student affect toward the game and its content, including student interest and self-efficacy, was highest when their teachers likewise had a high degree of participation in the ROPD program. This evidence demonstrates the importance that ongoing implementation supports can have in classroom-based simulations and serious games and the benefits of ROPD in furthering the impact of simulation games.

AB Through historically perceived as an ethnically homogenous country, rapid demographic changes in the Republic of Korea have resulted in increasing diversity. However, current multicultural education programs struggle to promote acceptance and appreciation of this diversity. This paper details one pedagogical activity, a racial discrimination simulation activity designed to allow learners to experience discrimination to critically reflect on more subtle forms of oppression in society and classroom contexts. The activity was implemented in a graduate school teacher education program in Korea with 55 learners over a 4-year period. Pre-participation surveys, classroom discussions, blog postings, and reflections were analyzed using grounded theory to investigate learner reactions. Learners reported a strong disconnect between race and Korea and classrooms in Korea. Based on findings, immediate attention is necessary in teacher education programs to prepare teachers to talk about race and diversity in classrooms and confront racism in current educational contexts.

AB Are well-designed computer simulations an effective tool to support student understanding of complex concepts in chemistry when integrated into high school science classrooms? We investigated scaling up the use of a sequence of simulations of kinetic molecular theory and associated topics of diffusion, gas laws, and phase change, which we designed and experimentally tested. In the two effectiveness studies reported, one in a rural and the other in an urban context, chemistry teachers implemented two alternate versions of a curricular unitan experimental version, incorporating simulations, and a control version, using text-based materials covering the same content. Participants were 718 high school students (357 rural and 361 urban), in a total of 25 classrooms. The implementation of the simulations was explored using criteria associated with fidelity of implementation (FOI). Each context provided insights into the role of FOI in affecting the effectiveness of the interventions when working with groups of teachers. Results supported the effectiveness of this sequence of simulations as a teaching tool in a classroom context, and confirmed the importance of FOI factors such as adherence and exposure in determining the specific environments in which these materials were most effective.

AB Simulation and modeling activities, a key point of computational thinking, are currently not being integrated into the science classroom. This paper describes a new visual programming tool entitled the Simulation Creation Toolkit. The Simulation Creation Toolkit is a high level pattern-based phenomenological approach to bringing rapid simulation creation into the classroom environment. Students create agent-based simulations via analogy between the real world phenomena they are trying to represent and "interacticons," which are visual animations of generic agents enacting the phenomena. This approach obviates the need for students to implement low level and often time-consuming agent behavior programming and yet, requires the use of abstraction, which is a key component of computational thinking. Initial data shows that students in the classroom can implement simulations faster using the Simulation Creation Toolkit as compared to the end-user programming level and begins to show that students can use the Simulation Creation Toolkit to create simulations through analogical reasoning. In this sense, Simulation Creation toolkit provides an initial data point into the integration of Computational Thinking activities through simulation construction in the classroom environment.

AB This study investigates student interactions with simulations, and teacher support of those interactions, within naturalistic high school classroom settings. Two lesson sequences were conducted, one in 11 and one in 8 physics class sections, where roughly half the sections used the simulations in a small group format and matched sections used them in a whole class format. Unexpected pre/post results, previously reported, had raised questions about why whole class students, who had engaged in discussion about the simulations while observing them projected in front of the class, had performed just as well as small group students with hands-on keyboards. The present study addresses these earlier results with case studies (four matched sets of classes) of student and teacher activity during class discussions in one of the lesson sequences. Comparative analyses using classroom videotapes and student written work reveal little evidence for an advantage for the small group students for any of the conceptual and perceptual factors examined; in fact, if anything, there was a slight trend in favor of students in the whole class condition. We infer that the two formats have counter-balancing strengths and weaknesses. We recommend a mixture of the two and suggest several implications for design of instructional simulations.

AB We studied the use of a digital planetarium for teaching relative distances and sizes in introductory undergraduate astronomy classes. Inspired in part by the classic short film The Powers of Ten and large physical scale models of the Solar System that can be explored on foot, we created lectures using virtual versions of these two pedagogical approaches for classes that saw either an immersive treatment in the planetarium or a non-immersive version in the regular classroom (with N = 973 students participating in total). Students who visited the planetarium had not only the greatest learning gains, but their performance increased with time, whereas students who saw the same visuals projected onto a flat display in their classroom showed less retention over time. The gains seen in the students who visited the planetarium reveal that this medium is a powerful tool for visualizing scale over multiple orders of magnitude. However the modest gains for the students in the regular classroom also show the utility of these visualization approaches for the broader category of classroom physics simulations.

AB Classroomteaching can be considered as structurally equivalent to complex problem solving. In a given situation, a person faces multiple challenges on different levels, is exposed to a variety of factors, and needs to make behavioral choices with competing short-term and long-term effects. In addition, situational emotions have an impact on the quality of both information processing and decision making. Simulation games try to instantiate real life problems as authentically as possible and allow learners to experience and to reflect on the complexity of a task, and to explore behavioral options and their effects. This study investigates learning effects through participation in this simulation game. N=32 participants responded to vignettes from everyday school life before the simulation game and after. Results indicate that participants used significantly less punitive behavior (threat, punishment, degradation) after the simulation game experience than before and in contrast to the control group. If further studies support the effects of our simulation game, a regular implementation of simulation games in student teachers' education should be discussed.

AB Exciting medical imaging technologies widely applicable to both clinical and basic science research have emerged over the last two decades and are crucially important to the biomedical engineering field. For undergraduate students, however, the "classroom-only" teaching style suffers from many limitations that make it difficult for students to gain a complete understanding of a particular system. In this university, we modified our existing medical imaging curriculum by associating a series of courses with research and clinical laboratories and formed an inherent medical imaging teaching program. We see that this program promotes students' interest to the subjects they are learning and enhances their understanding to medical imaging systems and applications.

AB Experimental learning plays paramount role in Physics education. Experimental physics requires phenomenological investigations in several cases and this includes understanding visible and invisible heuristic procedures to discern underlying concepts. This study investigates the invisible yet evident occurrences of physical phenomena that are difficult to grasp from a learner's perspective. In this work the contribution of compounded effects of using computational techniques, multimedia enhanced simulations and interactive animations to draw the learner's attention to those physically undiscernable aspects of physics experiments is presented. The study has investigated three physics experiments by engineering students (N=42) and the methodology focused on differentiating the learning outcomes between classroom teaching, laboratory experimentation and virtual laboratories. The students were divided into two batches. Visual and conceptual understanding was quantified by assessments that included their visual and conceptual understanding. Our study not only revealed severe limitations in learning invisible phenomena based on traditional classroom methods but also empirically validated the positive impact on learning outcomes when the classroom method is combined with Virtual Labs approach.

AB This study explored teachers' pedagogical strategies for using multimedia simulation to structure and support secondary science teaching. Expertise was investigated across a range of classroom settings to analyse how specialist knowledge is situated within and adapted to the teaching and learning context. Analysis of data arising from 10 lesson observations and post-lesson interviews with five teachers and their pupils highlighted significant variation in pedagogical approaches shaping simulation use in three topic areas. Two contrasting case studies involving a "terminal velocity" simulation exemplify this: one was characterized by some "dialogic" whole class interaction and collaborative testing of pupils' own ideas; the other by a more typical, more authoritative, discourse with pupil pairs. Over-structuring of tasks and curricular constraints meant that the rhetoric in the literature and teachers' aspirations concerning pupil experimentation balanced with structured tasks were not borne out. Implications for mode of use and the design of technology-integrated activity are discussed.

AB We report on a case study that took place in a southwestern culturally and linguistically diverse urban high school science classroom during a grade recovery summer session. The introduction of a technology-infused unit on epidemiology engaged students in a multi-contextual exploration of the spread of diseases. The analysis of the resultant classroom discourse centers on connections made and identities expressed by the students (as students, social beings, avatars, and scientists), with particular attention to how these students use language to bridge worlds (the participatory simulation world, the classroom world, the 'real' world (outside the classroom), and the laboratory (science) world). The results indicate that including a participatory technology tool supported students' learning journey. Specifically, students built on a shared virtual experience in ways that helped them to draw and expand on prior experiences well beyond the classroom in the service of developing science understanding.

AB This article reports on the collaboration of six states to study how simulation-based science assessments can become transformative components of multi-level, balanced state science assessment systems. The project studied the psychometric quality, feasibility, and utility of simulation-based science assessments designed to serve formative purposes during a unit and to provide summative evidence of end-of-unit proficiencies. The frameworks of evidence-centered assessment design and model-based learning shaped the specifications for the assessments. The simulations provided the three most common forms of accommodations in state testing programs: audio recording of text, screen magnification, and support for extended time. The SimScientists program at WestEd developed simulation-based, curriculum-embedded, and unit benchmark assessments for two middle school topics, Ecosystems and Force & Motion. These were field-tested in three states. Data included student characteristics, responses to the assessments, cognitive labs, classroom observations, and teacher surveys and interviews. UCLA CRESST conducted an evaluation of the implementation. Feasibility and utility were examined in classroom observations, teacher surveys and interviews, and by the six-state Design Panel. Technical quality data included AAAS reviews of the items' alignment with standards and quality of the science, cognitive labs, and assessment data. Student data were analyzed using multidimensional Item Response Theory (IRT) methods. IRT analyses demonstrated the high psychometric quality (reliability and validity) of the assessments and their discrimination between content knowledge and inquiry practices. Students performed better on the interactive, simulation-based assessments than on the static, conventional items in the posttest. Importantly, gaps between performance of the general population and English language learners and students with disabilities were considerably smaller on the simulation-based assessments than on the posttests. The Design Panel participated in development of two models for integrating science simulations into a balanced state science assessment system. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Researchers, evaluators, and practitioners need tools to distinguish between applications of technology that support, enhance, and transform classroom instruction and those that are ineffective or even deleterious. Here we present a new classroom observation protocol designed specifically to capture the quality of technology use to support science inquiry in high school science classrooms. We iteratively developed and piloted the Technology Observation Protocol for Science (TOP-Science), building directly on our published framework for quality technology integration. Development included determining content and face validity, as well as the calculation of reliability estimates across a broad range of high school science classrooms. The resulting protocol focuses on the integration of technology in classrooms on three dimensions: science and engineering practices, student-centered teaching, and contextualization. It uses both quantitative coding and written descriptions of evidence for each code; both are synthesized in a multi-dimensional measure of quality. Data are collected and evaluated from the perspective of the teacher's intentions, actions, and reflections on these actions. This protocol fills an important gap in understanding technology's role in teaching and learning by doing more than monitoring technology's presence or absence, and considering its integration in the context of the Next Generation Science Standards science and engineering practices. Its applications include research, evaluation, and potentially peer evaluation.

AB This paper explores the effectiveness of interactive simulation for teaching a selected complex subject, Ecology, in higher education. Specifically, we carry out a lab intervention using interactive agent based simulation, to teach the complex concept of spatially-explicit predator prey interaction to undergraduate students of an advanced module: BIOU9CE (Community Ecology & Conservation Applications) at the University of Stirling. We propose use of Netlogo, an interactive agent-based simulation tool, and evaluate its effectiveness for learning and teaching of interactive simulation developed specifically for the classroom, compared with an existing, less interactive, simulation tool (R).

AB The purpose of this study is to figure out the views of pre-service teachers on the usability of three-dimensional simulation-based teacher training simulations. For this purpose, the opinions of pre-service teachers regarding the use of three-dimensional teacher training simulation called "SimInClass" were taken. The participants were 39 university students in their junior years who had taken "Classroom Management", "Instructional Design" and multi-user virtual-environment design courses from a state university, from the Faculty of Education, Department of Computer Education and Instructional Technology (CEIT), in Ankara, Turkey. The pre-service teachers used simulations in a computer lab. In the orientation of the students, they used "Start Tutorial" part of the simulation for 10 minutes, and then they experienced the teacher training simulation as "teachers" for 60 minutes. After the implementation, data were collected via an online questionnaire, which was developed by the researchers. In addition, evaluation records which measure the level of knowledge and concentration of the class of the simulation were used, as well. According to this, it was observed that the teacher training simulation is easy to use and offers an opportunity to experience a real classroom environment. Moreover, candidate teachers expressed an increase in their awareness about situations such as preparation of lesson plan, classroom management, time management, and classroom control according to the number of students and strategy development for undesirable behaviors. It is therefore stated that "SimInClass" can be used as an auxiliary tool in the professional development process. However, it is noted that the interaction between the teacher and the student in simulations is limited; the feedbacks are insufficient and flow quickly from the screen, making it difficult to read the feedbacks. In addition, students also reported that the sound effects are insufficient and the simulation slows down the computer when it is used at a high resolution.

TI STELLA - SIMULATION SOFTWARE FOR THE PHARMACOKINETICS CLASSROOM
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION
LA English
DT Note
AB The application of the STELLA simulation software to teaching pharmacokinetic principles in the classroom is described.  A Macintosh computer and liquid crystal projection pad for overhead projection permits viewing of the simulations by an entire class.  The simulations run in real time rather than being static displays.  The example used to illustrate STELLA is a one-compartment model with first order absorption and an pharmacologic response that is related to  the plasma concentration using the sigmoid E(max) model.  The influence of absorption rate differences on the plasma concentration-time and effect-time profiles is demonstrated.  Multiple plots can be displayed simultaneously to show the effects of changing a model parameter.  The plots can be stopped and started during their simulation for discussion.

AB Students' emotional engagement in classrooms has always been regarded as a crucial factor influencing educational outcomes. Emotionally-engaged students are highly motivated to attend classes and participate actively in discussions. Conversely, emotionally-disengaged students are habitual truants and/or often misbehave in classrooms. It is time consuming to conduct research using traditional methods such as data collection or questionnaire. Furthermore, as these experiments are conducted on humans, limited settings can be organized and difficult to control/monitor. Therefore, in this paper, we present our work in-progress addressing to the problem. We propose a conceptual emotionbased model that is animated by an agent-based social simulator. The rudimentary theory of this proposal is based on three main elements; the engagement level of students, the emotional state of a lecturer and the emotional state of students in a classroom.

AB Can Flipped Classroom or Flipped Learning strategy be applied with different teaching methodologies? Can these methodologies be used simultaneously through the whole semester? Many authors have found that students are usually more receptive to a certain type of methodological strategy rather than another. This involves thinking of the choice of the appropriate method. In addition, once the method evaluation procedure is carried out, it is possible to think about whether students with lower grades would obtain higher grades when applying another pedagogical model. The scientific literature also shows that motivation is a primary factor in teaching-learning processes. So what is the most appropriate technique for not demotivating students in the classroom? If students have different learning styles, it is evident that the best results will be given in those cases where teaching method and learning style coincide. This turns into an increase in the teaching-learning efficiency.
   Then, is it possible to adapt the teaching to the different learning styles of students? In this case, how do you guide their assessment? This document provides different educational solutions. At the same time presents the advantages and disadvantages from the viewpoint of its implementation in the classroom. It is a certainty that the use of a methodological mix within the Flipped Classroom approach may be the appropriate strategy. This results in an increase in the teacher-student and the student-student interaction. The motivation factor of students is also increased. In addition, the use of these teaching strategies simultaneously allows developing multiple competences, abilities and transversal skills within the degrees, encouraging the student's complete development.
   This paper presents an interdisciplinary experience of applying several teaching methodologies (Problem-based Learning, Case-Method, Simulation-based Learning, Role- Playing, Puzzle-based Learning, Game-based Learning, Blended Learning, etc.) in different university degrees (Engineering, Optics and Optometry, Medicine and Veterinary Science). All subjects are based on the Flipped Classroom teaching approach. The incorporation of these techniques in the classroom is usually simple. The obtained results show a remarkable improvement over the last years. The benefits of the method allow obtaining conclusions and answers to the series of questions developed. At the same time, it allows thinking on the success of the Flipped pedagogical model.
   Many authors have cited the relevance of ICT in the Flipped Classroom teaching approach, pointing out its influence on student learning. Today the mobile phone is the main information processing device and every student carry one. Today nobody argues the fact that the introduction of ICT in teaching has brought many benefits and advantages in education, making learning easier for students and improving their efficiency. There are several free online tools (Socrative, Kahoot, EDpuzzle, PlayPosit, Google Apps for Education, Rubrics, QR Codes, etc.) that, whatever the context treated, can be applied in the classroom or outside it regardless of the methodological technique used. All these tools and technological applications must be at the service of the teaching goals that arise in each moment.

TI Classroom orchestration of computer simulations for science and
   engineering learning: a multiple-case study approach
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
ID DESIGN
AB This multiple case study focused on the implementation of a computer-aided design (CAD) simulation to help students engage in engineering design to learn science concepts. Our findings describe three case studies that adopted the same learning design and adapted it to three different populations, settings, and classroom contexts: at the middle-school, high-school, and pre-service teaching levels. Although the classroom orchestration of the particular learning design was customised for specific audiences and contexts, findings from this study suggest that the core components of the learning design, such as content, assessment, and pedagogy, and their alignment among them, resulted in students' learning. Specifically, results from a pre-post science assessment suggest that the three student groups arrived at similar understanding post-intervention levels, along with a significant aggregate growth in their scientific understanding. Regarding design performance, students in different groups demonstrated different levels of success in meeting design constraints. The findings also suggest that students' success rate in meeting the design constraints directly influenced their final design performance, where middle-school students had better performance than students in the other groups. That is, across the board, students increased their conceptual understanding of heat transfer, Earth, and solar science and were able to produce feasible designs. Implications of the study include how learning experiences with engineering and science simulations should be designed so that teachers can adopt and adapt materials for their specific audiences, contexts, and settings.

AB While technology for training in the simulation field has had a long history in medicine and the military, the application of emerging and innovative technologies in teacher preparation and education has been limited. TLE TeachLive (TM) (Teaching Learning Environment, Teaching in a Virtual Environment) is an innovative mixed-reality environment (the blending of real and synthetic content) where prospective teachers can interact with a group of virtual students. In the mixed-reality environment, novice teachers enter a virtual setting designed to replicate a middle-school classroom to work with classroom students who are virtual avatars. The purpose of the simulated teaching environment of TLE TeachLive (TM) is to allow pre-service teachers to improve their skills with virtual students, providing a more ethical approach to learning the art of teaching. This paper provides the results of a study of pre-service teachers' implementation of differential reinforcement of incompatible behavior (DRI) in a simulated classroom. The research design for this study was a multi-element brief experimental design with six pre-service participants and four student avatar participants. Results indicated that the majority of participants evidenced an increase in the use of these strategies to enhance student engagement in a simulated environment. The simulated environment focuses on pre-service teachers clearly understanding behavior, diversity, and effective instruction, while providing a safety net under the novice teacher and protecting actual children from potential harm resulting from improper strategy use in a real classroom setting. Simulated teaching environments have the potential to create more and better experiential practica for pre-service teachers.

AB The two separate projects described have examined how teachers exploit computer-based technologies in supporting learning of science at secondary level. This paper examines how pedagogical approaches associated with these technological tools are adapted to both the cognitive and structuring resources available in the classroom setting. Four teachers participated in the first study, undertaken as part of the InterActive Education project in Bristol; all of them used multimedia simulations in their lessons. The second study presented was part of the wider SET-IT project in Cambridge; 11 teachers in eight schools were observed using multimedia simulations, data logging tools and interactive whiteboards. Teachers were interviewed in all cases to elicit their pedagogical thinking about their classroom use of ICT.
   The findings suggest that teachers are moving away from only using 'real' experiments in their practice. They are exploring the use of technologies to encourage students to engage in "What If" explorations where the outcomes of 'virtual' experiments can be immediately accessed, for example through using a simulation. However, this type of activity can serve just as a mechanism for revealing - and indeed reinforcing students' informal conceptions if cognitive conflict is not generated or remains unresolved. The teachers in our studies used simulations, data logging, projected animations and other dynamic digital resources as tools to encourage and support prediction and to demonstrate scientific concepts and physical processes - thereby 'bridging the gap' between scientific and informal knowledge. They also integrated technology carefully with other practical activities so as to support stepwise knowledge building, consolidation and application.
   Research of this kind has design implications for both curriculum-related activities and emerging computer-based learning technologies, in terms of helping us to understand how teachers capitalise upon the technology available in supporting students to construct links between scientific theory and empirical evidence.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the use of a simulator for teaching programming to foster student engagement and meaningful learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - An exploratory mixed-method research approach was adopted in a classroom-based environment at a UK university. A rich account of student engagement dimensions (behavioural, affective/emotional, and cognitive) was captured through descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. This was triangulated through reflective and in-depth validation of open-ended questions.
   Findings - Results show higher behavioural and emotional engagement in simulator-based sessions, but relatively low cognitive engagement when compared with traditional programming sessions. A strong interweaving relationship between these three dimensions is evident in both the traditional and simulator approaches. Therefore, a balanced distribution of the dimensions is recommended for effective planning and delivery of programming sessions.
   Research limitations/implications - Student engagement is multidimensional as it includes various internal and external/ecological factors. This study did not consider external factors, such as family and societal influence; it focused on the classroom-based environment.
   Originality/value - This study critically examined the use of simulation as a means to foster student engagement in programming sessions. Findings suggest that a balanced activities within the three engagement dimensions can facilitate meaningful learning.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of a virtual reality (VR) classroom experience for improving the capacity of instructional leaders. Specifically, school leaders used VR to build their classroom observation and analysis skills to prepare to have more effective post-observation conversations with teachers. The authors provide insights from multiple data points that highlight the affordances of the virtual setting for improving classroom observation skills. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the application of simulations to practice classroom observations, the authors developed a VR experience in which participants tag observable elements of academic discourse using codes from two observation protocols. The protocols identify elements of equitable student access: how teachers call on students and how they design questions. Seventy-five school leaders used the VR platform to observe a classroom scenario and code evidence of equitable classroom access. The authors analyzed data from tagging in the virtual reality scenario and triangulated these data with survey data focused on observation practices from participants' schools. A reflection component is included on the platform to collect these qualitative data. Findings The study results indicate that the virtual reality platform provides an innovative process for leadership professional development focused on building school leaders' capacity to identify elements of academic discourse during classroom observations. Participants reported that the opportunity to practice classroom observations in a risk-free environment was useful. However, for school leaders to fully transfer the data to using in conversations with teachers, they benefit from leadership coaching. Originality/value This study ascertains the potential effectiveness of an advanced technology for enhancing instructional leadership by using evidence-based classrooms observations to drive improvements in teaching practice. Beyond the utility of the virtual reality tool, this study provides a proof of concept for the next generation of instructional leadership through teacher observations with augmented reality.

AB The ubiquity of computers and its rapid technological development in the form of computer games has provide an alternative media to build student's interest in history by providing players with intriguing facts presented as a narrative merged within the gameplay. It engages student with imaginative virtual world as well as the simulation of real-world environments and hypothetical situations. However its use in classroom is limited, as the method use is not ideal within the available time-frame of a formal education system. Within this constraint, computer game as a learning tool could only be applied beyond the classroom. Although not ideal if meant as an inseparable part of a learning module, it still provides a valuable contribution to the whole system by coaxing student to voluntarily add their allocation of study time through the act of multitasking (learning while playing), not to mention also increasing their interest in the learned topics.
   A virtual reconstruction of the kingdom visual environment based on archaeological study will provide student with a more scientifically accurate representation of Majapahit. Providing a valid references for studying through the act of observing. The gameplay will provide students with scenarios based on real historical events, enabling them to interactively learn through experimenting with possible actions to solve a problem, analyzing the resulting outcome and founding the relationship between cause, action and outcome. The game will increase student knowledge beyond the classroom, providing more quality time for a teacher and students discussion of the topic's meaning and its significance for modern day Indonesia.

AB The objective of the present work was to implement a teaching system useful in modeling and simulation of biotechnological processes. The interactive system is based on applications developed using 20-sim modeling and simulation software environment. A procedure for the simulation of bioprocesses modeled by bond graphs is proposed and simulators containing biochemical bond graph elements are designed. These simulators are organized in libraries that exploit the modularity of the method, very useful for master students, who will be able to model and simulate complex bioprocesses. In order to evaluate the learning performance of this teaching system, an analysis was performed using a pre-test/post-test scenario, with a multiple-choice knowledge test.

AB The present article discusses the design and impact of computer-based visualization tools for supporting student learning and representational competence in science. Specifically, learning outcomes and student representation use are compared between eight secondary classrooms utilizing The Connected Chemistry Curriculum and eight secondary chemistry using lecture-based methods. Results from the quasi-experimental intervention indicate that the curriculum and accompanying visualization tool yield only small to modest gains in student achievement on summative assessments. Analysis of student representation use on pre- and post-assessments, however, indicate the students in Connected Chemistry classrooms are significantly more likely to use submicroscopic representations of chemical systems that are consistent with teacher and expert representation use. The affordances of visualization tools in inquiry activities to improve students' representational competence and conceptual understanding of content in the science classroom are discussed.

AB This study explored how learning in a simulation environment with a single representation compares to learning with concreteness fading in the domain of electric circuits in secondary school. Concreteness fading, an instructional technique where representations change from concrete to more abstract during a learning sequence, has been proposed as an approach to combine the strengths of each representation and to promote transfer, but the empirical evidence is not unequivocal. One reason may be that defining "concrete" and "abstract" for the purpose of concreteness fading is less straightforward in practice than in theory, as illustrated in the conceptualization of concreteness fading in this study. The results showed no differences in content coverage and total learning time between conditions, but the transition between representations temporarily increased learning time in the fading condition. An analysis of the learning revealed no differences between conditions on circuits similar in appearance to the simulation environment, but the single representation resulted in better application of the learned knowledge to realistic circuits. The discussion explores the results from the perspective of concreteness fading and alternative conceptualizations of the learning environment. One of these, resulting from the difficulty in positioning computer simulations within concrete-abstract dimensions, is that computer simulations can include concrete and abstract in a single representation, which may be easier (and more effective) in classroom settings than multiple representations. This suggests that a well-designed simulation can be a reckoned alternative to concreteness fading and to multiple representations in general in science education.

AB Student teachers often struggle to keep track of everything that is happening in the classroom, and particularly to notice and respond when students cause disruptions. The complexity of the classroom environment is a potential contributing factor that has not been empirically tested. In this experimental study, we utilized a virtual reality (VR) classroom to examine whether classroom complexity affects the likelihood of student teachers noticing disruptions and how they react after noticing. Classroom complexity was operationalized as the number of disruptions and the existence of overlapping disruptions (multidimensionality) as well as the existence of parallel teaching tasks (simultaneity). Results showed that student teachers (n = 50) were less likely to notice the scripted disruptions, and also less likely to respond to the disruptions in a comprehensive and effortful manner when facing greater complexity. These results may have implications for both teacher training and the design of VR for training or research purpose. This study contributes to the field from two aspects: 1) it revealed how features of the classroom environment can affect student teachers' noticing of and reaction to disruptions; and 2) it extends the functionality of the VR environment-from a teacher training tool to a testbed of fundamental classroom processes that are difficult to manipulate in real-life.

AB In the traditional teaching of Circuit Analysis, teachers put much more emphasis on theory analysis and mathematical calculation, which may not be a proper way to arouse the study interests of students, and has less physical circuit information included. We try to imbed Multisim into the classroom teaching hours, in order to give the students more chances to observe circuits and verify circuit theories. Examples of a sinusoidal steady-state circuit, a second order circuit and a first order dynamic circuit are illustrated. We also provide a differential circuit design example. It can be seen that Multisim aided classroom teaching is more intuitionistic and effective. Deeper class teaching reform can be carried out in this direction.

AB Students engagement is a widely recognized concept that influence the achievement of outcome and learning in higher education. Studies have indicated boredom as one sign of a poor engagement in a classroom. For example, students who are bored may apply less effort and stop paying attention to their lecturer over time. Such students ultimately end up getting poor academic results, involving in many disciplinary actions and at risk of dropping out. However, many researchers study the problem of poor engagement in classrooms using traditional methods such as the questionnaire survey and setting up experiments that consume considerable time, effort and with very limited settings. Consequently, in this paper, we present our work-in-progress that addresses the problem. We propose a conceptual emotion-based student engagement model that is animated by an agent-based social simulator. The preliminary theory of this proposal is based on three main elements in a classroom; the engagement level of students, the emotional state of a lecturer and the emotional states of students.

AB Prior literature has begun to demonstrate that even young children can learn about complex systems using participatory simulations. This study disentangles the impacts of third-person perspectives (offered by traditional simulations) and first-person perspectives (offered by participatory simulations) on children's development of such systems thinking in the context of the emergent complexity of honeybee nectar foraging. Specifically, we worked with three first-grade classrooms assigned to one of three conditions-instruction through use of a first-person perspective only, third-person perspective only, and integrated instruction-to engage ideas of complex systems thinking. In each condition, systems concepts were targeted through instruction and assessment. The integrated and third-person classrooms demonstrated significant gains while the first-person classroom showed gains that were not statistically significant, suggesting that third-person perspectives play a critical role in how children learn systems thinking. This work also puts forth a novel assessment design for young children using multiple-choice questions.

AB Science simulations are popular among educators as such simulations afford for multiple visual representation and interactivity. Despite the popularity and abundance on the internet, our literature review suggested little research has been conducted on the use of simulation in elementary school. Thus, an exploratory pilot case study was conducted to address this research gap. In this study, an open source energy simulation was remixed for use in elementary school targeted at the Grade 4 & 5 students as an after-school enrichment program. We proposed 3 stages: design, customization and implementation, to provide useful insights with the aim to allow other educators to conduct their own remixed simulation lessons. The simulation design principles (e.g., learning outcomes and colour coding) with the corresponding TPACK construct that emerged from the design and customization stages were reported. Such simulation design principles would be useful to interested educators and researchers who wish to adapt and use simulation or teach others how to remix simulation. Data from the multiple sources (e.g., field observations, surveys, design notes and existing simulations) indicated that students enjoyed learning with the remixed energy simulation.

ID EDUCATION; STUDENTS; MOTIVATION
AB Neuroscience is a highly interdisciplinary field, but more collaboration among STEM disciplines is needed to advance undergraduate neuroscience education. This paper reports the development of code-based virtual laboratories to cross-foster ideas from engineering and biology in the neuroscience classroom. The simulations use a combination of NEURON and Python code to model neurophysiological processes. We report that the use of computational tools in the classroom increases student self-reported comfort in participating in a computational research project. The tools we developed have potential to increase persistence and retention of undergraduate students by encouraging interdisciplinary thinking and reducing barriers to entry.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine online learning simulations within a middle school science class and develop an understanding of the most and least successful profile combination of traits. The sample consisted of 350 middle school student taking 7th and 8th grade science in a classroom setting. Researchers examined outcomes on multiple administrations of a science content tests and affective measures. The authors examined test outcomes, affective outcomes, and profile combinations of traits using multilevel modeling, latent class analysis, and mean comparisons. Results indicated that the most successful combination of traits for using an online laboratory simulation in class is a student profile corresponding to a high allostatic load. Implications for this study also provide suggestions for understanding the mechanism of action for student success while using online laboratory simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This project brings together two lines of research-the study of complex dynamic systems and the use of participatory simulations as a powerful way into systems modeling-both of which can be enabled and advanced through emerging network technologies. The study of dynamic systems stands as a new form of literacy for all. Participatory Simulations Activities can support new forms of classroom interaction and can serve to catalyze the engagement with dynamic systems modeling as a core feature of the education of all students. To accomplish these goals, we introduce a new architecture, HubNet. HubNet is an open client-server architecture, which enables many users at the "Nodes" (currently TI graphing calculators) to control the behavior of individual objects or agents and to view the aggregated results on a central computer known as the Hub. This network of nodes is integrated with a powerful suite of modeling, analysis and display tools that together give users the capacity to "fly' the system in intuitive mode, to reflect on the emergent result of their simulation and, also, to encode their strategies as rules which the system can then run independently. The HubNet system is being used in several middle and secondary classrooms. An illustrative example of classroom use is presented.

AB Any teacher adopts a lot of decisions inside classroom to manage students' activity or engagement and the turn of events can change according those decisions. The decisions that teacher adopt in real time may vary according to his didactic intentionality, or simply with the turn of events, since classroom environment is dynamic and complex. Due to this complexity, the teacher can't always pay attention to all the events that take place. Teachers need to develop professional knowledge that will allow them to be attentive and conscious to different aspects that can draw his attention and adopt the appropriate decisions in real time, enabling them to help their students in their learning process.
   Thus, the main goal of research is to identify some structural components of a didactical decision on the context of using computer simulations (CS) in Physical science classroom and how they are related with teacher intentionality.
   The research question is: what similarities and differences are in teacher didactical decisions (from the one or different teacher)? What big patterns it is possible identify?
   This research deal with a qualitative and interpretative analyse, from two case studies involving two physical sciences teachers from secondary school in physical sciences classroom. Each teacher taught three lessons and students develop inquiry work organized into small groups. The teacher A uses the CS for replace experimental work and teacher B uses the CS as an introduction for the experimental work. The students, in both cases, need to accomplish a task in order to solve a problem.
   Several types of data was collected from each lesson (e. g. audio recording, documents from teacher or students, print screens, photos, indication of silences and gestures, explicit teacher's intentions and decisions, students' notebook, teacher notebook) to produce a multimodal narratives (MN), a tool with a clear structure and focus to organize and systematize data. The MN analysed correspond to the lessons taught by the two teachers during the use of CS available on web. Our model of data analyse is: (a) teacher take a didactical decision based on (b) information collected, (c) value judgement and (d) teacher focus of attention. This approach is based on the model of recognition-primed decision making (Klein, 2008): is a process in which there is an initial phase where it is percept and recognized the situation to then implement the decision.
   Results. There are a lot of different didactical decisions including from the same teacher. However, the four components of the model of didactical decision are easily recognized in a micro-level of didactical decision process. The didactical decision in micro-level process only is effective (change the turn of events) when the focus is students' behaviour or engagement. When the focus is students' epistemic work or mange task, in most of times, the teacher need a pack of micro decisions, linked each other, to accomplishment their didactical intentionality. The main differences between teachers appear in the structure of those packs of didactical decisions. And these differences can be related with the style of teacher's mediation or his didactical intentionality. We have evidences that if the pack of de micro decisions is longer, more aspects of the reasoning and students' work the teacher incorporate on the process of didactical decision. To study these differences can help teachers to be more dialogic in classroom.

AB E-learning development is becoming an alternative to classic education as it allows students and teachers to access to a great amount of educational information and multimedia contents. In this paper the authors present an educational application oriented to Electronics online teaching, using the support that the Internet gives by working under an e-learning environment. This environment consists on three virtual classrooms where students and teachers can make use of a real-time circuit simulation program (Simula 2000), create and access to didactic material an devaluate their knowledges by testing themselves. Its main feature is that it allows remote interaction between students and teachers through the program.

AB This study is aimed at investigating the relationships among students' relevant prior knowledge, meaningful learning orientation, reasoning ability, self-efficacy, locus of control, attitudes toward biology and achievement with the human circulatory system (HCS) using the learning cycle (LC) and the traditional classroom setting. The study was conducted with two teachers and four classes for a total of 60 11th grade students from high school. One class for each teacher was assigned as an experimental group and treated with 5E LC instruction and the other class was assigned as a control group and treated with traditional instruction (TI). The Human Circulatory System Achievement Test (HCSACT) was administered twice as a pre-test and after the treatment period, as a post-test to both the experimental and control groups. The Learning Approach Questionnaire, Test of Logical Thinking, Self-Efficacy Scale, Locus of Control Scale and Attitude toward Biology Scale were also administered to all students. The results indicated that the LC improved students' achievement in the HCSACT compared to TI. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that in the learning cycle classrooms, the main predictors of achievement on the HCSACT were students' reasoning ability (45.8%) and their prior knowledge (15.9%). In traditional classrooms, students' meaningful learning orientation (40%) and locus of control (9.8%) were the main predictors of achievement.

AB This research explores the effectiveness of using simulation as a tool for enhancing classroom learning in the Civil Engineering Department of the University of Minnesota at Twin Cities. The authors developed a modern transportation planning software package, Agent-Based Demand and Assignment Model (ADAM), that is consistent with our present understanding of travel behavior, that is platform independent, and that is easy to learn and is thus usable by students. An in-class project incorporated ADAM and the performance of this education strategy was evaluated through preclass survey, postclass survey, scores in the quiz focusing on travel demand modeling, and final scores. Results showed that ADAM effectively enhanced students' self-reported understanding of transportation planning and their skills of forming opinions, evaluating projects, and making judgments. Students who prefer visual and active learning were found to benefit more than others through simulation-based teaching strategy. Findings in this research could have significant implications for future practice of simulation-based teaching strategy.

AB Our school's vision is to deliver a more attractive, qualitative and technologically equipped school to our students in order to prepare them to be active 21st Century citizens. In this paper we present the on-going effort that we have made during the last years, towards this direction. Our initial step towards building the "School of the Future" is the implementation of a "Classroom of the Future", as well as the experience gained through our participation in the homonym project. In this classroom our students have a light-weight portable "electronic schoolbag" (Tablet PC) and are connected wirelessly to the interactive whiteboard of their classroom and their teacher's "electronic" tools. This schoolbag contains all of their books and sheets as well as virtual labs, simulations, multimedia material, their schoolwork and every tool related to the educational process.

AB This paper presents results of a case study conducted in secondary mathematics classrooms using a new generation of networked classroom technology (Participatory Simulations). Potential for drawing on youths' cultural practices in networked learning environments is explored in terms of opportunities for traditionally underserved students to participate in powerful mathematical discourse and practice. As mediated by the networked technology, the multiple modes of participation and opportunities to contribute to the group's accomplishment of its task served as important avenues for underserved students to bring to bear resources they develop through participating in everyday practices of their communities. The goal is to provide examples of networked activities' potential for leveraging cultural practices of marginalized groups through pedagogy that invites youth to draw on linguistic resources and interaction patterns they develop as members of cultural groups.

AB Nowadays the learning methods in the higher and further education are under a constant review process. Applications focused in blended-learning allow to speed-up the learning process; this facilitates the design and implementation of active resources in the classroom. Flipped Classroom strategy has achieved significant mention in academic circles in recent years. Flipped learning is a very effective idea for students to acquire knowledge, if they are well motivated. Undoubtedly, the implementation of this educational methodology improves the student motivation and increases their participation in the classroom. Traditional lecture style is the most common teaching-learning approach used in higher education. However this approach often places students in a passive role. Flipped Learning has changed the way that students receive information from their teachers. Thus the previous study, academic assignments and communication outside the classroom are more effective.
   As a brief summary, in this paper different ICT tools and multimedia resources that facilitate the teaching sessions are presented. The objective is to achieve a more interactive learning. The before-class time is dedicated to the study and preparation of the different academic task in order to obtain a previous knowledge. While in-class time it is dedicated to active learning and critical thinking processes. This series of activities include the use of mobile devices, quizzes and games. The instructor prepared a session with questions related to the basic knowledge and each student used his own mobile phone to give the answer to the respective question. The results are immediate. In addition students have instant feedback. The method is based on open-source and easy-to-use tools. Some examples of freeware applications used in the classroom can be: Socrative, Kahoot, GoConqr and Quizizz. Flipped learning incorporates basic e-learning tools and traditional learning practices. Numerous authors suggest that game-based learning provides students a deep-learning. Other learning resources that can facilitate the academic environment are: Educanon, Nearpod, Movenote, SliceShare, etc.
   In this paper is presented the educational innovation experience based in Flipped Learning and different active-collaborative activities realized during the academic year 2014/15. The course is integrated into the Renewable Energies and Energy Efficiency University Master. Flipped Classroom implements the self-learning ability. In this case, the low cost of the multimedia elements not only allow enhance learning activities, but also help to the student to learn in an entertaining way. Educational innovation strategies shown in this paper are economically efficient, sustainable and transferable to other subjects and knowledge disciplines, because the resources and tools necessary for its implementation are free and widely used within the educational community. The obtained results have shown that the effectiveness and level of global satisfaction of the students, during the development of this educational experience, has been high.

   Agent-Based Social Simulator
AB In this paper, we highlight the issues of poor students' engagement in classrooms and identify the attributes for the environmental settings of a proposed simulator to study the problem of students' poor engagement from the students' emotional demotion using agent-based social simulation concepts. The environmental settings of the simulation is classified into environmental factors and emotional factors. The environmental factors consist of a number of students, class session, class duration, type of subject, and year of study, while the emotional factors include the negative emotional states of student (e. g. anger, anxiety or boredom) and the emotional states of lecturers. In this simulation, a lecturer, who might have ideas on new strategies based on their experience, is able to insert a new strategy using a proposed Strategy Specification Settings Interface.

AB This paper provides an overview of application building in the course environment illustrated with samples of student work. User applications (apps) built as extensions of multiphysics models have been integrated into traditional face-to-face and hybrid engineering courses. Apps were first included in a multidisciplinary modeling graduate course that emphasizes an end-of-semester research project. At the undergraduate level, apps were added into a two-course mechanical engineering thermo-fluids sequence. Initially, apps were used as an effective demonstration tool both in the classroom and in an on-line environment. Subsequently, application building has been embedded into a string of simulation projects featuring prominently in the performance assessment. As a result, students have become more demonstrably engaged and are devoting substantial time outside the classroom to understand theoretical concepts. Feedback from graduates indicates that familiarity with simulation work-flow and application building are effective skillsets in seeking an entry-level industry position.

AB The investigation at scale of the tensions that teachers need to manage when deciding to follow recommendations for practice has been hampered by the problem of occurrence: The conditions in which those decisions could be made need to occur during an observation in order for observers to document how teachers handle them. Simulations have been recommended as a way to immerse teachers in instructional contexts in which they have the opportunity to follow such recommendations and observe what teachers choose to do in response. In this article, we show an example of how a teaching simulation may be used to support such investigation, in the context of policy recommendations to open up classroom discussion and consider multiple solutions and in the instructional situation of doing proofs in geometry. A contrast between the decisions made by expert and novice teachers (n = 59) in the simulation, analyzed using multiple regression, adds empirical evidence to earlier conjectures based on qualitative analysis of classroom teaching experiments that revealed teachers to be particularly attentive to epistemological and temporal constraints. We found that expert and novice teachers differed in how likely they were to prefer practices recommended by policymakers. Specifically, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to open up classroom discussions when they had the knowledge resources to correct a student error. Similarly, expert teachers were significantly more likely than novice teachers to explore multiple solutions when there were no time constraints.

AB As emerging technologies become increasingly inexpensive and robust, there is an exciting opportunity to move beyond general purpose computing platforms to realize a new generation of K-12 technology-based learning environments. Mixed-reality technologies integrate real world components with interactive digital media to offer new potential to combine best practices in traditional science learning with the powerful affordances of audio/visual simulations. This paper introduces the realization of a learning environment called SMALLab, the Situated Multimedia Arts Learning Laboratory. We present a recent teaching experiment for high school chemistry students. A mix of qualitative and quantitative research documents the efficacy of this approach for students and teachers. We conclude that mixed-reality learning is viable in mainstream high school classrooms and that students can achieve significant learning gains when this technology is co-designed with educators.

AB From an epistemological view, a computer simulation (CS) can be faced as mediator artefacts that provide students new experiences, perspectives and insights that allow the construction of knowledge. CS can display visual representations (VRs) that allow visualizations impossible to do in other ways.
   VR displayed by CS can work as important tools that will enlarge, improve and scaffold the students' epistemic work in the classroom. VR displayed by CS can work as symbolic mediators when used in a communicational context to inform, or illustrate, an idea (or a concept). Also, VRs can work as mediators of action when used in the interaction with CS context, to allow the students manipulate the CS, enabling them to change its configuration, or offering reformulations of or new VRs from a concept or phenomena.
   The main goal of this research is highlight the importance of VR (displayed by CS) used in the classroom as symbolic mediator or mediator of action to promote students' epistemic work. Research questions: a) what is the impact on the occurrence of students' epistemic practices (EPs) when teachers and students' use VR as symbolic mediator or as mediator of action? b) what teacher's mediation actions, concerning the use of VR can promote the development of students' EPs in the classroom?
   This research deal with a qualitative and interpretative analyse, from two case studies involving two physical sciences teachers from secondary school in physical sciences classroom (students age 1518 years) with different teaching experience, same academic background, and same research experience in the field of physical sciences education. Each teacher taught three lessons and students develop inquiry work organized into small groups.
   We collect several types of data from the lessons (e.g. audio recording, documents from teacher or students, print screens, photos, indication of silences and gestures, explicit teacher's intentions and decisions, students' notebook, teacher notebook) to produce multimodal narratives (MN), to organize and systematize data. MNs were constructed by teachers themselves and have the same structure, which allows its comparability. The content analyses of MN allow us the identification of the evidences about: (a) the use of VR (by students and teachers, both as symbolic mediator or as mediator of action), (b) the students' EP that take place and (c) the teacher's actions, concerning the use of VR that promote or enable such EP. These evidences were analysed to answer to the research questions.
   Main findings: (a) the students' use of VR as mediator of action is related with the occurrence of a larger number of students' EPs; the students' use of VR only as symbolic mediator seems to have low impact in the occurrence of students' EP; the use of VR by the teachers, without the complement of other mediation actions, doesn't seem to have a great influence on students' EPs; (b) there are important mediation actions, related with the use of VR, with great impact on students' EPs: task proposal as challenge, give autonomy to students, request for additional aspects, synthesize and make explicit the epistemic statute of the students' work done or ongoing. Taking into account the differences on using the VR displayed by CS (as mediator of action or symbolic mediator) may improve the quality of students' epistemic work and teacher's mediation.

AB Background: This exploratory study is part of a larger-scale research project aimed at building theoretical and practical knowledge of complex systems in students and teachers with the goal of improving high school biology learning through professional development and a classroom intervention.
   Purpose: We propose a model of adaptive expertise to better understand teachers' classroom practices as they attempt to navigate myriad variables in the implementation of biology units that include working with computer simulations, and learning about and teaching through complex systems ideas.
   Sample: Research participants were three high school biology teachers, two females and one male, ranging in teaching experience from six to 16years. Their teaching contexts also ranged in student achievement from 14-47% advanced science proficiency.
   Design and methods: We used a holistic multiple case study methodology and collected data during the 2011-2012 school year. Data sources include classroom observations, teacher and student surveys, and interviews. Data analyses and trustworthiness measures were conducted through qualitative mining of data sources and triangulation of findings.
   Results: We illustrate the characteristics of adaptive expertise of more or less successful teaching and learning when implementing complex systems curricula. We also demonstrate differences between case study teachers in terms of particular variables associated with adaptive expertise.
   Conclusions: This research contributes to scholarship on practices and professional development needed to better support teachers to teach through a complex systems pedagogical and curricular approach.

AB Research on the "Big-Fish-Little-PondEffect" shows that reference-group-effects do not only have an influence on students' academic self-concept but also on teachers' judgments about students' academic achievement. This study with N = 42 teacher students investigated reference-group-effects on direct and indirect judgments on students' performance experimentally by using the Simulated Classroom, a computer simulation of a classroom situation. Multilevel analysis revealed a negative effect of class average achievement on indirect judgments in terms of grades: students with identical performance were graded more favorable in a class with low average achievement than in a class with higher average achievement. There was no negative effect of class average achievement on teacher students' direct judgments, which consisted of an estimation of the percentage of correct answers given by each student. Beyond the reference group effect, the accuracy of teacher students' judgments is discussed.

AB The effectiveness of Problem Based learning in the context of chemical education has been tested by using different sets of computer based simulations as teaching aid over a two-year period in a major college of the Southern United States of America. By running simulations of a simple reaction's system on a JAVA based simulator, students were then able to earn a substantial improvement in their test scores. Students' improvements, measured with a four-group Solomon test composed of multiple choice questions, were similar or better of the improvements of students that followed the traditional teaching and learning study path. This study underlines the fact that PBL can be effectively used in a college classroom to complement the textbook and to raise awareness amongst students of the time and efforts needed to achieve measurable progresses in a simulated research environment.

AB My Science Tutor (MyST) is an intelligent tutoring system designed to improve science learning by elementary school students through conversational dialogs with a virtual science tutor in an interactive multimedia environment. Marni, a lifelike 3-D character, engages individual students in spoken dialogs following classroom investigations using the kit-based Full Option Science System program. MyST attempts to elicit self-expression from students; process their spoken explanations to assess understanding; and scaffold learning by asking open-ended questions accompanied by illustrations, animations, or interactive simulations related to the science concepts being learned. MyST uses automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, and dialog-modeling technologies to interpret student responses and manage the dialog. Sixteen 20-min tutorials were developed for each of 4 areas of science taught in 3rd, 4th, and 5th grades. During summative evaluation of the program, students received one-on-one tutoring via MyST or an expert human tutor following classroom instruction on the science topic, representing over 4.5 hr of tutoring across the 16 sessions. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare average learning gain for 3 groups: human tutoring, virtual tutoring, and no tutoring. Learning gain was measured using standardized assessments given to students in each condition before and after each science module. Results showed that students in both the human and virtual tutoring groups had significant learning gains relative to students in the control classrooms and that there were no significant differences in learning gains between students in the human and MyST human tutoring conditions. Both teachers and students gave high-positive survey ratings to MyST.

AB A challenge with flipped instruction is the pre-class preparation, where students independently learn fundamental content outside the classroom. For this pre-class learning, instructors typically assign videos with quizzes. However, this approach is the same for all and does not address differential needs. In a prior National Science Foundation (NSF) study with three schools, differences in the outcomes for blended versus flipped instruction in a numerical method course were not statistically significant, and the effect sizes were small. To diversify pre-class preparation and potentially improve outcomes in the flipped classroom, the instructor developed lessons using an adaptive platform via a new NSF grant. The adaptive platform provides personalized, flexible learning with multiple resources, including videos, text, quizzes, and simulations, with different paths depending on a student's progress. Adaptive lessons were implemented during two semesters in a flipped classroom, and the results were compared to (1) flipped instruction without adaptive lessons and (2) blended instruction. The comparisons consisted of direct assessments (i.e. exams) and student evaluations via survey. Analysis was done collectively for students and for several demographic groups. Based on direct and indirect measures, the flipped classroom with adaptive learning may be the preferred method for this and other STEM courses.

AB The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students-even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed.

AB This paper reports on a case study of an immersive and integrated multi-instructional approach (namely computer-based model introduction and connection with content; facilitation of individual student exploration guided by exploratory worksheet; use of associated differentiated labs and use of model-based assessments) in the implementation of coupled computer-based models and assessment in a high-school chemistry classroom. Data collection included in-depth teacher interviews, classroom observations, student interviews and researcher notes. Teacher conceptions highlighted the role of models as tools; the benefits of abstract portrayal via visualizations; appropriate enactment of model implementation; concerns with student learning and issues with time. The case study revealed numerous challenges reconciling macro, submicro and symbolic phenomena with the NetLogo model. Nonetheless, the effort exhibited by the teacher provided a platform to support the evolution of practice over time. Students' reactions reflected a continuum of confusion and benefits which were directly related to their background knowledge and experiences with instructional modes. The findings have implications for the role of teacher knowledge of models, the modeling process and pedagogical content knowledge; the continuum of student knowledge as novice users and the role of visual literacy in model decoding, comprehension and translation.

AB Engagement has been viewed as an important construct to understand students' learning performances in classroom settings. Taking an interactive perspective, the study investigates ninth graders' cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement in teacher-centered (TC) and student-centered (SC) technology-enhanced classrooms. 54 students from two science classes in Taiwan participated in this study. Multiple sources of data were collected during a 3-week instructional unit. The statistical results showed that although students in the SC class reported having significantly higher emotional engagement, the emotional engagement level had no impact on students' learning achievement. Analyses of qualitative data showed that students in both classes spent a majority of class time on cognitive involvement in learning activities, but there were qualitative differences in cognitive and behavioral engagement between the two classes. One type of activities that did not occur in the TC class was making reflections in which students in the SC class self-assessed what they did. In addition, the SC class usually interacted through group discussions provoked by the simulations, whereas the TC class frequently interacted through initiation-response-evaluation sequences and engaged in student-initiated discussions. The findings suggest that both instructional approaches promoted students' conceptual understanding and provided students with different opportunities to engage in science learning.

TI Opportunity Wages, Classroom Characteristics, and Teacher Mobility
SO SOUTHERN ECONOMIC JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID DURATION
AB This article analyzes the impact of classroom characteristics and opportunity wages on four possible labor market choices of teachers in Florida: remaining at their present school, switching schools within a school district, changing school districts, and leaving teaching. Discrete-time multinomial-logit-hazard model estimates indicate that classroom characteristics play a larger role than school average student characteristics in determining teacher mobility. Opportunity wages based on past teacher movements to other competing districts and professions are found to pull teachers away from their initial placements. Once opportunity wages and working conditions are considered, teachers' own salaries are found to exert little impact on teacher mobility within the profession; although, they reduce attrition out of the profession. Policy simulations indicate that targeted salary increases based on teacher-specific working conditions are important to retain teachers at a given school.

AB Physics' curricula of Italian Scientific High Schools in the last years have been enhanced by the introduction of Quantum Mechanics and Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL). Education monitoring reveals that last year's students are experiencing many issues in learning in their second language (L2) and advanced and counter-intuitive contents. Our experiment is aimed at understanding and then overcoming those problems using educational methodologies based on social aspects. Thanks to the Internet, a communicative style can be exploited where teachers could keep teaching, playing the role of semiotic mediators. Multimedia and simulations broadly available in MOOCS suggested a flipped classroom approach coping with the project of CLIL lessons. In our experience two classrooms of students were selected, starting from very similar performances and skills. The first one was taught with traditional lectures and tests; the second one, instead, attended to experimental lessons. Students could share their ideas and learning supports through a Facebook group, a blog, virtual classrooms and a website. Nevertheless, at the end of the experience an eTwinning exchange was planned, to spread the experiment towards foreign schools. The outcomes of the tests performed on the students were analysed and unexpected results were drawn. An extension to larger numbers of students, the introduction of different methodologies and the research about different topics in Physics could potentially develop this research.

AB This article describes a project that integrates faculty-developed computer courseware into a baccalaureate curriculum. The courseware was implemented as a teaching-learning strategy to enhance mastery of content and assist in development of decision-making skills. Curriculum, course, and unit objectives served as the foundation for the computer courseware lessons. The courseware is produced by a design team of six faculty. Computer lessons are interactive and actively involve students in the learning process. Students in six of eight clinical nursing courses are using faculty-developed courseware.

AB The demand for assessments of competencies that require complex human interaction is steadily growing as we move toward a focus on twenty-first century skills. As assessment designers aim to address this demand, we argue for the importance of a common language to understand and attend to the key challenges implicated in designing task situations to assess such competencies. We offer the descriptors coordinated, accumulated, and dynamic (CAD) as a way of understanding the nature of these competencies and the considerations involved in measuring them. We use an example performance task designed to measure teacher competency in leading an argumentation-focused discussion in elementary science to illustrate what we mean by the coordinated, accumulated, and dynamic nature of this construct and the challenges assessment designers face when developing performance tasks to measure this construct. Our work is unique in that we designed these performance tasks to be deployed within a digital simulated classroom environment that includes simulated students controlled by a human agent, known as the simulation specialist. We illustrate what we mean by these three descriptors and discuss how we addressed various considerations in our task design to assess elementary science teachers' ability to facilitate argumentation-focused discussions.

AB Objectives
   We sought to further determine whether cognitive test results changed for advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) taught in the team-based learning/flipped classroom format (TBL/FC) versus a lecture-based (LB) control.
   Methods
   We delivered 2010 ACLS to two classes of fourth-year medical students in the TBL/FC format (2015-2016), compared to three classes in the LB format (2012-2014). There were 27.5 hours of instruction for the TBL/FC model (TBL - 10.5 hours, podcasts - nine hours, small-group simulation - eight hours), and 20 hours (lectures - 12 hours, simulation - eight hours) in LB. We taught TBL for 13 cardiac cases while LB had none. Didactic content and seven simulated cases were the same in lecture (2012-2014) or in podcast formats (2015-2016). Testing was the same using 50 multiple-choice (MC) format questions, 20 rhythm-matching questions, and seven fillin management of simulated cases.
   Results
   Some 468 students enrolled in the course 259 (55.4%) in the LB format in 2012-2014, and 209 (44.6%) in the TBL/FC format in 2015-2016. The scores for two out of three tests (MC and fillin) increased with TBL/FC. Combined, median scores increased from 93.5% (IQR 90.6, 95.4) to 95.1% (92.5, 96.8, p = 0.0001). More students did not pass one of three tests with LB versus TBL/FC (24.7% versus 18.2%), and two or three parts of the test (8.1% versus 4.3%, p = 0.01). On the contrary, 77.5% passed all three with TBL/FC versus 67.2% with LB (change 10.3%, 95% CI 2.2%-18.2%).
   Conclusion
   TBL/FC teaching for ACLS improved written test results compared with the LB format.

AB This study examined whether a video illustration of a complex phenomenon promoted learner interest, perceived comprehensibility, and better learning in online- and classroom-based contexts. In the first study, undergraduate participants (N = 101) viewed learning materials which contained a video only, a video and textual explanation, or a textual explanation alone. Participants rated the interestingness and comprehensibility of the instructional materials and completed a learning outcomes test. The second study (N = 56) included the same learning materials in a classroom context. The video presentation of the material did not improve learning outcomes, in either context. Participants in the computer-delivered context who only viewed the text learned the material better than those who had viewed the video. In the classroom-delivered context, the video neither helped nor hurt the learning outcomes, but it also did not significantly boost learners' interest. Taken together, findings from the present study indicate potential limited utility of including video material within these instructional contexts.

AB There is great potential to design digital simulation games as part of professional training settings. However, there is little research on how a large group in a classroom or seminar can all play at the same time. In this paper we describe the design and first in-the-wild deployment of the 4Decades game, which involves up to 30 players simultaneously in a simulation of global climate economics. Using a network of shared devices and ambient displays, a fast-paced collaborative game enabled players to reflect on prior learning, strategy making and their critical understanding of the simulation.

AB Technological mediation is, and will be, one of the greatest topics in modern learning. The technology- education integration is one of its most important bifurcations. The success for technology to be integrated into educational scenarios has always been on the educational field side, and has as necessary conditions planning and instructional design.
   But today's contemporary instructional design implementation faces ever more complex technologies that have to be adapted or modified into increasingly disruptive learning models, making it increasingly difficult to integrate technology into the classroom, which in turn requires the mandatory application of models and theories that structure and guide ideas, needs, uses and even designer intuitions, which presents the educational technologist fundamental issue, the dichotomy of the teacher- technologist binomial or one is a very good teacher or one is a very good technologist.
   The objective of this work is to propose an instructional and technological design macro-structure for technologically mediated learning milieus that merge ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) Criterion 3 as the instructional axiom of design principles with the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning to integrate the mediated online laboratory technological feature, either remote or in-situ, with the educational one.
   Methodology: First, the criterion 3 section of the ABET Self-Study Questionnaire 2018-2019, available freely online is analyzed and applied for instructional design, which contains in 4 statements (A-D), the accreditation criteria and the accreditation policy criteria from the procedures manual and the 11 students outcomes (a-k) that according to ABET, every STEM university program must fulfill.
   Outcomes: instructional design for online lab-classroom integration guidelines, its interaction rules, didactic sequences and teaching and learning methods selection.
   Second, the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning is applied for technological design, based on three learning principles for the cognitive knowledge construction and a set of 42 e-Learning guidelines on ten domains: Multimedia; Contents Cognitive; Collaboration; Style; Navigation; Practice; Interaction; Exercise and Games and Simulations. Outcomes: technological design for online lab- classroom integration guidelines, its web and mobile apps interfaces and electronic control circuits configuration and mechanical interaction.
   Finally, the instructional/technological online lab-classroom integration will empirical validated. The mobile app interface for a Galilean inclined plane was first test in simulation mode for solving a classical problem within an experiment with a control group with just the app technology and, the experimental group with the same app and a instructional designed training process on its use as a personal leaning milieu.
   Conclusions: The 11 outcomes of ABET are addressed but not limited to the university level nor STEM areas. The accreditation is not intended, but to have a theoretical reference frame for high-end instructional design and scope within an international accreditation framework. The ten domains perfectly cover the technological scope of the online lab design of its web and/or mobile interfaces. It is a completely free and open technology-education integration process. The preliminary validation process shows that instructional design process is central in the online labclassroom integration.

AB Background: Student engagement is an important domain for medical education, however, it is difficult to quantify. The goal of this study was to investigate the utility of virtual patient simulations (VPS) for increasing medical student engagement. Our aims were specifically to investigate how and to what extent the VPS foster student engagement. This study took place at A.T. Still University School of Osteopathic Medicine in Arizona (ATSU-SOMA), in the USA.
   Methods: First year medical students (n = 108) worked in teams to complete a series of four in-class virtual patient case studies. Student engagement was measured, defined as flow, interest, and relevance. These dimensions were measured using four data collection instruments: researcher observations, classroom photographs, tutor feedback, and an electronic exit survey. Qualitative data were analyzed using a grounded theory approach.
   Results: Triangulation of findings between the four data sources indicate that VPS foster engagement in three facets:
   1) Flow. In general, students enjoyed the activities, and were absorbed in the task at hand.
   2) Interest. Students demonstrated interest in the activities, as evidenced by enjoyment, active discussion, and humor. Students remarked upon elements that caused cognitive dissonance: excessive text and classroom noise generated by multi-media and peer conversations.
   3) Relevance. VPS were relevant, in terms of situational clinical practice, exam preparation, and obtaining concrete feedback on clinical decisions.
   Conclusions: Researchers successfully introduced a new learning platform into the medical school curriculum. The data collected during this study were also used to improve new learning modules and techniques associated with implementing them in the classroom. Results of this study assert that virtual patient simulations foster engagement in terms of flow, relevance, and interest.

AB Computational Thinking (CT) can effectively promote science learning, but K-12 curricula lack efforts to integrate CT with science. In this paper, we present a generic CT assessment scheme and propose metrics for evaluating correctness of computational and domain-specific constructs in computational models that students construct in CTSiM - a learning environment that combines CT with middle school science. We report a teacher-led, multi-domain classroom study using CTSiM and use our metrics to study how students' model evolution relates to their pre-post learning gains. Our results lay the framework for online evaluation and scaffolding of students in CTSiM.

AB This paper explores the utilization of "pervasive" or "ubiquitous" computing devices and technologies in the higher education classroom of the future. Firstly, a survey on the characteristics and the applications of today's ubiquitous computing devices is presented, along with a questioning on the level of their ubiquity. Such devices include smartphones, PDAs, Tablet PCs, iPods, as well as reading appliances, Pad-type appliances, interactive whiteboards and telepresence boards. Multiple network connections such as cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and NFC, provide long-, medium-, or short-range wireless communication for different mobile devices. In the following, we investigate how innovative ubiquitous computing devices and technologies can be employed in education learning environments to enhance active learning by anyone, anytime and anywhere, as well as to enable blended learning, individually and collaboratively. A representative use case is presented to reveal the new possibilities for learning that a classroom equipped with ubiquitous computing devices can offer to students. Interviews with experts helped us to give proposals on the utilization of the advantages of ubiquitous computing technology in the higher education classroom of the future. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB The Research Problem (RP) of this report is: there is the need of research made in classroom to promote more comprehensive and grounded teaching and learning practices about Energy, Water and relationships between them. This work was done to validate the RP and to develop more solid foundations to subsequent research.
   We describe the resources, the activities and the educational outcomes of the use by the first author, in classes of an initial training course of teachers for age levels 6-12, of: (i) two experimental physical resources, about the Urban water cycle and the Desalination of sea water; (ii) a computer based simulation related to Archimedes' law and its interpretation in terms of gravitational potential energy.
   We have looked for answers with the following characteristics: (i) theoretically grounded; (ii) grounded on evidences from content analyses of multimodal narratives; (iii) requiring only common and not expensive material resources; (iv) methodologically feasible in natural classroom environments.
   We present and discuss answers to the RQ and contributions to solve the RP.

AB This study examined the effects of a computer game on students' mathematics achievement and motivation, and the role of prior mathematics knowledge, computer skill, and English language skill on their achievement and motivation as they played the game. A total of 193 students and 10 teachers participated in this study. The teachers were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. A mixed method of quantitative and interviews were used with Multivariate Analysis of Co-Variance to analyze the data. The results indicated significant improvement of the achievement of the experimental versus control group. No significant improvement was found in the motivation of the groups. Students who played the games in their classrooms and school labs reported greater motivation compared to the ones who played the games only in the school labs. Prior knowledge, computer and English language skill did not play significant roles in achievement and motivation of the experimental group. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper examines how sports video games can become a relevant artifact for the development and improvement of cognitive skills by teenagers. Both sport and games have an important role in the lives of children and teenagers: as active participants or spectators, the interest of both activities plays an important role in their leisure. Sport video games provide a setting that combines different aspects of game and sport as the entertainment, the physical, the psychological boost and the competition & collaboration (Wolf, 2003).
   The analysis that concerns us is focused on the ethnography (Pink, 2006). We worked with a Secondary School teacher in the field of Physical Education inside the classroom developing an innovative educational setting by using video games as an educational tool. In this context, we use team-sports video games to join real and virtual sports in the classroom setting, thus contributing to the development of cognitive skills that allow teens to actively reflect on the relationship between game content and contexts of everyday activity (Gee, 2008). We will focus on two different skills defined by Jenkins (2006) as simulation and performance.
   One one hand, simulation is defined as the ability to interpret and construct dynamic models of real-world processes. Considering that simulations are dynamic, and students, as any other person, are usually governed by the intuitive application of grounding assumptions, our finding show how video games can turn into an artifact for students to discover and observe (as researchers do) the emergent properties of these virtual worlds.
   On the other hand, performance is considered the ability to adopt alternative identities in a process that encourages improvisation and discovery and allows the player to develop a richer understanding both of the character and himself. We show how this projected identity allows the player to live the character and therefore have an immersion experience in the game, while using the character as a mirror to reflect their own values and choices. Then, learning with the support of video games involves taking and playing with different identities, so the learner has to make "real" choices (in the development of virtual identity), having multiple opportunities to reflect on the relationship between new and existing identities (Gee, 2003). Thus, our findings show how, through the sports video games, teenagers develop new comprehension skills that enable them to master the different multimedia resources available in their everyday life (Jenkins, 2006).
   The educational relevance of this perspective implies that students relate to and reflect on their multiple identities in real and virtual worlds. That is, learners participate fully committed (with much effort and dedication) because they feel their real identity has been extended into a virtual identity that commits them.

AB Traditional teaching strategies dominate science classrooms in Lesotho, resulting in poor academic performance at each level. Information and Communication Technology tools such as simulations offer potential benefits for improving science teaching. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to evaluate the effect of simulations on learners' performance and retention of stoichiometry concepts using Solomon's four-group design. Purposive sampling of two existing Form E (Grade 12) classes, with 81 learners, led to the creation of four groups. The study responds to the research question: How does using simulations as part of an intervention affect learners' academic performance in stoichiometry? Data were collected as learners' scores for pre-tests and post-tests, designed to assess their understanding of stoichiometry, and analysed through ANOVA and t-tests. After the intervention, the experimental group's mean score (M = 44.2, sigma = 18) was higher than that of control group (M = 32.6, sigma = 15.8), and the difference between the two mean scores was statistically significant, namely t(81) = 3.14, p = 0.002. The experimental group had a higher mean score for retention in post-test (M = 47.4, sigma =16.1) than the control group (M = 37.2, sigma = 13.7) which was statistically significant, namely t(81) = 3.10, p = 0.003. Therefore, it was concluded that simulations enhanced learners' performance and could improve the retention of stoichiometry concepts. This study recommends that simulations be used to supplement the teaching and learning of science, in particular chemistry.

AB With recent advances in technology, animations and simulations are increasingly available for science education. These dynamic resources can be useful for communicating some of the critical ideas that are fundamental to chemistry; however, numerous factors contribute to their effectiveness. In this chapter, we describe our research in designing and implementing a sequence of interactive multimedia simulations on Kinetic Molecular Theory and associated topics, developed for use in high school classrooms. We first discuss the role of representations in chemistry learning, specific attributes of simulations and animations, and theoretical approaches to how people learn from multimedia resources in general and dynamic representations in particular. We then situate this theoretical discussion in practice by describing our own experience in designing, building, testing, and implementing simulations for chemistry education.

AB Introduction: Paramedic students should have the crucial cognitive and psychomotor skills related to neonatal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (N-CPR). Study Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of blended learning on the theoretical knowledge and preliminary knowledge of the psychomotor skills, adherence to the algorithm, and teamwork in simulation-based education (SBE) of N-CPR. Methods: This randomized, prospective study was conducted on 60 fourth-semester paramedic students. The participants were separated into two groups following a classroom lecture. Each group was assigned either a slide presentation (Group 1; SP-G) or a video clip (Group 2; V-G). All the participants answered multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and each group (Group 1 and Group 2) was divided into 10 sub-groups. These sub-groups were then tested in an observational performance evaluation (OPE) consisting of a neonatal asphyxia megacode scenario, after the classroom lecture and following the blended learning process. Results: Group performance, teamwork, communication skills, and adherence to the algorithm were evaluated. There was a significant difference in the MCQ and OPE results between the after classroom lecture and after blended learning for both groups. The average score of Group 2 was higher than Group 1 in the MCQ results (Mann-Whitney U test; P <.001). The average score of Group 2 was higher than Group 1 in the OPE results (Mann-Whitney U test; P = .002). Conclusion: Blended learning, especially video clips, in adjunction with the classroom lecture were effective in acquiring and developing both technical and non-technical skills among paramedic students in SBE of N-CPR training.

AB An integral component of transitioning to the nursing practice setting is in assimilating and sometimes reformulating and reconceptualizing the knowledge gained in the classroom with what is seen and experienced in practice. An inability to do so may inhibit role development and result in difficult transitions to practice. A constructivist approach was utilized in the development of a new model that describes the process of learning and role development in the clinical and simulation setting. This approach involved reviewing the literature, reanalyzing themes, development of multiple schematics, continual review, personal observations of students in the clinical and simulation settings, and feedback from peer educators. The resulting reflection, feedback, and restructuring model describes an inductive, iterative process strongly influenced by feedback. This conceptual model may be a useful tool to guide nurse educators in facilitating role development and the transition from the classroom to the clinical setting for the nursing student.

AB Since the chalk was brought into education in the XIX century, the use of communication technology has been the most impressive change in this field. We are aware of the need of forming team works and giving anew direction to education in order to improve the communication between teachers and students of Architecture, Engineering and Construction. We make use of the following concepts: constructivist learning, virtual classroom, virtual simulation laboratory, internet, team work cooperative work (such as digital and electronic cooperative spaces). We also refer to a synchronous/asynchronous communication group, which offers cooperative approaches for teaching and training.

AB The development of analytical skills is a central goal of the Next Generation Science Standards and foundational to subject mastery in STEM fields. Yet, significant barriers exist to students gaining such skills. Here we describe a new "gentle-slope" cyberlearning strategy that gradually introduces students to the authoring of scientific simulations via a Web-based modding approach called CyberMOD. Modding involves adding agents with predefined functionality to a simulation world to produce a unique combination whose behavior can then be visualized by running the simulation. This permits low barrier experimentation on the modded simulation, which is hoped to help students gain a deeper understanding of scientific phenomena that is the focus of the activity. Our research questions are: i) does this approach encourage students' interest in computational science and ii) does it enhance their analytical abilities, and iii) does it foster a deeper understanding of the processes modded? Here we take an in-depth look at what was created for the CyberMOD infrastructure and analyze the results of initial in-class studies as to the effectiveness of this strategy. The results support the premise that teachers can easily integrate CyberMOD into their in-class activities, that CyberMOD activities encourage creative student learning, and that the CyberMOD approach facilitates student understanding.

AB This study evaluates a framework developed for the use of computer-based business games in higher education, with the aim of developing specific knowledge and competencies within financial teaching at the Polytechnic University of Madrid. This research was developed through an action research methodology. First, professors developed the learning framework by applying the principles of gamification: mechanics, dynamics, and emotions. Subsequently, researchers evaluated its use. The experiment has been conducted through the introduction of two simulators, Gestionet, in the undergraduate classroom, and Global Management Challenge (GMC), in the master's degree classroom. Triangulation is included, gathering various data from students and firms. A 52-item survey was developed and tested statistically. Neural networks and fuzzy set-approaches were used to analyze students' responses and understand how the activity stimulates students' motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic). Simulators offer multi-layered learning experiences to students and produce soft skills, such as strategic capacity, decision-making, and data analysis, and knowledge from their interactions with others and from their reflections on their actions and outcomes. These results are aligned with the competencies demanded by companies according to an analysis of the Report of the Association for the Progress of Management. This makes the simulator a great opportunity and a very useful tool for all the agents of the educational ecosystem.

AB The use of virtual environments and multimedia methods are now part of several educational preparation programs such as surgical medical programs, flight simulators, and military combat training situations. It is believed by researchers these technologies became a part of the educator preparation programs and meeting the needs of the new academic settings (Dieker, Hynes, Ludlow, & Whitten, 2012). TeachLivE (TM) is one of these virtual education simulation technologies, originally designed for teacher education simulation with student avatars.

TI CuVIS: An interactive tool for instructors to create effective
   customized learning designs with visualizations

ID SCIENCE-EDUCATION; TECHNOLOGY; INTEGRATION
AB Instructors face difficulty in creating student-centred, customized learning designs (LDs) for teaching with information and communication technology (ICT) tools such as visualizations (animations, simulations or videos). This problem is compounded for tertiary-level instructors teaching in instructor-mediated classrooms. In such classrooms, common in many parts of the developing world, students may not have 1:1 access with the visualization and have to interact with it via the instructor. Here, the instructors' pedagogy becomes an important factor determining effective learning with the visualization. To address this problem, a set of design impediments faced by instructors in this context were first identified. Design guidelines were created to address these impediments. These guidelines evolved into the Customized Visualization Integration System (CuVIS). It is a wizard-like interactive tool that provides guidelines to instructors on how to create effective LDs that incorporate the principles of constructive alignment and meaningful learning with ICT, and is customized to instructors' requirements. The effectiveness of CuVIS has been tested with instructors along multiple dimensions: usefulness and usability, impact on instructors' pedagogical practice and impact on student learning when taught with CuVIS-generated LDs.

AB Computerized simulators are important tools that support teaching in many areas. The use of these instruments is often described as significant for students and teachers. In this paper, a software piece was developed to aid decision-making in nursing, allowing the simulation of real situations, addressed in the classroom. The simulator architecture corresponds to a multi-agent system supported by a state machine model. To build the knowledge base, a list of contents was selected, including the Nursing Intervention Classification (NIC). An experiment was carried out with the participation of eleven students of the third year of the course. A questionnaire was applied and, as a result, there were more than 90% of acceptance as a relevant educational tool. The simulation, through this tool, contributed to apply theoretical knowledge to the students, besides helping in the development of the nursing decision-making ability.

AB Numerous authors indicate that the Flipped Teaching pedagogical approach combined with other active strategies such as: Problem-based Learning (PbL), Role-Playing, Game-based Learning (GbL), Puzzle-based Learning, Learning by-doing, Simulation-based Learning (SbL), Competence-based Education, Blended-Learning, etc., (the list is endless) allow to achieve a much more meaningful learning. Flipped Learning model has achieved significant mention in academic circles in recent years, although recently detractors and opponents of its implementation in higher education are appearing. In addition, the use of these teaching strategies simultaneously allows developing multiple competences and transversal skills, encouraging the student's complete development. It is well known that knowledge retention is far more effective when students learn by doing something, instead of just listening or watching.
   It seems clear that the technological possibilities of ICT resources are endless. The ideas are innumerable, always as technological elements that allow you to search for content and information, or simply interact in the classroom. In this way, like any other ICT tool that you want to implement in the classroom, it should help and complement the learning dynamics. The idea is not to use innovative tools for the sole purpose of entertaining students or being fashionable (fashion education apps), incorporating the latest ICT applications that are offered by the market. The schools and their teachers see appear, from time to time, certain fashions or pedagogical approaches that promise to be revolutionary and solve all the problems existing in the classrooms of the educational centers and universities. In many cases they are old educational methodologies, applied decades ago, that supported with more or less novel software and with an original technical word (usually in English), reappear as modern techniques, innovative strategies or even revolutionary concepts. Therefore, before designing an educational activity, it is recommended that the teacher reflects on the use of this technology and the added value that really contributes to student learning, inside or outside the classroom.
   The new technologies do not make a teacher good or bad, since by themselves they are useless. Now, together with an adequate methodology, they can improve learning. A good teacher knows how to teach and helps to learn his students. Education is very simple, not easy, but sometimes teachers insist on making it complicated, filling it with too many "fireworks". ICT tools are the essence of these adaptive teaching models. The purpose is to know, how and where to use this technology. The options are endless, always as a complement to the educational strategy.
   In this paper, the author presents different ICT tools that facilitate the implementation of active methodologies in the university context. The technical characteristics of these tools in education can get extra motivation in students, since it involves a game in a natural format for them: active, multimedia and immediate. On the other hand, regardless of the software used, an important reason is the cost. Free software and mobile applications are preferred, especially from the student view. It is the result of the implementation of the BYOD model (Bring Your Own Device) in higher education. All these ICT tools have made it possible to improve the digital competences acquired by the students. In addition, its implementation in the classroom can be simple and independent of the knowledge discipline.

Simulation of a staffing process was proposed and performed in class. Following general and specific skills from the syllabus, students were instructed to design and prepare their curriculum vitae and given multiple tools to conduct active job searches and strategies for participating in selection processes. The results show that students internalized key issues to consider during staffing processes. Participants also discussed and learned key mistakes to avoid in job interviews and examples of good practices for future interviews.

AB Business simulation games (BSGs) enable students to practice making decisions in a virtual environment, accumulate experience in application of strategies, and train themselves in modes of decision-making. This study examines the value sought by players of BSG. In this study, a means-end chain (MEC) model was adopted as the basis, and ladder method soft laddering was used to conduct in-depth interviews with students who had experience in using BSGs. The chain concept of "attribute-consequence-value" was used to understand students' value cognition structures. Content analysis was used to analyze the attributes-consequences-values for BSGs players, then converted into a Hierarchical Value Map (HVM). The results showed that students consider teamwork and market diversity as the most important attributes, and the consequences of a cooperative approach and market diversity are emotional exchange and multi-thinking, with the ultimate value brought to users by exchanges between teams and constant thinking being interpersonal relationships and a sense of accomplishment.

AB This paper examines the educational impact of the implementation of the tutorial activity "Changes in Energy and Momentum" from The Tutorials in Introductory Physics in five different instructional settings. These settings include (1) a completely computer-based learning environment and (2) use of cooperative learning groups with varying levels of instructor support. Pre- and post-tests provide evidence that a computer-based implementation falls significantly short of classroom implementations which involve both collaborative learning groups and interactions with a teaching assistance. Other findings provide insight into the importance of certain elements of instructor training and the appropriate use of the tutorial as an initial introduction to a new concept.

AB Previous research has established that embodied modeling (role-playing agents in a system) can support learning about complexity. Separately, research has demonstrated that increasing the multimodal resources available to students can support sensemaking, particularly for students classified as English Learners. This study bridges these two bodies of research to consider how embodied models can strengthen an interconnected system of multimodal models created by a classroom. We explore how iteratively refining embodied modeling activities strengthened connections to other models, real-world phenomena, and multimodal representations. Through design-based research in a sixth grade classroom studying ecosystems, we refined embodied modeling activities initially conceived as supports for computational thinking and modeling. Across three iterative cycles, we illustrate how the conceptual and epistemic relationship between the computational and embodied model shifted, and we analyze how these shifts shaped opportunities for learning and participation by: (1) recognizing each student's perspectives as critical for making sense of the model, (2) encouraging students to question and modify the "code" for the model, and (3) leveraging multimodal resources, including graphs, gestures, and student-generated language, for meaning-making. Through these shifts, the embodied model became a full-fledged component of the classroom's model system and created more equitable opportunities for learning and participation.

AB This paper presents an advanced variant of learning programming by the use of the Internet and multimedia. It describes the development of a blended learning environment, which, in addition to classroom (face-to-face) lessons, introduces lessons delivered over the Internet: the use of multimedia teaching material with completely dynamic interactive simulations; the use of applications for regular checking and self-checking of the acquisition of knowledge; and applications for regular communication on the teaching material between students and lecturers. This blended learning environment has been developed with the purpose of upgrading the basic programming courses (Programming Fundamentals 1 and Programming Fundamentals 2) at the Advanced School of Electrical and Computer Engineering (VISER) in Belgrade, Serbia. The paper contains a brief description of the goals set, their development and implementation (structure design, the development of teaching materials, scenario implementation, and evaluation), and the results of the implementation and evaluation of these courses.

DE agent-based modeling; NetLogo; STEM education; blocks-based programming
AB Computational models and simulations can be powerful tools to help learners understand a wide variety of natural phenomena. However, understanding and learning from computational models requires learners to comprehend the rules agents follow that lead to emergent outcomes. Blocks-based programming is useful in scaffolding learners in the early stage of programming tasks. We posit that students can authentically interact with agent-based modeling via a blocks-based dialect of the popular ABM language NetLogo, dubbed NetTango, across many difficulty levels. Specifically, we discuss three different activities in which we have integrated blocks-based programming into STEM classrooms that show blocks can be used for activities of increasing computational engagement and difficulty.

AB This position paper provides a theory-based explanation informed by philosophy of technology (PoT) of the recurrent documented patterns often associated with attempts to enact technology-supported, inquiry-based approaches in precollege science classrooms. Understandings derived from the history of technological development in other domains (e.g. medicine, transportation, and warfare) reveal numerous parallels that help to explain these recurrent patterns. Historical analyses of major technologies reveal a conglomerate of factors that interact to produce benefits, as well as intended and unintended consequences. On a macro-scale, PoT facilitates understandings of how technologies interact and are impacted by individuals, society, institutions, economy, politics, and culture. At the micro-level, and most relevant to science education, PoT engages the inherent nature of technology along a number of key dimensions: role of culture and values, notions of technological progression, technology as part of systems, technological diffusion, technology as a fix, and the notions of expertise. Overall, the present analysis has implications for the design, development, implementation, and adoption of technological tools for use in precollege science education, and highlights the role of technology as both artifact and process.

   Hardware-Assisted Tracking Intervention
SO OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERNATIONAL
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents an in-depth study and analysis of the model of higher education using distributed hardware tracking intervention of information technology. The MEC-based dynamic adaptive video stream caching technology model is proposed. The model dynamically adjusts the bit rate by referring to the broadband estimation and cache occupancy data to ensure users have a smooth experience effect. Simulation results show that the model has fewer transcoding times and generates lower latency than the traditional model, which is suitable for dual-teacher classroom scenarios and further improves the quality of the user's video viewing experience. The model uses an edge cloud collaborative architecture to migrate the rendering technology to an edge server closer to the user side, enabling real-time interaction, computation, and rendering, reducing the time of data transmission as well as computation time. According to the blended learning-based adaptive intervention model, three rounds of teaching practice are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the intervention model in terms of both student process performance and outcome performance, thereby improving learning adaptability and improving learning effect. Teachers' teaching has a significant impact on learning motivation (beta=0.311, p < 0.01), which in turn affects learning adaptability. Teachers use scientific teaching methods to stimulate students' learning motivation, mobilize enthusiasm, and improve learning adaptability. Under the communication topology of the system as a directed graph, a multi-intelligent system dynamic model with grouping is established; i.e., the intragroup intelligence has the same dynamics but is different between groups, and all system dynamics are unknown. The proposed novel policy iterative algorithm is used to learn the optimal control protocol and achieve optimal consistency control. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated by the simulation experimental results. The simulation results show that the model has lower latency and energy consumption compared to the cloud rendering model, which is suitable for the safety education classroom scenario and solves the outstanding problems of network connection rate and cloud service latency.

AB Our goal in this work has been to bring together the entertaining and flow characteristics of video game environments with proven learning theories to advance the state of the art in intelligent learning environments. We have designed and implemented an educational game, a river adventure. The adventure game design integrates the Neverwinter Nights game engine with our teachable agents system, Betty's Brain. The implementation links the game interface and the game engine with the existing Betty's Brain system and the river ecosystem simulation using a controller written in Java. After preliminary testing, we will run a complete study with the system in a middle school classroom in Fall 2005.

AB The theoretical and methodological foundations of the sciences and technologies are essential to the removal of barriers to achieving sustainable systems. The teachings of these concepts still lie in traditional academic disciplines such as engineering, science, and mathematics. This structure can often manifest significant barriers to progress in tackling challenging sustainability issues due to an absence of a multi-faceted, interdisciplinary, systems approach. This work will explore approaches for using current sustainability issues and problems to introduce both systems thinking and traditional discipline specific learning objectives to the classroom. Specific examples will be illustrated for a diverse set of courses and curriculum. Assessment shows an improved rate of achieving teaching outcomes compared to traditional curricular techniques.

AB Java simulation applets solving equations for system models have been constructed for teaching system behavior in Pharmacology and Physiology. The applets are intended to be included in Web pages with text and other illustrations for use in the classroom or in self-study lessons. Students can experiment with the system by changing selected model parameters with sliders, immediately observing the resulting changes in system behavior. Several applet presentations are constructed for a model, each presentation designed for a different learning objective by displaying a subset of output variables and making a subset of parameters available for adjustment. Presentations may include control buttons, a graph for output display, sliders to adjust parameters, a legend table comparing parameter settings for multiple experiments, and an animation of the model linked to the calculations. The applet design is highly modular to facilitate replication with different models. Two architectures were tested and compared: 1) a single applet containing all the functions listed above embedded as a single unit in the Web page and 2) a cluster of individual applets of different functional types (control buttons, graph, sliders, etc.) distributed over the Web page and linked by a control object having no visible interface.

AB This paper describes the design and implementation of a multiagent based interactive learning environment called BeLife. BeLife intends to support learning scientific concepts related to photosynthesis, plant growth and greenhouse management. One of the main objectives of the development of BeLife is to create an interactive learning environment that combines modelling and simulation learning tasks in one tool. We present the initial findings from a case study conducted in a classroom setting with high school students. The study evaluated the usability of a high fidelity prototype of the system. We elaborate on these results and discuss the adequacy of BeLife envisioned functionalities and its applicability.

AB This study examined teachers' and students' initial conceptions of computer-based models-Flash and NetLogo models-and documented how teachers and students reconciled notions of multiple representations featuring macroscopic, submicroscopic and symbolic representations prior to actual intervention in eight high school chemistry classrooms. Individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 32 students and 6 teachers. Findings revealed an interplay of complex factors that functioned as opportunities and obstacles in the implementation of technologies in science classrooms. Students revealed preferences for the Flash models as opposed to the open-ended NetLogo models. Altogether, due to lack of content and modeling background knowledge, students experienced difficulties articulating coherent and blended understandings of multiple representations. Concurrently, while the aesthetic and interactive features of the models were of great value, they did not sustain students' initial curiosity and opportunities to improve understandings about chemistry phenomena. Most teachers recognized direct alignment of the Flash model with their existing curriculum; however, the benefits were relegated to existing procedural and passive classroom practices. The findings have implications for pedagogical approaches that address the implementation of computer-based models, function of models, models as multiple representations and the role of background knowledge and cognitive load, and the role of teacher vision and classroom practices.

AB Advances in mobile and wireless technologies provide new possibilities for supporting K-12 learning activities that can be spatially distributed in the classroom, for example in jointly investigating a scientific phenomenon. Such technologies have an impact on the ways in which students engage with one another, and with the quality of their engagement with the activity itself. This paper uses an embodied approach to understand the patterns of interactions between students (e.g., student-to-student, student-to teacher) and with computational media within the environment (e.g., student-to-device, student-to-large display), in relation to students' real-time meaning making as they engage in collective inquiry in an immersive simulation environment. The design-based research study consists of two iterations tested in an authentic school setting. We found that increased student-to-student interactions was accompanied by improved observational accuracy and higher quality student explanations constructed. The design implications of the research findings are discussed.

AB The first half of this book focused on research investigating what it means for students to "understand" modeling processes and models that are important in order for students to be able to use mathematics in real life situations beyond school. This second half shifts attention toward investigations about what is needed for modeling activities to be used productively to promote learning in mathematics classrooms. These investigations are not simplistic one-variable experimental studies intended to prove or disprove the success or failure of pre-defined "treatments" and "interventions." Rather, many of these chapters describe teaching experiments (Lesh, 2003) which are investigations designed to show how students' or teachers' thinking changes in situations which involve multiple iterative cycles of expressing, testing, and revising initial ways of thinking about (simulations of) "real life" decision-making situations. Or, other chapters describe design studies (Kelly, Lesh, and Back 2008) in which students or teachers design artifacts or tools which need to be powerful (for some specific purpose in some specific situation), sharable (with other people), and reuseable (in other situations). Both of the preceding kinds of studies often involve model-eliciting activities in which: (a) one of the most important parts of the products that are produced are the underlying interpretation systems (or models), and (b) the interpretation systems (models) involve concepts that the researcher or teacher judges believe to be among the main "big ideas" that students should learn.

AB Animation films were used frequently during online didactic activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have not identified research that focuses on the problems that teachers face when using animated films to enable students' learning of Natural Sciences and on the training models that can be organized based on this resource. Therefore, we analysed the problems faced by teachers and, to solve them, we identified, analysed, and described several instruction models based on animation films: illustrative, expositive, interactive, flipped classroom, learning through discovery, and learning through simulation. We analysed the way to integrate them into the didactic activity and, finally, we realized some recommendations.

AB Growing higher educational programs are always interested in adding physical facilities to their campus. Many times the initial plans do not include all the technology details needed for either a standard or a cutting-edge program. This paper describes planning and implementation efforts at the Vanderbilt University School of Nursing, which has resulted in a new 29,947-square-foot facility addition. The new space includes a complete floor designated as simulation laboratory space, an interactive classroom with five screens suitable for small group interaction, and a virtual classroom for cutting edge multimedia production and transmission. Additional floors house both technology rich seminar meeting rooms as well as collaborative offices. All spaces are integrated using the innovative Crestron control system, including a multitude of their solutions that help to make this a smarter workplace that is both secure, smart, and worthy of completing educational goals.

ID CLASS SIZE; STUDENT-ACHIEVEMENT
AB We develop a simple model of teacher behavior that offers a solution to the "class size puzzle" and is useful for analyzing the potential effects of the No Child Left Behind Act. When teachers must allocate limited classroom time between multiple instructional methods, rational teachers may respond to reductions in class size by reallocating classroom time in a way that reduces average educational achievement. This result is possible even when students are not sorted by ability. Teacher preferences for the achievement of heterogeneous students play a fundamental role in our model, and we derive necessary conditions for reductions in average educational achievement. We also provide an analysis of the distributional consequences of changes in class size and teacher preferences. Monte Carlo simulations predict both positive and negative class size effects, suggesting that the model supports the findings of several leading econometric studies.

AB Simulations have changed chemistry education by allowing students to visualize the motion and interaction of particles underlying important chemical processes. With kinetics, such visualizations can illustrate how particles interact to yield successful reactions and how changes in concentration and temperature impact the number and success of individual collisions. This study examined how a simulation exploring particle collisions, or screencast employing the same simulation, used as an out-of-class introduction helped develop students' conceptual understanding of kinetics. Students either manipulated the simulation themselves using guided instructions or watched a screencast in which an expert used the same simulation to complete an assignment. An iterative design approach and analysis of pretest and follow up questions suggests that students in both groups at two different institutions were able to achieve a common base level of success. Instructors can then build upon this common experience when instructing students on collision theory and kinetics. Eye-tracking studies indicate that the simulation and screencast groups engage with the curricular materials in different ways, which combined with student self-report data suggests that the screencast and simulation provide different levels of cognitive demand. This increased time on task suggests that the screencast may hold student interest longer than the simulation alone.

AB Both complex systems methods (such as agent-based modeling) and computational methods (such as programming) provide powerful ways for students to understand new phenomena. To understand how to effectively teach complex systems and computational content to younger students, we conducted a study in four urban middle school classrooms comparing 2-week-long curricular units-one using a physical robotics participatory simulation and one using a virtual robotics participatory simulation. We compare the two units for their effectiveness in supporting students' complex systems thinking and computational thinking skills. We find that while both units improved student outcomes to roughly the same extent, they engendered different perspectives on the content. That is, students using the physical system were more likely to interpret situations from a bottom-up ("agent") perspective, and students using the virtual system were more likely to employ a top-down ("aggregate") perspective. Our outcomes suggest that the medium of students' interactions with systems leads to differences in their learning from and about those systems. We explore the reasons for and effects of these differences, challenges in teaching this content, and student learning gains. The paper contributes operationalizable definitions of complex systems perspectives and computational perspectives and provides both a theoretical framework for and empirical evidence of a relationship between those two perspectives.

AB We evaluated Simulations in Developmental Disabilities (SIDD), a multimedia software program that provides students with practice in behavioral assessment and treatment decisions for persons with developmental disabilities. Following a lecture on clinical strategies, students in an experimental group received instruction with SIDD whereas students in the control group did not, We collected assessments of students' clinical knowledge before and after the lecture, immediately after training, and several weeks later. The lecture had no immediate impact on clinical knowledge; how, ever, there was a significant difference in test scores between the ex, perimental group and the control group following exposure to SIDD training, which remained at follow-up.

AB Pediatricians must be able to diagnose, triage, and manage infants and children with congenital heart disease. The pediatric cardiology division at the Medical University of South Carolina updated their curriculum for pediatric residents to a format supported by constructivist learning theory. The purpose of this study is to determine if shorter, interactive learning with fellow and faculty involvement improved pediatric cardiology knowledge demonstrated through test scores and resident satisfaction. A curriculum of short lectures and interactive workshops was delivered over 6 weeks in August and September 2018. Residents answered a 10-question pretest prior to the curriculum, followed by a post-test immediately after the last session and a delayed post-test 8 months later. Residents also provided summative feedback on the educational sessions. Sixty-six residents were eligible to participate in the curriculum with 44 (67%) completing the pretest, 40 (61%) completing the post-test, and 33 (50%) completing the delayed post-test. The mean score increased significantly from 56 to 68% between the pretest and post-test (p = 0.0018). The delayed post-test mean score remained high at 71% without significant change (p = 0.46). Overall feedback was positive highlighting the interactive nature of lectures and the participation of cardiology fellows. Using an interactive, multimodal educational series, pediatric residents had a significant increase in pediatric cardiology test scores and demonstrated good retention.

AB Some studies question if web-based inquiry is as practical tasks for developing inquiry skills. We have hypothesised that particular effectiveness depends on the support system that outperforms the guidance of a teacher in a classroom situation. For this reason, a multi-level support system has been developed for the learning environment 'Young Scientist' (http://bio.edu.ee/noor/) on the basis of the results derived from earlier studies of composing web-based learning environments. The main focus of this paper is on the evaluation of students' progress in their skills in designing inquiry process, and formulating research questions and hypotheses. 164 students from the 4(th) and 6(th) grades participated in a pilot study where they filled in a pre-test, solved four problems in the learning environment, and answered to a post-test. Students' skills to arrange inquiry steps were evaluated in the theoretical and situational context. The results have demonstrated that the learning environment 'Young Scientist' is applicable for developing learners' inquiry skills: i) it increases students' skills to design an experiment in both theoretical and situational context, and ii) develops statistically significantly students' skills to formulate research questions and hypotheses.

AB The growing popularity of flipped, blended, and online learning, combined with the need to support a student population with increasingly diverse backgrounds, has led to the development and use of online materials to support students' learning of chemistry outside of a face-to-face classroom. Chemistry simulations provide opportunities to make such materials more interactive; however, it is important to understand how to best employ them to support students' independent learning outside of the classroom. The larger ChemSims project aims to determine how screencasts and simulations can be used to best support the development of students' conceptual understanding of core chemistry concepts in such environments. This paper focuses specifically on the concepts of force and energy as they pertain to bonding and intermolecular attractions. It describes the investigation of students' out-of-class use of a PhET simulation that illustrates force and energy changes that occur when two atoms come together or are separated. As an introduction to bonding, students completed out-of-class assignment questions in one of three different treatment conditions: (1) exploring the simulation directly using guided instructions; (2) watching an expert-narrated screencast using the same simulation; or (3) watching an "enhanced screencast", consisting of the expert-narrated screencast plus additional information related to the formation and breaking of bonds in chemical reactions. Comparing scores on pretest and follow-up questions indicated that all treatments resulted in small learning gains with some learning objectives indicating greater gains than others. Further, findings indicate that the enhanced screencast was able to help students better connect this concept to the phenomena of ATP hydrolysis. Finally, using eye tracking to contrast student use of the simulation as compared to the screencast in completing the assignment suggests that, while the screencast may not result in increased conceptual gains, it may serve to make the assignment seem easier than if students are required to engage with the simulation themselves to work through the initial questions.

AB This study was aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CAI vs. classroom lecture for computer science at ICS level. The objectives were to compare the learning effects of two groups with class room lecture and computer assisted instruction studying the same curriculum and the effects of CAI and CRL in terms of cognitive development. Hypothesis of this research were based on six levels of blooms taxonomy as there was one major hypothesis: There is no significant difference exist for CAI student in gaining a high cognitive achievement than students of same level having Traditional CRL. The study was delimited to three colleges of Faisalabad city. The research was true-experimental in nature. The research design followed by researcher is The Pre-test-Post test Equivalent groups Deign. The software used for CAI group was basically the combination of Discovery environment and simulation soft wares, however, the time for drilling and practice was given to student. It a designed to cover the all levels of cognitive domain described by B. S. Blooms ( 1956). A question paper containing 30 items multiple choice test was compiled from the curriculum, with a representative number of questions from each of the cognitive levels. Findings of this research indicate that total gain in cognitive domain by CAI was significantly superior to the total gain in cognitive domain by CRL teaching method. This study concluded that the skills of knowledge, analysis and synthesis assured significant increase. The CAI proved to be very much effective in increasing the evaluation and application skills of students to experimental group. Comprehension skill, however, not much affected by the CAI. According to the results of this study it was suggested that CAI as an effective teaching method should be applied to improve teaching quality and by using CAI it will be possible to eliminate lingual, regional and ethical biases between teacher and student. Key words: computer assisted instructions, classroom lectures, cognitive domain.

AB Adapting training methods to specific teacher traits to best facilitate the training effects for preservice teachers is an important, yet neglected, topic in aptitude-treatment interaction research. This study investigated interactions between four personal traits (CT-dispositions, thinking styles, CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence) and two designed treatments on preservice teachers' behavior change during a computer-simulated teaching experience. One hundred and seventy-eight preservice teachers participated in this study. The CS-TGCTS simulation program was employed to measure the preservice teachers' actual use of effective teacher behaviors, as well as the four targeted personal traits which were measured by three Likert-scale inventories and one multiple-choice test. The results suggest that preservice teachers with high levels of CT-dispositions, CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence - as well as those with judicial or legislative thinking styles - are mindful, analytical, and reflective in their teaching practices and therefore more likely to continually improve their teaching skills.

ID TOOLS
AB In the last decade, new pedagogical models associated with higher education have appeared (e.g. Flipped Teaching, Game-based Learning (GbL), Problem-based Learning (PbL), Simulation-based Learning (SbL), Puzzle-based Learning, Competence-based Education (CbE), Just-in Time Teaching (JiTT), Learning-by doing..., the list is endless); these models promote a change in traditional teaching. New strategies are gaining more and more attention within the educational context. It is not necessary to cite a large number of papers, chapters and books that have appeared in recent years indicating its advantages and benefits in higher education. The purpose has been to improve the teaching-learning process. Undoubtedly, the implementation of these educational strategies improves student motivation and increases their participation in the classroom. Moreover, the use of devices, technologies and ICT tools can help attract students' attention. But... are the new methodologies in higher education so effective? or, in other words, is traditional learning so inefficient?
   There is no doubt that with the new active learning models students can acquire other skills and competencies that were not developed with the more classical methodologies. However, it also has a high added cost that at the moment nobody has dared to indicate: the reduction of the contents of the subjects. If we think of knowledge disciplines related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (also known as STEM), the agenda has been reduced in favour of the development of other much more interactive and participatory activities. These more active activities make students more involved in the subjects, but ... shouldn't the student who chooses a university degree in science or engineering to be sufficiently motivated?
   On the other hand, we must not forget that in the most classic methodologies, the teacher is the one who transmits the knowledge in the classroom. That is, it presents a summary of the necessary knowledge and key concepts, searching for useful or everyday examples that allow their understanding to the students. In this way, students save time during their study because it is not necessary to search for information. The assimilation of knowledge occurs outside the classroom, through review of notes, resolution of exercises and development of activities. This method, which has lasted for centuries, has allowed students to focus on really important content, studying different mathematical principles and theorems, as well as multiple application examples. Therefore, it is not such a lousy method, as the new educational currents want to make us believe.
   It should also be noted that incorporating new digital technologies (apps and devices) in the classroom does not indicate a change in educational methodology. Some new teachers confuse the use of ICT tools with the implementation of new pedagogical models..., nothing is further from reality. Technological advances have replaced the teacher's explanation in the classroom with other techniques such as video-lessons, webinars, improved contents, theory-pills ..., improving the communication channel and making learning more ubiquitous (u-learning), but the learning model has not changed. The teacher (whether face-to-face, online or virtual version) is the instrument to transmit knowledge. The new technologies do not make a teacher good or bad since by themselves they are useless. A good teacher knows how to teach and helps to learn his students. In this paper, the author reflects on the implementation of this pedagogical methodology in higher education; indicating some contexts where this strategy can be useful and effective.

TI Learning residential electrical wiring through computer simulation: The
   impact of computer-based learning environments on student achievement
   and cognitive load
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

AB Multimedia learning environments such as computer simulations are widely accepted as tools for supporting science learning. Although the design of multimedia learning environments can be domain specific, few studies have focused on the use of computer simulations for learning residential electrical wiring. This study aimed to determine whether students using computer simulations learned better than traditional classroom learners in the domain of residential wiring. A quasi-experiment was implemented with 169 high school students. The simulation group participated in a series of computer simulations, whereas the control group received lectures and demonstrations from an instructor. Students' cognitive load as elevated by multimedia leaning tasks was compared with that of students learning using traditional methods. The simulation group learned significantly better and reported higher cognitive load than did the control group. Moreover, the simulation group managed cognitive resources more efficiently on transfer of learning than did the control group. Having more opportunities to interact with a simulation-based learning environment could result in higher cognitive load. The higher cognitive load seemed to result in better performance on the achievement test and, therefore, the learners' mental effort was possibly invested mainly in meaning making in the virtual learning environments. Discussion of the results, instruments and research design, as well as suggestions for future studies are provided.

AB A case study is presented on the use of web-based technology to transition from a lecture-based delivery system to an online/multimedia technology delivery system at the University of Oklahoma's School of industrial Engineering. Coupling web and multimedia technology with a pyramid approach to a simulation course sequence, the goal is to provide both undergraduate and graduate students with strong simulation skills in both modeling and analysis. Web-based technology is used to provide course access to non-traditional students, to re-enforce prerequisite knowledge, and to support learning statistical concepts. The approach has been successful at (i) generating two types of graduates, the simulation modeler and the simulation analyst/consultant, (ii) increasing the retention of non-traditional students (industrial engineering students with full-time jobs and other engineering majors without strong statistical backgrounds), and (iii) graduating two non-traditional students in the School's master's degree program as based on their research in simulation analysis. However, online technologies are not without their disadvantages. While the burden has been eased on student learning and their out-of-class activities, the faculty is now tasked with an increased load of supporting online courses and utilizing web-based technologies both within and outside the classroom.

AB Due to limitations in traditional approaches to didactic and clinical learning, professional veterinary medical students face challenges in developing skills and competencies related to clinical practice. The Veterinary Information Network's (VIN) Virtual Clinic (VVC) aims to support learning by using gaming techniques to simulate clinical case management in a low-risk setting. The VVC lets students explore medical scenarios inside a virtual hospital. The purpose of this article is to describe the development and implementation of a learning approach that blends classroom instructor-directed learning with online simulation-based learning, using the VVC.We share challenges and successes of this approach. The case vignettes in the specific example described herein are for canine multicentric lymphoma. However, the lessons learned through the implementation of this oncology clinic module are expected to apply to a wide range of clinical disciplines.

ID EDUCATION
AB This study provides a description of 34 practicing teachers' beliefs regarding the role of empathy as an attribute in their effectiveness with culturally diverse students. Empathy involves cognitive, affective, and behavioral components that teachers believed were manifested in their practice. All of these teachers had participated in a multicultural professional development program geared to fostering culturally responsive practice. Through a content analysis of more than 125 documents, three themes in teachers' practices emerged: more positive interactions with culturally diverse students, more supportive classroom climates, and more student-centered practices. In addition, teachers discussed their most valuable learning experiences in the professional development course. These included a cross-cultural simulation, cultural immersion trips, and their own experiences as minorities. The results from this study underscore the importance of creating contexts in teacher education and professional development programs in which teachers and preservice teachers use and nurture empathetic dispositions and behaviors.

ID OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE; MOBILE ROBOTS
AB The wider availability of 3D printing has enabled small printable robots (or printbots) to be incorporated directly into engineering courses. Printbots can be used in many ways to enhance lifelong learning skills, strengthen understanding and foster teamwork and collaboration. The experiences outlined in this paper were used in our teaching during the last academic year, although much of the methodology and many of the activities have been used and developed over the past 8 years. They include project based assignments carried out by multidisciplinary and multicultural teams, a number of theoretical and practical classroom and laboratory activities all aimed at familiarizing students with fundamental concepts, programming and simulation, and which now form part of our regular robotics courses, and some brief descriptions of how printable robots are being used by students carrying out final projects for Bachelor and Master degrees. The online resources show many of these activities in action.

AB Multimedia learning resources have diverse content forms which can satisfy the educational needs including multimodal resources, multi-sensory teaching, virtual situated-teaching, simulation classroom, emotion interaction, and so on. So, many teachers/developers create multimedia resources for learning, education and training. In order to avoid repeated efforts of teachers/developers, metadata standards could be used for sharing and reusing multimedia learning resources. This paper describes existent metadata standards and their features respectively. The educational features and needs of multimedia learning resources are analyzed. Some educational features are different from single media, such as teachers and learners' emotion, discourse and behavior, and so on. According to these differences, the gaps between metadata standards and educational needs of multimedia learning resources are listed. Existent metadata standards don't fully describe educational features of multimedia learning resources to share and reuse.

AB The recent advances in information technologies with the increasing interest of large number of individuals in the developing countries to get higher education have led to the evolution of online distance education. Distance e-learning has a possibility to offer education to students who are busy or being unable to attend face-to-face classroom lectures. This study focuses specifically on how distance learning will impact the learning of students taking online software engineering course that includes a lab. It examines the ways that the teacher and the students will perceive the online course so as to be an effective and positive educational experience. The system effectively integrates the multimedia contents of the study materials with the virtual lab and simulation of computer-generated diagrams and models that enhances the productivity of educational process.

AB This study proposes a teaching and research initiative. named SAMAL (Smart AMbience for Affective Learning) that will provide a unique ambient mediated environment for integrating cognitive and affective approaches to enhance learning. Also, this study illustrates a design of SAMAL classroom with affectively evocative scenarios for learning de Bono's six-hat thinking in a course of information management, and proposes a research model to examine the enabling effects of the SAMAL environment on learners' affective experience, learning engagement and creativity. Our empirical results show that SAMAL environment can positively influence the affective experience perceived by learners, encourage their learning engagement, which in turn positively influence their creativity. In particular, the results show that the effect of SAMAL environment on students' learning engagement was mediated by the affective experience they perceived. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although physical hands-on laboratory experiments are commonly used in schools, virtual laboratory environments are also being used in science classrooms. Their possibilities and impact on students' achievement, conceptual understanding, and inquiry skills have been investigated by other researchers. Yet, it is difficult to find studies about the effect of virtual learning environments on written argumentation in science classrooms. In the current study, the influence of hands-on and virtual laboratories on pre-service science teachers' scientific writing was investigated using the science writing heuristic. The participants were 52 pre-service science teachers who were assigned to two conditions. One group used the hands-on laboratory to design and implement experiments and used a paper-based worksheet to write their arguments; the other group did their investigations through a computer-based virtual-tool laboratory and wrote their arguments on the online learning platform. Pre-service science teachers' written arguments were evaluated using content analysis. The findings revealed that the overall quality of written arguments created by pre-service science teachers in both laboratory environments was at an intermediate level. Furthermore, pre-service science teachers who learned in the virtual laboratory posed better testable questions, presented strong and valid evidence, and used multiple representations better than their counterparts in the hands-on laboratory. An important conclusion of the current study is that the science writing heuristic can be used effectively in both virtual and hands-on laboratory environments.

DE higher education in engineering; virtual classroom; modeling of higher
   education; integration of industrial and education processes
AB Application of information technology has changed the work of engineers. Products, processes, and knowledge are handled in comprehensive and sophisticated computer systems. In these systems, engineering objects are described, related, and communicated using wide range of latest advancements in computer and information technology including intelligent computing. Recently, Internet portals organize work of communities of engineers. Because computer methods and tools change frequently, lifetime education of engineers is essential. For this purpose, engineering systems have means for continuous education and training. An experimental engineering portal has been established in the Laboratory of Intelligent Engineering Systems (LIES). It represents integrated product related engineering including modeling, simulation, manufacturing, product data management, knowledge management, communication, and multi site management of project work. As an integrated functionality, and using facilities provided by powerful engineering system, a higher education functionality is being -conceptualized in the LEES. As the methodological background for education, an approach and method for virtual classroom by the authors is being implemented. Competences in BSc and We courses as they are collected from recent industrial engineering technology represent the primary expected advantage of this solution. In this paper, the problem of bridging the gap between higher education and engineering functionality is discussed. Previous works in the area of computer system based higher education and by the authors are introduced. Following this, functionality of engineering system and virtual classroom are compared and concept of Integrated Engineering and Higher Education (IEHE) is proposed. Classroom model by the authors as associative set of structure, content, teaching process, and assessment entities is explained. Next, competence extraction as taxonomy controlled modification of topics in courses, construction of classroom model as object related actions together with relating and constraining of objects, and handling of capability and human intent originated conflicts are discussed. Finally, an experimental laboratory system for product lifecycle management (PLM) system and integrable functionality of the engineering system are concluded as implementation issues.

AB Manufacturing is increasingly important to the balanced education of engineers in all disciplines. While specific operations and processes can often be taught in the classroom, it is difficult to convey a broader understanding of the interrelationship among design, manufacturing, and marketing, and the coordinated effort required to meet the demands of a global marketplace with high product variety and rapid response requirements. In the Cybertronics interactive simulation game, we create a fictional enterprise, the Cybertronics Corporation, in which the user assumes the role of product designer, manufacturing engineer, marketing expert, and product manager. In working through the decisions required in product development, the user addresses the tradeoff among product performance, cost, quality, and time-to-market. The Cybertronics simulation game has been developed in a modular architecture using Multimedia Director as the development environment. The major components include: Electronics Handbook, Manufacturing Handbook, Functional Design, Parts Ordering, Manufacturing Layout and Planning, Manufacturing Control, and Market and Sales. Each section is an enhanced multimedia module with access to video (e.g. manufacturing operations in a factory) and animation (e.g. depiction of manufacturing process principles). The focus of Cybertronics is on electronics manufacturing and the processes involved in the design and manufacturing of circuit-board assemblies for commercial and military electronics products. Cybertronics has been used in both undergraduate and graduate courses in engineering and management at Rensselaer, and also in corporate training sessions. A formal evaluation process of Cybertronics in the classroom has shown that the experience is effective in presenting the principles of manufacturing activities, and has been especially successful in motivating students to understand the larger context of their engineering and management decisions.

AB Integrated approach to education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has recently become a common practice. Technologies such as wireless graphing calculators, electronic whiteboards, and computers help engage students in classroom activities. Modeling and simulation software allow experimentation without usual prerequisites while enabling a pedagogical approach to display interconnectedness of math and science. Controlled simulations and layered approach to learning seem to offer long-sought support for inquiry-based curricula in public schools. Today's jobs require multiple skills, necessitating a broader college education. While students with multiple majors can be seen on college campuses, the overall number of degree holders in technical fields has gone down steadily. A handful of institutions have established multidisciplinary programs to adjust to these concerns and to better serve diverse interests of students.

AB This paper explores the strategies used by a senior teacher to adapt her instruction about covariation among quantities to her students and their learning processes. It analyses data from a teaching experiment conducted in Turin with twenty 15-year-old students. They used a digital simulation of the so-called Galileo experiment - a ball rolling along an inclined plane - to model the quadratic law of its motion. The adaptive instruction of the teacher is examined via a multimodal lens, analysing the semiotic productions active in the classroom: the teacher and her students' utterances, gestures, inscriptions, and the role of instruments within the development of the teaching design. The analysis highlights the primary strategies employed by the teacher during her instruction process and how these strategies support the students in reaching different levels of covariational reasoning, as defined by an extension of the Thompson and Carlson framework. Finally, some pedagogical implications are sketched.

AB AutoTtitor simulates a human tutor by holding a conversation with the learner in natural language. The dialogue is augmented by an animated conversational agent and three-dimensional (3-D) interactive simulations in order to enhance the learner's engagement and the depth of the learning. Grounded in constructivist learning theories and tutoring research, AutoTbtor achieves learning gains of approximately 0.8 sigma (nearly one letter grade), depending on the learning measure and comparison condition. The computational architecture of the system uses the.NET framework and has simplified deployment for classroom trials.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to analyze learning assurance measures derived from a business simulation as part of capstone business strategy courses delivered via distance learning (DL) compared to traditional classroom (on-ground [OG]) delivery modes using experiential learning theory.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A sample of 595 undergraduate capstone business students from 21 course sections taught over a four-year period in a medium-sized private master's level college is investigated. Variables included learning assurance measures from a competitive online simulation (GLO-BUS), gender, business degree major, capstone course grades and cumulative grade point averages. The analytic strategy included correlations, linear regressions, multiple regressions and multivariate analyses of variance.
   Findings
   Results reveal that there are significant differences in learning assurance report (LAR) scores, gender differences and differences between academic majors based on delivery mode (OG versus DL). Simulation performance was higher for DL students, although the relationship between simulation performance and final course grades was not significantly different for OG and DL cohorts.
   Research limitations/implications - To the best of the authors' knowledge, implications for courses, programs, curricula and learning assessment are considered. The strengths (actual performance measures) and potential limitations (e.g. possible deficiency ofmeasures) of LAR scores are discussed.
   Originality/value
   This research compares OG and DL modes for strategic management course outcomes using direct assessments, including simulation learning assurance measures, student characteristics, capstone course grades and student grade point averages.

   Introduction
AB The 21st century workplace is an increasingly intercultural and collaborative environment. As a result, soft skills are being recognized as deficient in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates, as documented in a survey commissioned by the Association of American Colleges and Universities. The social sciences and humanities lag significantly behind science and medicine in the utilization of the new immersive technologies such as virtual reality. Our program seeks to improve essential workplace skills for STEM students through experiential case studies, experienced in immersive virtual reality simulation modules that immerse students in intercultural leadership scenarios. Experiencing something from a distance is a new type of collaborative technology known as telehora. The simulations will be recorded in two genres: via 360-degree cameras utilizing real actors and with computer generated imagery characters. The two recording genres will be compared to determine if they have differential impacts on student presence, engagement, and education outcomes. The modules will be playable on traditional computers as well as virtual reality hardware. We will also compare high-cost virtual reality hardware to low-cost virtual reality and traditional computers, examining how student engagement and outcomes are affected by the different delivery mediums. The research methods to examine the differential impact of simulation genre and delivery medium will include student self-report, facial emotion detection, and a combination of galvanic skin response and electromyography/electrocardiography. The combination of methods will give insights into the effectiveness of the interventions on traditional outcomes as well as giving researchers a better understanding of emotion's role in intercultural leadership behaviors.
   Students will be active participants in the virtual environment, capable of both responding to and looking around in the virtual environment. Students will experience firsthand how the choices they make within the modules change the outcomes of the case. The modules present potential to be deployed in traditional classrooms, online classrooms, and as self-study. Once created, the modules can easily be scaled to provide a safe and replicable experience for large student cohorts with the potential to expand to multiple universities and be used in industry. Students are unable to gain these experiences through formal education by other means, making the experiences good candidates for virtual reality application. A variety of outcomes will be examined, including development in the Intercultural Development Inventory, leadership competencies, and collaborative problem solving skills. The program will provide an immersive and safe learning environment for students to experience and participate in intercultural leadership scenarios that cannot be replicated in traditional classrooms.

AB Brussels-based CEN (the European Committee for Standardization) is the solely recognized organization for the planning drafting and adoption of European Standards in all major areas of business. Concretely, on July, 2013, was published the UNE-CEN/TS 16555-1:2013, the European Standard for Innovation Management. This technical specification provides guidance on establishing and maintaining an innovation management system (IMS).
   On the other hand, when considering the range of available technologies and their potential impacts on learning, an important distinction can be made between two categories of technology tools. With the first of them, students essentially learn "from" the technology. Technologies of the second type are those that engage students in communication, hypothesis testing, and interactive information sharing. Also sometimes referred to as "disruptive technologies", second-type applications have proven to be powerful agents of change in the classroom when teachers learn to adapt their instructional practice to the design and capabilities of these "cognitive tools". Taking into account the above mentioned aspects, this works presents the integration of disruptive technologies for the teaching of Chemistry, from the point of view of the innovation management.
   In this context, innovation management techniques can be used to plan activities at the superior educational level. On the other hand, when integrated meaningfully into curriculum and instruction, technology can positively impact student learning and achievement. Likewise, students using simulations can gain deeper and more flexible knowledge of scientific concepts. In fact, when integrated into curriculum-based student-centred classroom activities, tools such as word processors, spreadsheets, databases, modelling and presentation software can promote the development of such 21st century skills as communication, collaboration, and analytical thinking. "Meaningful integration" of technology, then, refers to the process of matching the most effective tool with the most effective pedagogy to achieve the learning goals of a particular lesson.

AB Especially in vocational education, attention should be paid not only to the use of new technological solutions but also to collaborative learning and cooperative working methods in order to develop students' skills for their future jobs. This study involves a design experiment including the design process of a new game environment, description of the script developed for this game, as well as the empirical study with multiple data collection methods, data analysis, results and conclusions for further work. The aim of the study was twofold. Firstly, we aimed to develop a game environment to simulate the work context of a vocational design process, and secondly, to investigate how effective the game environment is in vocational learning and how scripting affected students' group processes during the game. It seems that, at their best, such "edugames" may enrich learning and the pedagogical use of technology. Although integrating learning and games provides tempting possibilities, it also contains many challenges, such as different group-specific learning processes despite the scripted environment.

AB A nanotechnology module was developed for ninth grade students in the context of teaching chemistry. Two basic concepts in nanotechnology were chosen: (1) size and scale and (2) surface-area-to-volume ratio (SA/V). A wide spectrum of instructional methods (e.g., game-based learning, learning with multimedia, learning with models, project based learning, and storytelling and narratives) was implemented to support students' understanding. Students' interviews and the content of students' final projects were used and analyzed to learn how using a variety of teaching methods influenced students' understanding of basic concepts in nanotechnology. In addition, the study examined which methods enhance students' understanding and which do not, according to students' perceptions. Students felt that most of the teaching methods facilitated their learning, with the exception of two activities: the Hungarian cube, and nano effect simulation; these two activities were very abstract and confused the students. Finally, we formulated recommendations regarding methods for teaching nanotechnology in the future.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the association of middle school student science achievement and attitudes toward science with student-reported frequency of using computers to learn science and other classroom practices. Baseline comparison data were collected on the frequency of student-centred teaching practices (e.g. the use of group experiments during science class) and traditional teaching practices (e.g. having students copy notes during science class) to learn science. The student sample was composed of 294 seventh-grade students enrolled in middle school science. Multiple regression was used to investigate the association of attitudes toward science, student-centred teaching practices, computer usage, and traditional teaching practices with science achievement. Both attitudes toward science and student-centred teaching practices were positively associated with science achievement, and student-centred teaching practice was positively associated with attitude toward science. Computer usage was found to have a negative association with student achievement, which was moderated by traditional teaching practices.

AB In recent years, individual learning path planning has become prevalent in online learning systems, while few studies have focused on teaching path planning for traditional classroom teaching. This paper proposes a target-oriented teaching path optimization scheme for cloud computing-assisted instructions, in which a sequence of learning contents is arranged to ensure the maximum benefit for a given group of students. First, to evaluate the teaching performance, we investigate various student models and define some teaching objectives, including the pass rate, the excellence rate, the average score, and related constraints. Second, a new Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based teaching path planning method is proposed to tackle the learning path by maximizing a multi-objective target while satisfying all teaching constraints. It adopts a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework to find a model-free solution for achieving fast convergence and better optimality. Finally, extensive simulations with a variety of commonly used teaching methods show that our scheme provides nice performance and versatility over commonly used student models.

AB The purpose of the study is to examine the ethical dilemmas among mid-level school leaders in the social-ecological context through role-play simulations. We examined simulations involving role-played ethical scenarios and group debriefings among 30 mid-level school leaders from different Israeli high schools and districts during the MA course in the educational leadership program. A qualitative analysis generated an expanded social-ecological model for mid-level school leaders. The model consists of six main layers: individual, interpersonal, organizational, community, public policy, and technology. Each of the layers is divided into sub-categories. The study's findings reveal the concurrent appearance of the different layers. These findings emphasize the complexity of the role of mid-level school leaders, as they cope simultaneously with a variety of ethical dilemmas characterized by multiple conflicting values. Moreover, the study findings indicated the interpersonal layer to be the most dominant layer, demonstrating mid-level leaders' dual role as both classroom teachers and as team leaders. This study may contribute toward the development and modification of professional training programs for mid-level school leaders. It may also be helpful when designing strategies to deal with ethical challenges and to strengthen the school's ethical leadership.

AB Research in the field of technology-enhanced learning has argued for a broader scope of technology-supported learning environments to include the design of activity systems which position students as active thinkers by reorganizing learning with technology around the practices of scholarly communities. In the context of elementary ecosystems science, this entails structuring classroom activity around the construction and evaluation of epistemic artifacts, such as scientific models and representations, that profitably direct learners' conceptual efforts toward productive forms of inquiry and the construction of new scientific knowledge. In this demonstration-of-concept paper, we present EcoMOD, an elementary ecosystems science curriculum that blends an immersive virtual environment with an agent-based computational modeling tool to support growth in ecological knowledge and scientific practice in learners aged 8 to 11 years old. Specifically, we explore how the design of the EcoMOD activity system supported students' active thinking in scientific inquiry through transformative modeling practices. Analysis of student activity and discourse indicates that engagement in transformative activities supported students in developing more nuanced causal explanations of the ecosystem by the end of the curriculum. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Authentic virtual simulations can transform classroom learning experiences, particularly when organized around the production of epistemic artifacts. Computational modeling and programming tools are successful in supporting ecosystems knowledge construction and complex causal reasoning in learners. Engagement in transformative modeling practices are integral to the construction of new scientific knowledge. What this paper adds Suggests a design framework for meaningfully blending immersive virtual environments with computational modeling and programming tools to support active thinking in scientific inquiry. Demonstrates multi-modal techniques for formative and summative assessment. Indicates that children in this age range are able, with appropriate support, to acquire knowledge and skills well above what is described in curriculum standards. Implications for practice and/or policy Offers practitioners an effective approach for productively integrating computational modeling, science content and inquiry-based practices within elementary science instruction. Demonstrates to policymakers the practicality, affordability and value of immersive learning technologies and agent-based modeling in classroom settings.

   The paper proposes an application of UCB algorithm for item selection in formative assessment. The main advantage of this approach is its ease of implementation when compared to Elo and Multidimensional Item Response Theory based testing. Thus the method should be applicable in virtually any classroom where formative assessment is desired and students have access to computers or phones.
   Abstract There is strong support for formative assessment inclusion in learning processes, with the main emphasis on corrective feedback for students. However, traditional testing and Computer Adaptive Testing can be problematic to implement in the classroom. Paper based tests are logistically inconvenient and are hard to personalize, and thus must be longer to accurately assess every student in the classroom. Computer Adaptive Testing can mitigate these problems by making use of Multi-Dimensional Item Response Theory at cost of introducing several new problems, most problematic of which are the greater test creation complexity, because of the necessity of question pool calibration, and the debatable premise that different questions measure one common latent trait. In this paper a new approach of modelling formative assessment as a Multi-Armed bandit problem is proposed and solved using Upper-Confidence Bound algorithm. The method in combination with e-learning paradigm has the potential to mitigate such problems as question item calibration and lengthy tests, while providing accurate formative assessment feedback for students. A number of simulation and empirical data experiments (with 104 students) are carried out to explore and measure the potential of this application with positive results.

AB Until the late-twentieth century, primary anatomical sciences education was relatively unenhanced by advanced technology and dependent on the mainstays of printed textbooks, chalkboard-and photographic projection-based classroom lectures, and cadaver dissection laboratories. But over the past three decades, diffusion of innovations in computer technology transformed the practices of anatomical education and research, along with other aspects of work and daily life. Increasing adoption of first-generation personal computers (PCs) in the 1980s paved the way for the first practical educational applications, and visionary anatomists foresaw the usefulness of computers for teaching. While early computers lacked high-resolution graphics capabilities and interactive user interfaces, applications with video discs demonstrated the practicality of programming digital multimedia linking descriptive text with anatomical imaging. Desktop publishing established that computers could be used for producing enhanced lecture notes, and commercial presentation software made it possible to give lectures using anatomical and medical imaging, as well as animations. Concurrently, computer processing supported the deployment of medical imaging modalities, including computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasound, that were subsequently integrated into anatomy instruction. Following its public birth in the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web became the ubiquitous multimedia networking technology underlying the conduct of contemporary education and research. Digital video, structural simulations, and mobile devices have been more recently applied to education. Progressive implementation of computer-based learning methods interacted with waves of ongoing curricular change, and such technologies have been deemed crucial for continuing medical education reforms, providing new challenges and opportunities for anatomical sciences educators.

TI Intelligent simulation of the battlefield (ISB)
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper discusses the development of a meta-expert system, the Intelligent Simulation of the Battlefield (ISB) for assisting military commanders with managing battlefield information and decision making. The three main components of the ISB are the Standard Army Training System-Training Exercise Development System (SATS-TREDS), the Janus combat simulation model and the Command Support System (ComSS).
   Integrating simulation with artificial intelligence, the three main components of the ISB merge to enhance the command and control process. ISB creates an environment to measure the effectiveness of battle commanders to focus and operate in a simulated, yet realistic dynamic, information-driven, knowledge-assisted environment. The front-end training preparation component of the ISB structures the exercise based on mission requirements and tasks. Once the training scenario is specified through SATS-TREDS, the ISB utilizes a command interface designed to build information templates for displaying information based on a commander's profile and the particular mission. The ISB system's network is configured to accommodate the flow of information generated by the Janus simulation program. With assistance by ISRA intelligent agents and associates, the information is then pushed to the ComSS decision support system. Due to the enormous flow of information, only certain, preselected data are queried and reported during the battle. Through the SATS-TREDS program the remainder of the information is stored for later reference and review for feedback on future training needs.
   The ISB system promises to be a beneficial tool for classroom, training and operational environments as it conforms to the demanding requirements of realistic, dynamic and flexible simulation users.

AB This paper describes a flexible method of teaching introductory robotics. Students program an autonomous mobile robot to complete a set of tasks of increasing complexity, including multirobot tracking. Two proximity detectors (1 b each) and a pair of photosensors (2 b each) provide six sensory inputs to logic circuits, which control two drive motors and two internal memory flip-flops. The robot brain is a digital logic circuit programmed by loading an ASCII code that specifies the logic circuit configuration, similar in approach to a field-program-mable gate array. The logic circuit design evolves with task complexity. Two internal set/reset flip-flops can be used to design a finite-state machine to implement a memory. One novelty of the method is that students develop and test their logic circuits on a Web-based graphic simulation before downloading the code to an actual robot. The simulation is written in JavaScript to acquire sensor readings and control robot motors to interact with the environment in a flexible manner. The simulation is downloaded with the Web page and runs smoothly on the client's machine, eliminating the need for high-speed connections. The ASCII code producing successful simulation performance is downloaded to an actual robot through a printer port on a PC in the robot laboratory. A microcontroller on the actual robot interprets the ASCII code in the same manner as the simulation. Classroom experience indicates that evolving a robot brain is an effective teaching tool and students enjoy applying logic circuit design to program a robot.

AB There is great potential in making assessment and learning complementary. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of developing a desktop virtual reality (VR) laboratory simulation on the topic of genetics, with integrated assessment using multiple choice questions based on item response theory (IRT) and feedback based on the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. A pre-test post-test design was used to investigate three research questions related to: (1) students' perceptions of assessment in the form of MC questions within the VR genetics simulation; (2) the fit of the MC questions to the assumptions of the partial credit model (PCM) within the framework of IRT; and (3) if there was a significant increase in intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and transfer from pre- to post-test after using the VR genetics simulation as a classroom learning activity. The sample consisted of 208 undergraduate students taking a medical genetics course. The results showed that assessment items in the form of gamified multiple-choice questions were perceived by 97% of the students to lead to higher levels of understanding, and only 8% thought that they made the simulation more boring. Items within a simulation were found to fit the PCM and the results showed that the sample had a small significant increase in intrinsic motivation and self-efficacy, and a large significant increase in transfer following the genetics simulation. It was possible to develop assessments for online educational material and retain the relevance and connectedness of informal assessment while simultaneously serving the communicative and credibility-based functions of formal assessment, which is a great challenge facing education today.

AB Over 20 years of research into the use of cross-curricular drama in secondary science has indicated that this medium enables learning of affective, cognitive and procedural knowledge. To date, academic research has tended to frame successful drama pedagogy as resulting from a Drama-in-Education approach, incorporating extended role plays and simulations of social events. By contrast, research has rarely focused on the scope and context of drama which is devised and used by real people in real situations. Indications from non-academic literature and informal education practice suggest that there is a gap in our knowledge between research and classroom practice. This study focused on teachers' own drama activities in five science lessons taught across schools in Cambridge, Kent, and Hertfordshire. Their classes spanned the ages of 12-16 in the subjects of chemistry, biology, and physics. This study explored the drama forms, teaching objectives, and characteristics by which drama was perceived to enable learning in Science. The findings revealed that drama activities were used to convey a variety of topics that have not yet been recorded in academic literature, and revealed a greater scope for the teaching abstract scientific concepts through mime and role play. These activities were perceived to develop students' visualisation through a range of modalities, which included embodied sensation and anthropomorphic metaphors. Some features reflected the development of thought experiment skills. A pedagogic model was produced based on different levels of interactive talk and multimodal communication.

AB The design of computer-assisted educational materials and programs is a specialty of science education and relies heavily upon the results of science education and educational technology research. This paper explores the implications of this research for successful computer-assisted instruction. Two areas are examined: (1.) Simulations and problem-based learning environments (2.) The basis for the evaluation of distance learning course software. Examples will be given using a project developed by the NASA Classroom of the Future, at the Center for Educational Technologies at Wheeling Jesuit University. There are a number of optics-related computer simulations in CD-ROM based programs such as the award winning Astronomy Village: Investigating the Universe. Most educational designers can identify the characteristics of a good educational simulation. The design of an entire course delivered over the Internet requires high quality software that can maximize not only course material delivery but the conversation and information exchange that must take place as well. A model approach for an entire course using such software will be presented. Particular care will be given to how one evaluates the course software.

AB This article examines the impact of a professional development program aimed at encouraging high school teachers to include more modern physics in their enacted classroom curricula through improved content and pedagogical knowledge. The program was implemented with 17 high school physics teachers (three were the focal point of this study) in Turkey. A multi-case study using mixed-methods analysis followed by a cross-case analysis revealed conceptual and pedagogical gains. Teachers' higher scores on an achievement test indicated their development of increased subject-matter knowledge. Further, classroom observation revealed a shift from lecturing to dialogic practices centered on student sense-making such as discussion, questioning, and interactive use of technology (simulations, videos). In alignment with the professional development, teachers devoted more instructional time to modern physics, increased the conceptual scope of their lessons (more concepts were taught), and adopted instructional approaches that were more dialogic. It is argued that the combined use of legal mandate and teacher development can help address the problematic status of Einsteinian physics as an absent curriculum at the high school level.

DE Use-Modify-Create; Computational Thinking; Lesson Design
AB Computational Thinking (CT) is being infused into curricula in a variety of core K-12 STEM courses. As these topics are being introduced to students without prior programming experience and are potentially taught by instructors unfamiliar with programming and CT, appropriate lesson design might help support both students and teachers. "Use-Modify-Create" (UMC), a CT lesson progression, has students ease into CT topics by first "Using" a given artifact, "Modifying" an existing one, and then eventually "Creating" new ones. While studies have presented lessons adopting and adapting this progression and advocating for its use, few have focused on evaluating UMC's pedagogical effectiveness and claims. We present a comparison study between two CT lesson progressions for middle school science classes. Students participated in a 4-day activity focused on developing an agent-based simulation in a block-based programming environment. While some classrooms had students develop code on days 2-4, others used a scaffolded lesson plan modeled after the UMC framework. Through analyzing student's exit tickets, classroom observations, and teacher interviews, we illustrate differences in perception of assignment difficulty from both the students and teachers, as well as student perception of artifact "ownership" between conditions.

AB In today's world, Global Competence represents a fundamental disposition for teachers who must be able to teach effectively in classrooms with students from diverse backgrounds and manage multiple learning contexts. For these reasons, it is necessary to set up educational activities during initial teacher education programs aimed at developing and assessing preservice teachers' ability to be Global Competent. This study was aimed at designing and creating a set of rubrics that can be used by either teacher educators or preservice teachers, in this case, as a self-assessment instrument. The research design was based on a modified Delphi method composed of five rounds to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. A panel of 31 experts was involved in an iterative process until a consensus among the experts was reached. The rubrics can be employed in several contexts and situations such as: before and after an international experience, during or after a simulation or a workshop based on intercultural and real-world situations.

AB This paper aimed to identify trends in the scientific literature that relate the link between two concepts: historical thinking and historical reenactment. The definition of both concepts and their commonalities were examined. Convinced that History instruction and Heritage education could improve new methods and techniques, and aware of the benefits of reenactments in active learning and participation in and outside the classroom, we came to the obvious conclusion that merging both aspects is a must and should be disseminated. We also analyzed the presence of second-order concepts in reenactment practices and how they are addressed by actors and spectators. Reenactments foster the acquisition of critical thinking by citizens through education; their quality, however, must be improved through research and didactics-didactics based on reenactment that help us value the past and the traces still present in local areas. Local and global identity and heritage, emotions, reproduction of objects, the use of sources, relevance, empathy, multiperspectives, causation, communication, the relationship between past and present, and the sustainable economy proposed by the 2030 Agenda, are all aspects that should take center stage in turning this phenomenon into a living and lasting history as an experience.

AB Most junior high school students considered chemistry as a complicated science subject with an abstract concept, symbols, and terms that must be memorized. The difficulty of learning chemistry made students had low positive perceptions of chemistry. It was needed the right ways to introduce chemistry to them. The purpose of the multiple case study was to explore chemistry multimedia could help students understood chemistry and created a good impression. The study was conducted in three 7th grade classes in different schools. Classroom observations were done in four meetings to collect students' responses toward this multimedia by ending students filling out a questionnaire of impression. Test of classification of matter and its change was given in the last meeting to investigate the level of students' understanding In the way to gain more depth information, two students from each class were an interview about the application of multimedia. The chemistry multimedia made it easier for the teacher to introduce chemistry through a podcast, molymod-like, and digital simulation. This study documented that the appearance of this multimedia could make the students attracted and curious about chemistry.

AB Teaching the subject of the electron transport chain is one of the most challenging aspects of the chemistry curriculum at the high school level. This article presents an educational program called Electron Transport Chain which consists of 14 visual animations including a biochemistry quiz. The program was created in the Adobe Flash CS3 Professional animation program and is designed for high school chemistry students. Our goal is to develop educational materials that facilitate the comprehension of this complex subject through dynamic animations which show the course of the electron transport chain and simultaneously explain its nature. We record the process of the electron transport chain, including connections with oxidative phosphorylation, in such a way as to minimize the occurrence of discrepancies in interpretation. The educational program was evaluated in high schools through the administration of a questionnaire, which contained 12 opened-ended items and which required participants to evaluate the graphics of the animations, chemical content, student preferences, and its suitability for high school biochemistry teaching.

AB Acquiring the skills needed to solve certain types of problems is one of the main challenges of distance university education, demanding extra motivation from students to tackle it. New technology should be one of our great allies in addressing these problems. This article proposes an expert system with a web-based problem-solving simulator for a multidevice environment in order to allow students to access an unlimited number of problems with their corresponding solutions, immediately, anytime and anywhere. The types of problems that can be used are those based on quantitative methods with a fixed methodology to be followed. A successful case study was carried out for the subject Operations Management at the Distance University of Madrid (UDIMA), with three different problem simulators having been developed. The results were very satisfactory compared with previous academic years in terms of motivation. A decrease in students that did not sit the final examination was observed, as was an increase in the number of visits to the Moodle classroom. Students also responded positively in their assessments of the initiative.

AB This paper aims at proposing a methodological strategy for teaching the modelling of dynamic scenarios from Multivariable Data Tables using Microsoft Excel as a technological tool. It provides a step-by-step guide for improving the teaching-learning method on the development of financial models, which could also be used in other areas. The methodology allows identifying the most important aspects of developing financial models so students-professors could be guided towards a more pedagogical approach promoting the incorporation of technological tools in the classroom. This work plays a pivotal role in financial modelling teaching since it provides relevant elements leading to the development of systematic thinking among university students based on cognitive activities. Also, various contributions to research on the teaching-learning process in modelling are discussed. For validating the proposal, an airport's financial valuation was used as a case study. As a result, this paper contributes to increasing the role of computational tools and students-professors involvement in the development of systemic thinking and cognitive skills.

AB Within the last 10 years, new tools for assisting in the teaching and learning of academic skills and content within the context of science have arisen. These new tools include multiple types of computer software and hardware to include (video) games. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the effect of computer learning games in the form of three-dimensional serious educational games, two-dimensional online laboratories, and traditional lecture-based instruction in the context of student content learning in science. In particular, this study examines the impact of dimensionality, or the ability to move along the X-, Y-, and Z-axis in the games. Study subjects (N = 551) were randomly selected using a stratified sampling technique. Independent strata subsamples were developed based upon the conditions of serious educational games, online laboratories, and lecture. The study also computationally models a potential mechanism of action and compares two- and three-dimensional learning environments. F test results suggest a significant difference for the main effect of condition across the factor of content gain score with large effect. Overall, comparisons using computational models suggest that three-dimensional serious educational games increase the level of success in learning as measured with content examinations through greater recruitment and attributional retraining of cognitive systems. The study supports assertions in the literature that the use of games in higher dimensions (i.e., three-dimensional versus two-dimensional) helps to increase student understanding of science concepts.

AB Developing of cognitive competencies in scientific, mathematical and technological fields is one of the most important goals for educational systems across the world. In this paper, we present a way in which new computational technologies can support learning in some interdisciplinary lessons at the upper secondary level. We will refer to a new kind of classrooms equipped with multi-touch technology, available in eight schools in Romania, thanks to a project implemented by the Project Management Unit with Foreign Finance-Education Ministry in partnership with SIVECO ROMANIA and "Carol I" National Defence University. This new technology allows an integrated approach, is suitable for studies of complex issues and fosters collaborative activities. We want to present one of the ways in which the multi-touch laboratory of the National College "Mihai Eminescu" Satu Mare is used for teaching and learning in scientific field. We refer to the manner in which the uses of computer simulations improve the understanding of scientific concepts. During the engagement with the model, there is an interaction between students' current understanding and the computational models they use, facilitated by the visualization of different states that the system can have. Students can modifir variables of the model, question and test hypotheses. In a constructivist learning approach the students create their own models and simulations in order to express their conceptions on how a given scientific process works. By working in team, students learn both from the teacher and from the other students. The assessment is formative and takes into account not only students 'products, but the entire process. This interdisciplinary approach aims developing computational and analytical thinking, as well as the development of the capacity of investigation and working in a team.

AB A new generation of networked classroom technology immerses students and teachers in the group-level construction of powerful mathematical and scientific concepts. We examine these networks from a sociocultural point of view as a new form of mediating artifact. We present a mixed-method, microgenetic analysis to characterize students' appropriation of mathematical content and practice as mediated by the Participatory Simulations system. Central findings of the study are that networked activities provided the opportunity for students and the teacher to: (a) act on multiple representations, (b) create collectively a linked set of mathematical objects that they could examine and discuss together, and (c) exercise agency in the production of mathematical discourse and practice. These opportunities fostered the development of powerful mathematical discourse.

AB This study explored young children's understandings of targeted lunar concepts, including when the moon can be observed, observable lunar phase shapes, predictable lunar patterns, and the cause of lunar phases. Twenty-one children (ages 7-9 years) from a multi-aged, self-contained classroom participated in this study. The instructional intervention included lunar data gathering, recording, and sharing, which integrated Starry Night planetarium software and an inquiry-based instruction on moon phases. Data were gathered using semi-structured interviews, student drawings, and a card sorting activity before and after instruction. Students' lunar calendars and written responses, participant observer field notes, and videotaped class sessions also provided data throughout the study. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. Nonparametric statistical analyses were also performed to support the qualitative findings. Results reflected a positive change in children's conceptual understanding of all targeted concepts including the cause of moon phases, which is remarkable considering the complexity and abstractness of this spatial task. Results provided evidence that computer simulations may reduce the burden on children's cognitive capacity and facilitate their learning of complex scientific concepts that would not be possible to learn on their own.

ID POLICY IMPLEMENTATION
AB The expectation that educators will use data in the service of school improvement and planning is a major feature of national and local reform agendas. Prior research has found that the principal plays a critical role in making policymakers' visions for data use a reality at the school and classroom levels. Most prior studies, however, have not fleshed out how the principal functions as a key agent in influencing other key players in data use. This article will illustrate the actions of the principal, teachers, students, and district personnel through simulation models of principal leadership that we developed based on a case study of a high school implementing this reform. We use these models both as a framework for understanding our findings and as a way to enhance understanding of the processes by which educational reform is co-constructed through the simultaneous mediation of the multiple agents involved in the system.

AB Demonstrations can be very effective at engaging students, generating interest in a topic, and enhancing student learning. Demonstrations can occur at three different stages of a course topic: as an introduction, as a wrap-up and an aid used throughout the class discussion of a topic. A key component to an effective demonstration is active student engagement throughout the entire process. This means students are involved in discussing the purpose of the demo; predicting what will happen during the demo; discussing who developed theories to help us understand what happens during the demo; and comparing observations to predictions, as opposed to simply passively watching a demonstration. This paper presents a model for infusing demonstrations into an engineering science class and the use of this model during a semester. Demonstrations in this class incorporate both software simulation and physical models of dynamic systems. While physical models provide a concrete example, computer simulations allow the exploration of "what-if" scenarios and greater meta-cognitive activities. Assessment includes components from both faculty and students.

AB Research about modeling emphasizes the importance of heterogeneity in science learning. At the same time, a growing body of scholarship seeks curricular pathways for epistemic and representational convergence. In response to this tension, we propose two constructs: heterogeneity-seeking curricula and commitments. Heterogeneity-seeking curricula emphasize generating and valuing multiple representations of phenomena, offering an image of science that foregrounds messy, nonlinear aspects of learning. Commitments parallel epistemic cognition research by focusing on values that shape students' modeling; however, rather than looking for disciplinary practices in students' modeling, commitments take students' values as a starting point, mapping them to disciplinary resources not typically foregrounded in science education. Using a lens of commitments, we analyze six implementations of a heterogeneity-seeking 6th grade modeling curriculum, and we compare the lens of commitments to the lens of epistemic ideals. Then, we show that, in this context, commitments functioned like epistemic ideals by acting as evaluative resources during modeling. However, commitments also extended beyond this role by helping students ask and explore questions that were not anticipated by the curriculum, problematizing a view of phenomena as objective and external to students' modeling work and showing them instead to be a production of the classroom's multidimensional modeling discourse.

AB In educational process the wide usage of computers and informational technologies led to interactive formation of education. Interactive form of education is formed with the integrated use of not only the computer but also electronic media television. In an interactive way of learning using of multimedia technologies is very expensive, but they provide visibility.
   Information computer technology learning programme expands analysis of teaching process that is reasonable using general principles in targeted training consisting theoretical basis.
   Classroom self-study of the student is determined by the training plan and by the programme of learning discipline, regularized by educational timetable and held by heading the lectures, seminars laboratory work of colloquiums.
   Taking part in IWS: self-work of the students, masters, and doctorants without teachers and under the teacher's headings (IWS). Main extracurricular types of individual work: looking through lectures, summarizing, assimilation-abstracts, opposition abstracts, preparing doclades, writing annotations for a book and articles, creating glossaries, assimilation researching tasks, deep analysis scientific-methodological literature, holding experimentation, preparing for colloquiums, practical and seminar lessons, scientific or bad review, project methods, telecommunicational projects, training programmes (individual thematical educational plans), assimilation of creative diploma course work.

AB The main purpose of this study is to design a "Courseware Development Model" (CDM) and investigate its effects on pre-service teachers' academic achievements in the field of geography and attitudes toward computer-based education (ATCBE). The CDM consisted of three components: content (C), learning theory, namely, meaningful learning (ML), and multimedia (M). The CDM is designed to show the synthesis of the C and M components under ML In this study, an experimental design including pre-test and post-test groups is used to define the efficiency of the CDM. There are 31 pre-service teachers in the control group, 28 pre-service teachers in the meaningful learning theory group-ML, and 30 pre-service teachers in GTC group that uses geography teaching courseware-GTC based on the CDM. The results of the analysis indicate that the courseware is quite effective, improving pre-service teachers' academic achievements as well as their ATCBE scores. The results also suggest that the new model has an appropriate structure for courseware design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The COVID-19 challenge found many instructors in unchartered territory. While some had experience in planning flipped or blended lessons, switching to 100% online instruction was unfamiliar. Many educators faced the problems of too many resources to sift through and too little time to master them before beginning online instruction. While numerous technology tools are available for use during remote learning, this communication focuses on the applications commonly used and vetted by teachers in Maine Township High School District 207. The resources introduced and described in this paper include applications for communication, creation of interactive videos, applications of games for the classroom, computer simulations, online assessments, and opportunities for student voice and choice. Further details and online support to learn these applications are noted. These technological tools are also useful during flipped or blended lessons. The applications are discussed as they are implemented during specific stages of the SE instructional model, which includes these five phases: Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, and Evaluate. Using this carefully planned sequence of instruction places students at the center of learning, whether in face-to-face or virtual instruction.

AB This paper discusses how application building has been integrated into a set of graduate and undergraduate engineering courses that contain computational simulation learning outcomes. Applications (apps) were first included in a multidisciplinary modeling graduate course that culminates in the end-of-semester research effort. At the undergraduate level, apps were added into a two-course mechanical engineering thermo-fluids sequence. Since introducing apps, students have become demonstrably more engaged in the subject matter and are devoting more time out of the classroom to understand fundamental concepts.
   Simulations have long been used to analyze and predict performance in order to guide engineering design teams. Now, commercial software suppliers have bundled application building into their offerings. An effective app has a simplified interface yet it contains the full efficacy of the underlying model without exposing the end user to its complexity. Within the modeling software, COMSOL Multiphysics (R), an Application Builder allows developers to quickly create easy-to- use apps based on working models. The finished app provides for the inputs, settings, and outputs the user is allowed to control and view.
   Companies as well as research organizations are using apps to extend product models to their constituents, be it customers, supply chain members or the broader scientific community. Leveraging simulation models accompanied by apps is proving to be an efficient way to add an additional skillset to our graduates as they enter the workplace. The paper provides an overview of how application building is employed at the engineering graduate and undergraduate levels. Examples of modeling and simulations assigned in the aforementioned courses are discussed. Illustrations of student work as well as the assessment criteria used to measure performance are presented.

TI A Theoretical and Evidence-Based Conceptual Design of MetaDash: An

ID METAANALYSIS; ISSUES
AB Teachers' ability to self-regulate their own learning is closely related to their competency to enhance self-regulated learning (SRL) in their students. Accordingly, there is emerging research for the design of teacher dashboards that empower instructors by providing access to quantifiable evidence of student performance and SRL processes. Typically, they capture evidence of student learning and performance to be visualized through activity traces (e.g., bar charts showing correct and incorrect response rates, etc.) and SRL data (e.g., eye-tracking on content, log files capturing feature selection, etc.) in order to provide teachers with monitoring and instructional tools. Critics of the current research on dashboards used in conjunction with advanced learning technologies (ALTs) such as simulations, intelligent tutoring systems, and serious games, argue that the state of the field is immature and has 1) focused only on exploratory or proof-of-concept projects, 2) investigated data visualizations of performance metrics or simplistic learning behaviors, and 3) neglected most theoretical aspects of SRL including teachers' general lack of understanding their's students' SRL. Additionally, the work is mostly anecdotal, lacks methodological rigor, and does not collect critical process data (e.g. frequency, duration, timing, or fluctuations of cognitive, affective, metacognitive, and motivational (CAMM) SRL processes) during learning with ALTs used in the classroom. No known research in the areas of learning analytics, teacher dashboards, or teachers' perceptions of students' SRL and CAMM engagement has systematically and simultaneously examined the deployment, temporal unfolding, regulation, and impact of all these key processes during complex learning. In this manuscript, we 1) review the current state of ALTs designed using SRL theoretical frameworks and the current state of teacher dashboard design and research, 2) report the important design features and elements within intelligent dashboards that provide teachers with real-time data visualizations of their students' SRL processes and engagement while using ALTs in classrooms, as revealed from the analysis of surveys and focus groups with teachers, and 3) propose a conceptual system design for integrating reinforcement learning into a teacher dashboard to help guide the utilization of multimodal data collected on students' and teachers' CAMM SRL processes during complex learning.

AB Pre-laboratory practices and online pre-laboratory resources have been implemented in laboratory courses through various instructional approaches. This study seeks to elicit information about how online multimedia resources are embraced and used in the course system and which factors might affect the adoption of the resources in this context. This research was designed as a case study in order to explore the enablers and barriers of online multimedia resource adoption and associated problems in the system through two resources developed in video and simulation formats. Interviews, observations, and documents were applied so as to provide a detailed perspective of the course and the phenomenon. The findings of the study revealed that the multimedia components of the resources attracted the students' interest and engagement, and affected the users' preparation routines; however, attitude toward the course and resources, lack of policy practices and support, quality of the resources, problems in classroom practices, and administration were found to be prominent issues that challenged the adoption of online resources. The study offers suggestions concerning how to adopt the online resources into laboratory courses, and insights about the implications of online resources and their different multimedia features are also presented.

DE Linear function; Graphic; Modellus; Computer simulation; Teaching
AB The Official Portuguese curriculum of Mathematics [1] considers that, in the 7th grade classes (12-13 years old students) students begin with the study of the topic "Functions". This algebraic topic is an introduction to the concept of function taking to account the graphical representation of the functions. A special attention is given to the direct proportionality and the particular case of direct proportionality relationship between two quantities be represented by a linear function.
   Students should understand the relationships between tables, graphs and symbols. As they work with multiple representations of functions such as, numeric, graphic and symbolic, they develop a better understanding of the function concept [2].
   The Information and Communications Technology (ICT) is a powerful educational tool for the dissemination of knowledge, as well as for student learning. The software Modellus is addressed to the teaching and learning of mathematics that allows students and teachers to carry out experiments with mathematical models, in particular, to analyse the variation of the function and the respective graphical representation [3]. On the other hand, mathematical modelling as classroom practice is a very current international trend research [4].
   This paper explores the Modellus applicability in the linear function learning with twenty students of 7th grade of a Portuguese School. The specific objective is to highlight the contributions of the use of computer simulations with Modellus on student learning, for the study of linear functions.
   Methodologically, was opted a qualitative and interpretative research approach, based on a case study. Data collection was done through direct observation of a lesson and written productions of students. An activity with an inquiry was drafted and applied in a 7th grade class during a mathematical class of fifty minutes, who answered individually to the data items.
   The results show that the developed proposal is valid and appropriate for students in 7th grade class. In addition, it was noted that during the study of the linear function, the simulations allowed a better development of the ability to work with various types of representations, promoting the ability to identify the variation and analysis of induced effect by changing the proportionality parameter value into the family of linear functions.

AB This study lies at an intersection between advancing educational data mining methods for detecting students' knowledge-in-action and the broader question of how conceptual and mathematical forms of knowing interact in exploring complex chemical systems. More specifically, it investigates students' inquiry actions in three computer-based models of complex chemical systems when their goal is to construct an equation relating physical variables of the system. The study's participants were 368 high-school students who interacted with the Connected Chemistry (CC1(1)) curriculum and completed identical pre- and post-test content knowledge questionnaires. The study explores whether and how students adapt to different mathematical behaviors of the system, examines how these explorations may relate to prior knowledge and learning in terms of conceptual and mathematical models, as well as components relating to understanding systems. Students' data-collection choices were mined and analyzed showing: (1) In about half the cases, mainly for two out of the three models explored, students conduct mathematically-astute (fit) explorations: (2) A third of the students consistently adapt their strategies to the models' mathematical behavior: (3) Fit explorations are associated with prior conceptual knowledge, specifically understanding of the system as complex, however, the three explorations' fitness is predicted by the understanding of distinct sets of systems' components: (4) Fit explorations are only somewhat associated with learning along complementary dimensions. These results are discussed with respect to 1) the importance of a conceptual understanding regarding individual system elements even when engaged in large-scale quantitative problem solving, 2) how distinct results for the different models relate to previous literature on conceptual understanding and particular affordances of the models, 3) the importance of engaging students in creating mathematical representations of scientific phenomena, as well as 4) educational applications of these results in learning environments.

The analysis of long-term and high-frequency sensor data combined with simulation modeling enables interpretation of complex ecological phenomena, and the computational skills needed to conduct these analyses are increasingly being integrated into graduate student training programs in ecology. Despite its importance, however, computational literacythat is, the ability to harness the power of computer technologies to accomplish tasksis rarely taught in undergraduate ecology classrooms, representing a major gap in training students to tackle complex environmental challenges. Through our experience developing undergraduate curricula in long-term and high-frequency data analysis and simulation modeling for two environmental science pedagogical initiatives, Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) and Macrosystems EDDIE, we have found that students often feel intimidated by computational tasks, which is compounded by the lack of familiarity with software (e.g., R) and the steep learning curves associated with script-based analytical tools. The use of prepackaged, flexible modules that introduce programming as a mechanism to explore environmental datasets and teach inquiry-based ecology, such as those developed for Project EDDIE and Macrosystems EDDIE, can significantly increase students' experience and comfort levels with advanced computational tools. These types of modules in turn provide great potential for empowering students with the computational literacy needed to ask ecological questions and test hypotheses on their own. As continental-scale sensor observatory networks rapidly expand the availability of long-term and high-frequency data, students with the skills to manipulate, visualize, and interpret such data will be well-prepared for diverse careers in data science, and will help advance the future of open, reproducible science in ecology.

AB Background: A number of studies across different disciplines have investigated students' learning styles. Differences are known to exist between graduate and baccalaureate nursing students. However, few studies have investigated the learning styles of students in graduate entry nursing programs.
   Objectives: Study objective was to describe graduate entry nursing students' learning styles.
   Design/Setting/Participants/Methods: A descriptive design was used for this study. The Index of Learning Styles (ILS) was administered to 202 graduate entry nursing student volunteers at a southwestern university. Descriptive statistics, tests of association, reliability, and validity were performed. Graduate nursing students and faculty participated in data collection, analysis, and dissemination of the results.
   Results: Predominant learning styles were: sensing - 82.7%, visual - 78.7%, sequential - 65.8%, and active - 59.9%. Inter-item reliabilities for the postulated subscales were: sensing/intuitive (alpha = 0.70), visual/verbal (alpha = 0.694), sequential/global (alpha = 0.599), and active/reflective (alpha = 0.572). Confirmatory factor analysis for results of validity were: chi(2)(896) = 1110.25, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.779, TLI = 0.766, WRMR = 1.14, and RMSEA =0.034.
   Conclusions: Predominant learning styles described students as being concrete thinkers oriented toward facts (sensing); preferring pictures, diagrams, flow charts, demonstrations (visual); being linear thinkers (sequencing); and enjoying working in groups and trying things out (active),. The predominant learning styles suggest educators teach concepts through simulation, discussion, and application of knowledge. Multiple studies, including this one, provided similar psychometric results. Similar reliability and validity results for the ILS have been noted in previous studies and therefore provide sufficient evidence to use the ILS with graduate entry nursing students. This study provided faculty with numerous opportunities for actively engaging students in data collection, analysis, and dissemination of results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB More and more educators are adopting simulations for teaching students and training individuals. A more comprehensive model proposing key simulation features is needed for simulation designers and educators. The aim of the study is to propose a theoretical model for examining simulation features in digital-based learning and the impact of simulation features on higher order thinking. Data was collected from 301 business management students from two universities. Study One focused on a university in the U.S. (North America) and Study Two focused on a university in Peru (South America). The findings; confirm that the three key components comprising simulation features are: simulation design, simulation; interactivity, and simulation realism. The results also support the operationalization and conceptualization of simulation features as a multi-factor, higher-order construct. Lastly, simulation features have an impact on higher order thinking skills, including critical thinking and reflective thinking. Educators and content developers should ensure they consider the specific simulation features discussed in this research when designing and selecting simulations.

AB Science disciplines are inherently multimodal, involving written and spoken language, bodily gestures, symbols, diagrams, sketches, simulation and mathematical formalism. Studies have shown that explicit multimodal teaching approaches foster enhanced access to science disciplines. We examine multimodal classroom practices in a physics extended curriculum programme (ECP) through the lens of new materialism. As De Freitas and Sinclair note in their book, Mathematics and the Body, there is growing research interest in embodiment in mathematics (and science) education-that is, the role played by students' bodies, in terms of gestures, verbalisation, diagrams and their relation to the physical objects with which they interact. Embodiment can be viewed from a range of theoretical perspectives (for example, cognitive, phenomemological, or social semiotic). However, they argue that their new materialist approach, which they term "inclusive materialism", has the potential for framing more socially just pedagogies. In this article, we discuss a multimodal and new materialist analysis of a lesson vignette from a first-year extended curriculum physics course. The analysis illuminates how an assemblage of bodily-paced steps-gestures-diagrams becomes entangled with mathematical concepts. Here, concepts arise through the interplay of modes of diagrams, gestures and bodily movements. The article explores how multimodal and new materialist perspectives might contribute to reconfiguring pedagogical practices in extended curriculum programmes in physics and mathematics.

AB Changes in the environment in which clinical medical education takes place in the United States has profoundly affected the quality of the learning experience. A shift to out-patient based care, minimization of hospitalization time, and shrinking clinical revenues has changed the teaching hospital or "classroom" to a degree that we must develop innovative approaches to medical education. One solution is the Virtual Patient Project. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer-based multimedia technology, we are building a library of simulated patient encounters that will serve to fill some of the educational gaps that the current health care system has created.
   This project is part of a newly formed and unique organization, the Harvard Medical School-Beth Israel Deaconess Mount Auburn Institute for Education and Research (the Institute), which supports in-house educational design, production, and faculty time to create Virtual Patients. These problem-based clinical cases allow the medical student to evaluate a patient at initial presentation, order diagnostic tests, observe the outcome and obtain context-sensitive feedback through a computer program designed at the Institute. Multimedia technology and authoring programs have reached a level of sophistication to allow content experts (the teaching faculty) to design and create the majority of the program themselves and to allow students to adapt the program to their individual learning needs.

AB Experiential learning, or learning by doing approach actively involves the students in a concrete experience and helps them to become confident. As compared to traditional classroom based learning - which might even include a component of experiential learning such as business simulations, our model of "Experiential Learning" which was developed on the principle of "linking classroom with the business community" not only targets skill building, but it also seeks to benefit the local businessmen in their efforts to open up to new markets. Therefore it includes a real life experience and contact with real business people; allowing students to become not only confident but also more "motivated". In this study, we will share our first outcomes of an ongoing research project covering a series of experiential learning methods. We have developed an experiential learning model for students of international trade and marketing in Gediz University, a foundation university unique for hosting more than 70 nationalities in Izmir, Turkey. The project covers the small and medium sized enterprises (SME's) in the region, which are in need of support in terms of accessing international markets. One of our aims was also to examine how the multicultural nature of a university can be utilized also for the benefit of the local business. Our findings show that the impact of such a real life experience model on student interest and motivation is high. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced drastic changes in all layers of life. Social distancing and lockdown drove the educational system to uncharted territories at an accelerated pace, leaving educators little time to adjust.
   Objectives: To describe changes in teaching during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We described the steps implemented at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine during the initial 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic to preserve teaching and the academic ecosystem.
   Results: Several established methodologies, such as the flipped classroom and active learning, demonstrated effectiveness. In addition, we used creative methods to teach clinical medicine during the ban on bedside teaching and modified community engagement activities to meet COVID-19 induced community needs.
   Conclusions: The challenges and the lessons learned from teaching during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted us to adjust our teaching methods and curriculum using multiple online teaching methods and promoting self-learning. It also provided invaluable insights on our pedagogy and the teaching of medicine in the future with emphasis on students and faculty being part of the changes and adjustments in curriculum and teaching methods. However, personal interactions are essential to medical school education, as are laboratories, group simulations, and bedside teaching.

TI Exploring Shifts in Middle School Learners' Modeling Activity While

AB Modeling and using technology are two practices of particular interest to K-12 science educators. These practices are inextricably linked among professionals, who engage in modeling activity with and across a variety of representational technologies. In this paper, we explore the practices of five sixth-grade girls as they generated models of smell diffusion using drawing, stop-motion animation, and computational simulation during a multi-day workshop. We analyze video, student discourse, and artifacts to address the questions: In what ways did learners' modeling practices, reasoning about mechanism, and ideas about smell shift as they worked across this variety of representational technologies? And, what supports enabled them to persist and progress in the modeling activity? We found that the girls engaged in two distinct modeling cycles that reflected persistence and deepening engagement in the task. In the first, messing about, they focused on describing and representing many ideas related to the spread of smell at once. In the second, digging in, they focused on testing and revising specific mechanisms that underlie smell diffusion. Upon deeper analysis, we found these cycles were linked to the girls' invention of "oogtom," a representational object that encapsulated many ideas from the first cycle and allowed the girls to restart modeling with the mechanistic focus required to construct simulations. We analyze the role of activity design, facilitation, and technological infrastructure in this pattern of engagement over the course of the workshop and discuss implications for future research, curriculum design, and classroom practice.

AB Mathematical modeling is both an important tool to professional engineers and instructional method in engineering education. This paper reviews the literature around mathematical modeling activities in the undergraduate engineering classroom. Twenty-seven journal articles were selected through a literature review process based on decided inclusion and exclusion criteria. From there, multiple themes arose surrounding the topics of student strategies to mathematical modeling, instructional implementation of mathematical modeling, and assessment of these activities. The result of the study is a clearer picture of what is most effective in implementation of mathematical modeling methods, as well as the effects of modeling activities on the learning of undergraduate engineering students. In addition, considerations around assessment of mathematical modeling activities are discussed. This study also identifies gaps in the literature that need bridged to obtain a holistic view of mathematical modeling activities and their true utility to the education of our engineering workforce.

AB This paper presents a research protocol for three longitudinal, multisite cluster-randomized controlled trials of the National Institute for School Leadership's Executive Development Program. This program is a comprehensive professional development initiative designed to improve leadership knowledge and skills of school principals across the United States. Through classroom instruction, simulations, interactive online sharing of ideas, and other resources, this program provides for a yearlong, cohort-based professional development program. To measure the effects of the program and coaching, longitudinal, multisite cluster-randomized trials (MSCRT) will be conducted in three states involving 270 schools to estimate the impact of principal access to the program and coaching on such relevant outcomes as student achievement, principal leadership skills, school climate, and teaching conditions.

AB Using PISA data for 16 Western OECD countries having comprehensive school systems, we explore the conditions under which the socioeconomic composition of schools affects educational efficiency and equality, to a greater or lesser extent. First, a multilevel analysis is applied to examine and compare the effect of school socioeconomic composition on students' outcomes across countries and comprehensive models. Second, a simulation exercise shows the variations in the efficiency and equality levels that would result in two distinct hypothetical school scenarios in each country-a segregated scenario and a nonsegregated scenario. We find that a hypothetical reduction in school segregation would positively affect educational equality in all of the countries considered, but the impact on levels of educational efficiency in individual countries varies with the structure of comprehensive schooling.

AB Lab instructors, for both high school and undergraduate college level courses, face issues of constricted time within the lab period and limited student engagement with prelab materials. To address these issues, an online prelab delivery system named LabLessons is developed and tested out in a high school chemistry classroom. The system supplements the laboratory experience by providing visualizations and simulations of concepts to prepare students for the practical experiments. The system requires students to answer prelab questions online, which provides immediate feedback and cuts down on last minute copying of answers that instructors anecdotally reported with paper laboratories. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and improved outcomes for students who have used LabLessons. In addition, the ease of use of the system and better preparedness for the lab is noted by the instructor.

ID TEACHING EVOLUTION
AB This classroom activity highlights how evolution by natural selection is nonteleological-that is, not guided by need, by organismal intent, by inherent progress, by an external ideal, or by any observable pur posive agent. Rather, it is driven by chance opportunity, environmental context, and historical happenstance. Students simulate the evolution of a population of tin cans, based on temperature retention/loss in either arctic or hot desert habitats. Chance and necessity interact in separate lab groups (as isolated populations), based on similar starting organisms. The process demonstrates not only selection but also how even organisms in similar environments may not evolve with identical traits, depending on available mutations. It shows that even when selection occurs, it may not do so consistently or uniformly with each generation. It shows both divergence based on different contexts of selection and variability based on the vagaries of history.

AB Background: Phone simulations offer educators unique opportunities for teaching and assessment with reduced scheduling and location barriers. Problem: Challenges to learner assessments are multifaceted, including decreased availability of clinical sites, preceptors, and, at times, clinical instructors. Approach: This article describes the creation and implementation of diverse phone simulations at multiple levels of nursing education and provides suggestions for broader replication and adaptation. Outcomes: Phone simulations are easily implemented, well received, and helpful in assessing student learning and progression. At the generalist level, telephone SBAR (situation, background, assessment, and recommendation) simulations promote essential communication skills imperative in the delivery of safe and effective care. For advanced practice learners, phone simulations are easily applied across multiple populations and specialties. Guided reflections following simulation offer learners an opportunity to immediately self-remediate. Conclusions: Phone simulations provide adaptable opportunities to support learning and assess knowledge and competency within educational and clinical settings.

DT Article
AB Japanese is among the international languages in extreme demand in the modern education system. There is a technological revolution in language learning, with blended learning (BL) in the classroom and online resources offering the possibility of autonomous learning education. The advancement of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and the development of the Internet, predominantly the Web, has transformed the way students get curriculum materials in online environments. Teaching Japanese languages has experienced crucial changes with multimedia technologies aimed at simulating a native-speaking environment in audition and oral communication. Evaluating student readiness for online learning is the beginning point for online course design using the multimedia network. Hence, this paper proposes the Multimedia Network-assisted Online Japanese Language Teaching Method (MN-OJLTM) to enhance student engagement in the online learning environment. This study identifies probabilities for better incorporation of technology and Japanese language learning and learners' interest and desires via tactical education of Japanese online courses. This paper examines the role and influence of an intelligent learning environment of ICT multimedia in Japanese education. Experimental outcomes show that the suggested MN-OJLTM method enhances the accuracy of usage and Japanese language students' fluency and expression in writing and speaking. The simulation outcomes demonstrate that the proposed MN-OJLTM method improves student learning ability ratio by 98.4%, language fluency level by 96.2%, performance ratio by 97.5%, student engagement ratio by 95.6%, and efficiency ratio by 97.9% compared to other popular methods.

AB The use of digital learning environments and Flash games or simulations has received much attention in the research literature. Many are quite sophisticated where the user is enveloped in an alternative world and often engages with a virtual or alternative reality. These digital learning environments may be best suited to single-user per computer situations, however changing teachers' approaches can be difficult. Here we report an attempt to incorporate digital learning into the whole-class setting. Teachers use computers in schools in a variable manner. Often, such attempts are anecdotally reported to consist of single outdated computers in a poor state of repair with multiple user groups struggling to access information or at the other extreme, dedicated computer rooms are provided but these require a level of support that is often lacking. Three Flash games were developed for learning concepts from the Irish science curriculum with a view to bringing about conceptual change. Once the games were developed, they were used in conjunction with experimental hands-on activities, which helped to contextualize the digital learning component. The evaluations were ranked according to the rubric provided, ranks were tabulated with case ranks forming rows and question ranks forming columns, thus a matrix was produced for each lesson. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was applied to this resulting matrix and plots made of emerging dimensions. Since the data are non-metric, they are transformed into Euclidian distances, which are then plotted.

AB Multiple external representations (MERs) have been widely used in science teaching and learning. Theories such as dual coding theory and cognitive flexibility theory have been developed to explain why the use of MERs is beneficial to learning, but they do not provide much information on pedagogical issues such as how and in what conditions MERs could be introduced and used to support students' engagement in scientific processes and develop competent scientific practices (e.g., asking questions, planning investigations, and analyzing data). Additionally, little is understood about complex interactions among scientific processes and affordances of MERs. Therefore, this article focuses on pedagogical affordances of MERs in learning environments that engage students in various scientific processes. By reviewing literature in science education and cognitive psychology and integrating multiple perspectives, this article aims at exploring (1) how MERs can be integrated with science processes due to their different affordances, and (2) how student learning with MERs can be scaffolded, especially in a classroom situation. We argue that pairing representations and scientific processes in a principled way based on the affordances of the representations and the goals of the activities is a powerful way to use MERs in science education. Finally, we outline types of scaffolding that could help effective use of MERs including dynamic linking, model progression, support in instructional materials, teacher support, and active engagement.

AB Educational simulations represent a substantial innovation in the formal learning process, mainly due to their dynamic structure, interactivity, and complexity. Nevertheless, these features could arguably simultaneously problematise the adaption of digital simulations to "traditional" forms of teaching. Educational simulations not only provide a concrete methodical approach but also create new educational environments ("problem spaces"), generating additional sets of goals in other areas of learning (for example, in personal and social education), thus moving beyond the limits of classical history teaching. In a case study of the Czechoslovakia 38-89 educational simulation, we demonstrate how an educational simulation can extend educational goals from the reproduction of facts towards a deeper understanding of the multifaceted historical context. Stemming from a field survey that took place at 38 schools with more than 3500 students, this paper analyses the benefits and challenges related to the use of the above-mentioned digital simulation in the Czech formal schooling system and the acceptance of the simulation by Czech teachers and students.
   The study also describes how an educational simulation benefits students in terms of reflecting on witness accounts, illustrates the benefits of using constructed memory for education, and reflects the problem of the authenticity of witness accounts in historical education.

AB Elaboration and implementation of effective educational simulations systems requires a great effort in the field of multimedia, collaboration and communications components development, and thus significant funding. For this purpose, a relevant questionnaire was developed to measure the priority of proposed 19 factors in teaching simulations. The survey was conducted among 172 participants of business simulation project - Case Simulator. The results of questionnaire, presented in the second part of the article indicate which factors are the most important, such as teamwork during simulation realization supported with suitable communication tools, and competition based on rankings. They also highlight which components are optional and do not have a significant impact on simulations realization efficiency. Such knowledge is crucial during decision-making, which elements should be included in simulation system in the context of limited time and financial resources. Research results served as a starting point to develop presented in the third part of the paper, methodology for elaborating effective simulations with inclusion of components priority view. The solution has a form of a Model for Effective Simulation Development and Implementation (MESDI) with highlighted components priority that act as principles for choosing them during simulation development.

AB Strategies are an important component of self-regulated learning frameworks. However, the characterization of strategies in these frameworks is often incomplete: (1) they lack an operational definition of strategies; (2) there is limited understanding of how students develop and apply strategies; and (3) there is a dearth of systematic and generalizable approaches to measure and evaluate strategies when students' work in open-ended learning environments (OELEs). This paper develops systematic methods for detecting, interpreting, and analyzing students' use of strategies in OELEs, and demonstrates how students' strategies evolve across tasks. We apply this framework in the context of tasks that students perform as they learn science topics by building conceptual and computational models in an OELE. Data from a classroom study, where sixth-grade students (N = 52) worked on science model-building activities in our Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM) environment demonstrates how we interpret students' strategy use, and how strategy use relates to their learning performance. We also demonstrate how students' strategies evolve as they work on multiple model-building tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy framework in analyzing students' behaviors and performance in CTSiM.

AB Components of complex systems apply across multiple subject areas, and teaching these components may help students build unifying conceptual links. Students, however, often have difficulty learning these components, and limited research exists to understand what types of interventions may best help improve understanding. We investigated 32 high school students' understandings of complex systems components and whether an agent-based simulation could improve their understandings. Pretest and posttest essays were coded for changes in six components to determine whether students showed more expert thinking about the complex system of the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Results showed significant improvement for the components Emergence (r = .26, p = .03), Order (r = .37, p = .002), and Tradeoffs (r = .44, p = .001). Implications include that the experiential nature of the simulation has the potential to support conceptual change for some complex systems components, presenting a promising option for complex systems instruction.

AB As we have begun to move toward a blended classroom format in Introductory Biology, lack of preparation by students prior to class has made it difficult to implement active learning during class, especially in sections that meet in large lecture halls. While Biology textbooks can be used outside of class, many students resist reading assignments, finding them to be too tedious, while the cost of textbooks is fast becoming a financial burden for most students. Thus we wish to provide online materials for use before classes that are cost-free, engaging, and more likely to stimulate student interest in biological content and motivation to learn. Recent studies have revealed that game-based learning has a positive impact on student motivation, as summarized by recent Horizon reports. The most recent development in this realm is gamification, the incorporation of gaming elements or frameworks into non-game scenarios. A gamified learning object is not an actual game, but includes game-like features that engage and motivate the learner. Thus, we decided to develop game-like learning objects (GLOs) for selected topics in Introductory Biology. The GLOs are designed to be used on the Internet before class meetings to cover the basic concepts of a specific topic, thus allowing instructors to use class time for active-learning approaches that delve more deeply into the topic and promote critical thinking and problem solving skills. They may also be used as a review of the material prior to the unit exam. The GLO described in this presentation serves as an introduction to evolution, including Darwin's views on natural selection, genetic drift, and sources of genetic variation. It contains learning objectives presented as quests, with each quest taking the student to a scientific article, narrated slide-show, video clip, animation, or interactive simulation, followed by assessment questions with immediate feedback. The Evolution GLO was created in html5/JavaScript format for universal usage and can be edited and customized for a variety of purposes. It currently contains 7 hotspots which link to the media utilized for 7 quests. Since we plan to use the GLO as part of a blended learning experience, we have developed active-learning exercises for classroom use that draw upon knowledge gained from the quests. The effectiveness of the Evolution GLO and correlated exercises to enhance student's understanding of evolution will be assessed using a comparison group study approach that will analyze overall conceptual understanding of each topic covered in the GLO. Students within the control group will be assigned equivalent textbook readings for each of the 7 quests contained within the GLO. Student motivation will be assessed using the IMI (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory), a multidimensional survey instrument designed to measure student's experiences in regards to a targeted activity.

AB In the teaching and learning of physics, simulations have many applications. Simulations can help to illuminate concepts (such as the motion of electrons in electric or magnetic fields) that cannot usually be seen with the unaided eye, or to slow down things that happen over short time periods or at high speeds. They can also be used to help students explore physics for themselves and allow students to see things from multiple perspectives, such as with accompanying graphs, bar charts, or motion diagrams. Other papers have expanded on the many uses of simulations, and have demonstrated the effectiveness of simulations for student learning, as evidenced by student interviews, for instance. In this pandemic era, in which much teaching and learning is happening online, simulations can also be useful for remote learners, who can benefit from simulation-based labs.

AB The complexities of observing flow phenomena in porous media have made it difficult to teach the course, Flow in Porous Media, to undergraduate students majoring in petroleum engineering. In this study, we propose an integrated numerical visualization teaching (INVT) approach that is based on MATLAB Pdetool, graphical user interface, and Visual Basic Programming. The effectiveness of the INVT method was evaluated in two ways: First, via statistical analyses of the examination grades of two groups (experimental and control groups) of selected undergraduate students from the school of petroleum engineering, after a carefully designed INVT tutorial program was conducted on the experimental group, and finally, by interviewing the selected students to ascertain their psychological wellbeing. The following results were obtained: (1) From the statistical analysis, it was observed that the grade distribution, arithmetic mean, median, and maximum scores of students in the experimental group were relatively higher, suggesting that the INVT approach was effective and suitable for the majority of the students. (2) The interviews revealed that the INVT method provides students with a better classroom experience and help them identify their area of interest. (3) The INVT method will provide other benefits, such as cost-saving, greener classroom s, decrease carbon footprint, talent and skill enhancement, and achieve sustainable development goals for education. This paper introduces an effective teaching method for environmental and sustainable energy education. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the INVT method is adopted in teaching a petroleum engineering professional course.

ID LECTURE
AB Students' retention remains one of the main challenges in Science and Engineering education. Often, students experience a lack of connection to the material taught in class and, as a result, gradually lose motivation and interest in the course. Technology-enhanced learning has a potential to shift the classroom environment from professor-centered to student-centered, thus improving student learning outcomes. At Ryerson, we frequently experiment with various technologies to support active learning. The electronic pen and screen capture technologies utilized in the tablet personal computers open up new exciting opportunities in teaching Science, Mathematics, Engineering and Technology (SMET) disciplines. Thanks to the generous HP Educational Technology Initiative grant, we have been able to create HP Multipurpose Mobile Science Laboratory for our students in Sciences and Engineering Programs. Since the Fall 2008, tablet PCs have been used in our second year Modern Physics and third year Electricity and Magnetism courses. The tablets allowed us to create collaborative studiostyle environment blending together lecture and tutorial where the students can annotate instructor's lectures, collaborate on problem solving, run applets and simulations, and submit their work. In-class use of tablets significantly increases student-instructor communication. We have recently expanded the use of tablets to offer selected laboratory assignments. We use tablet PCs to create Camtasia mini-lessons on selected particularly challenging topics of the undergraduate curriculum. We believe that the tablet inking and screen capturing capabilities have largely unexplored potential to engage the students in active learning in SMET courses. This work is being supported by HP Innovations in Education Initiative.

AB Conceptual change is one of the international issues that had been studied by many researchers since three decades ago. Students' conceptual understanding could be optimized through the learning process in classroom. Nevertheless, students still have misconceptions that noticed the students conceptual change is still not successfully yet. In order to solve the problem, this study was conducted through four D research method (Define, Design, Develop and Disseminate) for 60 educational-university students that aimed to optimize students conceptual understanding using cognitive conflict-based multimode teaching (CC-BMT) in the learning process oriented conceptual change that concluded with: PDEODE*E worksheet design, simulation and natural phenomenon-based multimedia and Conceptual Change Text (CCT). The Electricity and Magnetism Conceptual Change Inventory (EMCCI) and CC-BMT have already been developed through the initial steps (define, design and develop) of four D model to produce the learning model that is able to optimize the students' conceptual understanding. Finally, in the disseminate phase, the quantitative data which is analyzed by using conceptual change process based on the score as the the percentage result of EMCCI four tier diagnostic test. The analyzing data which is utilized a sequential codding analysis reports for electricity and magnetism that the students misconceptions (M) -18.33% and -15%; sound understanding (SU) 25% and 11.67%; partial understanding (PU) 16.67% and 20%; no understanding (NU) 23.33% and 16.67%; uncodeable (UC) is all 0% after implementing the CC-BMT learning strategy. It can be concluded that the implementing of CC-BMT is able to optimize students' understanding on electricity and magnetism.

AB This study focuses on the design and testing of a motivational animated pedagogical agent (APA) in an inquiry learning environment on kinematics. The aim of including the APA was to enhance students' perceptions of task relevance and self-efficacy. Given the under-representation of girls in science classrooms, special attention was given to designing an APA that would appeal to the female students. A review of the literature suggested that the best design solution would be an agent who was female, young, attractive, and "cool". An experiment compared three conditions: agent (image and voice), voice (no image), and control (no image and no voice). The research question was whether students' motivation and knowledge changed over time as they worked in the inquiry learning environment, and whether condition and gender affected such changes. Participants were 61 third-year students (mean age 14.7 years) from a secondary school. Gender was distributed evenly within and across conditions. A significant main effect of time on self-efficacy was found, with self-efficacy beliefs increasing significantly for both boys and girls. In addition, there was a significant interaction between time, condition, and gender for self-efficacy. About halfway during training, girls' self-efficacy beliefs significantly increased in both experimental conditions and decreased in the control condition. For boys the opposite pattern was found. Girls also gave higher appraisals for the agent. Students in all three conditions realized significant knowledge gains, which did not differ by gender. The discussion critically considers the need for, and design of motivational scaffolding in inquiry learning environments.

AB This paper discusses a survey by research group PSITIC (Social Pedagogy and Information Technology and Communication) using Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) in conjunction with a Multi-User Virtual Environment in 3D (Second Life), at an institution of higher education. The aim of this study is formulated on two levels: refers to the technological characteristics and psychopedagogical needed by teachers and students in the use of virtual media, and the other hand, try to understand the interaction from the description, analysis and observation of the facilitators and difficulties encountered by students and teachers in these new virtual models of social interaction. The results allow us to draw a guide for teachers to move these new types of environment and identify issues such as: attitudes, skills, actions, interactions, difficulties, fears, questions, threats, and motivations, among others. The research is designated the evaluative case study. The require data are collected through questionnaires, interviews and observation of teachers, students, group members PSITIC and system administrator. As a result of research, the work presents a comparative table in the outline of the main advantages and disadvantages of the platform Sloodle (Simulation Linked Object Oriented Dynamic Learning), a result of the integration of a VLE, and Second Life to university teaching. The findings suggest that offer to the teachers and students, technologies such as learning environment integrated virtual domains such as Second Life is a challenge and it is impossible to integrate them into university without a technological, pedagogical-didactic and sociocritical training.

AB Mobile applications (apps) for learning technical scientific content are becoming increasingly popular in educational settings. Neuroscience is often considered complex and challenging for most students to understand conceptually. iNeuronis a recently developed iOS app that teaches basic neuroscience in the context of a series of scaffolded challenges to create neural circuits and increase understanding of nervous system structure and function. In this study, four different ways to implement the app within a classroom setting were explored. The goal of the study was to determine the app's effectiveness under conditions closely approximating real-world use and to evaluate whether collaborative play and student-driven navigational features contributed to its effectiveness. Students used the app either individually or in small groups and used a version with either a fixed or variable learning sequence. Student performance on a pre- and post-neuroscience content assessment was analyzed and compared between students who used the app and a control group receiving standard instruction, and logged app data were analyzed. Significantly, greater learning gains were found for all students who used the app compared to control. All four implementation modes were effective in producing student learning gains relative to controls, but did not differ in their effectiveness to one another. In addition, students demonstrated transfer of information learned in one context to another within the app. These results suggest that teacher-led neuroscience instruction can be effectively supported by a scaffolded, technology-based curriculum which can be implemented in multiple ways to enhance student learning.

AB The method for producing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) was first published in 1975. MAbs have revolutionised research, diagnosis, and disease treatment approaches. While students need a good understanding of MAb production, teaching the key steps via traditional methods can be challenging. Numerous resources exist, but these focus on hybridoma selection omitting other key steps. In 2016, an interactive simulation was developed where students produced a virtual MAb. The simulation was used in conjunction with a lecture and tutorial, providing an alternate approach for students to learn and test their understanding. The simulation is interactive, placing students in charge of all key decisions, with immediate feedback provided at all stages. The impact of the simulation on student learning was assessed between 2017-19. Ten formative multiple-choice questions were included so students could test their understanding. The impact of the simulation on student performance was assessed in a quiz. Students that used the simulation consistently scored significantly higher in all assessment items than students who did not access the simulation. Students were engaged and the positive feedback indicated that they enjoyed this novel, alternative teaching method. This demonstrates that a simulation is a novel, learning aid for teaching students all aspects of MAb production.

AB Developing fluency across symbolic-, macroscopic-, and particulate-level representations is central to learning chemistry. Within the chemistry education community, animations and simulations that support multi-representational fluency are considered critical. With advances in the accessibility and sophistication of technology, interactive computer simulations are emerging as uniquely powerful tools to support chemistry learning. In this article, we present examples and resources to support successful implementation of PhET interactive simulations. The PhET Interactive Simulations project at the University of Colorado Boulder has developed over 30 interactive simulations for teaching and learning chemistry. PhET simulations provide dynamic access to multiple representations, make the invisible visible, scaffold inquiry, and allow for safe and quick access to multiple trials, while being engaging and fun for students and teachers. The simulations are readily accessible online, and are designed to be flexible tools to support a wide-range of implementation styles and teaching environments. Here, we introduce the PhET project, including the project's goals and design principles. We then highlight two simulations for chemistry, Molecule Polarity and Beer's Law Lab. Finally, we share examples (with resources) of the variety of ways PhET simulations can be used to teach chemistry in lecture, laboratory, and homework.

AB Three-dimensional visualization of molecular simulations in virtual reality (VR) is an emerging teaching tool in chemical education. This work describes a VR application which can generate a 3D molecular dynamics (MD) simulation from arbitrary molecular structures and renders that MD simulation trajectory on a VR headset in real-time. This system uses the ZeroMQ (ZMQ) message passing framework for multisimulation to multiclient VR visualization of MD simulation. All MD simulations are done in the HOOMD-blue simulation engine, and the graphics for the VR are rendered in Unity3D. The key feature that sets this software apart from previous 3D viewer programs is the real-time simulation and thus the ability to manipulate thermodynamic variables like temperature on the fly. This allows viewers to build an intuitive understanding of the effects of thermodynamics state variables in a hands-on way. This application was used as a pedagogical tool with high school students, and the curriculum used, along with outcomes of the activity, has been presented here. This application can provide an interactive tool for teaching thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and even as a diagnostic tool for MD simulations for research purposes.

AB In this paper, we present some interactive simulations developed mainly for educational purposes in physics, mathematics, and engineering. A new horizon of understanding some concepts via interactive animations has opened a new research dimension in the learning theory. In this work, our interest is focused on the design of interactive and didactic simulations for teaching and learning differential equations. The code is written in ActionScript/Flash to enjoy all the benefits of this technology in the multimedia field, Internet and mobile phones (smartphones and tablets). This powerful tool stimulates students' interest to understand/learn abstract mathematical concepts in physics. These simulations provide additional insight for concepts that need a lot of resources and time. These simulations are applied in e-learning environments and engineering education.

AB This article describes the,ExpertCop tutorial system, a simulator of crime in an urban region. In ExpertCop, the students (police officers) configure and allocate an available police force according to a selected geographic region and then interact with the simulation. The student interprets the results with the help of an intelligent tutor, the pedagogical agent, observing how crime behaves in the presence of the allocated preventive policing. The interaction between domain agents representing social entities as criminals and police teams drives the simulation. ExpertCop induces students to reflect on resource allocation. The pedagogical agent implements interaction strategies between the student and the geosimblator, designed to make simulated phenomena better understood. In particular, the agent uses a machine-learning algorithm to identify patterns in simulation data and to formulate questions to the student about these patterns.

AB Information technologies play an important role in designing new ways of teaching, and, at the same time, the globalization of the business world affects the quality of human capital that the corporate sector requires. Apart from theoretical business understanding, multidisciplinary knowledge is also needed. Business simulation games belong among suitable educational tools, which are able to respond to contemporary business requirements and the requirements of students. Business simulation games provide a useful tool for experiential learning by university students studying business programs. For the effective development of students' competencies in economic and managerial fields of study, it is necessary to apply appropriate steps in the implementation of simulation games and to understand the experience of students in the use of games in the teaching process. For that purpose, best practice for business simulation games has been determined. This introduced best practice includes description of the benefits from realized simulation games, from the lecturer point of view. A realized survey focused on the main benefits considered by students who completed the subject Managerial Simulation Game. The students' approach to the implemented simulation games was gradually monitored over the course of five academic years. Research samples contain 148 students from the first year of a master's study program. Our survey showed that the subject is more beneficial for students for their further study than for their future professions. At the same time, the vast majority of students perceive simulation games as a useful and interesting way to verify the dependencies between economic variables. To strengthen analytical skills, it is necessary to introduce tasks that support working with economic data through simulation games. The novelty of the paper consists of mapping the benefits from the implemented simulation games for the student's own person, categorizing the identified benefits into six groups with the same characteristics, and, at the same time, implementing the research for students attending private and public schools.

AB The purpose of this paper is to introduce a multimedia computer software package that has been developed for the Federal Armed Forces of Germany to train military physicians in trauma management, The program presents different groups of casualties with characteristic wounds and multiple injuries on a CD-ROM and provides many clinical options at each decision point, Automatically evaluating the decisions for accuracy, the objective of the program is to train for triage, resuscitation, and evacuation of wounded in combat under pressure of time, The computer-assisted instruction program is inexpensive and allows easily accessible self-instruction as a supplement to formal classroom training, Using this teaching software, it may be possible to teach a standardized emergency case-management algorithm for battlefield trauma, There was a high level of acceptance for this type of instruction, This is encouraging for medical educators involved in producing multimedia packages for teaching emergency medicine.

AB This article details the results of an action research study which investigated how teachers used online learning community spaces to develop and support their teaching and learning of the Jewish Court of All Time (JCAT), a web-mediated, character-playing, simulation game that engages participants with social, historical and cultural curricula. The nature of reflection that was generated in the asynchronous and synchronous professional development spaces is discussed. Data analysis of online discussion and chat transcripts revealed that two forms of reflection were generated: reflection on self-as-teacher (juggling roles, responsibility, teaching challenges) and reflection on students (socio-cognitive and relational dimensions). The results speak to the importance of selecting online spaces that support the overall objectives of the professional development, as well as provide a rich forum to discuss the game in question. Having both asynchronous and synchronous spaces allows teachers the freedom to express themselves in multiple ways. Findings guide instructional design, generate insight on the interaction of online spaces and support teachers in how they learn and teach virtual simulation game experiences.

AB In the last few years, flipped teaching has become one of the most popular teaching trends being adopted. Yet, there is a lack of data on what students use and find useful while taking these classes. This paper focuses on the use of class web logs, student surveys and class records to analyze student use of the material developed as well as how this use correlates with course results. The course being investigated is taught once a year by the same professor. It is the second course in an introductory physics course sequence for life science majors. The flipped format was adopted gradually in the course starting the Spring 2009 semester. The analysis focuses on the last iteration. The current format of the course was partially driven by student input, and took several years to fully implement. In this case, lecture time is devoted to answer and discuss questions, work on practice problems, and, sometimes, to explore the topics students find interesting. Instead of lectures students complete online multimedia quizzes, embedding both short lecture type recording segments simulations and videos. The quiz format is meant to help students identify the topics they don't understand. Homework is also completed online. It includes both traditional end of the chapter problems and simulation mediated questions. Students also complete pre-laboratory simulation mediated activities. The analysis focused on the analysis of each of the components the students complete online. That data was also correlated to the student performance in various class assignments.

AB The focus of higher education institutions is the preparation of future professionals. To achieve this aim, innovative teaching methods are often deployed, including games and simulations, which form the subject of this paper. As the field of digital games and simulations is ever maturing, this paper attempts to systematically review the literature relevant to games and simulation pedagogy in higher education. Two researchers collaborate to apply a qualitative method, coding and synthesizing the results using multiple criteria. The main objective is to study the impact of games and simulations with regard to achieving specific learning objectives. On balance, results indicate that games and/or simulations have a positive impact on learning goals. The researchers identify three learning outcomes when integrating games into the learning process: cognitive, behavioural, and affective. As a final step, the authors consolidate evidence for the benefit of academics and practitioners in higher education interested in the efficient use of games and simulations for pedagogical purposes. Such evidence also provides potential options and pathways for future research.

AB Animations, simulations and visualizations are playing an increasingly important role in chemical education. A powerful use of such tools is to give students experience at the particulate level of chemistry by depicting collections of molecules. In this chapter, however, the use of different, analogy-based simulations is considered as a means to help students learn abstractions that lie at the core of chemical reasoning. Rather than depict atoms and molecules directly, the presented simulations involve boxes, steps, and bouncing balls, which were chosen because of their familiarity to students and their ability to represent chemical systems by analogy.
   In this chapter, it is argued that appropriately designed analogy-based simulations have the potential to help students learn the important abstractions that are used by experts to organize their domain-specific knowledge. Before presenting guidelines on how such simulations may be designed, necessary background information is presented. This includes a brief review of analogies and their use in science education, a description of analogy-based simulations and their potential benefits, as well as an overview of abstractions and their importance in expert knowledge structures.
   The chapter concludes with guidelines on how to create analogies and analogy-based simulations, particularly those that use multiple external representations in order to address abstractions. The presented concepts are illustrated using examples of analogy-based simulations that were created to teach the thermodynamic abstractions of energy landscapes, thermally-activated processes, and entropy-driven reactions.

AB The Next Generation Science Standards call for engaging K-12 students in three-dimensional learning, in which students make sense of phenomena or solve problems by simultaneously using science and engineering practices (SEPs), crosscutting concepts (CCCs), and disciplinary core ideas (DCIs). Decades of education research suggest agent-based computer models (ABMs) have the potential to support all three dimensions. However, most existing studies focus on using ABMs to support one or two dimensions (i.e., DCIs and/or SEPs). This article presents a mixed-methods study in which 63 sixth-grade students engaged in ABM-supported, three-dimensional learning to explore the causes of severe bark beetle outbreaks in forest ecosystems. Data collected from pre- and post-assessments, students' written explanations for the outbreak phenomenon, and videos of classroom instruction suggest the ABM of bark beetle outbreaks supported students in using all three dimensions of science learning to make sense of the target phenomenon. Our results show that the ABM-supported unit significantly improved students' understanding of ecosystem concepts. The largest improvement was observed among previously low-performing students. Furthermore, students engaged in sophisticated science practices, reasoning with the computer-generated data to develop an evidence-based explanation for the target phenomenon. The ABM helped students to make sense of the target phenomenon using five different CCCs. Importantly, our results also show that ABMs enabled students as young as sixth grade to predict system outcomes and better understand the nature of models in science. This study contributes to the field by bridging ABM education literature with three-dimensional science teaching and learning.

DE intercultural learning; creativity; drama; diverse thinking
AB In modern globalized world, there is an urgent need to prepare students for work in intercultural surroundings. As some intercultural elements can cause misunderstanding and miscommunication, we are in search of tools that facilitate intercultural communication. Studies revealed that general conflict resolution skills and flexibility necessary for working in an increasingly multinational arena might be connected to enhanced creativity. Creativity, understood here as the ability to "give rise to something new, regardless of whether what is created is a physical object or some mental or emotional construct that lives within the person who created it and is known only to him" [2] should be of higher priority in education.
   This paper has three purposes: (1) to develop the argument that creativity is a key element in intercultural communication; (2) to test a systems of drama activities in language classroom as a means of creativity development; (3) to assess the dynamics of students creativity.
   The study was conducted with the total number of participants of 56 foreign students studying Russian and 40 students studying English in Moscow universities. The data was collected with the help of self-report survey questionnaires. The effects of the experiment were evaluated using divergent thinking verbal tasks. The present study shows initial evidence for a positive relation between using drama activities establishing a balance between cognitive, emotional learning and experiential processes, and more efficient creative communication in multicultural context. These results provide promising evidence that intercultural background promotes flexibility and creative thinking. To introduce innovation into intercultural learning, teachers and educators must create an environment that fosters creativity as catalysts for transformation. Drama activities involving role-plays and simulations create a lively and friendly atmosphere, that awaken the senses, sharpen insights and allow exciting possibilities for taking creative risks, both personally and professionally.

ID SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENTATION; CONCEPTUAL CHANGE
AB Technology based settings have variety of assets and possibilities for learning elementary level science. This study has designed and developed a computer based environment, Argumantaryum. It provides virtual experiment facilities, visually rich multi representations of contents, video and simulations at which students may base their arguments and learn some elementary level science units. It has also a built-in discussion forum and an instant messaging component both contain argumentation sentence-openers. Following the implementation, the system was tested in real classroom settings under different study schemes for different learning units. When the system is used in the mode of a peer collaboration supported by a teacher (compared to individual use without a teacher support), it helps students to make progress in terms of both scientific discussion skills and knowledge of the learning units accommodated in the platform. Though, similar results were obtained when the same usage scheme is followed for another learning unit, we could not entirely confirm the previous finding. Further, the system performance in supporting collaborative work with teacher guidance was compared to lecture based learning. Although both collaborative use of the system under teacher guidance and the lecture based activities significantly helped their students to develop knowledge of the learning unit, the lecture based activities helped to develop better scientific discussion skills. The students who used the system individually without teacher guidance could not benefit from the system as much as collaborative groups who also received teacher guidance. Finally, the report provides a discussion and a set of recommendations on how to further test the platform facilities. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID INDUSTRY; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB Purpose - Investigations of food-borne outbreaks are complex and require multidisciplinary collaboration. The purpose of this paper is to help food technologists face this challenge and be competent members of a multidisciplinary team, a study module on the investigation of a "real-life" food-borne outbreak was developed.
   Design/methodology/approach - The module design was based on the principles of inquiry-based learning with the purpose to motivate and activate students with challenging assignments. The didactic impact of the module was evaluated as a qualitative case study with questionnaires, reflection assignments and interviews of students and lecturers.
   Findings - A teaching module developed by an external professional taking part in the academic environment provides a learning environment well adapted to the curriculum, as well as bringing first-hand realism and enthusiasm into the classroom. The external lecturer's dedication to the subject was appreciated by the students. A majority of the students believed that the outbreak investigation simulation play gave a better understanding of how food-borne outbreaks are investigated. A majority of the students 68 per cent (2011) and 82 per cent (2012) believed that what they learned in this module would be useful in a future work situation.
   Research limitations/implications - There are some limitations to the study, the most important one being the small sample size, and as the classes rarely exceeds 30 students, the use of a control group was not logistically feasible.
   Originality/value - Teaching food technologists to become knowledgeable professionals in this field will constitute a valuable contribution to the multidisciplinary food-borne outbreak investigation team. In turn, this may increase confidence among the general public in the food industry.

ID MATTER
AB Multimodality is defined as the use of different modes of communication in creating meaning. In this sense, teaching and learning are multimodal activities. Even though the information society we live in, the use of videos, animations and simulations are already regular expressions, the teaching of science in technological environments and multimodal projects remain awaiting.
   Despite its potential, ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) are often underused in schools that already have them and still have not effectively integrated in the teaching practice. To make these technologies an integral part of science teaching, it is necessary to know the potential benefits of their use in classrooms and outside them, and based on this, teachers can choose the appropriate technological tools to the learning objectives of each topic. By integrating these to the didactic proposals, it will be possible to avoid designing activities that allow the passive use of ICT, as the mere act of observing an animation, as this is an activity with a very low cognitive demand for students.
   In this paper, we present two of the multimodal didactic sequences, which integrate the use of ICT, we are developing in the Faculty of Chemistry of the University of Mexico (UNAM). The subjects we choose to exemplify the work done are fractals and oscillating chemical reactions. These sequences are designed as support materials for teachers and, among others, are intended to present a comprehensive theory, experiment and theoretical model of current scientific issues, looking for relationships between the three levels of scientific explanation: the macro (experiment), the nano (model) and the symbolic.

   Randomized Controlled Trial

AB Background: Problem-based learning (PBL) is well established in medical education and beyond, and continues to be developed and explored. Challenges include how to connect the somewhat abstract nature of classroom-based PBL with clinical practice and how to maintain learner engagement in the process of PBL over time.
   Objective: A study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of decision-PBL (D-PBL), a variant form of PBL that replaces linear PBL cases with virtual patients. These Web-based interactive cases provided learners with a series of patient management pathways. Learners were encouraged to consider and discuss courses of action, take their chosen management pathway, and experience the consequences of their decisions. A Web-based application was essential to allow scenarios to respond dynamically to learners' decisions, to deliver the scenarios to multiple PBL classrooms in the same timeframe, and to record centrally the paths taken by the PBL groups.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial in crossover design was run involving all learners (N=81) in the second year of the graduate entry stream for the undergraduate medicine program at St George's University of London. Learners were randomized to study groups; half engaged in a D-PBL activity whereas the other half had a traditional linear PBL activity on the same subject material. Groups alternated D-PBL and linear PBL over the semester. The measure was mean cohort performance on specific face-to-face exam questions at the end of the semester.
   Results: D-PBL groups performed better than linear PBL groups on questions related to D-PBL with the difference being statistically significant for all questions. Differences between the exam performances of the 2 groups were not statistically significant for the questions not related to D-PBL. The effect sizes for D-PBL-related questions were large and positive (>0.6) except for 1 question that showed a medium positive effect size. The effect sizes for questions not related to D-PBL were all small (<= 0.3) with a mix of positive and negative values.
   Conclusions: The efficacy of D-PBL was indicated by improved exam performance for learners who had D-PBL compared to those who had linear PBL. This suggests that the use of D-PBL leads to better midterm learning outcomes than linear PBL, at least for learners with prior experience with linear PBL. On the basis of tutor and student feedback, St George's University of London and the University of Nicosia, Cyprus have replaced paper PBL cases for midstage undergraduate teaching with D-PBL virtual patients, and 6 more institutions in the ePBLnet partnership will be implementing D-PBL in Autumn 2015.

AB This paper describes an approach, where an exploration-based simulation environment for conducting and observing science experiments is combined with a game environment to provide a learning environment that supports learning with understanding and transfer. We describe the components of the learning environment that includes active controls to create an "inspectable" simulation, and a formative assessment scheme that aids monitoring and learning for novice learners. A preliminary experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of the simulation environment. In future, ef we will extend this environment by linking it to our teachable agent system, Betty's Brain, and develop a simulation-based "game" environment that includes a sequence of challenges to further motivate the student and expand their learning abilities.

AB Blended learning (BL) is an educational method, which combines analogue, classical approaches to teaching with elements of e-learning. Especially in higher education, it is a popular format to encourage students' active participation as well as individualized, multi-channel and de-centralized learning. It is often related to strategies and measures taken by educational institutions to digitalize teaching offers. The credo often is The more digital, the better' although BL was basically meant as a connection of analogue and digital methodologies.
   In the lecture "Communication and Organizational Development I" (KOE I) at RWTH Aachen University in Germany, BL is practiced in the form of a flipped classroom. The lecture is an obligatory module for mechanical engineering students in their first bachelor semester and includes up to 1.400 students every winter semester. Amongst the BL elements used in this course, there is an online lecture and a business simulation with LEGO Mindstorms NXT robots. Furthermore, it contains catch boxes with microphones, which students can playfully throw around the room when discussing with their peers and the lecturer as well as finally, an online examination. Every year, the course is formally evaluated. Students can anonymously rate every element of the lecture. The lecture team analyzes these results and adapts the format accordingly for the following term.
   In 2016, the KOE I team implemented a fully analogue gamification element in the lecture in order to support the topic of problem-solving in teams. Gamification is defined as the addition of gamy elements and game design techniques to existing processes in order to foster motivation and/or a change of behavior. The gamification element used in this course refers to the "Engineers without Borders Challenge" in which students develop ideas for real life problems in developing countries. In 2016, the students were asked to create an alternative solution for a smashing device used in Tanzania, which needed to suit certain requirements. For this paper the authors assume that gamification does not necessarily have to be digital which is a very common notion and thus sometimes very costly in order to be effective and instructional as one needs to buy expensive technical tools and invest a lot of human resources to design and program suitable applications.
   This research paper deals with the question whether and in how far digital solutions are indeed more engaging and motivating for students and thus be a 'hands on' alternative to laborious and often costly digital solutions. The answer to this question is especially important for the education of large classes wherefore the herein researched lecture presents a suitable case study. Moreover, this paper will reflect on the KOE l's process towards realizing gamification and thereby provide instructional guidelines for implementing elements of gamification in large courses in general. The argumentation will be based on the student evaluation results of the winter semester 2017/2018.

AB Simulation and modelling course at the National Defence University (NDU) is aimed at learning how real-world models work, how to acquire data, how to visualize the acquired data, and to develop one's understanding through simulations. The course ends with a group work, where participating students are asked to produce a working simulation model either from the given list or from their professional context.
   We use action research as our teaching paradigm. Action research is designed to bridge the gap between research and practice. This method guides towards real intervention, includes evaluative work and produces information that helps to find a better educational approach. Therefore, enhanced interventions are often seen as a cyclic process. This study describes two sample cases: The first one is a flight simulator that includes a lot of physics and physical phenomena. The second one illustrates modelling of Helsinki-Vantaa airport border inspection procedure which has statistical and logical nature.
   We show that the simulation course presented here can be recommended to any nature science students, because it offers a real linkage to the practical applications which are connected to the theory through simulations. For military officers learning is mainly practical, while in natural sciences learning is more oriented towards theoretical knowledge. In both cases simulation is a natural "bridge" in between theory and practice. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents a systematic visual approach to teaching concepts in nanotechnology. Five types of mathematical models are used to generate visual, interactive simulations that provide a powerful software environment for virtual experimentation. The nanotechnology content areas covered by this approach are discussed. A variety of instructional strategies for effective use of these simulations are discussed. Preliminary results from a pilot study at the college level demonstrated the potential of this approach for improving nanotechnology learning.

AB Computer simulations have been used for teaching and evaluation in a number of professions including health care. Recent advances in technology and cognitive sciences (decision-making and memory system) permit expansion of simulations as an important adjunct To the teaching and evaluation of clinical decision-making, Simulations offer a number of attributes: They can be integrated into clerkship training, used as both self-evaluation and standardized external evaluation measures, and created and modified by faculty. The key features of simulations are that they are experiential, a patient case can be modelled to unfold over time and options generated by users need not be constrained, thus creating multiple pathways. These characteristics allow medical educators to capture decision-making and its component processes of sequencing, timing and pathway choice. Analysing these dimensions can reveal errors, classify patterns and isolate the component processes of the clinical management process. Current concepts in learning theory (feedback, transfer, error analysis, modelling, declarative and procedural memory systems) will be used as a framework for discussion and analysis of simulation. Examples will highlight the use of the computer based case simulation (CBX) from the National Board of Medical Examiners.

AB In recent decades, live simulation has been introduced into teacher training in the USA, Europe and Asia in order to better prepare students for teaching in class. The current study sought to examine the effect of using live simulations of conflict management on the formation of professional identity among Israeli students in a multicultural teacher education college. The study included 145 B.Ed. and M.Ed. students attending an Israeli teacher education college. Data were collected using the teachers' professional identity scale, teachers' identity conflicts scale and an open-ended questionnaire about the advantages and challenges of teaching-learning through simulations. The content analysis of the open-ended questions supported the SEM findings and showed that the less central, cognitive and emotion-arousing the conflict, and the higher its level of resolution, the stronger the professional identity formation among the intervention group members. The research conclusion is that learning through conflict simulations contributes to the development of pre-service teachers' professional identity.

AB Researchers and employers both herald the importance of quantitative literacy among undergraduates in business schools. Despite this, the ability to effectively train students in quantitative literacy is difficult due to its multi-disciplinary nature, everchanging accreditation recommendations, and administrative restrictions faced by today's business schools. In this paper, we explore the use of the ScrimmageSIMTM simulation in a Midwestern U.S. business school across two semesters one year apart. We demonstrate qualitatively via student comments and quantitatively via course evaluations the value of this simulation in increasing the quantitative literacy of undergraduate business students.

AB Computer-based clinical simulations are a powerful teaching and learning tool because of their ability to expand healthcare students' clinical experience by providing practice-based learning. Despite the benefits of traditional computer-based clinical simulations, there are significant issues that arise when incorporating them into a flexible, co-operative and collaborative learning environment. Unlike traditional technologies; immersive multi-user virtual environments such as Second Life can incorporate comprehensive learning materials with effective learning strategies, allowing healthcare students to obtain a simulated clinical experience in an immersive social environment. The purpose of this research was to investigate how a simulation could be optimised in Second Life to encourage teamwork and collaborative problem solving based on the habits, experiences and perceptions of nursing students towards Second Life as a simulation platform. The research was conducted by placing groups of nursing students in separate locations and exposing them to a series of clinical simulation developed in Second Life. The simulation involved a series of problem-based scenarios, which incorporated concepts of technical skills, patient interaction, teamwork and situational awareness. Using qualitative feedback from a series of evaluative case studies, the study determined good practices and issues involved with a virtual computer-based clinical simulation. A common theme which emerged from this research, which is discussed in this paper, was the student's ability to work in an artificial social structure where they could actively co-construct mental models of technical and interpersonal skills through experiencing human interaction in a computer-based simulated environment.

AB Effective teaching of physics requires the use of well-designed and diversified instructional tools such as multimedia throughout the teaching and learning process. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Physics Educational Technology (PhET) simulations and YouTube videos to improve the learning of optics in Rwandan secondary schools. The study was framed by the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. A total of 136 senior-4 physics students from six schools were divided among three groups and taught with the usual teaching methods only, the usual teaching methods supported by PhET simulations or YouTube videos, respectively. Student achievement was measured by administering the Geometric Optics Conceptual Understanding Test to each group of students before and after teaching. The groups of students who were taught using PhET simulations and YouTube videos achieved significantly more gains on the posttest compared with the students who experienced neither. PhET simulations and YouTube videos saw average normalised learning gains of 12 and 11%, respectively, while students who experienced solely the usual teaching methods got a gain of only 2%. These results show that the use of PhET simulations without student manipulation (as applied in this study) is equally effective as the use of YouTube videos. The researchers recommend that teachers incorporate these instructional tools as a way of effectively teaching and learning optics.

AB In medical education, pedagogical agents are widely used by computer learning systems to simulate tutors and/or mimic tutoring interactions, as well as offering just-in-time and adaptive feedback. Although the theoretical aspect of the pedagogical agents has been well-documented in literature, relatively fewer efforts have been made on how a pedagogical agent should be implemented in a real multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. In this paper, we propose a general purpose pedagogical agent architecture and implement it in the multimedia medical simulation Web-based learning system called Health Information Network Teaching System (HINTS) to further facilitate students' learning and thereby make the HINTS a more helpful educational tool. Our focus is the design of the general purpose pedagogical architecture and its implementation in a multimedia computerized simulation learning environment. A preliminary students' performance evaluation result is also reported. We analyzed how to evaluate the students' performance and how the hints were given by the pedagogical agent. The system has been installed in the National Cheng Kung University Medical Center, Tainan, Taiwan for trial purposes. Some experiments have been conducted and the results have shown that the pedagogical agent indeed help the students in their learning process.

AB The purpose of this study was to reflect the leadership strategies that may arise using a constructivist approach based on organizational learning. This approach involved the use of simulations that focused on ethical tensions in school principals' daily experiences, and the development of codes of ethical conduct to reduce these tensions. The study included 50 teachers who served in school leadership roles in addition to their regular teaching jobs. The teachers participated in 50 simulation sessions. The data were analyzed with ATLAS.ti 5.0. Five dimensions of tensions between leadership strategies were found to be related to the central concept of "Leadership strategies derived from simulations:'' Engaging versus Monitoring; Envisioning versus Implementing; Implementing versus Engaging; Monitoring versus Envisioning, and Articulating versus Envisioning-demonstrating the complexity of dialogue during the simulations, which include a multifaceted model of tension between values, and codes of ethical conduct. The study findings may encourage school principals and education leaders to use simulations to help unravel ongoing ethical dilemmas in school for the development of leadership strategies based on organizational and constructivist learning theories. These learning conditions may provide fertile ground for practicing difficult ethical decision-making and thus enhance the professional development of education leaders.

AB The aim of this exploratory case study was to gain insight into the overlooked learning experience of simulation "observers," through the lens of the mimetic learning theory. Fifty-nine inservice teachers attended five, 4-h-long simulation workshops. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews (15), a focus group, and participants' reflections (59), and underwent content and linguistic analysis. Four themes denoting mimetic learning emerged: multimodal sensory observation; adopting multiple perspectives; balanced emotional involvement; and cognitive critical thinking. The study highlights the affordances of simulation-based observation experiences in teacher education. This is especially relevant considering the COVID-19 lockdown, when opportunities for peer observation are limited. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A novel instructional computer simulation that incorporates a dynamic analogy to represent Le Chatelier's Principle was designed to investigate the contribution of this feature to students' understanding. Two groups of 12th grade Chemistry students (n = 15) interacted with the computer simulation during the study. Both groups did the same pre-instructional and simulation activities except one of the groups interacted with the analogical example in the simulation and the other group was asked to recall an analogy that was presented in the form of text and pictures. A statistical analysis of the tests administered at the end of the study suggested that analogies that are dynamic, interactive, and integrated in a computer simulation may have a stronger effect on learning outcomes than analogies which are presented in the form of text and static pictures. The implication of this study for science educators is that dynamic computer-based analogies can enhance student learning of unobservable phenomena in science. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Simulation-based education (SBE) is a fundamental teaching method that complements traditional teaching modalities. SBE has improved students??? knowledge, understanding, and numerous essential skills within undergraduate pharmacy education, similar to traditional teaching methods. However, SBE has become crucial for developing students??? teamwork, decision-making, and communication skills. Even though the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) has acknowledged the benefit of SBE in interprofessional education (IPE) and the introductory pharmacy practice experience (IPPE). This article provides evidence that SBE can be effective beyond that. This narrative review is focused on the literature related to SBE modalities and the assessment methods of student learning outcomes in the undergraduate pharmacy curriculum. The review illustrates that SBE is an effective teaching method that could be utilized within the pharmacy curriculum. The review also could help pharmacy educators decide on the best modality and placement of integrating patient simulation within the pharmacy curriculum. Combining multiple simulation techniques may be the best way to achieve the desired student learning outcomes.

AB Background: A multimedia software designed as a Computer-Assisted Scaffolding system was used to teach gas behavior on the submicroscopic level using Physics Education Technology Project (PhET) simulation. PhET is a set of interactive, research-based science and mathematics online simulations (). Purpose: The purpose was to investigate secondary school students' perceptions of the simulation-based learning system and how it supported their cognitive processing of chemistry target concepts. Identifying its most (and least) helpful features and instructional strategies was also an objective of this study. Simulation-based learning system description: The Computer-Assisted Scaffolding system combined with the PhET simulation (Program) were meant to facilitate learners' conceptual understanding of gas behavior on the submicroscopic level, which would serve as a foundation for learning gas laws on the macroscopic and symbolic level. Chemistry target concepts included causes for gas pressure, relationship between gas pressure and volume/temperature changes, and relationship between gas pressure and the number of particles. Sample: One hundred and fourteen secondary school students participated in this study as part of their science curriculum. Design and methods: Data on the students' perceptions of the overall learning experience and specific Program features were collected and analyzed. Students responded to three open-ended questions and provided ratings of the Program features, such as pop-up explanations, images, model explorations, guiding questions, diagrams and feedback. They used a paper-based survey that was administered during the last 8 min of class. Results: The results provide preliminary evidence of the benefits of this approach in chemistry education. For instance, the changing variables in the simulation helped students understand gas behavior, the multiple images and working with the simulation lab helped students visualize gas behavior, and the design of the system made it easy for students to understand gas behavior on the submicroscopic level. Conclusions: The vast majority of the students reported a positive learning experience and described it as worth spending their time.

AB We present the results of two design-based action research case studies. These case studies sought to develop pedagogical models and computer applications for teaching, studying and learning in technology education. The first pedagogical model entitled "Network oriented study with simulations" (NOSS) supports teaching and learning in technology education in laboratory settings using a computer-based tool, termed the "web-orientation agent (WOA)" and graphical simulations. The second pedagogical model entitled "Innovation education in virtual reality" (IEVR) happens in a virtual reality environment. The virtual realities and simulations represent shared virtual spaces and sociomental tools, tools for thinking, problem-solving, sharing ideas and thoughts on a symbolic level. Furthermore, they provide for tools of communication and shared attention toward the same objects. Article presents results and an understanding for the implications, possibilities and limitations of the both models.

AB Continuous medical education and accreditation of health care personnel and managers have become an urgent topic of discussion in Russia, Armenia and other countries. Discussion of these issues is based on the health care needs of highly skilled managers. It is necessary to assess the experience of other countries in using simulations to consolidate the practical skills of making managerial decisions.
   In this article use problems the simulations tasks in educational process of training of managers of health care and medical insurance are discussed. The analysis of ways of introduction the simulations of technologies is carried out to formation of competences of managers of health care and medical insurance. On the basis of own experience authors developed an algorithm of a multilevel technique the simulations tasks for training of administrator of public health, health care and medical insurance.
   Several levels of an algorithm of the simulations tasks on the basis of which skills of management are gained are offered: cases solutions, a training in a workplace, a mentoring. This problem remains important and relevant for health managers and teachers of all countries. The experience of Russia's higher school in the issue of simulation training of medical organizations may be of interest to managers and trainers. Increase the effectiveness of health care is possible only with the help of successful management.
   The article substantiates important educational and methodological educational provisions and principles on which a continuous medical education in health care is identified: professional retraining in educational programs, internship at the workplace, a system of training in distance educational technologies and teaching materials to support the learning process.
   Simulation training will not solve all the problems of domestic healthcare, but it is an effective tool for increasing the effectiveness of medical education.
   In the article discusses the issues and proposes mechanisms for continuous medical education and accreditation of specialists of the health care organization and public health on the base of simulation, tasks.

AB The Postgraduate Medical Education Office (PGME) Core Curriculum Web Initiative - called PGCorEd (TM) was implemented in 2008 as a required foundational curriculum for all 1st and 2nd year resident physicians. This new curriculum was accelerated by new accreditation standards for residency training programs by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada in 2006. PGCorEd (TM) modules are web-based and interactive in nature, integrating several simulation approaches to learning and evaluation including: video for role model simulations, video narratives, content interactivity techniques, and electronic key feature case assessments. This paper reports on a case study in a multi-method curriculum project that included: action research, deliberative curriculum inquiry, development of a standardized online multimedia based curriculum, simulation approaches, learner assessment including pre module and post module testing of learners, a comprehensive program evaluation involving pilot testing of content, and the collection of learner satisfaction data. The results from the pilot testing and 2 years of data on pre module and post module testing of learners reveal that this fully online self-moderated curriculum is a viable forum for teaching learners in busy field-based training environments. Learner satisfaction surveys for the completed modules show that using multimedia and storytelling are effective approaches to teaching and learner engagement in an online environment. Additionally, the findings reveal a positive impact on learning and utility to medical residents across diverse training programs. This paper also illustrates some practices to integrate simulation in the effective learning and teaching of the foundational humanistic competencies for postgraduate medical residents. Deliberative efforts by the design teams to be attentive to the needs of learners, including the active participation of learners in constructing the simulations, has resulted in an authenticity of the simulations noted by learners and faculty involved with this project.

DE GeoGebra; physics; teaching and learning; animations; simulations;
   computer games; active learning
AB GeoGebra is very popular free and open source software. In this paper, the author will demonstrate how it can be effectively used for creating digital educational materials, such as animations, simulations and computer games for teaching and learning physics. A few examples of digital learning materials, created by the author, will be presented. It's about animations, simulations and computer games that could help understanding of terms, phenomena and processes, as well as to improve adoption of knowledge and skills in several areas of physics, including movements, dynamics, electric circuits, and swings. The exploration will stress relations between these digital learning materials with the theory of physics.
   The digital learning materials used do not pretend to substitute the textbooks in physics, but to complement it. The pictures in the textbook are motionless and reflect only one point, one situation from a given process or procedure. In contrast, animations and simulations can capture all aspects of the processes and procedures under consideration. The paper will demonstrate the relations between animations, simulations and computer games and the methods of active learning, problem learning, experimenting, project learning, and others.
   The paper will try to explain the universality of the application of animations, simulations and computer games made in the GeoGebra software in several aspects: The paper will try to explain the universality of the application of animations, simulations and computer games made in the GeoGebra software in several aspects: a) They can be successfully used in more degrees of physics education, from elementary school to college, b) They can be multilingual; c) Various types of animations and simulations with different difficulty levels can be made. They will potentially advance the individualization of teaching within a certain level of education and provide conditions for programmed instruction.

DE virtual reality; leadership development; intercultural competence
AB The 21st century workplace is an increasingly intercultural and collaborative environment. As a result, soft skills are being recognized as deficient in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) graduates. Our program, Purdue Polytechnic Leadership Academy seeks to improve essential workplace skills for STEM students through virtual reality (VR) simulations that immerse students in intercultural leadership case studies. Experiencing something from a distance is a new type of collaborative technology enabled by the internet of things known as telehora. Students will actively participate in the virtual environment, both responding to and looking around in the virtual environment. Students will experience firsthand how the choices they make within the modules change the outcomes of the case. Once developed, the modules can be deployed in traditional and online classrooms or as self-study. The modules can be scaled to provide a safe and replicable experience for large student cohorts, with potential to expand to multiple universities and industry. Students are unable to gain these experiences through formal education by other means, making the experiences good candidates for VR application. Virtual reality combined with sensors for emotion tracking represent a novel educational application of Internet of Things hardware. We will compare efficacy of high-cost VR hardware to low-cost VR and traditional computers, examining how student engagement and outcomes are affected by the different delivery mediums, thereby contributing to our understanding of these novel technologies. Research methods will include measures of intercultural competence, tolerance for ambiguity, facial emotion detection, and a combination of galvanic skin response and electromyography. This data triangulation will provide insights into the effectiveness of the interventions on traditional outcomes and give researchers a better understanding of emotion's role in intercultural leadership interactions. The provides an immersive and safe learning environment for students to participate in intercultural leadership scenarios that cannot be replicated in traditional classrooms.

AB This paper reports the use of different kinds of multimedia in a blended general chemistry course as a strategy to achieve a better integration of the theory and practice and improve students' motivation to learn chemistry. After researching and comparing different types of virtual lab packages available, three types of web-enhanced experiences were tested in this study. The first type of virtual labs consisted of freely available computational labs developed by the Concord consortium that were assigned during the online sessions and to substitute for some of the wet labs. The computational labs chosen for this study included: the atomic structure, chemical bonds, molecular geometry, intermolecular attractions, solubility, chemical reactions and stoichiometry. The second type of virtual labs were assigned during the weekly online-session of the course, and consisted of simple applications and extensions of the topics covered in the face-to-face lecture sessions of the course. Topics covered by this second group of virtual labs included: renewable energy, properties of elements, when is water safe to drink? and where in the US is acid rain most severe?. A third type of web-enhanced activities combined simulations with relevant information posted by the US government agencies to allow students to find out relevant information about radioactivity and radon, electrochemistry and corrosion or cement and concrete chemistry. This study provides evidence that integrating the use of wet labs, a variety of virtual lab experiences and lectures in the undergraduate chemistry classroom may facilitate students' learning and critical thinking by providing them with an opportunity to design and repeat their own laboratory experiments and apply or extend lecture topics to real-life examples. Importantly, the choice of virtual labs and the methods used to integrate those virtual labs into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum seem to be critical to trigger the student interest in learning chemistry topics and to culminate in an efficient learning experience.

AB This study is aimed to investigate the effectiveness of problem-based learning combined with simulation on students' problem-solving and creative thinking skills. By employing a quasi-experimental design, this study used essay and problem-based tests as the instruments to evaluate problem-solving and creative thinking skills of 192 students. These students were categorized into three groups: experimental group I (n = 68) receiving instruction using problem-based learning combined with simulation, experimental group II (n = 60) receiving instruction with problem-based learning only, and control group (n = 64) receiving instruction with a conventional method. Using a multivariate analysis of covariance, the results revealed that problem-solving and creative thinking skills taught by problem-based learning combined with simulation were significantly improved as compared to those in experimental group II and control group. In addition, a positive relationship was identified between students' problem-solving skills and their creative thinking skills. Ultimately, this study shows that instruction using problem-based learning combined with simulation method is much more effective than using either problem-based learning only or a conventional teaching method.

AB Developing academic literacy in mathematics instruction is challenging for most mathematics teachers, requiring more than vocabulary and grammar assistance with a focus instead on building discourse competence. This research utilizes a teaching simulation called the script writing task, in which pre-service teachers are asked to identify student conceptions in a fictional classroom situation concerning fraction multiplication and division and write a script pertaining to the situation, enabling the examination of pre-service teacher moves to support students engage in mathematical discourse. Over half of the teacher moves involved explaining procedural aspects, whereas approximately 10 percent contained lexical supports. In a cluster analysis of the types of teacher moves used by the of pre-service teachers, three groups emerged regarding how they supported the students, focusing predominantly on (1) reporting procedure, (2) explaining meaning, or (3) a mix of both reporting procedure and explaining meaning, with few instances overall of lexical and syntactical supports.

AB Students in college courses struggle to understand many concepts fundamental to transmission and evolutionary genetics, including multilocus inheritance, recombination, Hardy-Weinberg, and genetic drift. These students consistently ask for more demonstrations and more practice problems. With this demand in mind, the Genetics and Evolution app was designed to help students (and their instructors) by providing a suite of tools granting them the ability to: (1) simulate genetic crosses with varying numbers of genes and patterns of inheritance, (2) simulate allele frequency changes under natural selection and/ or genetic drift, (3) quiz themselves to reinforce terminology (customizable by any instructor for their whole classroom), *4) solve various problems (recombination fractions, Hardy-Weinberg, heritability, population growth), and (5) generate literally an infinite number of practice problems in all of these areas to try on their own. Although some of these functions are available elsewhere, the alternatives do not have the ability to instantly generate new practice problems or achieve these diverse functions in devices that students carry in their pockets every day.

AB Critique is central to the development of scientific knowledge. From a cognitive perspective, critique can be used to enhance understanding. From a social perspective, critique serves to maintain the standards of a professional field. In science education, it is of tremendous value to diagnose and nurture students' critical knowledge. How students develop and apply criteria for critique, however, remains unclear. What factors influence students' performance of critique, and how can educators incorporate technology-enhanced scaffolding strategies to help diagnose and nurture students' critical knowledge? In this paper, I define critical knowledge as the criteria people use to evaluate other knowledge, the ability to use these criteria across contexts, and the reflective understanding of such processes. Building on existing literature, I develop a conceptual framework that describes the components and processes involved in a critique activity. Using this framework, I discuss the application of technology-enhanced scaffolding strategies to facilitate critique activities in science classrooms.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model of the standard U.S. k-12th grade classroom using NetLogo. By creating an artificial society, we identify the casual implications of the same-race effect (a moderate sized academic boost to students whose teachers have the same race) on the national educational achievement trends. The model predicts sizeable achievement gaps at the national level, consistent in size with those documented by the US National Report Card (NAEP) stemming from moderate sized same race effects. In addition, matching effects are found to be a source of increased heterogeneity in academic performance for the minority group. These results hold for all teacher-student matching phenomena and have implications for educational policy at the aggregate level. Using artificial societies to disentangle the aggregate effects of hypothesized causes of the achievement gap is a promising strategy that merits further research.

AB This research investigated the effects of selected characteristics of a web-aided instructional simulation on students' conceptual change, problem solving and transfer. A two-pronged research study was conducted using 117 students enrolled in a beginning meteorology course at Iowa State University. For the experimental design, the performances of three groups (the with-log group, the without-log group and the control group) were compared on post-test scores and a weather forecasting activity. No statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) were found among the groups on these measures. However, follow-up interview data obtained from five diverse students in the treatment group showed that the simulation with authentic situations, multiple representations and the capability of reviewing previous actions supported science learning. For the student who was able to readily take advantage of the information contained in the log and graphs, the simulation exercises were quickly completed and a sufficient understanding of the concept was developed to transfer the newly-gained knowledge to new situations, weather forecast exercises. For others, the simulation was less effective. Only one interviewee showed all three stages of Goos and Galbraith's model of problem solving. This student also demonstrated a better understanding of how to transfer newly-gained knowledge to weather forecast exercises. The other four interviewees, who did not show the features of all the stages, needed the teachers' facilitation to develop their problem-solving skills in order to achieve optimal learning when using the instructional simulation.

AB The present study examined the efficacy of a haptic simulation as a pedagogical tool to teach freshmen engineering students about electromagnetism. A quasi-experimental design was used to compare students who used visual-only simulations to those who used visuohaptic. We hypothesized that multimodal presentation of information may lead to better conceptual understanding of electromagnetism compared to visual presentation alone.
   A class of 77 electrical engineering technology students from six different laboratory sessions participated in the study. Laboratory sessions were randomly divided into two groups: a control group with only visual simulations and an experimental group with visual simulations plus haptic feedback. Learning was assessed qualitatively and quantitatively.
   Overall results on the pretest and posttest assessments did not demonstrate a significant increase in student achievement of concepts. Differences between the experimental and the control group showed mixed results. Furthermore, results also suggested that students in the control group performed better for specific electromagnetism concepts.

AB OBJECTIVES: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has become integral to critical care. Data informing optimal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation education modalities are lacking. We aimed to compare the effect of high-fidelity simulation versus interactive mobile learning on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation knowledge acquisition and retention among clinicians. DESIGN: Observer-blinded, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A single academic medical center. SUBJECTS: Forty-four critical care clinicians with limited extracorporeal membrane oxygenation experience. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to receive: 1) simulation: three high-fidelity training scenarios, 2) QuizTime: 15 total multiple-choice questions delivered over 3 weeks via mobile device, or 3) experiential: no formal training. Participants completed a survey, written knowledge examination, and simulation assessment prior to randomization, immediately following the intervention, and 4 month postintervention. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was knowledge about extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assessed by score on the immediate postintervention written examination. Secondary outcomes included performance in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation simulation postintervention and 4 months later assessed by a rater blinded to group assignment. Clinicians randomized to simulation (n = 15), QuizTime (n = 14), and experiential (n = 15) had similar baseline characteristics. Adjusting for baseline knowledge, postintervention examination scores were higher in the simulation group (90.0%; interquartile range, 85.0-90.0%) than the QuizTime group (70.0%; interquartile range, 65.0-80.0%; p = 0.0003) and the experiential group (75.0%; interquartile range, 65.0-80.0%; p = 0.001). Scores did not differ between the groups at 4 months (p > 0.05 in all analyses). In postintervention extracorporeal membrane oxygenation simulations, the simulation group demonstrated shorter time to critical action compared with QuizTime (80.0 s [interquartile range, 54.0-111.0 s] vs 300.0 s [interquartile range 85.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.02) and compared with both QuizTime (45.0 s [interquartile range, 34.0-92.5 s] vs 255.5 s [interquartile range, 102.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.008) and experiential (300.0 s [interquartile range, 58.0-300.0 s]; p = 0.009) at 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation was superior to QuizTime and experiential learning with regard to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation knowledge acquisition. Further studies are needed to ascertain the effect of these interventions on knowledge retention, clinical performance, and patient outcomes.

TI Students' Perceptions of Learning in an Online Multiround Business
   Simulation Game: What Can We Learn from Them?
SO DECISION SCIENCES-JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Multiround business simulation games have been gaining popularity in higher education. However, certain aspects of experiential learning of individual students in the game remain unaddressed in research literature. Team assessments, such as team papers, appear a common, "natural" choice given the team-based nature of the games but may potentially mask individual learning outcomes. In this study we use a qualitative method to glean from individual students' papers a deeper understanding of the process of learning of individual students in a team-based, multiround business simulation game. Our findings indicate that individual and timely assessments are necessary to identify cases of not meeting the expected individual learning outcomes for the instructor's corrective intervention. This study contributes to the understanding of the process and outcomes of student learning in a multiround business simulation game, methods of teaching a supply chain and operations class with a simulation, and methods for better aligning course goals and assessments.

AB The work presented in this paper was developed in the context of the SimSense project that aims at understanding how computer simulations and electronic sensors may be used by in-service and preservice teachers to scaffold science learning in elementary education.
   Our previous research showed that senses, sensors and computer simulations can be used as didactical resources to relate concrete experimental data sensing and theoretical abstract information. The work presented here aims at a deeper understanding of the potential and limitations of the separate use of sensors and computer simulations, fostering to make it possible to improve teachers' mediation, overcoming such difficulties, through the joint use of those tools. The research questions (RQ) are:
   RQ1: What are the potentialities and difficulties in relating abstract information and more concrete information when using senses and sensors in experimental science teaching?
   RQ2: What are the potentialities and difficulties in relating abstract information and more concrete information when using simulations in experimental science teaching?
   A set of case studies are analysed: 1) two case studies that used sensors and senses in elementary schools; 2) two case studies that used simulations in science teaching in an elementary teacher education school. Multimodal narratives are used to analyse the students' activities, including epistemic practices (EP), and teachers' mediation.
   The analysis of the two case studies developed in elementary schools contributed to answer RQ1, showing that the joint use of senses and sensors, mediated by teachers, allowed children to: 1) discover diverse environmental objects/phenomena and variables; 2) to observe what is unobservable with senses; 3) develop complex EP, such as interpreting and relating. Nevertheless, the use of senses and sensors created difficulties in scientific inquiry activities, showing the need for the manipulation of abstract models. This can possibly be accomplished through the use of simulations and concreteness fading to: i) link the data acquired by senses and sensors to the iconic and the numeric models; ii) enhance the development of conceptual models grounded on data acquired by senses and sensors and, thus, the development of even more complex EP like modelling.
   The analysis of the two case studies developed in a teacher education school contributed to answer RQ2. While exploring the models, students were able to develop EP such as communicate, identify empirical conditions and relate the models to the observable world. However, students showed difficulties in relating the conditions of experimental work to the conditions of the simulations' models and in relating these models to their everyday sensations and perceptions. This may be overcome by complementing the use of simulations with the joint use of sensors and senses to: 1) bridge the gulf between the abstractedness of simulations' parameters and the more concrete data acquired by senses and sensors; 2) relate senses and sensors' data to the manipulable models.
   On the basis of the results presented here, future work will deepen the research of : 1) a set of affordances of the joint use of senses, sensors and simulations to overcome the identified students' difficulties; 2) the possibility of using those three epistemic mediators to implement a concreteness fading strategy with children and an abstractedness fading strategy in teacher education.

AB Purpose
   Distance universities are of great importance for establishing sustainability literacy, as they operate as multipliers for thousands of students. However, despite several advantages of e-learning environments compared to traditional class-teaching, there are still challenges regarding suitable e-learning tools and didactical models. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of several e-learning tools on students' knowledge and skills growth and to compare two learning paths, synchronous vs asynchronous, exploring how each affects the level of students' knowledge achievement and skills acquisition.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The empirical analysis is based on an online course "Participatory processes in environmental politics". International MSc and PhD students who enrolled in the course were from FernUniversitat in Hagen (Germany) and Aberta University (Portugal). The course was designed as the flipped classroom, applying different e-learning tools and activities, some synchronous and others asynchronous. A pre- and post-evaluation questionnaire was applied to evaluate students' knowledge and skills. Descriptive statistical analyses were carried out on this data.
   Findings
   Results showed that in the synchronous group, knowledge about theoretical approaches to citizen participation and sustainable environmental governance improved to a greater extent, whereas the asynchronous group showed greater improvement in nearly all skills related to intercultural communication and e-learning. Also, in the synchronous path, students enhanced their knowledge on "research application" to a greater extent.
   Originality/value
   Evaluating the effectiveness of different e-learning tools on students' sustainability knowledge and information and communication technologies skills is a fundamental issue. The study discusses these issues, contributing to enhancing the use of adequate and grounded e-learning models on sustainable development in higher education.

AB Teaching laboratories are a highly complex environment that require students to master the following: technical skills, application of theory, safe working conditions, and teamwork. Often, students have had very little prior experience to prepare them for this alien and pressured environment. Prelaboratory tasks are typically considered key to mitigating this issue, with simulations being developed to help students prepare for class and also to help improve their technical abilities. Building on a prior initial study, this contribution evaluates student perceptions toward dynamic laboratory simulations as part of their freshman chemistry course. Our data shows that the majority of students found the simulations to have a positive impact on their learning experience, especially during the enforced online learning experiences that resulted from COVID-19. Students were generally found to be less anxious and more excited to attend the laboratories, and they frequently utilized their experiences with the simulations during the in-laboratory class time.

AB BackgroundWithin serious games, in particular simulation games, have potential when it comes to teaching complex topics. Simulation games allow learners to explore the complex interplay of various variables. The current campaign of the German statutory accident insurance (DGUV; Deutsche Gesetzliche Unfallversicherung) addresses such acomplex topic in the field of prevention at work: one's own prevention culture.AimsBased on the goals of the current campaign (e.g., promoting aholistic approach with regard to safety and health in organizations), the aim of the present contribution is to describe how aserious game can help raise awareness for one's own prevention culture.ResultsThe article presents the concept of the simulation game culture of prevention (short working title simkult). In this multiplayer game, the player has the role of a restaurant manager who is responsible for the health and productivity of his employees. In this article, the core elements of the game, the implementation within teams, and preliminary results of the concept evaluation are presented and discussed.

ID SIMULATION
AB In this paper, we propose two diagrams, the corporate strategic framework diagram and the free cash flow diagram, to teach students how the finance function is integrated to other business functions in a multinational corporation. We recommend the diagrams as pedagogical took in the context of a widely used management simulation software, Business Strategy Game (BSG). We provide specific examples of their use to enhance the effectiveness of the simulation experience, to motivate the students to follow current events in international business more closely, and to connect the simulation to real-world business situations. The formulation and implementation of global strategy are complex processes and can benefit from a structured framework. Methods that use the proposed diagrams in teaching international business provide the necessary framework to students in an experiential setting and enhance their learning. Using evaluation scores from end-of-semester business reports, we demonstrate that students' learning of the global strategy-making process improved from semester to semester as these methods were gradually implemented in our classes.

AB The purpose of this study was to explore the process of designing a visuohaptic simulation for learning structural analysis following a learner-centered approach (LCD). Our implementation of an LCD approach followed a three-part iterative process: (1) requirements analysis and specification, (2) multimedia application design, and (3) prototype inspection. In designing the learning tasks, we employed a three-phase pedagogical approach of prediction, experimentation, and confirmation. We found that designing a visuohaptic simulation for learning purposes is a complex process that requires considering the learners' building of knowledge from different perspectives (e.g., prior knowledge, nonnormative conceptions, cognitive load, and modalities). A total of 51 participants interacted with the visuohaptic simulation following one of two sequenced approaches: (1) haptic feedback and minimal visual information followed by enhanced visual and haptic feedback, or (2) enhanced visual and kinesthetic feedback followed by enhanced visual and haptic feedback. Results suggest that the visuohaptic simulations promoted learners' exploration of structural analysis concepts, improved their intuition about the forces acting on the member of the structure-compression, tension, and zero-force members, and facilitated knowledge transfer. However, we concluded that our approach did not challenge participants to revise nonnormative conceptions and representational competencies. Implications for teaching and learning of our findings are discussed.

TI INTEGRATING AN EDUCATIONAL SIMULATION INTO A LOGIC DESIGN COURSE
SO LECTURE NOTES IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the philosophies underlying the transition from a hardware laboratory to computer simulation within the Logic Design module of a Computer Systems course and the development of SimLog(TM), a Computer Aided Learning application, for Apple Macintoshes(TM). The current emphasis on software engineering means that the majority of students are not going to use this theory in any electronic engineering sense and as such have a certain reluctance to deal with hardware based laboratory classes. Good computer simulation of traditionally laboratory based subjects offer many advantages to both the student and the establishment alike. When implemented on existing teaching work-stations, multiple facilities can be created at almost zero cost. Emphasis within a simulation can placed upon maintaining realism whilst incorporating sound educational tenets. A certain element of fun can be embodied to assist with student acceptance.

AB This paper examines the value of using intelligent multimedia simulation for the teaching of nursing clinical decision-making skills. The possibilities of multimedia-based educational resources are examined and the rapid growth and questionable effectiveness of current multimedia computer-based learning applications for nursing students are discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of this technology and the problems developing intelligent agent-based systems are examined. A case study is presented which uses a modular design with an integrated intelligent agent and knowledge base. It is argued that by using this type of approach, the real value of intelligent CBL to provide individual formative advice to students in a simulated experience can be realized.

AB Multimedia and simulation programs are increasingly being used for anatomy instruction, yet it remains unclear how learning with these technologies compares with learning with actual human cadavers. Using a multilevel, quasi-experimental-control design, this study compared the effects of "Anatomy and Physiology Revealed" (APR) multimedia learning system with a traditional undergraduate human cadaver laboratory. APR is a model-based multimedia simulation tool that uses high-resolution pictures to construct a prosected cadaver. APR also provides animations showing the function of specific anatomical structures. Results showed that the human cadaver laboratory offered a significant advantage over the multimedia simulation program on cadaver-based measures of identification and explanatory knowledge. These findings reinforce concerns that incorporating multimedia simulation into anatomy instruction requires careful alignment between learning tasks and performance measures. Findings also imply that additional pedagogical strategies are needed to support transfer from simulated to real-world application of anatomical knowledge. Anat Sci Educ 7: 331-339.

AB Concepts in fields such as astronomy often invoke scales of space and time that far exceed any that are perceived in daily life. Consequently, learners sometimes develop inappropriate intuitions of scale that in turn impede an understanding of related ideas. We investigate whether exposure to virtual 3D simulations of the solar system advances students' understanding of phenomena for which misconceptions often dominate. Here, high school students used handheld tablet computers (Apple iPad) driven by a pinch-to-zoom display to manipulate virtual representations of the solar system. Learning was gauged using a normed concept inventory of multiple choice questions that offered common misconceptions among the answer options. The experiment compared two conditions. One used a simulation where scale relationships in the solar system were exaggerated, so as to focus on surface features of the planets (much like the orrery models often used in astronomy instruction), while the other used a simulation that displayed scale relationships more appropriately. We found that, in either case, even brief exposures to instruction based on pinch-to-zoom simulations of the solar system advanced students' understanding in areas where traditional instruction is notoriously ineffective. Furthermore, displays that used more realistic depictions of scale were more successful in addressing students' misconceptions when scale played an important role in the concept.

AB The use of business simulation games has grown progressively during the last 40 years as an educational tool for teaching strategic managerial economics in universities, business schools and also for executive training.
   The participants must develop a business strategy to achieve their goals in a competitive environment. In addition to improving their skills, "decision-making", "financial analysis", "market analysis","operations", "problem solving", "strategic thinking", "tactically develop", "teamwork" and "leadership", they have an enjoyment experience, with an emphasis on winning, but also allowing the hope and opportunity of improvement and doing better in the next decision.
   This research focuses in a business simulation game applied in the process of educating 1500 students, of different undergraduate level years, in the fields of business analysis, finance, and management during 2013 to 2017 in one or two semesters. The study seeks to analyse the influence of different factors in the students' academic performance, taking into account that they belong to almost 20 different universities covering the whole Spanish territory.
   Numerous benefits result from enriching curricula with business simulation games to develop the undergraduate students' abilities to manage businesses, experiencing other indirect advantages, such as "effective group work", "shared responsibility", "understanding of business environment", as well as "multi-dimensional long-and short-term planning", nevertheless, not all the students use the full potential of simulation game.
   Simulation results of the different student's teams not only depends on their implication, analysed in relation with other factors of the student profile as region, university, age and degree area of knowledge, but also on the scenario where each team have to compete with each other in simulated market circumstances, managing complex and dynamic situations, since the same decision with different competitors have a different reaction in each round result.
   These findings are useful to determine how to administrate the simulation as a training tool in strategic managerial economics subjects, choosing the better years of the degree to implement it and the best way to create the scenario, organizing the student teams depending on their characteristics and maturity, to enhance their educational outcomes.

AB Exploratory learning environments (ELEs) promote a view of learning that encourages students to construct and/or explore models and observe the effects of modifying their parameters. The freedom given to learners in this exploration context leads to a variety of learner approaches for constructing models and makes modelling of learner behavior a challenging task. To address this issue, we propose a learner modelling mechanism for monitoring learners' actions when constructing/exploring models by modelling sequences of actions reflecting different strategies in solving a task. This is based on a modified version of case-based reasoning for problems with multiple solutions. In our formulation, approaches to explore the task are represented as sequences of simple cases linked by temporal and dependency relations, which are mapped to the learners' behavior in the system by means of appropriate similarity metrics. This paper presents the development and validation of the modelling mechanism. The model was validated in the context of an ELE for mathematical generalisation using data from classroom sessions and pedagogically-driven learning scenarios.

AB Adopting a multitiered design-based research perspective, this study examines pre-service secondary mathematics teachers' developing conceptions about (a) the nature of mathematical modeling in simulations of real life problem solving, and (b) pedagogical principles and strategies needed to teach mathematics through modeling. Unlike other studies that have focused on single-topic and lesson-sized research sites, a course-sized research site was used in this study. Having been through several iterations over three teaching semesters, the 15-week long course was implemented with 25 pre-service secondary mathematics teachers. Findings revealed that pre-service teachers developed ideas about the nature of mathematical modeling involving what mathematical modeling is, the relationship between mathematical modeling and meaningful understanding, and the nature of mathematical modeling tasks. They also realized the changing roles of teachers during modeling implementations and diversity in students' ways of thinking. The researchers' conceptual development, on the other hand, involved realizing the critical aspect of the teacher role played by the instructor during modeling implementations, and the need for more experience of modeling implementations for pre-service teachers.

AB Complex computer and video games may provide a vehicle, based on appropriate theoretical concepts, to transform the educational landscape. Building on the original game object model (GOM) a new more detailed model is developed to support concepts that educational computer games should: be relevant, explorative, emotive, engaging, and include complex challenges; support authentic learning activities that are designed as narrative social spaces where learners are transformed through exploration of multiple representation, and reflection; be gender-inclusive, include non-confrontational outcomes, and provide appropriate role models; develop democracy, and social capital through dialogue that is supported by means of computer mediated-communication tools; and include challenges, puzzles or quests, which form the core of the learning process, where access to explicit knowledge. conversations, and reflection results in the construction of tacit knowledge. It is argued that the GOM version 11 can be used not only to support the development of educational computer games but to provide a mechanism to evaluate the use of computer games in the classroom.

AB Graph technologies are now widely available in K-12 science and mathematics classrooms. These technologies have the potential to impact the learning of science and mathematics, especially by supporting student investigations. We use meta-analysis to analyze 42 design and comparison studies involving data from 7699 students spanning over 35 years. In these studies, graphing technologies include computer software such as simulations; online tools such as graph utilities; and sensors such as temperature probes. We characterize the assessments used to measure graphing. We describe the investigative activities that graphing supports including generating hypotheses or predictions, collecting data, analyzing or interpreting data, and reflecting. Studies show that graphing technologies impact learning of mathematics and science topics as well as graphing itself. These technologies are especially advantageous for learning complex topics where students need to conduct investigations to interpret change over time or position such as functions, kinematics, and thermodynamics. Recent studies take advantage of logs of student interactions to study the design of automated guidance for graphing. We discuss the implications of these findings for instruction at the K-12 level.

AB Within the context of higher education for science or engineering under-graduates, we present an inquiry-driven learning path aimed at developing a more meaningful conceptual understanding of the electron dynamics in semiconductors in the presence of applied electric fields. The electron transport in a nondegenerate n-type indium phosphide bulk semiconductor is modelled using a multivalley Monte Carlo approach. The main characteristics of the electron dynamics are explored under different values of the driving electric field, lattice temperature and impurity density. Simulation results are presented by following a question-driven path of exploration, starting from the validation of the model and moving up to reasoned inquiries about the observed characteristics of electron dynamics. Our inquiry-driven learning path, based on numerical simulations, represents a viable example of how to integrate a traditional lecture-based teaching approach with effective learning strategies, providing science or engineering undergraduates with practical opportunities to enhance their comprehension of the physics governing the electron dynamics in semiconductors. Finally, we present a general discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of using an inquiry-based teaching approach within a learning environment based on semiconductor simulations.

DE Simulation; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Engineering Education
AB Engineers take advantage of computers to model and simulate real problems. In the engineering education, a computer simulation is a laboratory where the students experiment, analyze, and design models close to real devices. Thanks to the simulations, students only deal with concepts and complex models, their motivation in understanding real-world relationships is increased, and they can decides where, when and what to explore. This is possible using an Internet learning platform as for example Ilias or mooddle. On the other hand, the main drawbacks are the time needed to choose and develop the application and to train students in the interface.
   Previous paragraph shows why engineer instructors include simulations in their teaching methodologies. To achieve a learning aim, different educational software can be chosen. Which is the best election? It is proposed a methodology to find adequate software according the learning goal and a set of criteria related with the effort and time needed by students and instructors. This is a multi criteria problem that can be modelled and solved used a method of the decision theory. Because is simplicity, the authors employ the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The methodology is general, two examples portrait how to select the software for power plants and mechanical engineering subjects.

ID MANAGEMENT SIMULATIONS
AB Business simulation games are used worldwide as teaching and learning tools for business classes and provide an interactive educational approach to business, economics, and entrepreneurship. They act as a basic supplement to the core curriculum due to their motivating and engaging nature and their simulation aspect which enables reinforcement of key concepts in a risk-free environment. The P4G Business Game has been developed in the context of the European project PLAY4GUIDANCE. It is a simulation game between teams, where each team has the task of managing from a strategic point of view their own manufacturing business competing with the other in a market. The rationale of the game lies on the users' training and guidance in the use of entrepreneurial, transversal and mathematical skills. The P4G business game is an online learning environment which acts as a replication and extension of the physical market world. The innovative character of the P4G Business Game lies in its embedded evaluation and scaffolding mechanism that provide significant guidance for the trainees. It focuses on both qualitative and quantitative data analysis providing users with immediate feedback and constant tracking of their performance. The sophisticated interactive technology underpinning the game accommodates social and technical dimensions -player exposure to varying levels of social interaction and cognition, removal of time and space constraints - not always available in the physical world. It allows for user intervention and decision taking processes while it offers a specific and structured space where critical analysis of intertwined and complex information is necessary. The evaluation tool was validated through pilots and national conferences conducted in all participating member countries of the project. The findings from the testing phase have shown a positive level of reliability of the P4G Evaluation tool.

AB The purpose of this study was to understand how students engage in computer-supported modeling-based activities (CSMBAs), and the relationship between their engagement and their modeling competence. Different facets of learning engagement were measured through multiple data, including performance on modeling tasks, self-reported level of engagement, and online behavior patterns of science modeling. The research participants were 76 11th-grade students in Taiwan. The research instruments included online student worksheets, an engagement questionnaire, computer logs, and modeling competence tests. Students' online worksheets were scored and used to group them into three performance groups-the low-level-performance group (LPG), the middle-level-performance group (MPG) and the high-level-performance group (HPG). ANOVA statistics lag sequential analysis (LSA), and ANCOVA statistics were used for the data analysis. The results showed that, first, in analyzing the engagement questionnaires, students' negative cognitive engagement, negative behavioral engagement, and negative social engagement all played important roles in their low performance in the CSMBAs. Second, through the use of LSA, it was found that the LPG students lacked evaluative behavior, while the HPG students emphasized reflective behavior. Third, analysis of the students' pre- and post-modeling competence tests showed that those who were in the HPG and MPG scored significantly higher than those in the LPG in two dimensions of the modeling competence post-tests. The results indicate that efforts made in completing tasks in CSMBAs can lead to better modeling competence. Implications for developing future CSMBAs and for promoting student engagement are suggested.

AB Simulation techniques such as virtual patients (VPs) are valuable tools for teaching and learning a range of clinical proficiencies. Compared with other forms of simulation, however, the reported use of VPs within nursing is limited. Descriptions of simple, low cost methods for the development of VP devices could help facilitate their wider implementation and use in nursing education and training. In order to encourage broader use of VP technologies within nursing, this paper aims to expand current knowledge of VP creation by reference to the development of two virtual mental health patients produced for a multilingual e-learning course for European mental health nurses. Focusing on narrative VPs, the paper provides a brief overview of various types and potential uses of VP techniques, along with central elements of good practice in VP development. The five phase development framework used in the creation of the two VPs is presented. Processes detailed include the design and construction of case scenarios and multimedia components, in addition to initial usability and validity testing. VPs like those described here are a relatively inexpensive way of integrating virtual simulation technology into nursing education, particularly within online, blended and/or cross-cultural learning environments.

AB Background: One of the topics students have difficulties in understanding is electromagnetic induction. Active learning methods instead of traditional learning method may be able to help facilitate students' understanding such topics more effectively.Purpose: The study investigated the effectiveness of physical models and simulations on students' understanding daily life applications of electromagnetic induction.Sample: The nine participants in the study were voluntaries from the fourth year of the physics education undergraduate programme.Design and methods: Lessons were designed to enhance students' conceptual understanding of electromagnetic induction. Researchers developed multiple generator and simple electric motor models. These models and simulations about Faraday's Law, magnetic field, magnets, generator and radio waves were used in lessons. The data were collected through open-ended questionnaire and semi-structured interview. Open-ended questionnaire was employed in a pre-test and a post-test. Students' answers were categorized as sound understanding, partial understanding, misunderstanding and no understanding. At the end of the last lesson, the interview was implemented about the students' opinions related to application.Results: For each question, the number of responses matching the accepted scientific explanation increased after application. The number of illogical or incorrect responses decreased.Conclusions: Physical models and simulations used in the present study had positive effect on students participated in this study to understand electromagnetic induction and its daily life applications.

AB Computer simulations have become widely available to support geometric learning; however, the type and amount of guidance, as well as the freedom to engage in self-directed learning that should be allowed for children from differential socio-cultural backgrounds, have not yet been clarified. On the basis of the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and cognitive load theory, we varied guidance - in relation to representation and manipulation - between two levels (high and low) to form four conditions. We investigated 152 fifth-grade students with various socio-cultural backgrounds (80 were non-indigenous and 72 were indigenous) to explore the interaction effects of guidance on their learning of area-related concepts using a computer simulation-based environment. The results indicated that the learning performance of children from various socio-cultural backgrounds interacts with four experimental conditions at different guidance levels. More specifically, the indigenous children outperformed the non-indigenous children in highly directed learning environment, but the non-indigenous children outperformed the indigenous children in learning environments that entailed a high degree of exploration. Children from different socio-cultural backgrounds also exhibited various patterns of germane cognitive load. Finally, we discussed future study directions based on cognitive and socio-cultural perspectives for simulation-based learning environments.

AB The recent coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented limitations in person-to-person contact, elective surgeries, and even traumatic injuries, leaving potential gaps in training and skill development. Surgical programs have had to adapt with the rapid implementation of surgical simulation curricula, collaborative lecture series, and greater focus on online learning. Using models, simulation, and virtual learning, we have accommodated for restrictions and operative volume from coronavirus disease of 2019. The goal was to establish a durable system of extra-clinical training that would increase patient safety and collaborative knowledge sharing. From our simulated interventions, we noted maintenance of skills despite low operative volumes, low temporal or monetary commitment especially when compared with operating room time, and engagement from both learners (medical students and junior residents) and teachers (senior residents and staff physicians). Our experience with transition to a virtual curriculum with involvement of multiple institutions has also resulted in greater diversity of lectures, increased frequency of academics, and high levels of participation. In this article, we discuss our department's experience with these alterations and the path for surgical training moving forward. We have seen multiple benefits to advancement of nonclinical specialty-specific simulation and virtual didactics. While some of these efforts may require some early expenditure, both monetary and temporal, to establish the program infrastructure, they are easy to apply, confer substantial added value, and appear durable.

AB Science learning in general and physics learning in particular are far perceived to be complex. Various physics education researchers have substantiated that traditional teaching methods accomplish simple transmission of the physics concepts. Hence, for real learning, this necessitates interactive-engagement instruction strategies. The study initiated to understand the augmented learning difficulties experienced by students with the concept of magnetic force on a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field. As a first step in understanding, we administered pre-investigation studies for first-year Master Physics Course students by using multiple choice questions to identify learning difficulties. Responses of pretest indicate vectorial nature of physical quantity and use of right-hand rule are the conceptual difficulties which impede learning. So, to reduce the learning difficulties and to develop the conceptual framework of magnetic force, we adopted interactive simulation as a learning tool and conducted detailed student interviews. Responses of pretest questions enabled us to tailor and design the activities for effective learning in a simulation-based environment. The analysis of student interviews probes the details of how a learner processes information about the concept and noticed an improvement in developing a good reasoning skill and a coherent conceptual framework of magnetic force. In the final stage, validation test results do indicate weak intermediate stages in learning even in post-simulation experience which present need for explicit instructional implication.

AB Aircraft dynamics and control (ADC) is a core course requirement for an undergraduate program in aeronautical engineering. This article presents an undertaking that reconfigures the instruction of fundamental concepts in ADC by replacing traditional problem-solving approach with a method that relies on a simulation framework comprising of Matlab, USAF DATCOM, and flight simulation software. The typical challenges experienced by students including their inability to visualize complicated, multi-modal aircraft were overcome by the new method thus enhancing the student's learning experience. The implemented approach improved students' motivational belief and its calibration, their use of active learning strategies and actual performance. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Teaching practical chemistry skills remotely is not a ask that would have been high on the agenda only a few months ago. However, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, students around the world are having to work from home, and the chemistry education community has been forced to adapt to the new circumstances. In response, we discuss the use of simulations in place of practical laboratory work, with emphasis on the development of students' experimental design skills. The simulation of Michaelis Menten enzyme kinetics is given as an example exercise, which other instructors could implement with immediate effect.

AB This study aimed to identify if complementing representations of concrete objects with representations of abstract objects improves students' conceptual understanding as they use a simulation to experiment in the domain of Light and Color. Moreover, we investigated whether students' prior knowledge is a factor that must be considered in deciding when to use representations of abstract objects. A pre-post comparison study design was used, involving 69 participants assigned to two conditions. The first condition consisted of 36 students who had access to a simulation with representations of concrete objects, whereas the second condition consisted of 33 students who had access to a simulation with representations of both concrete and abstract objects. Both conditions used the same inquiry-oriented curriculum materials, consisting of three sections that included physical phenomena with increasingly complex underlying mechanisms, so that the third section's mechanisms were more complex in nature than those in the first two sections. Tests were administered to assess students' conceptual understanding before and after the presentation of the curricular material as a whole, as well as before and after each of its three sections. Results revealed that the presence of representations of abstract objects was helpful for the first two sections, but only for students with low prior knowledge. On the third, most complex section, also the students with higher prior knowledge profited from the presence of abstract objects. From these findings, we conjecture that for physical phenomena with a lower level of complexity, students with high prior knowledge are able to mentally construct the necessary abstract concepts on their own, whereas for higher levels of complexity they need an explicit representation of the abstract objects in the learning environment.

TI Students' situational interest in cultivated plants: the importance of
   contextualisation and topic selection
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
LA English

DE Situational interest; plants; topic; context; activity; botany
AB Student interest in plants is lacking. Therefore, we investigated potential drivers of situational interest in cultivated plants and interactions between different dimensions of interest, i.e. topic, context and learning activity. A total of 462 high school students (14-17 years of age) rated two sets of questionnaire items combining eight plants (representing topics) either with different contexts or with different activities. We used Rasch analyses and multivariate analyses of variance to investigate which dimension of interest drove the students' interest. Contexts were the dominant dimension of plant-context combinations. Students were most interested in plants in reference to the contexts 'risks and the assessment of risks' and 'impacts on the environment'. Plants were the dominant dimension of plant-activity combinations. Students were most interested in activities in reference to cannabis (psychoactive plant), cocoa (stimulant plant) and arnica (medicinal plant). For these three plants, the least interesting activity ('working with scientific texts') was more interesting than the most interesting activity ('completing a computer simulation') for the other five plants. Plants, thus, moderated the general level of interest students expressed in plant-activity combinations. We discuss the findings in terms of the choices educators can make for contextualizing plants and for selecting plants for classroom activities.

AB Purpose of Review The training of psychiatrists and other mental health professionals requires education on a range of interpersonal, communication, and psychotherapy techniques. Classroom and workshop training must be augmented by experiential learning with feedback for skill implementation with fidelity. Virtual standardized patients (VSPs) are computerized conversational agents that can support experiential learning through standardized, consequence-free training environments at reduced costs. Recent Findings Research on mental health VSPs is rife with feasibility and acceptability pilot studies across various training populations and settings. Users have generally reported positive reactions to training with VSPs, though frustrations with some VSP speech recognition or VSP response relevance has been reported. Several studies have demonstrated a promising transfer of clinical skills from VSP training to human standardized patients and randomized trials supporting improved skill relative to reading or academic study are encouraging. As technology improves and natural language processing and accurate computer response generation for broad ranging conversational topics emerges, the field would benefit from research on the characteristics of effective VSPs for a range of purposes and trainee populations. Well-designed randomized evaluations of VSPs relative to best practices in education are needed, particularly regarding the impact of VSPs on clinical practice among actual patients.

AB There has been a body of emerging research describing students' understanding of complex systems. This research has primarily studied students understanding of complex phenomena in science. However, complex phenomena are also pervasive in everyday life. Children observe and participate in them daily. How do they reason about such ordinary complex phenomena? In this study, we investigate students' reasoning about everyday complex phenomena. We report on interviews and a classroom participatory simulation with ten sixth-grade students about ordinary events that could be construed as emergent, such as social situations in which the social pattern emerges from the participating students' individual actions. We have observed a widespread student-initiated strategy for making sense of complex phenomena. We call this strategy "mid level construction," the formation of small groups of individuals. Students form these mid-level groups either by aggregating individuals or by subdividing the whole group. We describe and characterize this mid-level strategy and relate it to the students' expressed understanding of "complex systems" principles. The results are discussed with respect to (a) students' strengths in understanding everyday complex social systems; (b) the utility of mid-level groups in forming an understanding of complex systems; (c) agent-based and aggregate forms of reasoning about complex systems.

AB The solar system is one of the intangible learning materials of science because the phenomena that occur could not be presented directly in the classroom such as members of the solar system, the repetition of day and night, the phases of moon, and the eclipse. This resulted is student difficulties to understanding the solar system concept. To overcome these problems, the researcher aims to develop learning media that can also enhance the Critical Thinking Skills (CTS) of students through Multimedia Based Integrated Instruction (MBI2). MBI2 is an integrated multimedia computer which contains learning materials including video, animation and simulation, learning tools, e-books and assessment. To collect and analyze the data genuinely and comprehensively, researchers utilized a pre-experimental method with one group pretest-posttest design for 36 students as research subject. The results of research showed that (1) 43% of students were able to identifying/formulating the criteria of possible answers, (2) 32% of students could giving a reason, (3) 39% of students could giving a hypothesis, (4) 41% students could identifying assumptions or conclusions, (5) 36% of students could select the possible criteria as a solution to the problems. Based on data analysis, it can be concluded that MBI2 could significantly enhance the critical thinking skills of junior high school students on solar system.

AB Dynamic visualisations capture aspects of scientific phenomena that are difficult to communicate in static materials and benefit from well-designed scaffolds to succeed in classrooms. We review research to clarify the impacts of dynamic visualisations and to identify instructional scaffolds that mediate their success. We use meta-analysis to synthesise 47 independent comparisons between dynamic and static materials and 76 comparisons that test the effect of specific instructional scaffolds. These studies show that dynamic visualisations are better than static visuals at promoting conceptual inferences about science, consistent with the success of inquiry instruction in science. To realise this potential of dynamic visualisations, instruction needs to help students use the dynamic visualisation to make sense of their own ideas. Scaffolds that are most successful include prompts for reflection, prompts to distinguish among parts of the visualisation, visual cues that identify salient features, multiple visualisations presented sequentially, and interactive features that govern the pacing of activities. We extract guidelines from this research to help researchers plan future studies of visualisations, designers create and refine instructional materials using visualisations, and practitioners customise instruction that features visualisations.

AB Background: As nursing programs continue to expand online, innovative pedagogies that support online teaching and learning practices grounded in theoretical constructs are needed. Method: Video simulation scenarios and VoiceThread technology were used to create a model of online instruction that promotes active student participation and aligns with course objectives and content. Kolb's experiential learning theory serves as the framework for this project. Results: The integration of multimedia in the course gave students a collaborative experience where they can apply their knowledge to the simulation scenarios. Inclusion of the vignettes was found to be effective in addressing specific areas of curriculum while stimulating student engagement. Conclusion: Increased use of online delivery for nursing education necessitates course designs that promote student interaction and foster community. Teaching and learning practices that include technologies and are supported by theoretical constructs promote best practices for online instruction.

AB Computer simulations were used to teach students basic concepts associated with correlaion. Half of the students were presented information in a sequential series of single frames in which each frame replaced the preceding frame while the other half were presented the information in simultaneous multiple frames in which each frame was added to the previous frames without replacement. It was hypothesized that if the isolated elements effect occurs, the single-frame condition should be superior. Alternatively, if the transient information effect dominates, the multiple-frame condition should be superior. Results confirmed the superiority of the single-frame presentation. Eye-tracking indicated that participants who learned with single frames paid more attention to the important representations than participants who learned with multiple frames. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Nowadays, different ways of communication and interaction among multiple actors are dominating learning processes. However, there are critical opinions that question the contribution of student interaction to real learning. This study applies learning analytics and data mining techniques to explore the online discussion forums of 362 business students at the bachelor and master levels, who participated in business simulation games between 2011 and 2016. The findings revealed that the most frequent contents in the students' online discussion forums were related, firstly, to the parameters and features of the business simulation game, and, secondly, to elements that fostered the students' learning process, while small talk or regular conversation did not appear to be relevant. In addition, the contents with predictive power over learning results were related to uncertainty, time, interaction, communication and collaboration, although none of these elements influenced teacher assessment of student learning. This study reveals the usefulness of learning analytics tools to gain a more wide and holistic view of the learning process of students, discovering new aspects that affect students' learning results.

ID SEVERE SEPSIS; SIMULATION
AB Objective. To enhance student learning of a complex therapeutic concept through the incorporation of 2 case-based, active-learning strategies with lecture in a required advanced therapeutics course.
   Design. A virtual patient session using a branched-outcome decision-making model and a problem-based learning (PBL) practica were developed from the course learning objectives for severe sepsis and septic shock. Following lecture of this material, students were required to complete the simulation session and attend the PBL.
   Assessment. Student learning was assessed through review of examination scores, as well as quality and accuracy of the pharmaceutical care plan developed as part of the PBL. Satisfaction of the teaching format was assessed through a course evaluation survey. For questions pertaining to sepsis or septic shock on the final examination, the class average was 90%, despite an average of 76% on the examination as a whole. Class average for the pharmacuetical care plan was 90%. Sixty-three percent of students stated the simulation contributed to their learning, and 93% stated the PBL contributed to their learning.
   Conclusion. Using a multifaceted teaching approach, combining active- and passive-learning strategies, was well received by students and fostered an effective environment.

   INQUIRY
AB Chemistry knowledge can be represented at macro-, micro- and symbolic levels, and learning a chemistry topic requires students to engage in multiple representational activities. This study focused on scaffolding for inter-level connection-making in learning chemistry knowledge with graphical simulations. We also tested whether different sequences of representational activities produced different student learning outcomes in learning a chemistry topic. A sample of 129 seventh graders participated in this study. In a simulation-based environment, participants completed three representational activities to learn several ideal gas law concepts. We conducted a 2 x 3 factorial design experiment. We compared two scaffolding conditions: (1) the inter-level scaffolding condition in which participants received inter-level questions and experienced the dynamic link function in the simulation-based environment and (2) the intra-level scaffolding condition in which participants received intra-level questions and did not experience the dynamic link function. We also compared three different sequences of representational activities: macro-symbolic-micro, micro-symbolic-macro and symbolic-micro-macro. For the scaffolding variable, we found that the inter-level scaffolding condition produced significantly better performance in both knowledge comprehension and application, compared to the intra-level scaffolding condition. For the sequence variable, we found that the macro-symbolic-micro sequence produced significantly better knowledge comprehension performance than the other two sequences; however, it did not benefit knowledge application performance. There was a trend that the treatment group who experienced inter-level scaffolding and the micro-symbolic-macro sequence achieved the best knowledge application performance.

AB Clinical skills education is an essential component of the teaching plan in medical science courses, such as nursing education. Simulation-based learning is an effective teaching method in any practical or vocational-based training. The development of simulation-based teaching has been impacted by the integration of emerging technologies, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which results in a more interactive and adaptive environment. Recently, educational data mining (EDM) has played an important role in the development of ITSs by providing different methods and techniques to predict a student's performance. Research carried out to deliver intelligent simulationbased systems for clinical skills teaching has applied several artificial intelligence techniques, however there is a lack of research that describes the use of the powerful methods and techniques available in EDM. This paper investigates and traces the technological developments of the most effective methods employed to promote learning in clinical skills education, particularly in nursing education, where skills acquisition is imperative for the provision of high quality care. To this end, we propose a conceptual model for an intelligent simulation-based learning system using a data mining agent in clinical skills education.

AB Writing and balancing equations of chemical reactions is one of the \most difficult elements of chemistry education for students, which is why it was decided to analyse part of the process which is the most difficult. The process itself consists of multiple stages. it is important to highlight that the focus of research was not only on balancing the chemical equations. This stage can be independent of chemical skills and knowledge and is based on combinatorial and mathematical skills.
   The aim of the research was to examine whether using computer simulations can help younger children to balance chemical equations before they start to learn chemistry by using the psychological theory of transfer. It was decided first to teach children how to "make sandwiches" using a computer simulation game. When they have mastered in this activity, they can balance chemical equations. If the children learned how many pieces of cheese, ham and bread would be necessary to "make sandwiches" they began to learn how to balance chemical equations. The children were acquainted with the elements of chemical knowledge necessary to understand the simulation, and then they worked independently with it. Tests were carried out to check the acquired level of ability to balancing chemical equations.
   The obtained results proved that the balancing of the simple equation of reaction was mastered by over 50% of the children tested.
   It seems, therefore, a good solution that elements of reconciliation of chemical reaction equations should be introduced at an earlier stage of education, for example during maths lessons.

ID SIMULATIONS
AB In this project, we explore the use of threshold concept theory as a design basis for development of Interactive Virtual Laboratories in thermodynamics. Thermodynamics is a difficult subject for chemical and biological engineering students to master. One reason for the difficulty is the diverse and challenging set of threshold concepts that they must coherently synthesize and be able to apply in a diverse range of contexts. Based on our experience and from reports in the literature, we have identified a set of threshold concepts we propose are critical for mastery of thermodynamics. To help students better learn these concepts, we have been developing Interactive Virtual Laboratories. This paper describes the development and initial investigation of two such laboratories. They are available for instructors to use through the AIChE Concept Warehouse website (http://cw.edudiv.org/).
   The Interactive Virtual Laboratories are a series of two-dimensional simulations designed to address the targeted threshold concepts. The design of these laboratories is based on allowing students to see and explore alternative representations of the phenomena that they are learning. They allow inquiry-based, scaffolded activity, and each has several activities that provide multiple representations. These activities guide students to perform virtual experiments, and also to place the virtual experiments in the context of the concepts that they are learning. They explain concepts in a way that is less abstract and more intuitive to students by providing a dynamic representation of phenomena at a molecular level. Students are expected to answer numerical questions and, whenever possible, predict and explain the effects of macroscopic changes (i.e., pressure, temperature, composition, energy) based on observations of molecular properties.
   In the study reported in this paper, we investigate how students experience the laboratories and whether the students perceive the simulations are beneficial towards learning. The two interactive virtual laboratories studied address the concepts of Pv work and reversible processes. Eight participants took part in the clinical study outside of the engineering classroom. All students had previously taken a thermodynamics course and had access to a thermodynamics textbook and the internet as they completed the laboratory. A "think aloud" protocol was used where students were audio recorded as they verbally described their actions in completing the laboratory. The transcribed audio recordings together with video recordings of the computer screen on which they worked were analyzed. After completing the laboratory, a semi-structured interview asked participants about their perceptions of the simulation's effectiveness, their previous thermodynamics experience, and a brief assessment of what they learned. All interviews were transcribed for analysis.
   The participants generally responded positively to the simulations. Seven out of eight students explicitly stated that the dynamic simulations helped them visualize and engage with the processes more than they could with the static depictions in books or lecture. However, some difficulties were observed, including interacting with the interface and understanding specifically what a question was asking. One participant found the interactivity to be unintuitive. We also noticed a relation between how the participants framed knowledge and their approach to completing the laboratory. Students who activated more sophisticated frames typically completed the simulation more quickly and accurately than those with more naive frames. Students who did not do as well tended to focus on trying to identify equations they had used in the past, even going so far as to use them in an unsuitable context. On the other hand, students who completed the simulations accurately and more quickly appeared to integrate what they were seeing on the screen with their foundational conceptual knowledge to form new understanding.

AB This article is a case study which discusses the implementation of a 3D virtual environment that will enable psychology students to conduct experimental investigation for the testing and analysis of models and theories relating to operant conditioning. Teaching and learning in psychology focuses on how people think, feel, and behave. Students must learn to use scientific methods to collect data from participants, and then analyse the data to testify related models and theories learned in the classroom. Experiments may be performed to study at different levels: individuals, groups, organizations, and communities. In the real world there are limited opportunities and various challenges for undergraduate students to be involved in experimental investigations. 1) There are difficulties recruiting participants. This often results in the use of convenience samples consisting of undergraduate students. The problem will compounded in campuses with a low student population and a limited variety of participants resulting in small sample sizes or skewed samples which can makes statistical analysis meaningless. Alternatively a lecturers may provide a dummy data sets for analysis. In this situation students do not practice appropriate experiment design nor learn to administer surveys for data collection. 2) There are difficulties conducting longitudinal studies relating to reinforcement or induced behavioural changes due to time limitations. This is essential for some theories and models such as developmental psychology which may require longitudinal studies over many years. 3) It is risky to allow undergraduate students to conduct experimental investigation on human subjects. These issues may be addressed through the use of a virtual environment which will allow students to explore a range of psychological phenomena without the need for close supervision required when dealing with human subjects. A range of simulation software is currently available to simulate learning behaviour and experimental design, but none is suitable for scalable psychological studies. It is proposed that a single-user virtual environment or multi-user virtual world can be created for this purpose using intelligent agents and 3D avatars with physical, physiological, and emotional responses. This would allow students to interact with avatars, participate in the virtual world to conduct experimental investigation, and collect and analyse data. A prototype virtual environment currently under development for the teaching of experimental design and learning theory in psychology is discussed. When conducting investigations, students will provide rewards/punishments to induce changes to an avatars' behaviour. For example, an avatar that is rewarded for engaging in a behaviour will have a higher probability of displaying that behaviour in the future (operant conditioning). If an avatar is punished it will be more likely to decrease that behaviour. This virtual environment will enhance student's learning experience in research design and analysis, and provide the ability to perform research that would be difficult or impossible to conduct in undergraduate psychology subjects run over a single semester. Future research proposes the addition of physiological and emotional responses, incorporating more complex learning algorithms, and extending the virtual environment into a multi-user virtual world.

ID ACHIEVEMENT
AB Industrial experts have implemented lean methods globally since the late 1970s in response to difficult economic conditions, as well as to compete in an increasingly global and difficult marketplace. The application of lean methods has been used to eliminate non-value added activities from business and manufacturing operations. By eliminating non-value added activities, organizations have been able to reduce costs, improve process flows, and increase value for customers. The popularity and benefits of lean methods have led to a demand for an engineering curriculum that includes lean principles and methods. Engineering student learners often do not have experience in manufacturing operations at the point in which they are introduced to lean principles and methods in their studies, thus selecting appropriate teaching methods is important in ensuring that students develop a working knowledge of how to apply lean tools. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of learner perceptions specifically, the role of self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes in motivation and in academic performance. Moreover, researchers have found that the use of collaborative activities and simulation can positively impact learning. However, few previous studies have reported on the impact of interactive sessions on learner perceptions, including self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes, and the possible impact of these effects on learning. This study sets out to examine the impact of self-efficacy beliefs and attitudes, resulting from the use of collaborative and simulation sessions on the learning of lean principles and methods. Participants in this study were undergraduate students, primarily engineering students, from three universities. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests. Based on the analyses, it was found that the sequencing of sessions was an important variable. The findings also suggest that the use of collaborative and simulation sessions has a positive impact on learner self-efficacy and on some learner attitudes.

AB This paper describes the experience of Instituto de Empresa Business School (IE) using games, simulations and interactive cases for supporting both online and face-to-face learning processes. Instituto de Empresa Business School is a Spanish private institution of graduate business education, founded 1973. IE has some 35,000 alumni in 85 countries, produces over 1600 master graduates per year and has a main urban campus in Madrid and offices in ten countries. The elearning department was created in 2000 and was responsible for the support to on-line classes and for the preparation of interactive learning materials. The paper will show some examples of success in the use of simulations and games in business education. Multimedia content was originally developed for online education but has proved to be also useful in teaching regular face-to-face courses and for executive education. One hundred and sixty five modules (for all business areas) have been developed already internally in the e-learning department. These modules can include interactive cases, simulations and games. The teaching strategy can vary as the professors can use these modules as additional visual aids for regular class discussion, as an exercise for the preparation of in-class discussion, or for direct in-class discussion, both for face-to-face or for on-line teaching.
   The use of games and simulations at IE has been a largely successful experience, with high learner satisfaction which has been measured since the beginning. The team responsible of the creation of the materials and the authors (almost always IE professors), have daily access to the comments of the students. These results are very useful for continuous improvement. The paper will finally analyse the initial problems that the school managers had to face in order to achieve the implementation of the new learning methodology and a new learning materials among the traditional faculty and how they are being solved.

AB Background. For uncommon events in medicine, such as pediatric CPR, more frequent training is associated with improved performance among healthcare providers and physicians in training. Gamified learning may facilitate motivation to practice CPR, though studies to support this are lacking.
   Intervention. Residents were interviewed to understand motivating factors for CPR practice outside of a traditional classroom certification setting.
   Methods. We used a qualitative study design within a larger multinational study. Semi-structured, one-on-one interviews were completed with pediatric residents using a constructivist approach. Transcripts were reviewed independently by two authors (IHG, JLS).
   Results. The inductive framework gradually moved away from gamification and towards that of self-determination. Participating residents reported several types of intrinsic and extrinsic motivational drivers towards practicing CPR, such as practicing CPR to prepare, or as a connection to clinical practice. Some themes were amotivational, such as performance anxiety, and detracted from their drive to practice. Despite a gamification design to this curriculum, these components were rarely mentioned. These themes related to achieving Maslow's three psychological needs of autonomy, relatedness and competence.
   Conclusion. The motivation to practice CPR among residents aligns with the self-determination theory. By stimulating intrinsic motivating factors, future curriculum design may better motivate residents to practice CPR.

DT Article
ID 2ND LIFE
AB This study looked at teachers' role-play and simulations in order to increase teacher's skills in psycho-pedagogical support on educational virtual worlds. We put forward a proposal to encourage the use of 3D scenarios where teachers can improve their skills for situations of cultural and ethical concerns that require a high level contextualization. We organized the study around improvement of those skills related to diversity, equity, and inclusion in education. The ultimate aim was to investigate whether educational virtual worlds or Massively Multiuser On-line Learning (MMOL) platforms can improve such skills through training teachers in real and virtual simulations and role-play. The study makes use of descriptive statistics and the Standards Performance Continuum to measure the use of diverse standards in a teaching improvement process. Results suggest that MMOL platforms support the development of more effective teacher control of problematic school situations when these platforms are used collaboratively. Our findings indicate that MMOL platforms could be understood as a social environment with an emphasis on group awareness and cohesion.

AB How can different aspects of diagnostic competence be promoted? Three measures in comparison Abstract. A well-developed diagnostic competence is an essential prerequisite for successful teaching and significantly contributes to students' academic and personal development. However, teachers often fail to adequately assess student characteristics such as performance, motivation, or anxiety. Diagnostic competence should already be promoted during teacher education to prepare teachers early for real diagnostic situations and to avoid negative consequences of possible pedagogical mistakes. This paper compares a teacher-centered, a problem-based, and a digital simulation-based intervention for training different aspects of diagnostic competence in a sample of N = 166 preservice teachers regarding their effectiveness. We found advantages for the simulation-based intervention regarding intrinsic motivation and interest, disadvantages for the teacher-centered intervention regarding a systematic approach in the diagnostic process and disadvantages for the problem-based intervention regarding extraneous cognitive load. Results are discussed in particular in terms of their practical implications for teacher education and increasingly digital teaching.

TI The design and evolution of TurboTurtle, a collaborative microworld for
   exploring Newtonian physics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID LANGUAGE
AB TurboTurtle is a dynamic multi-user microworld for the exploration of Newtonian physics. With TurboTurtle, students can alter the attributes of the simulation environment, such as gravity, friction, and presence or absence of walls. Students explore the microworld by manipulating a variety of parameters, and learn concepts by studying the behaviours and interactions that occur. TurboTurtle has evolved into a "group-aware" system where several students, each on their own computer, can simultaneously control the microworld and gesture around the shared display. TurboTurtle's design rationale includes concepts such as equal opportunity controls, simulation timing, concrete vs. abstract controls, recoverability, and how strictly views should be shared between students. Teachers can also add structure to the group's activities by setting the simulation environment to an interesting state, which. includes a set of problems and questions. Observations of pairs of young children using TurboTurtle highlight extremes in collaboration styles, from conflict to smooth interaction. Finally, the technical work in making TurboTurtle group-aware is slight, primarily because it was built with a groupware toolkit called GroupKit. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

   education
AB Today's higher education in science and engineering is often affected by e-learning. In addition to the advantages of e-learning, e.g. learning independently of time and place, there are some disadvantages of pure online learning - learners (students) are alone in front of their computers. As a possible result, learners are generally less motivated, quit courses more often and have problems in understanding the teaching content which usually is a result in the lack of communication with other learners and/or teachers, inappropriate learning materials as well as the absence of questioning. These problems occur especially in sciences because the learning content is dominated by abstract, theoretic, complex contexts and mathematical theories which in general are more difficult to understand than normal texts. These challenges can be solved by several solution approaches: Blended learning (BL, a combination of face-to-face (F2F) classes and online learning through the internet), social software ("web 2.0") to increase communication and the extension of learning material by alternative representations of the content. For example, learning material in computer engineering consisting of many mathematical models and algorithms can be supplemented by animations and especially simulations that visualize the abstract meaning of formulas which help to understand them.
   Thus, this paper presents the development of web based simulation in computer engineering education for the subject "embedded systems". The following software simulator has been developed to support e-learning (as a part of the education program "computer engineering online"):
   VHDL Validator: Programming editor to model hardware modules using the hardware description language VHDL and to validate the source code by simulation
   AutoSim: Visual editor to create finite state automatons and simulate them by different tasks
   Simulator for "tank control systems": 1 to 3 tank control systems can be simulated by solving tasks. Changing of input data can be retraced by animation of the tanks, a value table and highlighted formula terms
   PID-UFO: A Learning game in which learners can "fly" a space ship manually and adjust an autopilot through PID controls.
   The simulation is part of a web based learning platform and has been realized as web applications based on JAVA, JSP, PHP, Python, MySQL, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript/Ajax/jQuery on an Apache/Tomcat web server. In terms of new approaches in e-learning, the software tools also support mobile learning (single-source-publishing with optimized layout templates for heterogeneous devices), platform independence through usage of standard web browsers and multilingualism by default.

AB Background: Medical Faculties Network (MEFANET) has established itself as the authority for setting standards for medical educators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 2 independent countries with similar languages that once comprised a federation and that still retain the same curricular structure for medical education. One of the basic goals of the network is to advance medical teaching and learning with the use of modern information and communication technologies.
   Objective: We present the education portal AKUTNE.CZ as an important part of the MEFANET's content. Our focus is primarily on simulation-based tools for teaching and learning acute medicine issues.
   Methods: Three fundamental elements of the MEFANET e-publishing system are described: (1) medical disciplines linker, (2) authentication/authorization framework, and (3) multidimensional quality assessment. A new set of tools for technology-enhanced learning have been introduced recently: Sandbox (works in progress), WikiLectures (collaborative content authoring), Moodle-MEFANET (central learning management system), and Serious Games (virtual casuistics and interactive algorithms). The latest development in MEFANET is designed for indexing metadata about simulation-based learning objects, also known as electronic virtual patients or virtual clinical cases. The simulations assume the form of interactive algorithms for teaching and learning acute medicine. An anonymous questionnaire of 10 items was used to explore students' attitudes and interests in using the interactive algorithms as part of their medical or health care studies. Data collection was conducted over 10 days in February 2013.
   Results: In total, 25 interactive algorithms in the Czech and English languages have been developed and published on the AKUTNE.CZ education portal to allow the users to test and improve their knowledge and skills in the field of acute medicine. In the feedback survey, 62 participants completed the online questionnaire (13.5%) from the total 460 addressed. Positive attitudes toward the interactive algorithms outnumbered negative trends.
   Conclusions: The peer-reviewed algorithms were used for conducting problem-based learning sessions in general medicine (first aid, anesthesiology and pain management, emergency medicine) and in nursing (emergency medicine for midwives, obstetric analgesia, and anesthesia for midwifes). The feedback from the survey suggests that the students found the interactive algorithms as effective learning tools, facilitating enhanced knowledge in the field of acute medicine. The interactive algorithms, as a software platform, are open to academic use worldwide. The existing algorithms, in the form of simulation-based learning objects, can be incorporated into any educational website (subject to the approval of the authors).

TI Designing for discovery learning of complexity principles of congestion

SO INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE

AB We propose and evaluate a framework supporting collaborative discovery learning of complex systems. The framework blends five design principles: (1) individual action: amidst (2) social interactions; challenged with (3) multiple tasks; set in a (4) a constrained interactive learning environment that draws attention to (5) highlighted target relations. The framework addresses a persistent tension in discovery-based pedagogy between offering students the freedom to initiate, experiment, and explore and providing them with tailored experiences with many instances of particular relations underlying the target conceptual structure. The framework was realized with TrafficJams, a participatory simulation in which students drive together. A class of high-school students worked with TrafficJams over 2.5 h. The teacher's role was to orchestrate the activity but there was no explicit instruction of the traffic and complexity principles. The students completed pre- and post-test questionnaires and their activities were observed and logged. In terms of driving in the simulation, the students learned to drive in ways that reduced congestion in traffic by decreasing lane and speed changes, and keeping their speed down. Even though there was no explicit teaching, half of the students learned that car speed distribution alone can generate traffic jams with no additional causes; and, keeping a safe following distance from the next driver increases everyone's speed. Our study suggests that the learning environment partially met both the overarching design goal of constrained discovery and the specific content goal of systems reasoning.

DT Article
AB Objective. To study the application value of PBL (Problem-Based Learning) combined with a situational simulation teaching method in clinical practice teaching of radiology. Methods. 120 interns who practiced in the radiology department of our hospital from 2020 to 2021 were randomly divided into a study group and a control group. The research group used PBL combined with the scenario simulation teaching method to carry out clinical practice teaching activities. The control group was carried out according to the conventional teaching plan. After 3 months, the teaching effect and satisfaction of the two groups were compared. Results. The imaging report quality control score, intravenous contrast agent score, and practice test score in the study group were higher than those in the control group. The scores of the small class and special class in the research group were higher than those in the control group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The scores of job competency questionnaire in the research group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05). The occupational self-efficacy questionnaire score of the research group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). The nursing practice satisfaction score of the research group was higher than that of the control group (P < 0.05). Conclusion. The value of PBL combined with the scenario simulation teaching method in the teaching of radiology clinical practice is significant, which can improve the work ability of interns and make them more satisfied.

TI Peer Pedagogy: Student Collaboration and Reflection in a
   Learning-Through-Design Project
SO TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID CLASSROOM; SCIENCE; APPRENTICESHIP; SOFTWARE
AB Background: Existing research suggests that one of the challenges for teachers in persisting with innovative inquiry curricula is their difficulty scaffolding students' transitions into technology-supported and open-ended activities. The question of whether students can effectively scaffold one another's transitions has not been previously investigated, in part, we argue, because of a predominant focus in collaborative learning research on short-term tasks and perfunctory "helping" behaviors.
   Purpose: This article addresses the nature and role of students' collaborations in learning-through-design, a technology-rich science inquiry curriculum. Within this environment, we examined emergent collaborative patterns among students, the affordances of those patterns for effective learning, and students' reflections on their interactions. We paid particular attention to how students with varying degrees of previous experience in this curricular approach collaborated with one another.
   Setting: This study took place at a university-affiliated elementary school in a West Coast urban area.
   Population: Two mixed-grade classes of fourth-and fifth-grade students (n = 63) and their science teacher participated in this study. Fifth-grade students in one class had extensive experiences with learning through design during the previous year.
   Practice: For 10 weeks during the fall, students in both classes learned about marine biology. During this time, they also worked in teams to create marine simulations using Logo Microworlds programming and multimedia software.
   Research Design/Data Collection and Analysis: Design-based research guided the creation of the curriculum and examination of its effectiveness. Ethnographic methods, grounded theory, hermeneutics, and discourse analysis were used to collect and analyze video of student collaborations and interviews. Analysis of variance was conducted using the coded results from student interviews to determine significant differences among groups.
   Results: We found that experienced fifth-graders took on many socializing functions, effectively apprenticing younger students into the practices of learning-through-design. Interviews revealed that both fourth-grade and fifth-grade students were highly reflective about their respective collaborative roles and that experienced students benefited as much as, if not more so, than inexperienced students from this arrangement.
   Conclusions: Given experienced students' strategic, effective, and thoughtful ongoing collaborations with their fourth-grade counterparts, we introduce and propose the term peer pedagogy to describe these interactions. This term and our constituent results have implications for existing research and practice with collaborative learning and project-based technology-integrated curricula, as well as for theory and scholarship on children's roles within learning communities.

AB Background: This article reports on an evaluation study of a project seeking to develop the use of position-linked datalogging with primary pupils in environmental science contexts.
   Purpose: The study sought to find out the extent to which the project had developed: (1) participant teachers' confidence in using datalogging as an everyday part of their science teaching; (2) pupils' abilities to collect and interpret relevant environmental monitoring data; and (3) the use of scientific data within environmental education in the project schools.
   Programme description: The project used software which integrates data from Global Positioning System (GPS) with sensor data collected outdoors to produce Google Earth visualisations of environmental quality in each school's locality.
   Sample: Phase 1 involved 10 primary schools in the South West of England (2008-9), and phase 2 was implemented in six primary schools in Greater London during 2010. All pupils in the 9-10-year-old age range participated to some extent (N approximate to 450) and each school identified a focus group of between two and four pupils (n = 38) together with two members of staff (n = 32) to be more closely involved in the project.
   Design and methods: The evaluation adopted a multi-method approach, drawing upon documentary sources (n = 40); observations of continuing professional development (CPD) cluster days (n = 8) and dissemination events (June 2009 and January 2011): baseline pupil assessment tasks (n = 291) and teachers' baseline questionnaire (n = 25) in September 2008 and March 2010; classroom observations; samples of pupil work (n = 31); end-of-project pupil assessment (n = 38) and teachers' and pupils' responses to the project (n approximate to 180) in June 2009 and December 2010; and a longitudinal evaluation in February 2012.
   Results: Datalogging had become a regular feature of practical science in nearly all project schools up to 30 months after the end of the project, but the use of position-linked logging had not been sustained. While there is evidence of pupils developing a range of scientific enquiry skills through the project, the extent to which their interpretation of data improved is unclear. All participating schools made greater use of scientific data than before the project to develop their environmental education.
   Conclusions: The project has demonstrated the potential of combining datalogging with GPS technology to support challenging, motivating and relevant scientific enquiry. Primary teachers require targeted technical and pedagogical support to maximise learning benefits for pupils.

AB This study examined how middle school students constructed their understanding of the mitosis and meiosis processes at a molecular level through multimedia learning materials presented in different interaction and sensory modality modes. A two (interaction modes: animation/simulation) by two (sensory modality modes: narration/on-screen text) factorial design was employed. The dependent variables included subjects' pre-test, post-test, and retention-test scores, showing their understanding of mitosis and meiosis process at molecular level, as well as data of subjects' eye-movement behavior. Results showed the group that received animation with narration allocated a greater amount of visual attention (number of fixations, total inspection time, and mean fixation duration) than the group that received animation with on-screen text, in both pictorial area and area of interest, which is consistent with students' immediate and long-term retained learning of the processes of mitosis and meiosis. The group that received simulation with on-screen text allocated a greater amount of visual attention than the group that received simulation with narration, consistent with students' immediate and retained learning. The group that received simulation with on-screen text also allocated a greater amount of visual attention than the group that received animation with on-screen text, consistent with students' immediate and retained learning. This study adds empirical evidence of a direct correlation between the length of eye fixation behavior and the depth of learning. Moreover, it provides insight into the multimedia effect on students' cognitive process through the use of eye fixation behavior evidence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The implementation of Virtual Learning Environments (VLE) is becoming more frequent in various academic fields, within these, Mechanical Engineering is not a stranger to this trend. Although, there have been multiple developments of computer simulations for physics and basic sciences, there is, still, a timid and limited presence within the specialty of Mechanical Engineering. Therefore, it is difficult to evaluate the effect of these VLEs on the training of mechanical engineers. Taking these two aspects into account, a VLE focused on kinematics was implemented during the Dynamics and Mechanisms course, taught at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Antioquia. The use of free and open computer applications and their effects in the learning of complex engineering knowledge was evaluated. It was found that the incorporation of these type of applications could improve the level of appropriation of the various concepts of kinematics. In addition, through an analysis of the results, it was possible to identify some concepts that represent greater understanding difficulty and help the instructor provide the needed feedback to the group.

DE Automatic formative evaluation; flipped classroom; multiple campus /
   online students
AB In this article, we describe an approach to give automatic formative evaluation by atomizing the feedback. The mechanics in this approach is a large number of multiple-choice tests. The multiple-choice tests are used as voluntary assignments and gives controlled progression by releasing the tests in an order. Instruction is in the spirit of flipped classroom with short video lectures accompanied by one to several above-mentioned assignments. The preliminary results show reduced dropout, higher student satisfaction, and less fail on final exam.
   The background for this approach submerged from a multi-campus/online course with 300+ students. The aim was to create the same environment for learning for all categories of students, on campus, remote campus and online students.
   Atomized formative evaluation is achieved by giving feedback down to each individual multiple-choice answer. The multiple-choice questions are in the nature of practical tasks where students are expected to use external tools, calculations and simulation to find answers. The multiple-choice test collects the students' findings. The number of correct answer gives a summative evaluation. After turning in the test, answers are available together with feedback for each answer. Correct answers explain why this is correct and a wrong answer explains why this is wrong in addition to how and why the student should go by finding the correct answer. The questions are designed with no "dummy" answer, so when choosing a wrong answer, it is a plausible answer, and an explanation for this is given as feedback.
   The goal is to encourage the student to try again both to improve the summative score and to fill the gap in knowledge. When forming the feedback, one must consider both the type of question and the choices made available.
   Using atomized feedback improves the formative evaluation greatly by being instant, continuous, to the point and informative. This is evaluation for learning that both guides and encourage the student. In addition, since instructors/TA do not use time to evaluate results on assignments, they can guide / tutor individual students who need follow up.
   Student performance is evaluated by achieved grade, student satisfaction, progression, and the number of assignments compared to grade. The preliminary findings compared with earlier student performance in the same course but without atomized formative feedback show a reduced number of dropouts and reduced number of students failing the final exam.

AB Although visualization remains a primary mode of interaction in simulations, touch is the most common way people use to interact with the physical objects. A greater sense of immersion in a learning environment can be reached when the user is able to feel and manipulate objects as compared to only seeing or listening. Despite the affordances of haptic technologies, which could serve as scaffolds for deep conceptual learning, their true potential in education has not been fully harnessed and little research has been done to investigate its effectiveness for learning difficult concepts. This study explores the potential of haptic technologies in supporting conceptual understanding of difficult concepts in science, specifically concepts related to electricity and magnetism. A pretest-posttest study identified if students improved their conceptual understanding of electricity and magnetism concepts. Specifically, this study identified (a) how students, with different physics background, conceptually interpreted the tactile learning experience in the context of the visualization, and (b) students' perceptions on the use of haptic technologies for their learning, as well as their perceived usefulness and ease of use. Our results suggest that overall students significantly improved their conceptual understanding about electric fields for distributed charges after being exposed to a visuohaptic simulation guided activity. Regarding students' prior coursework, students with high school-only physics background outperformed students who have been previously exposed to college-level physics courses 8% higher in the posttest average score. Similarly, students overall agreed that they enjoyed using the haptic device for learning and found the technology as easy to interact with. Implications for teaching and learning are provided as well as venues for future work.

AB Researchers designing the multiagent tools and techniques for computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments are often faced with high cost, time, and effort required to investigate the effectiveness of their tools and techniques in large scale and longitudinal studies in a real-world environment containing human users. Here, we propose SimCoL, a multiagent environment that simulates collaborative learning among students and agents providing support to the teacher and the students. Our goal with SimCoL is to provide a comprehensive test bed for multiagent researchers to investigate 1) theoretical multiagent research issues, e. g., coalition formation, multiagent learning, and communication, where humans are involved and 2) the impact and effectiveness of the design and implementation of various multiagent-based tools and techniques (e. g., multiagent-based human coalition formation) in a real world, distributed environment containing human users. Our results show that SimCoL 1) closely captures the individual and collective learning behaviors of the students in a CSCL environment; 2) identify the impact of various key elements of the CSCL environment (e. g., student attributes and group formation algorithm) on the collaborative learning of students; 3) compare and contrast the impact of agent-based versus nonagent-based group formation algorithms; and 4) provide insights into the effectiveness of agent-based instructor support for the students in a CSCL environment.

AB Agent-based modeling (ABM) offers learners the opportunity to actively engage in complex modeling situations. These range from the physical and natural sciences to those topics which are relevant in today's society under the auspice of a variety of socio-economic or cultural happenings. Minimal user interaction is required, as the simulation or game is designed and the outcome of the data on human behavior and logical thought processes. This encourages learners to work collaboratively in a multi-player gaming forum and to realistically apply scientific principles and properties in a low-threat matrix environment. The uses of ABM within educational games are a key component in improving Critical Thinking (CT) and Cognitive Load (CL) abilities for a more realistic learning environment.
   ABM propounds a practical application of identifying active entities by the modeler, of agents while defining the agents' behavior(s). The agents, in this learning forum, were the learner/users of the simulation game, while the behavior was the established connection(s) between scientific concepts and phenomena and the practical application(s) therein. ABM is a fairly new approach to the modeling of complex systems, in which autonomous 'agents' or users abide by 'behaviors' or rules of engagement. The users or agents interact with one another, thus influencing their behavior(s), therefore altering the outcome(s) of the simulation game. This in turn creates a more realistic view of general behavioral practices. These practices give rise to patterns and structural attributes that cannot be expressly or explicitly programmed into the game itself.
   The research performed was a causal-comparative quantitative study with 150 learners enrolled at a two-year community college, to determine the effects of Agent-Based Modeling on learner behavior within science education. Data collection involved a quantitative analysis of pre/post-laboratory experiment surveys that included using a Repeated Measures ANOVA test for ABM or non-ABM for cognitive load and critical thinking modalities. By studying the manner in which learners comprehend information and reducing their cognitive load while conducting scientific experiments in Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs), we are provided with the information required to structure pedagogical changes and appropriate technology resources in applicable teaching modalities.

AB Applying graphical programmable platform-LabVIEW to develop virtual instrument is an important direction in instrument development..Its advantage is to simplify hardware development under the help of LabVIEW's powerful data processing, analysis and display capabilities. The development and application of Multisim, a circuit simulation software, makes building a virtual laboratory based on computer become possible. Shortcomings of the Experimental teaching in Hardware environment would be eliminated and students can fulfill their circuit testings which are designed by themselves though the computer by combining Multisim and LabVIEW perfectly, so that way, it will not only make students know the circuit theory better, but also increase students' interest in learning so that the quality of electronic experiment teaching can be improved.

AB Programmable robots like Lego Mindstorms have proven to be an effective mediator to teach computer programming to school children. Therefore several projects that aim at increasing the interest in computer programming and computer science in general use robots as a cornerstone in their course concepts. Handing out robotic kits to the school students who have participated in the courses is not feasible, thus the learning content cannot be repeated and enhanced at home. We developed a flexible multi-user simulation environment for LEGO Mindstorms NXT robots which is closely integrated into our pedagogical teaching scenarios. User tests show that this environment can be successfully used to increase the long-term outreach of our courses.

DT Article
AB A multimedia program, a non-linear system which supplements the traditional, linear way of learning (e.g. with a text book), was developed. Non-linear systems allow the direct use of information in a free sequence. A problem of these systems is the danger that the reader becomes lost in detail. Therefore, a program was constructed which tries to combine the properties of linear and non-linear teaching systems. Student groups were continuously involved during all stages of the project. The program is organized in several levels. These are: (1) choice of chapters; (2) table of contents of one chapter; (3) summary; (4) text and (5) pictures, animations, simulations and video sequences. The program can be used in different ways. In the linear mode, the reader selects via action words different levels of the program. The user can read either only on the level of the summaries or on detailed information (text, pictures, simulations and videos). In the non-linear mode the user jumps via menu items or buttons to selected pictures, simulations or a searched term. In this way, more than 3500 screen pages are integrated into a multimedia program for veterinary physiology. The program is written in TOOLBOOK(R), and can be used on a personal computer with Windows 95(R) or higher.

AB Higher education institutions need to play a leading role as drivers of change. In this context, there is a growing trend to develop multidisciplinary approaches to education for sustainable development, and to implement student-centered and problem-based teaching and learning methods to increase student satisfaction and engagement. The method presented here uses an online role-play simulation in which the students represent several stakeholders from the microfinance sector in Uganda, for the overall purpose of increasing financial and social inclusion levels in the country. Several Sustainable Development Goals are addressed from the perspective of interactions between different actors and their specific characteristics, objectives, and interests. This study uses post-simulation data to explore the students' perceptions about the usefulness of this methodology to foster key cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning outcomes. The implementation of this teaching and learning methodology demonstrated that this active learning method helps students acquire the set of skills and abilities that are expected of graduate students in economics, business, and management, with a special focus on sustainability criteria. Thanks to the methodology in this study, students are able to understand the complexities of the microfinance sector and its potential to tackle poverty and inequality.

AB In 2011, the Finnish National Board of Education assessed the learning outcomes of history with a study whose results raised doubts about the fulfilment of the goals of history education. This article seeks to expand awareness about Finnish adolescents' understanding of historical empathy. The study assessed twenty-two 16-17-year-old high school students' ability to understand predecessors' actions in particular historical situations. The study also examined how well a simulation exercise works as a tool of empathy teaching and evaluation. Students participated in the simulation and afterwards the students were interviewed. They also participated in a survey that measured their attitudes before and after the exercise, and wrote an essay at the end of the course. The results of the study show that most of the high school students did not reach the goals set for history teaching. The weak performance of students is explained by the strong tradition of history teaching which has been continuing in Finnish schools despite the curriculum reform. Teaching still concentrates on passing a meta-narrative on to students who have not yet enough experience of explaining historical events from a multiperspective point of view.

AB The use of technology in teaching economics has become increasingly popular in recent decades, and the rapid evolution of the sector has the potential to revolutionize education. Yet, despite the wide range of methods implemented in economics courses, more research is required regarding examples of how active-learning methodologies can be combined with technology to foster student learning, raise awareness regarding real-world complexities, and enhance the acquisition of multiple learning outcomes. This study presents an online role-play simulation designed to help students understand the intricacies of International Political Economy, while fostering essential cognitive, skill-based, and affective learning outcomes. Students participated in teams representing different countries seeking to improve their economic status by producing products and exchanging them with other countries, all while monitoring their performance in five core structures of International Political Economy: global production, global trade, global finance, global knowledge, and global security. These structures and all the economic interactions were managed using a single spreadsheet. The study uses pre-and post-simulation quantitative and qualitative information to assess the students' perception about the methodology. The implementation of this problem-based, online, collaborative learning activity demonstrated that the students perceived the experience as a useful teaching and learning strategy.

AB An interactive computer program is described, which presents simulated data for a range of tutor-designed, structured investigations performed in vivo in the anaesthetised rat. It is aimed at undergraduate students of pharmacology, and is designed to teach various aspects of cardiovascular pharmacology and to provide an alternative to performing the practical procedure on live animals. In addition to providing simulated data, the program covers several other aspects related to the live practical, for example, UK Home Office Licence requirements, anaesthesia of the animals, cannulation procedures and the apparatus used. It also contains suggested student tasks for each experiment, making it suitable for independent learning. The program is written for IBM-compatible PCs running Windows(TM) and makes use of several features to enhance interactivity and presentation, i.e. high-resolution colour graphics, animation, interactive questions (multiple choice, drag and drop, True/False), problem-solving exercises and simulations. It has been evaluated with final year BSc (Hens) Pharmacology students at one UK university, where is was used to prepare students for the live animal practical. The results of this small study were largely favourable.

AB BackgroundNowadays, a comprehensive approach is needed to describe the current status of the technology integration process and the identification of the factors that affect it, because the description and frame of the existing situation will be the starting point in the organization of the roadmap to the realization of an effective integration process. The purpose of this study is to identify the differences in technology integration of the medical educators working in Turkey and analyze these according to various variables on the basis of technological pedagogical content knowledge.MethodData used in the study were collected from 301 medical educators using the TPACK-Practical Scale and Attitude towards Technology Scale. The data were analyzed using Ward's minimum variance hierarchical clustering analysis, discriminant function analysis and multinomial logistic regression analysis.ResultsAccording to the results of the study, medical educators' technology integration was grouped in the following clusters, according to their TPACK: (i) activity-based, (ii) student- based and (iii) topic-based. It was found that the developed model explains 79% of the variance of technology integration. The implementation of simulation-based medical education in medical school and the department where they work affect the clusters to which the medical educators were assigned, whereas the gender variable didn't have an effect. The findings showed that attitudes towards technology, simulation education and working in the field of basic medical sciences increased medical educators' activity-based presence.ConclusionsThe review of the clusters and their characteristics showed that there are similarities between the items used in the designing stage of the education programs and the relationships of these items among them. Learner centered approaches are based on the assumption that students are located at the center of the program. In these designs, teaching mostly focuses on the learner, rather than program, learning or administrative body. Individuals and their identities are crucial.

AB Purpose
   There is a growing trend in higher education institutions to develop multi-disciplinary approaches to education for sustainable development and to implement student-centered and problem-based methodologies to increase student engagement and satisfaction. This paper aims to present an innovative methodology to increase student awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This method uses a videogame and two board games to simulate three spheres of economic interaction, namely, local, national and international. For every sphere, three key economic sectors and their relationships with fundamental sustainable development goals (SDGs) are addressed. This study uses pre- and post-simulation data to analyze the students' perceptions regarding the usefulness of the simulations and their awareness about the effects of economic decisions on sustainability.
   Findings
   The implementation of this teaching and learning method demonstrated not only that active learning can effectively increase student awareness about the potential social and environmental consequences of economic decisions but also that students perceive games and simulations as useful teaching and learning tools.
   Social implications
   Students in these areas need to learn not only how to transform original ideas into successful projects but also to align financial results with social and environmental objectives. The methodology presented in this research allows to enhance learning from a multi-disciplinary perspective, helping the students to analyze different economic sectors and their connection with a number of SDGs through the lens of public economics.
   Originality/value
   The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus has shown the effects of a global pandemic at the economic, social and environmental levels. This paper presents an innovative active learning framework to increase sustainability awareness among students of economics, business and management.

AB As part of a process of quality enhancement of the curriculum and the student learning experience at Birmingham City University (BCU), the Initial Teacher Education (ITE) academic team in has been experimenting and implementing innovative ways of developing trainee teachers interview skills. A series of online simulations have been purposely developed and trialled with students. The multimedia resources have been designed to provide students with an opportunity to test their interview skills in a virtual environment, where they can safely make mistakes. Initial findings relate to trainee teachers' limited previous interview experience for any employment, including teaching posts, limited strategies to support them at interview (e.g.: worked with peers on possible questions) and usefulness of interview scenarios in providing an opportunity to strengthen interview skills. Feedback from the academic staff related to trainees being less well-equipped for interview than anticipated, therefore the experience as assessors provided good insights to plan for personalised and group interventions, and challenge preconceptions. Also, staff valued the peer assessment process, as an excellent way of engaging all students in thinking about interviews. The realism of the questions and the visual clues of panel was a considerable added value, as it contributed to exercise a similar level of "pressure" on the interviewees, similar to the one of a real interview.

However, multiple professional societies have recognized that most undergraduate biochemistry students acquire only a surface-level understanding of metabolism. We hypothesized that guiding students through interactive computer simulations of metabolic systems would increase their ability to recognize how individual interactions between components affect the behavior of a system under different conditions. The computer simulations were designed with an interactive activity (i.e., module) that used the predict-observe-explain model of instruction to guide students through a process in which they iteratively predict outcomes, test their predictions, modify the interactions of the system, and then retest the outcomes. We found that biochemistry students using modules performed better on metabolism questions compared with students who did not use the modules. The average learning gain was 8% with modules and 0% without modules, a small to medium effect size. We also confirmed that the modules did not create or reinforce a gender bias. Our modules provide instructors with a dynamic, systems-driven approach to help students learn about metabolic regulation and equip students with important cognitive skills, such as interpreting and analyzing simulation results, and technical skills, such as building and simulating computer-based models.

AB Seventeen ninth grade students worked in teams to build their own low cost robots, program them and use them to draw various geometric shapes. The course was designed to enhance their interest in engineering and math, while providing a social context of empowerment, competition and cooperation. This paper will document our past and planned efforts to integrate robotics into high school math curriculum. Our goal is to build low-cost robots that can be purchased or built incrementally to manage budgetary restrictions. These robots should be reliable, robust, and most important of all, be customizable for the specific needs of the teacher and the student teams. Furthermore, we integrated the robots into math lessons.
   The results indicate that students in our robotics program benefited from the use of robots. We looked at a problem that students solved using the Pythagorean Theorem and then analyzed the results of the robotic simulation. The students correctly interpreted both the mathematical problem and the real world error that was produced when using the robots. Students were also able to understand the difference between conceptual error and real world error. The students recognized that the robots they built could be used as an instructional tool to a wider range of audience. In all, these clinical interviews explicitly show how students used the robotic art approach to better conceptualize and solve math problems.
   We also examined the two-boat problem that we intend to use in our future robotics math classroom. The problem is visually and dynamically solved. Successive approximation is used to identify a trend and come close to a solution. Using robots, students can guess and check to make sense of the problem then look at it from different angles and solve it in many ways. Students need to explore different estimates and evaluate each one until they come close to the solution. After examining the problem from so many different perspectives, they are now comfortable that the result they have gotten with the robots is near to the mathematically correct solution. Students can stop with the robotic investigation at any point and solve the problem algebraically.
   Learning mathematics with robots helps students visualize challenging real world applications and supports multiple representations of a problem. While students apply their knowledge of math concepts solving real world problems with the help of robots, they develop a lasting handson experience in a social context and a better attitude towards math education. Building low cost robots that schools can afford would ensure access, availability and foster mainstream instruction with robots that would help prepare our next generation in math and engineering principles.

AB MeParticle-WeMatter is a participatory simulation in which students play the role of particles to learn about the structure and properties of matter. The students navigate their particle in a multiparticle environment, as they are pulled or pushed by Lennard-Jones forces. We show how the student control of the particles resembles a random heating algorithm and describe a quasi-experimental setup to study how participating as particles in this environment contributes to learning. This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the ConfChem online conference Interactive Visualizations for Chemistry Teaching and Learning, held from May 8 to June 4, 2015 and hosted by the American Chemical Society Division of Chemical Education Committee on Computers in Chemical Education.

AB Purpose - This research aims to explore how textual literacy and computational literacy can support each other and combine to create literacies with new critical possibilities. It describes the development of a Web application for interactive storytelling and analyzes how its use in a high-school classroom supported new rhetorical techniques and critical analysis of gender and race.
   Design/methodology/approach - Three iterations of design-based research were used to develop a Web application for interactive storytelling, which combines writing with programming. A two-week study in a high-school sociology class was conducted to analyze how the Web application's textual and computational affordances support rhetorical strategies, which in turn support identity authorship and critical possibilities.
   Findings - The results include a Web application for interactive storytelling and an analytical framework for analyzing how affordances of digital media can support literacy practices with unique critical possibilities. The final study showed how interactive stories can function as critical discourse models, simulations of social realities which support analysis of phenomena such as social positioning and the use of power.
   Originality/value - Previous work has insufficiently spanned the fields of learning sciences and literacies, respectively emphasizing the mechanisms and the content of literacy practices. In focusing a design-based approach on critical awareness of identity, power and privilege, this research develops tools and theory for supporting critical computational literacies. This research envisions a literacy-based approach to K-12 computer science which could contribute to liberatory education.

AB Background: The increasing volume of nursing students placed in shrinking numbers of clinical sites has resulted in clinical overcrowding in behavioral care settings. Overcrowding has resulted in the deterioration of the clinical teaching and learning experience for students, faculty, and nurses. PsyConnect is a layered, multiplatform engagement learning experience that uses multiple teaching methods to increase student engagement, reduce inpatient overcrowding, maximize learning opportunities, and improve teaching and learning experiences. Method: PsyConnect was implemented in a baccalaureate mental health nursing course during one term. Investigators surveyed students, faculty, and nurses who attended campus simulation. Data analysis included measures of central tendency and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: Setting rotations, clinical checklists, off-unit learning modules, and simulation with staff nurses improved educational experiences, as reported by students, faculty, and participating nurses. Conclusion: The PsyConnect evaluation suggested that layered, multiplatform, engagement-based learning addressed critical barriers to high-quality, clinical education.

AB There has been much research interest in the area of multimedia learning and using e-learning to assist student learning. A range of tools and teaching materials are used to develop students' understanding in different domains. We have developed an online chemistry module with three different versions, designed to determine the most effective way for enhancing student learning and addressing misconceptions students may have. One version incorporates the use of still pictures, one version uses animations and simulations, and the final version uses animations and simulations together with interactivity. The present study investigated students' perception of the modules and performance associated with using these different versions of the module. While students rated the animated and interactive versions of the module more highly than the one that had still pictures only, this did not translate to increased performance in associated tests.

TI MULTIMEDIA PEDAGOGUES - INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING
SO COMPUTER
LA English
DT Article
AB Multimedia learning environments, or pedagogues, may well revolutionize education as students participate in the educational process through intelligent simulation, dynamic links, and multimedia composition and creation.
   Multimedia technologies will challenge teachers to instruct dynamically and students to learn actively. The authors believe that this approach will motivate students to want to learn, and free teachers to spend additional time providing individual attention and guidance.
   To accomplish this, the active learning environment must let users adjust the database parameters to their individual needs. The multimedia system must be able to reason about user actions and respond immediately. To do so, the system must have detailed knowledge about the environment.
   The authors present case studies of educational multimedia systems already in use, including simulations, tutors, document creation and collaboration, and explanatory systems. For example, the Cardiac Tutor, a knowledge-based simulation for teaching cardiac resuscitation. provides spoken advice, emergency room sounds, and graphic indications of ECG trace, blood gases, and vital signs for senior medical students at the University of Massachusetts.
   Some technological barriers must be overcome before more effective multimedia tools can be developed. The authors suggest several ways. They discuss the benefits of knowledge- and network-based multimedia systems, and the challenges that must be faced to realize their potential in active learning environments. They also call for effective authoring tools that can evaluate student responses and track student activities. As these technologies mature, multimedia pedagogues will help motivate a shift in education toward active, hands-on learning.

TI Sketching to support visual learning with interactive tutorials
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB [This paper is part of the Focused Collection on Curriculum Development: Theory into Design.] This manuscript discusses how learning theories have been applied to shape multiple aspects of the design of curricular activities combining interactive computer simulations and University of Washington style tutorials (so-called simulation-tutorials). When considering the curriculum goals (what to teach), we drew on theories of representational competence and learning with multiple representations. When considering how to teach, we drew on theories of constructivism and sketching to learn, leveraging the advantages of sketching as a constructive process that requires students to make their current understanding explicit in visual form, to make specific choices in order to make their ideas concrete, and to organize information to support deep processing. When considering when and why to sketch, we drew upon theories of representational competence, learning with multiple representations and inventing to prepare for future learning to describe six distinct purposes of sketching both prior to and while working with the simulation. This is illustrated by presenting specific sketching tasks to show how theory informed the design and the sequencing of the tasks. We followed a design-based research method, working at two institutions in two countries and with multiple cohorts of students to understand, and where necessary improve, the design of these activities, primarily basing our decisions on the sketches that students had created. The key message of this research is that the design and sequencing of sketching tasks needs to be carefully matched to the pedagogical rationale and that theory can shape these decisions in many ways.

AB Medical education is changing at a fast pace. Students attend medical school with a high degree of technological literacy and a desire for a diverse educational experience. As a result, a growing number of medical schools are incorporating technology-enhanced active learning and multimedia education tools into their curriculum. Gamified training platforms include educational games, mobile medical apps, and virtual patient scenarios. We provide a systematic review of what is meant by gamification in this era. Specific educational games, mobile apps, and virtual simulations that may be used for preclinical and clinical training have been discovered and classified. The available data were presented in terms of the recognized platforms for medical education's possible benefits. Virtual patient simulations have been shown to enhance learning results in general. Gamification could improve learning, engagement, and cooperation by allowing for real-world application. They may also help with promoting risk-free healthcare decision-making, remote learning, learning analytics, and quick feedback. We account for Preclinical training which included 5 electronic games and 4 mobile apps, while clinical training included 5 electronic games, 10 mobile applications, and 12 virtual patient simulation tools. There were additionally nine more gamified virtual environment training products that were not commercially accessible. Many of these studies have shown that utilizing gamified media in medical education may confer advantages. This collection of hyperlinked resources may be utilized by medical students, practitioners, and instructors at all levels.

AB The main aim of education reform in the European Union is the transformation of traditional school into a modern. The task of reform is purposeful and systematic development of skills and competencies especially in the context of a focus on science (Project ROSE - Relevance of Science Education). From the wide range of similar projects such as is project ROSE is a resulting fact that guys are more interested in the technique and everything associated with it, while girls are more focused on issues of a humanitarian nature. In this paper we provided an example of the use of advanced IT to support the teaching of subject Computer Architecture. The traditional form of teaching this course is focused on the memorization of electrical schemes, which represent the functional units of a computer, possibly explaining the operation of its individual components. When transform traditional form to modern teaching methods, we focused on the use of simulation program Multisim that allows to the students a relatively simply gradually develop their critical thinking. In this paper we present a series of examples that we have implemented with students. Examples was focused on non-linear transistor level, combination (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, NOT) and sequential logic circuits (RS), which form the basic architecture of computers. All examples were solved repeatedly with students in the academic years 2009 - 2012. To evaluate the effectiveness of teaching using program Multisim we used a questionnaire in which learners express their views on the quality and method of teaching.

ID FRAMEWORK; MODEL
AB Complex engineering systems often require dynamic coordination of multidisciplinary teams with conflicting objectives. Failing to understand the complex relationships among the conflicting objectives may result in serious engineering failures. In engineering education, one of the challenges in teaching complex systems is the lack of effective tools to demonstrate system dynamics, especially spatial-temporal relationships in the system. The described project in this paper is supported by grants from Engineering Education program of the National Science Foundation. In the project civil/construction engineering cases are used as the context to test the proposed new teaching/learning tool on the subject and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed tool. In building system design, structural designs mainly focus on the behavior of structures under design loads specified for operating stage. Typically less attention is given to the dynamic transient load during various construction stages. The insufficient considerations of the construction related transient loads may reach the critical point during construction and cause structural failure. For example, there were cases of bridge collapse during construction due to inadequate considerations of the load dynamics during construction. Also, many factors affecting construction transient loads were not technical. Rather, they are management related such as construction sequence and cost considerations. Thus, enabling construction students to learn from the similar cases through effective media is critical to avoid repeating the mistakes.
   Based on the case-based and problem-based learning theory, the authors explored using 3D computer simulation of failure cases to help construction engineering and management students to develop a better understand of the dynamics between design and construction. In this study, a case about a high-rise residential building was used. The building collapsed due to many factors, such as improper construction sequence, poor selection of staging area, bad weather, and lack of shoring of foundation wall. Through this case, computer simulation illustrated the interactions of elements of different systems, including building, nature and the social-economic system, and how and why the interactions eventually led to a failure. To better understand the complexity of construction systems, information that was presented by the simulation was organized based on the structure-behavior-function (SBF) theory. In addition, this paper also discussed the technology used in the case study and simulation and the application of such simulation in construction education. The assessment method is to compare the learning results between the control student groups and the experimental student groups, on SBF concepts on complex engineering systems.
   In summary, this paper presents the research background, a case study, research methodology, and 3D cases animations as a potential solution to address the existing problem-the lack of effective teaching tool to effectively teach context-rich case-based engineering cases. Since this is an ongoing research project, the final results of the hypothesis tests are not available yet.

AB Effectively teaching the concepts of osmosis to college-level students is a major obstacle in biological education. Therefore, a novel computer model is presented that allows students to observe the random nature of particle motion simultaneously with the seemingly directed net flow of water across a semipermeable membrane during osmotic simulations. Specifically, the simulations are intended to help students understand that the membrane-crossing probability of water molecules depends solely on their concentrations on both sides of the membrane. The interactive model allows for user-controlled concentration gradients and should also help students avoid some common osmotic misconceptions including those that derive from the use of teleological or anthropomorphic explanations. The model is implemented in the multiagent NetLogo environment and is accessible as a platform-independent Java applet.

AB The article describes the use of Mathematica, a computer algebra system (CAS), in a high school chemistry course. Mathematica was used to generate a graph, where a slider controls the value of parameter(s) in the equation; thus, students can visualize the effect of the parameter(s) on the behavior of the system. Also, Mathematica can show the steps in the solution to an algebraic expression (e.g., solving equilibrium problems), which can benefit students with weak algebra skills. The CAS was used to create interactive and dynamic simulations in support of an inquiry-based advanced placement chemistry Beer's law, kinetics, and. solubility of ionic compounds laboratory activities. A primer in the use of some Mathematica commands is included. This contribution is part of a special issue on teaching introductory chemistry in the context of the advanced placement (AP) chemistry course redesign.

AB In the current paper we propose a framework for designing interactive content to make future e-books more dynamic. The problem with typical e-books today is that they seem to have a lack of interactivity. Considering the rapid advancement of digital technology there are many opportunities to change this situation. We focus on using the multimedia authoring tool Scratch as an option to create interactive content. The Scratch platform is valuable because content can be easily created, shared, embedded in websites and even possibly embedded in future e-books. Thus it opens up a possibility for making e-books more interactive and dynamic. Scratch by its very nature also promotes the constructivist pedagogy of learning by design. The framework we propose for designing interactive Scratch content was derived from creating a specific Scratch model to teach biology content. However, the framework is a promising start to producing interactive content that can apply potentially to any subject.

AB The landscape of surgical anatomy education is progressively changing. Traditional methods, such as cadaveric dissection and didacticism are being increasingly phased out in undergraduate courses for multimodal approaches incorporating problem-based learning, radiology and computer-based simulations. Although effective at clinically contextualizing and integrating anatomical information, these approaches may be a poor substitute for fostering a grasp of foundational pure' anatomy. Dissection is ideal for this purpose and hence remains the cornerstone of anatomical education. However, novel methods and technological advancements continually give way to adjuncts such as cadaveric surgery, three-dimensional printing, virtual simulation and live surgical streaming, which have demonstrated significant efficacy alone or alongside dissection. Therefore, although divergent paradigms of new versus old' approaches have engulfed and divided the community, educators should seek to integrate the ancient and avant-garde to comprehensively satisfy all of the modern anatomy learner's educational needs.

AB An undergraduate bioengineering laboratory course using small autonomous robots has been developed to demonstrate control theory, learning, and behavior. The lab consists of several modules that demonstrate concepts in classical control theory, fuzzy logic, neural network control, and genetic algorithms.
   The autonomous agents are easy-to-build, inexpensive kit robots. Each robot functions independently in a real-world environment. Students program and retrieve data wirelessly using handheld computers. The hands-on nature of the lab modules engages students in ways that lectures, readings and software simulations cannot. By interacting with these robots, students directly experience the effects of unexpected environmental factors on designs and deviations from software simulations.
   The robots are easily adapted for use in many different aspects of two-year college and K-12 STEM education. Students are motivated to understand engineering, math and science principles in order to control the robots. Examples of use of the robots and modules by a local community college are presented.

AB Background.Risk management, and in particular the management of natural hazards and territorial risks has become an essential skill for civil engineers. Teaching risk management to engineering students is therefore crucial, but is also challenging: it looks too abstract to students, and practical works are complex and expensive to organise. It also involves interconnected mechanisms coupling human and technical aspects, that are difficult to explain.
   Aim. The challenge is then to propose a serious game able to support the teaching of territorial risk management to engineering students. As part of their curriculum, these students are expected to learn various concepts and notions: territorial risk, vulnerability of a territory, resilience, risk perception, multi-criteria analysis and balanced management.
   Method. In order to support risk management teaching, we propose SPRITE, an agent-based serious game using a concrete case study which is exemplary in terms of risk management: the coastal floods on the Oleron Island (France). SPRITE places the player (the student) in the role of a local councillor of the Oleron Island, who must ensure the safety and well-being of the island residents, while maximising performance with respect to economic and environmental issues, in a context of coastal flood risk.
   Results. The model is fully implemented in GAMA, an open-source multi-agent geographical simulation platform, and the game is already playable. It was used at the University of Bordeaux in a course on risk management dedicated to students in the Master of Geology and Civil Engineering. The evaluation of engagement and motivation with the game and learning from playing is very positive.
   Conclusions. The results from the game evaluation are encouraging. Short term future work will mainly be dedicated to pursuing this evaluation, and comparing results between students using SPRITE vs students following a more traditional course. Longer term prospects include several improvements of the model and the interface and implemented multiplayer features.

AB Interactive visualizations are being used extensively for effective teaching and learning. Higher degree of interaction in visualizations improves comprehension and leads to deeper learning. However, some research studies have reported ambiguous, inconclusive results in terms of learning benefits of interactive visualizations. The conditional results in such studies suggest some additional features to be instrumental in assisting learners in deriving benefits of interactivity in visualizations. We refer to these features as 'Interactivity Enriching Features'. This study examines how degree of interaction of the user with the visualization affects learning outcome. The study proposes how interactivity in visualizations can be enriched by offering apt affordances and evaluates what additional features could make learning from interactive visualizations more effective at the same degree of interaction. The study has been carried out in the context of a course on Signals and Systems in Electrical Engineering on second year engineering students (N = 134). The subjects were assigned to one of the four conditions: a Non-Interactive Visualization, an Animation, a Simulation, and an Interactivity Enriched Visualization. The dependent variable was test-score for 'Understand conceptual knowledge', 'Understand procedural knowledge' and 'Apply procedural knowledge' categories. The research findings indicate that, i)different degrees of interaction are required for learning different types of knowledge and ii) interactive visualization could not deliver its learning benefits unless it was augmented by 'Interactivity Enriching Features' in the form of appropriate affordance for variable manipulation, especially for higher learning outcomes. This research study contributes towards the design of educationally effective interactive visualizations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background E-learning is increasingly used in postgraduate medical education. Its numerous benefits include an enhanced learning experience through learning style individualisation, interactive elements, and assessment through tests and quizzes. Current meta-analyses conclude that the overall effectiveness of e-learning is comparable to traditional teaching modalities. However, studies demonstrating its benefits are heterogeneous and of varying quality. This randomised controlled trial aims to investigate whether contemporary e-learning completed prior to a course in obstetric anaesthesia prepares the course participants better than self-study of written course material. Methods A randomised controlled trial allocated second-year resident anaesthetists to receive either e-learning in postpartum haemorrhage and written course material in preeclampsia or e-learning in preeclampsia and written course material in postpartum haemorrhage, prior to a compulsory course in obstetric anaesthesia. The primary outcome was knowledge after completion of e-learning before the course, assessed by type X multiple-choice questions with a score ranging from zero to 35. The secondary outcomes were anxiety level before course simulations, performance during course simulations, and knowledge four and 12 weeks after the course. Results The per protocol analysis of the primary outcome included 45 participants and demonstrated a mean difference of 1.8 (95% CI 0.7-2.9; p = .002) in knowledge after completion of e-learning before the course, in favour of e-learning compared to written course material. There were no statistically significant differences in the secondary outcomes. Conclusion This blinded parallel group randomised controlled trial found a numerically small but statistically significant difference in knowledge favouring e-learning over written course material.

AB Education in veterinary medicine, as in other allied health care-health science professions and academia in general, has been subject to the public call for accountability for the quality of its student learning outcomes. A principal stakeholder in veterinary medicine is the American Veterinary Medical Association-Council on Education (AVMA-COE). AVMA-COE has adopted program accreditation standards requiring veterinary colleges to provide evidence that they are measuring and assessing the clinical competency of students before graduation and again shortly after graduation. Schools and colleges are required to develop relevant measures to validate scientific knowledge, skills, and values aligned with North American Veterinary Medical Education Consortium (NAVMEC) core competencies. Beginning in May 2012, the College of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at Texas A&M University modified the professional veterinary medical curriculum by including a required clinical rotation centered on veterinary emergency preparedness and response. A distinguishing major component of the instructional design of the clinical rotation includes Second Life, a commercially obtained computer-generated multi-user virtual simulation learning environment. The virtual reality situations require high-volume, mass-casualty medical triage decision making. The interpersonal communications and interactivity among students, faculty, and third-party actors enable faculty and instructor observers and simulation facilitators to evaluate students actively engaged in critical thinking and complex problem solving while demonstrating skill in the NAVMEC professional competencies. The Second Life virtual simulation has been adopted as a primary tool for direct measurement of student learning objectives outcomes achieved in this clinical rotation and is being implemented in other clinical teaching platforms.

AB This meta-analysis is a study of the experimental literature of technology use in postsecondary education from 1990 up to 2010 exclusive of studies of online or distance education previously reviewed by Bernard et al. (2004). It reports the overall weighted average effects of technology use on achievement and attitude outcomes and explores moderator variables in an attempt to explain how technology treatments lead to positive or negative effects. Out of an initial pool of 11,957 study abstracts, 1105 were chosen for analysis, yielding 879 achievement and 181 attitude effect sizes after pre-experimental designs and studies with obvious methodological confounds were removed. The random effects weighted average effect size for achievement was g+ = 0.27, k = 879, p < .05, and for attitude outcomes it was g+ = 0.20, k = 181, p <.05. The collection of achievement outcomes was divided into two sub-collections, according to the amount of technology integration in the control condition. These were no technology in the control condition (k = 479) and some technology in the control condition (k = 400). Random effects multiple meta-regression analysis was run on each sub-collection revealing three significant predictors (subject matter, degree of difference in technology use between the treatment and the control and pedagogical uses of technology). The set of predictors for each sub-collection was both significant and homogeneous. Differences were found among the levels of all three moderators, but particularly in favor of cognitive support applications. There were no significant predictors for attitude outcomes.

AB Competing in a highly competitive global market requires the commercialization of knowledge and technology to produce better, faster, cheaper, multi-functional flexible, and intelligent products. Engineers involved in the product realization process must master technology as it develops and quickly integrate it into products well ahead of the competition. Robotics, being an interdisciplinary engineering subject, plays a key role in achieving this goal Thus, robots have been a recurring theme in engineering education. Many educators have developed a variety of pedagogical tools and curriculums to increase the ability and competence of students. Project-based learning provides opportunities for interdisciplinary learning in traditional classroom. The emergence of the Internet has reformed the concept and methods of engineering education. This paper presents interactive e-learning environment to enhance student participation, motivation, and learning effectiveness. This research developed inquiry modules to allow students to present their queries in natural Chinese language fashion and through engineering graphics In addition, this study developed interactive learning platforms including mechanism design, assembly and simulation, manufacturing processes, and mechatronic integration. Quantitative and qualitative methods such as questionnaires and interviews were used to evaluate the effects of the developed system. Findings showed that inquiry modules were able to facilitate investigation and planning activities on project developing stages. The results also showed that there were significant improvements in the participants' integration ability of technologies. Furthermore participants with higher initial computer skills were also found to show higher performance as compared to those with lower computer skills. Generally, the online interactive e-learning environment is beneficial to the participants and ought to be given the attention it deserves as an alternative to traditional classes.

AB Many researchers have taken a great deal of effort to promote high quality game-based learning applications, such as educational games, animations, simulations, animated or interactive simulation mechanisms in learning management system (LMS), and so on. The Bloom's taxonomy strategy was successfully implemented as effective gaming model in two different game-based learning applications (puzzle and platformer games) that motivate and actively engage college students in order to make learning process more enjoyable. During using the game-based modules in LMS Moodle, special attention was paid both to the integration of game-play aspects and the relationship between learning styles and game genres. In this paper we shall describe the proposed approach and introduce an adaptation and personalization of player as student model based on game genres. We have analyzed learning styles and teaching strategies that match the game features which resulted in embedding the analysis personalization and teaching strategies into the game. This article presents the effectiveness of agent-based approach in teaching strategies of Moodle gaming education resources.

AB While there are some teachers who are dubious about the benefits of gaming in education, language teachers make great use of simulation/gaming methodologies and there are many supporting textbooks. While many of the simulations/games used are non-computer based, during recent years the computer game has become an important development in popular culture. During the same period there has been an appreciation that computer games can play a significant role in education. In this paper, we explore the use of one particular type of computer game called an Alternate Reality Game (ARG), a form of interactive narrative, often involving multiple media and game elements. We have developed an ARG to motivate secondary school students to learn a modern foreign language and have piloted this game across Europe in 2009. This paper presents a framework for evaluating games-based learning and provides both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of student performance in the pilot using this framework. The paper reflects on this analysis and provides directions for future research.

AB Marine engineering English teaching and learning circumstances in Chinese universities is still quite confined with textbooks and teacher dominant classes, lacking of diversified teaching methods can stimulate learners' passions and interests. The lack of relevant multi-modal teaching methods and information visualization learning tools make it hard for learners to learn marine engineering English. Therefore, we constructed and optimized three dimensional marine engine models based on virtual reality technology, applied force feedback technology to realize the virtual operations on marine engine equipment, and eventually designed and developed a marine engine simulation system (MESS) for marine engineering English teaching and examinations. This system supports three dimensioned interactions and gesture interactions, bringing learners into simulated marine engineering English learning environment with immersed senses. This study aims at augmenting learners' senses of entertainment and immerse, reducing their cognitive loads during marine English learning process, and improving the teaching quality of marine engineering English in Chinese maritime universities. Pilot study results show that students prefer learning marine engineering English under the help of MESS to traditional marine English classes.

ID MOTIVATION
AB One innovative use of digital games is to facilitate learning skills with social components by simulating human behavior with virtual humans. We investigate learners' social goals to understand how they help learners learn intercultural skills from virtual humans in BiLAT, a virtual world that teaches cross-cultural negotiation. We hypothesize that students learn more when they approach the simulation as a social interaction rather than taking a trial-and-error approach perhaps characteristic of video gaming. In a randomized controlled experiment with 59 participants, we found that participants improved cross-cultural negotiation skills through game play. Our hypothesis that participants given an explicit social goal would learn more than those given task-related goals was not confirmed. We did, however, find a positive relation between students' self-reported social goals, regardless of condition, and their learning results. This relation was confirmed through analysis of log data. Although it is still an open question how best to promote students' approaching a simulation with a social orientation, the results underline the importance of such goals.

AB Utilization of traditional teaching methods in education of medicine was considered as the most convenient way to introduce clinical problems and topics during long history. Thanks to the modern technologies and advances in multimedia, simulations and on-line availability obtained during last decades, this barrier was successfully overcome also in this area of higher education. Therefore, our activities are aimed to bring teachers new possibilities to make education of medicine more attractive and more illustrative at all medical faculties involved in MEFANET network. This should be achieved by integration of virtual cases into pre-clinical preparation of students. The virtual cases presented in the form of virtual patients will stimulate and improve both the self-learning activities and the critical thinking of students and future physicians. To discover the needs and expectations of our teachers in the area of virtual patients an online survey was conducted. Based on the requirements derived from this survey the most suitable platform was selected to be implemented into the activities to support multimedia and electronic forms of education at medical faculties.

ID TESTS; ACCURACY
AB When higher education students are assessed multiple times, teachers need to consider how these assessments can be combined into a single pass or fail decision. A common question that arises is whether students should be allowed to take a resit. Previous research has found little to no clear learning benefits of resits and therefore suggested they might not be advantangeous as they are costly for both students and institutions. However, we conducted a simulation study that shows such a conclusion to be presumptuous. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; our results illustrate that if a resit effect were to exist, the analysis used in these studies (i.e. regression discontinuity analysis; RDA) lacked the power to detect such an effect. Power of RDA was only sufficient under extremely implausible conditions (i.e. large sample, large effect size, high correlation between examinations). To adequately compare the effect of assessment policies, researchers are recommended to use other methods than RDA.

AB Technology has helped advance science education in its delivery of content to students. These advancements have led to improved conceptual understanding of physical phenomena in students. In most educational systems, teachers play a crucial role in the introduction of innovative pedagogic interventions. In this paper, the perceived impact on use of virtual laboratories and simulations as a teaching aide in science education by teachers is characterized. Significant improvements on teaching time, teaching methodology, and communication of concepts over traditional teaching techniques are reported. The value of virtual laboratories in individualized learning as opposed to group centric learning as in a conventional laboratory is further explored. Key challenges to complete adoption of these technologies include infrastructural lacunae and depth of teacher knowledge. Hence the individual teacher commitment along with the necessary ICT support can impact the knowledge environment. With functionality to simulate real environments, create assessments, monitor individual student performances, added to the scalability of the virtual laboratory platforms to encompass multiple thematic disciplines and cater to millions of users makes it a sustainable and a need-to-have teaching tool.

AB This paper introduces SimCity 2000, a popular computer simulation model, as a tool for teaching urban geography concepts. Situated within a more traditional class format, this software can enhance computer literacy, geographical knowledge, and critical skills. The dynamism and visual refinement of the software add to the entertainment value of attempting to effectively guide a city's development. These strengths of the program also facilitate learning about the complex, dynamic, and interrelated nature of urban problems. Students are highly motivated to use the software because of its game-like aspects, yet after using the program they report attitudinal learning in the form of a greater appreciation of the role of urban planners, designers, and policy-makers. Instructors should consider how to accommodate different levels of previous experience with the software, particularly in relation to a gender-based dichotomy that is indicated by this study. In addition, instructors should consider how to respond to the more critical response of students who have a stronger background in geography and urban studies.

AB End-user game design tools are effective in motivating and exposing students with no prior programming experience to computer science. However, while there is good evidence that these environments are effective motivators, the question remains what do students actually learn? For our purposes, using Agent Sheets, we would like to know if students can apply the knowledge obtained from programming games to creating science simulations. Specifically, we want to better understand if students are able to recognize Computational Thinking Patterns (CTP) from their game programming experience. Computational Thinking Patterns are abstract programming patterns that enable agent interactions not only in games but also in science simulations. Students and teachers who participated in a game design summer institute were administered a Computational Thinking Pattern Quiz (CTP Quiz). This quiz tested the participants' ability to recognize and understand patterns in a context removed from game programming. We found that participants, for the most part, were able to understand and recognize the patterns in a variety of contexts.

AB Most of learning systems deliver the same learning materials when targeting the same learning unit. It turned out that the learning process could significantly be improved if learning content could be specifically personalised and adapted to individual learners' domain knowledge and capabilities. Few learning systems introduce teaching strategies to satisfy individual learners' requirements. In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we propose a multi-agent system, which is based on learning styles for its adaptability and on domain knowledge for its personalisation. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of this multi-agent based learning system. In particular we discuss the learning resources collecting process, the personalised process and the adaptive process. The system has been tested through several functional experiments, and the analysis of the simulation study indicates that the approach is able to handle personalised and adaptive learning.

DE metaphors; game play; teaching programming
AB The amazing growth of the videogame industry in the last few years has opened new opportunities for the use of games in education. Not only the technology has evolved to a point where almost photorealistic 3D virtual worlds can be seen at home with retail equipment, but also the language of the videogames has evolved to become sophisticated enough to express mental processes, social relations and to represent rich and diverse ways of interacting with the elements of the virtual worlds. In spite of the growing complexity of the videogame language, most of its applications to education are merely simulations built with game technology. This approach limits the application of game-based learning to those domains where real world activities can be easily simulated. The motivation for the work presented in this paper is to pursue more creative uses of videogames in education. When confronting with abstract domains, it is not always possible to find a correlation between each game mechanic and a real world counterpart of the taught subject. So we advocate for doing the game experience a more important part of the learning process instead of using the common simulation-centric approach. The solution that we propose is the use of metaphors where, given the domain to be taught, a virtual world is designed with elements, actions and processes that correspond, as much as possible, on a one to one basis to elements, actions and processes in the problem domain. As a proof of concept, we are working in a system called JV(2)M to teach the inner workings of the Java Virtual Machine. The user is given a piece of Java code which has to be executed by interacting with a metaphoric representation of the Java Virtual Machine. In this paper we present two possible metaphors, one is based on adventure games and the other on multiplayer first person shooters.

AB Interactive multimedia is attracting increasing interest as a support for teaching and learning as the equipment and techniques become more affordable and manageable. However, whether the aim is to produce an information library or an instructional program, interlinking media and bringing them under the coordinated control of end-users raises problems of design and development. These issues arc discussed and illustrated with applications that cover the organisation of material, simulation and learner control, document interchange, and collaborative working.

AB The ray model is usually applied to explain optical phenomena involving light propagation through an optical system and the formation of an image. However, students have difficulties understanding the image formation in some cases because the traditional ray model only represents special light rays. In the present study, we replaced the traditional ray model with the luminous ray model (LRM) to help students understand image formation. In addition, the positive impact of virtual simulation (VS) in the learning process has been documented over the past few decades. The purposes of this study were to investigate high school students' conceptual change in learning image formation through the LRM, and to explore the learning effectiveness of VS on learning different optical concepts. The results indicated that the LRM is helpful in improving students' conceptual understanding. A further analysis showed that VS+LRM was more beneficial than other groups regarding the concept that the object lying on the horizontal central axis could form a real image. These results will help science teachers develop an instructional module to facilitate students' learning of image formation. (C) 2018 American Association of Physics Teachers.

   Heterogeneous associations; Embodied simulation
AB Drawing on Latour's (Reassembling the social: an introduction to actor-network-theory, Oxford University Press, New York, 2005), this manuscript discusses a study of a robotics class in a public, Title I elementary school. Compared with theoretical frameworks (e.g., constructivism and constructionism) dominant in the field of early childhood robotics education, the lens of ANT served to move beyond emphasizing a single element (i.e., either robotic tools or children's work with teachers and parents) to seeing heterogeneous associations of multiple elements involved in robotics education. In these associations, human and non-human elements greatly contributed to implementing robotics activities. In particular, our analysis of three second-graders, who successfully met the instructional objectives set by our research team, revealed critical roles played by material actors (e.g., robotic manipulatives, engineer logs) and quasi-human/quasi-material actants (e.g., embodied simulation) in these children's learning and performance. The findings of this study encourage educators to pay careful attention to multiple elements, including instructional materials and children's bodily exploration, associated with teaching and learning.

AB In learning based on socio-scientific issues, teachers primarily use role playing in situation learning to promote students' knowledge and responsibility and to teach them how to reach a consensus in multirole scenarios. However, if participants only engage with the material from the perspective of having one role, they will ignore comprehensive information on said issue. Therefore, the roles students play during multirole situational learning lead to diversity biases in learning results. To help participants enhance their competencies related to issues and eliminate learning gaps, we developed an issue-based board game named Water Ark based on the following four design ideas: multirole simulation, reflective goal, systemic situation, and interactions of society. The results indicated that after playing the game, participants' knowledge and responsibility regarding water resource adaptation improved significantly. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the gap between the learning outcomes of participants with different roles in the game was not statistically significant, except in terms of students' personal willingness to act. Thus, these design ideas could improve the utility of board games for learning about socio-scientific issues with multirole scenarios.

AB Scholarly debate about student evaluations of teaching (SETs) often focuses on whether SETs are valid, reliable and unbiased. In this article, we assume the most optimistic conditions for SETs that are supported by the empirical literature. Specifically, we assume that SETs are moderately correlated with teaching quality (student learning and instructional best practices), highly reliable, and do not systematically discriminate on any instructionally irrelevant basis. We use computational simulation to show that, under ideal circumstances, even careful and judicious use of SETs to assess faculty can produce an unacceptably high error rate: (a) a large difference in SET scores fails to reliably identify the best teacher in a pairwise comparison, and (b) more than a quarter of faculty with evaluations at or below the 20th percentile are above the median in instructional quality. These problems are attributable to imprecision in the relationship between SETs and instructor quality that exists even when they are moderately correlated. Our simulation indicates that evaluating instruction using multiple imperfect measures, including but not limited to SETs, can produce a fairer and more useful result compared to using SETs alone.

AB In an increasingly complex world, students of economics, business, and management must learn how to combine financial objectives with social and environmental aims. To that end, institutions, teachers, and curricula have a growing need for multidisciplinary approaches to reinforce education for sustainable development. This study presents a pilot project consisting of an innovative online simulation designed to help students understand the challenges that countries and companies from the Global South are facing to balance economic, social, and environmental objectives under sustainability criteria. This research uses quantitative and qualitative data provided by the students to assess the effectiveness of the methodology. The results indicate the usefulness of the methodology in helping students comprehend economic complexities in the Global South, as well as to assist them in acquiring key cognitive, skill-based, and affective educational outcomes. The combination of three active-learning methodologies (role-play, collaborative-learning, and inquiry-based learning) proved to be of high value to address sustainability-related issues in higher education and help students develop 21st-century skills.

AB A path model was used to test the unique and interactive effects of cognitive and motivational variables when learning in a supportive online learning system, Collaborative Inquiry System (CIS). In this student-centered learning environment, students interact with computer simulations and are assisted by online scaffolds intended to help them learn complex scientific concepts. The present study also explored the relationships between students' motivational, cognitive, and metacognitive strategy use and online performance. In total, 178 tenth-grade students participated in the study. The statistical analyses revealed that students' learning goals and cognitive preferences predicted metacognitive strategy use and later influenced their performance. Prior knowledge is a predictor of neither metacognitive strategy use nor learning goals and need for cognition, but is nevertheless an important determinant of online performance. Discussions on how to accommodate the different needs of students with varying levels of prior knowledge, goal orientation, and cognitive preference in a supportive learning system are provided based on the results.

AB We describe a collection of interactive animations and visualizations for teaching quantum mechanics. The animations can be used at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum. Each animation includes a step-by-step exploration that explains the key points. The animations and instructor resources are freely available. By using a diagnostic survey, we report substantial learning gains for students who have worked with the animations. (C) 2012 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB We present a system that automatically generates deictic gestures for animated pedagogical agents (APAs). The system takes audio and text as input, which define what the APA has to say, and generates animated gestures based on a set of rules. The automatically generated gestures point to the exact locations of elements on a whiteboard nearby the APA, which are calculated by searching for keywords mentioned in the speech. We conducted a study with 100 subjects, in which we compared lecture videos containing gestures automatically-scripted by the system to videos of the same lecture containing manually-scripted gestures. The study results show that the manually-scripted and automatically-scripted lectures had comparable number of gestures, and that the gestures were timed equally well.

AB Curriculum development is a dynamic process of iterating multi-literacy which inspires the creation of knowledge and enable to prepare students to meet the challenges of the modern world. Driven by societal imperative and contextual relevance, ideally, the 21st century learning skills and information-media literacy skill shall provide the backbone of Science teaching. Thus, this Action Research aims, to elucidate the integration of 4Cs (communication, collaboration, critical thinking and creativity) as well as to trace the development of information-media literacy and skills through essential mapping technique in order to support the ongoing implementation of the recently crafted Junior High School Science curriculum of the Philippines. As a result, learning activities promoting 4Cs are limited to: performing scientific investigations; role playing; chart & poster making; improvisation & demonstration activity; story making; role playing; multi-media & visual presentation; and simulation activity. The information-media literacy can be developed by the following learning strategies: multimedia presentation; group reporting; performing scientific investigations experimentations; debating activity; modelling, role playing & simulation activity; portfolio making; improvisation & model-making activity; concept making; and diagram making & illustration activity. Problems such as the platforms, the teacher's socio-economic status, tedious teacher's tasks, and lacking support from the community & other stakeholders affect the implementation of the curriculum framework.

AB Five science teachers were observed during two self-study sessions where they learned to use Visual AgenTalk (VAT). In the first session they learned basic skills; in the second, techniques for reusing example simulations. Two reusable examples were developed, one a concrete example world, the second an abstract world. Although all teachers succeeded in learning VAT basics, we observed differences in reuse. It appears that the simplified components of the abstract world supported reuse to a greater degree than those of the concrete example world.

AB BackgroundRealistic, portable, and scalable lectures, cadaveric models, 2D atlases and computer simulations are being combined more frequently for teaching anatomy, which result in major increases in user satisfaction. However, although digital simulations may be more portable, interesting, or motivating than traditional teaching tools, whether they are superior in terms of student learning remain unclear. This paper presents a study in which the educational effectiveness of a virtual reality (VR) skull model is compared with that of cadaveric skulls and atlases. The aim of this study was to compare the results of teaching with VR to results of teaching with traditional teaching methods by administering objective questionnaires and perception surveys.MethodsA mixed-methods study with 73 medical students was conducted with three different groups, namely, the VR group (N=25), cadaver group (N=25) and atlas group (N=23). Anatomical structures were taught through an introductory lecture and model-based learning. All students completed the pre- and post-intervention tests, which comprised a theory test and an identification test. The theory test consisted of 18 multiple-choice questions, and the identification test consisted of 25 fill-in-the-blank questions.ResultsThe participants in all three groups had significantly higher total scores on the post-intervention test than on the pre-intervention test; the post-intervention test score in the VR group was not statistically significantly higher than the post-intervention test score of the other groups (VR: 30 [IQR: 22-33.5], cadaver: 26 [IQR: 20-31.5], atlas: 28[IQR: 20-33]; p>0.05). The participants in the VR and cadaver groups provided more positive feedback on their learning models than the atlas group (VR: 26 [IQR: 19-30], cadaver: 25 [IQR: 19.5-29.5], atlas: 12 [IQR: 9-20]; p<0.001).ConclusionsThe skull virtual learning resource (VLR) was equally efficient as the cadaver skull and atlas in teaching anatomy structures. Such a model can aid individuals in understanding complex anatomical structures with a higher level of motivation and tolerable adverse effects.

TI Taking a Fresh Look at the Skull Base in Otorhinolaryngology With
   Web-Based Simulation Student's Interactive Skull-Base Trainer (SISTer)
SO JAMA OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY

ID VIRTUAL-REALITY; ANATOMY
AB IMPORTANCE The increasing amount of medical knowledge and necessity for time-effective teaching and learning have given rise to emerging online, or e-learning, applications. The base of the skull is a challenging anatomic area in the otorhinolaryngology (ORL) department-for both students and lecturers. Technology-enhanced learning might be an expedient approach to benefit both learners and lecturers.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate and create for advanced medical students a self-assessed adaptive e-learning application for the skull base within our curriculum of otolaryngology at the University Medical Center of Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pilot approach with prospective evaluation of a newly implemented web-based e-learning simulation. The e-learning application (Student's Interactive Skull-Base Trainer) was made accessible as an elective course to a total of 269 enrolled medical students during the first 2 semesters after web launch.
   INTERVENTIONS Spatiotemporal independent e-learning application for the skull base.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Self-assessed evaluation with focus on general acceptance and personal value as well as usage data analysis.
   RESULTS The application was well accepted by the learners. More than 80% of the participating students found the application to be a beneficial tool for enhancing their analytical and clinical problem-solving skills. Although the general matter of the skull base seemed to be of lesser interest, the concept of anchored instructions with the use of high-end, interactive, multimedia-based content was considered to be particularly suitable for this challenging topic. Most of the students would have appreciated an extension of optional e-learning modules.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE With this pilot approach we were able to implement a useful and now well-accepted tool for blended learning. We showed that it is possible to raise interest even in this very specialized subspecialty of ORL with overall individual learning benefit for the students. There is a demand for more e-learning and web-based simulation to support the existing curricula in a hybrid, blended way.

AB Equal access to an instructor's time and attention can be a barrier experienced by many underrepresented minorities. An instructor's own biases will determine the nature of their interaction with students, and even well-meaning instructors can interact with students in differential ways, which might prevent certain students from having access to the material in the class. This is an insidious problem, which may or may not be recognized in peer and student evaluations, and an issue that might escape self-reflection even in educators that are committed to diversity and inclusion. This issue conflates both actual and perceived biases, introducing a complex dynamic between instructor and student. Virtual reality (VR) provides an avenue to generate materials that can be used to enhance or replace classroom instruction with a great degree of realism. Our approach at NC State University was to design VR laboratories that were as inclusive and diverse as possible. This encompassed sourcing content and tapping talent from students that represented a broad range of races, gender identities, and ethnicities. These realistic simulations offer the advantage of minimizing instructor bias (since the instructor generates the material in the absence of the students) while offering students that might struggle with the instructor in a personal setting the opportunity to experience the best that the instructor has to offer. Analysis of the data collected in a user study of VR materials created for organic chemistry laboratories offers insights into the way that students interact with VR instructors. Comments provided by underrepresented minority students point to the perceived impartiality of the instructor, ability to engage with the material independently, and remote access as some of the desirable features of the experience.

ID PRODUCT INNOVATION
AB Universities are increasingly looking to round off undergraduate business degrees with a capstone course that provides students with learning experiences that synthesise prior knowledge, skills and abilities acquired throughout their degree and that leads them to look forward to the transition to the world of employment and professional careers. We take a closer look at these increasingly important courses as part of a multi-university project funded by the Australian Learning and Teaching Council. First, we define a capstone course. Next, we look at the two dominant types of capstone: disciplinary magnets and cross-disciplinary mountaintops. We report on their usage based on an audit of all Australian university websites. We then focus on a more detailed examination of the cross-disciplinary mountaintop capstone. The intention embedded in such a mountaintop is to provide cross-disciplinary learning which enables the student to engage simultaneously with a variety of disciplinary perspectives, processes and possibilities as experienced in the 'real' world. In this paper we provide a case analysis of the innovation processes involved in the creation and operation of such a mountaintop capstone that employs an innovative business simulation in the Faculty of Commerce at the University of Wollongong in Australia. The advantages as well the challenges associated with this initiative are discussed.

ID DESIGN; SYSTEMS
AB The learning process has proved to be highly effective when students learn about real world problems, because these cases stimulate and motivate the students to a greater extent. In this regard, it is intended to introduce the undergraduate engineering students to the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) using a topic of current importance, i.e. simulation of the human lung air flow. It is thought that this new approach will encourage and improve their perception towards the Fluid Mechanics subject as well as it should stimulate the learning process. Based on results from research activities, a new teaching material was developed for simulation of pulmonary biological flows. The learning process is a combination of master class and e-learning through the material available at the "virtual campus'' platform. Three different indicators had been chosen to measure the project success after the lectures. These are results of a knowledge test, the number of entries to the working material at the virtual campus (visit counter), and a satisfaction survey. Obtained results indicate a great benefit from the activity, with 97.8% of students passing the knowledge test. As a result, the fact of moving away from a theoretical CFD lecture to an introduction of practical concepts through a real-world problem, engage the students to a higher level allowing an improved learning process and subject perception.

AB In this paper, we examined students' engagement in an implementation of a Workplace Simulation Project (WSP). The WSP was designed to actively engage students in learning disciplinary content by inviting engineers from industry to have a physical presence within the school building to collaborate with teachers and students to complete projects which simulate the tasks authentic to their work. We focus on the first year implementation of the program that partnered a high school in the rural Midwest with an engineering unit of a government organization. Using a multiple methods study design, we analyzed disciplinary and interdisciplinary pre and posts test along with students' interviews to determine learning gains as well as students' interpretations of creative and critical thinking as experienced in the project and their knowledge of the engineering design process. Effect sizes showed that students in the WSP group had notable gains over the control group participants. Additionally, students' knowledge of core elements of the design process were identified in inductive analyses of the interviews. Findings from this study will provide usable knowledge about effective ways to support systems and design thinking and ways to support expert-novice collaboration to ensure success.

AB "Anatomic VisualizeR(C)" represents the University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine's first Virtual Reality-based educational application. Developed under a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Anatomic VisualizeR(C) is a virtual world which could provide a compelling learning environment and a paradigm for navigating through the world of medical information. It combines 3-D anatomic models (based on the Visible Human(TM) dataset) with supporting 2-D media (e.g., diagnostic imagery, surgical videos, etc.) to establish a comprehensive learning environment for clinical anatomy. This dynamic environment is suitable for preclinical or clinical students. The curricular content is based on clinical simulations and promotes exploration, discovery, and active learning by enabling structures to be taken apart and examined from multiple points of view and in ways not necessarily possible in the real world. It also encourages students to establish and reinforce strong cognitive links to associated curricular materials by providing links between these virtual anatomic models and a full spectrum of multimedia resources.
   Anatomic VisualizeR(C) provides a flexible and extensible user interface for manipulating objects within the simulated 3-D environment. At the core of its object-oriented architecture is the ability to identify, access, view, and manipulate disparate types of lesson resources, accomplished through the creation of encapsulated lesson elements called "blocks". A 3-D block manager called FACET implements the core functionality accorded every block. FACET blocks exist for a variety of medical resources, for exploratory tools that work with those resources, and for specialized text organization and presentation blocks. The application architecture is designed to enable complex multimodal simulations with dynamic retrieval and presentation of lesson resources while following the knowledge hierarchy represented by the lesson's Study Guide. Hand and head motion tracking combined with gestural input allow the user to grab any block and move it in 3-D space. The Study Guide as well as Toolbars provide the syntax for users to navigate, manipulate, and interact with the application and its resources. Anatomic VisualizeR(C) supports three types of visual display: monoscopic CRT, stereoscopic CRT, and full immersion. Studies designed to elucidate the relative merits of VR-based teaching systems and the role of interface design on educational outcomes are underway.

AB Using new game-based learning systems in college education is neither an easy nor a simple task. The aim of such systems is to keep attention, teach students or assess their knowledge through a game. With the aim of keeping students' attention through a game, in this paper we show the implementation of game-based learning systems with a pedagogical agent. We presents two models for assessing student's knowledge used by a pedagogical agent which is a part of the new class of Multimedia Interactive Modules for Learning - MIMLE. One of the models is used for activating the agent. It is realized as a window of Help option and built in accordance to Marcov decision process theory (MDP). The basic goal of this mode is to determine the minimal intervention of the agent towards making the right direction concerning the studying process based on simulation learning. With the second, long-term model, we have assessed student's knowledge in the current game level that is used to decide students should pass on to the next level of learning or if they should stay on the same level.

AB Science education in the United States should shift to incorporate innovative technologies and curricula that prepare students in the competencies needed for success in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers. Here we employ a qualitative case study analysis to investigate the system variables that supported or impeded one such reform effort aimed at improving elementary students' science learning. We found that, while some program design features contributed to the success of the program (i.e., a strong multi-institutional partnership and a focus on teacher training and instructional supports), other features posed barriers to the long-term system-level change needed for reform (i.e., low levels of social capital activation, low prioritization of science learning, and frequent turnover of key personnel). In light of these findings, we discuss broader implications for building the capacity to overcome system barriers. In this way, an in-depth examination of the context-specific barriers to reform in this educational system can inform efforts for future reform and innovation design.

   mechanistic reasoning
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY

ID EXPLANATIONS; THINKING; INQUIRY
AB Computer modeling promotes mechanistic reasoning when learners build and analyze models of complex systems to explore causal mechanisms and use models to generate patterns. StarLogo Nova (SLN), an agent-based modeling (ABM) environment, enables novice programmers to model a system's individual components and investigate its emergent, collective behavior. Through case analysis of teachers using SLN, we demonstrate how ABM advances thinking about mechanisms generating phenomenon. Teachers who used simulation combined with the decoding of SLN models utilized mechanistic reasoning to make sense of how and why complex phenomenon emerged.

AB Advances in signal processing theory and its multi-domain applications make it increasingly difficult for educators to teach abstract mathematical concepts as well as illustrate their relevance in real-world system design in a single course. The advent of block-based design and simulation technologies like Simulink (R) enables educators to develop and employ visual and interactive models of real-world signal processing systems to meet the corresponding challenges. This paper discusses the design and integration of Simulink based interactive models in lectures and related activities in a typical Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course.

AB At the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic continued to spread and became a global pandemic. Affected by the epidemic, online teaching has become the new normal. As the main form of online education, multimedia learning has attracted more and more attention. The study of traditional patterns has always been a particularly important element of art study in China due to cultural heritage and precious resources. Chinese traditional patterns are an important object of learning because of the heritage. This study examines students' understanding of the composition and evolution of traditional Chinese patterns in bronze mirrors by using different multimedia learning materials. A two by two factorial design is employed. The dependent variables includes (1) subjects' post-test scores and (2) the data of subjects' eye-movement behaviour. Data shows that students who use the animation with narration allocate a greater amount of visual attention than students who use animation with on-screen text. The students who use simulation with on-screen text demonstrated a greater amount of visual attention than students who use received simulation with narration. Furthermore, this empirical study confirmed a direct, positive correlation between the length of the subjects' eye fixation behaviour and the depth of learning. This result also provides evidence to prove that the use of multimedia learning materials is helpful in art education, especially in the study of the various elements of traditional Chinese art.

AB Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) has become a useful construct to examine science teacher learning. Yet, researchers conceptualize PCK development in different ways. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to use three analytic lenses to understand the development of three beginning biology teachers' PCK for teaching natural selection simulations. We observed three early-career biology teachers as they taught natural selection in their respective school contexts over two consecutive years. Data consisted of six interviews with each participant. Using the PCK model developed by Magnusson et al. (1999), we examined topic-specific PCK development utilizing three different lenses: (1) expansion of knowledge within an individual knowledge base, (2) integration of knowledge across knowledge bases, and (3) knowledge that explicitly addressed core concepts of natural selection. We found commonalities across the participants, yet each lens was also useful to understand the influence of different factors (e.g., orientation, subject matter preparation, and the idiosyncratic nature of teacher knowledge) on PCK development. This multi-angle approach provides implications for considering the quality of beginning science teachers' knowledge and future research on PCK development. We conclude with an argument that explicitly communicating lenses used to understand PCK development will help the research community compare analytic approaches and better understand the nature of science teacher learning.

AB Although the push toward competency-based higher education is strong and increasing over the years (see e.g. Christensen & Eyring, 2011), teaching and learning competencies at the university is a demanding challenge for both students and teachers. Computer simulations are a promising way to achieve this goal, but their effectiveness is far from conclusive (Bell, Kanar, & Kozlowski, 2008). In this study, we present an investigation of the impact of a distance learning class that employed vLeader, a computer simulator, as the main learning tool. vLeader allows users to interact with artificially intelligent avatars in order to solve complex organizational problems in a social context. Forty-five students participated in the class on leadership and filled out surveys before and after the class. Effectiveness was measured in a pre-post-test design by employing both transactional and transformational self-reported leadership behaviors. We also collected measures of fluid intelligence and extraversion to control inter-individual differences in learning proficiency, dynamism and dominance. Results suggest that the effectiveness of the simulator is moderated by students' implicit and explicit extraversion, such that more introverted students improved more in three scales of the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (Bass & Avolio, 1997): 1) "Outcomes of leadership" (Extra effort, Perceived Effectiveness and Satisfaction); 2) Individualized Consideration and 3) Laissez-Faire Leadership Style, which decreased from time 1 to time 2. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper presents a work focused on the methodology evolution studied from blackboard (2010) to e-learning (2017) of a transversal master subject, and their influence in the partial and final courses scores, so as the level of satisfaction of the students.
   The transversal subject was called "Fundamentals and Tools for the Modelling of Technical-Scientific Processes of Investigation". This subject is structured into the following 4 sections (S): S1 and S2: Introduction to Computational Science. S3: The statistic modelling of useful processes for Social, Scientific Science and Engineering studies. S4: Tools for modelling and simulation of systems.
   Hypothesis (H):
   User's acceptance of ICT (H1): User's acceptance of ICT (mini-videos, virtual laboratory, presentations, etc.) is related with the inclusion of the e-learning and improves the final scores of the students.
   E-learning and internationalization (H2): The use of e-learning positively influences in the variety of the maters' students and the internationalization.
   Educational use of Social Networks (H3): Educational use of Facebook (communication ability, satisfaction's degree, self-learning and tutorials) positively influences in the students' final scores.
   Methodology: The research has been divided in three phases. In the first phase, an Interactive Simulation Laboratory (ISL) was developed and implemented, in which, from the study of projectile motion through resistant environments, the students are introduced to modelling and numeric simulation processes, comparing different numerical methods. In the second phase, 8 mini-videos were developed. In the third phase, the virtual platform Moodle was utilized incorporating the ISL developed; online tutoring was made available; the filmed mini-videos were uploaded, as well as the teaching methods at the disposal of the students (transparency slides, practice material, additional lectures, etc.) that are necessary for optimal development of the course. What is more, a Facebook work group has been created and integrated as a complementary tool in the master degree. Also, the complete virtualization increased the integration of international students during the 2015-2016 course. Furthermore, strategies and on-line evaluation systems were designed that help to establish the level of knowledge acquired by the students. Finally there was a study done on the level of satisfaction of the students regarding both the virtual tools and multimedia. The results of the different thematic blocks that make up the course and the variation of the final results achieved were analyzed statistically.
   Conclusion: This progressive virtualization of the course, the development of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools, the introduction of Social Networks and the incorporation of online evaluation tools are making it possible for this course to be taken by students that come from different academic backgrounds of technology, science, social science, and health science obtaining satisfactory results while initially lacking previous knowledge. The Kruskal-Wallis test has proven that only in the 2010-11 (Chi-Square=13, p-value=0.023), 2014-15(Chi-Square=7.930, p-value=0.047) and 2016-17 (Chi-Square=17.981, p-value=0.012) years the final scores were improved by the changing in the educational methodology. The inclusions of the Social Networks in the e-learning method have shown an improvement in the students' final scores.

   Physiopathology simulation; Active integrated learning methodology
AB This study investigates the efficiency of a novel integrated practical teaching methodology by combination of problem basic learning (PBL) with the physiopathology laboratory practices. The progressive resolution of a clinical case related to the ovarian dysfunction in a simulated environment by performing histological and clinical diagnosis from patients' biological samples were the basis of learning. The pathophysiological simulation was used as a virtual facilitating the resolution of case in the laboratory teaching practice. We aim that this integrated pedagogic methodology allows students to learn to solve professional reality problems by laboratory exercises and so improve students' overall understanding pathophysiological concepts. The present pilot experience was carried out in third -year undergraduate in Pathophysiology course of the Pharmacy Curriculum. Groups of 30-36 students were divided into smaller groups (n=3-4). Students solved the problem posed by 1) Identification of the phases of the ovarian cycle by histopathological analysis with optic microscopy; 2) Vaginal cytological diagnosis from patients with ovarian dysfunction posed in the problem case; 3) Study of the effects of the administration of estrogen or calcitonin as hormone replacement therapy to ovariectomized rats by using simulation PhysioEX 9.0 software. We compared two student groups: one group including PBL to conventional teaching and another one without PBL (Non-PBL). The efficiency of PBL inclusion to traditional practical lectures session was evaluated through the academic achievement of the students. Standardized multiple-choice questions examinations about posed patient cases related the pathohistological diagnosis, uterine cervix cytology diagnosis and hormone replacement therapy, respectively, were performed. We found that the use of the PBL integrated teaching model led to a significant improvement in student performance on examinations. The results from the tests showed that the students were able to analyse and explain the effects of ovarian dysfunction, discuss the various variables that affect it, analyse the risks of the progression and development of this disease, critique diagnostic testing and determine its relationship to signs and symptoms. In summary, including PBL to the laboratory practical lectures improved the students' academic achievement and enhanced their critical thinking to understand the pathophysiologic principles of the ovarian dysfunction. We believe that the implementation of PBL integrated teaching model improves students' attitudes toward learning in professional context and could be adopted by instructors in similar courses in other professional grades.

AB The Electrochemistry topic is found to be difficult to learn due to its abstract concepts involving macroscopic, microscopic, and symbolic representation levels. Studies have shown that animation and simulation using information and communication technology (ICT) can help students to visualize and hence enhance their understanding in learning abstract chemistry topics. As a result, an interactive multimedia module with the pedagogical agent (IMMPA) named the EC Lab (Electrochemistry Lab) was developed in order to assist students in the learning of Electrochemistry topics. A non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design investigation was carried out in order to gauge the effect of the IMMPA EC Lab on students' understanding and motivation in the learning of Electrochemistry. Some 127 Form Four students from two secondary schools in one of the districts in Malaysia were involved in the study. Each school had one treatment group and one control group taught by the same Chemistry teacher. Instruments involved were a pre- and posttest, a pre- and post-motivation questionnaire, and the IMMPA EC Lab. Results showed a significant difference between the control groups and treatment groups in the understanding of concepts in the learning of Electrochemistry.

AB Virtual patients are computerised representations of realistic clinical cases. They were developed to teach clinical reasoning skills through delivery of multiple standardized patient cases. The anesthesia course at The Chinese University of Hong Kong developed two novel types of virtual patients, formative assessment cases studies and storyline, to teach its final year medical students on a 2 week rotational course. Acute pain management cases were used to test if these two types of virtual patient could enhance student learning. A 2 x 2 cross over study was performed in academic year 2010-2011 on 130 students divided into four groups of 32-34. Performance was evaluated by acute pain management items set within three examinations; an end of module 60-item multiple choice paper, a short answer modified essay paper and the end of year final surgery modified essay paper. The pain management case studies were found to enhanced student performance in all three examinations, whilst the storyline virtual patient had no demonstrable effect. Student-teaching evaluation questionnaires showed that the case studies were favored more than the storyline virtual patient. Login times showed that students on average logged onto the case studies for 6 h, whereas only half the students logged on and used the storyline virtual patient. Formative assessment case studies were well liked by the students and reinforced learning of clinical algorithms through repetition and feedback, whereas the educational role of the more narrative and less interactive storyline virtual patient was less clear .

AB Background: Knowledge of gross anatomy, as a basic core subject, is fundamental for medical students and essential to medical practitioners, particularly for those intending a surgical career. However, both medical students and clinical teachers have found a significant gap in teaching basic sciences and the transition into clinical skills. The authors present a Surgical Anatomy Course developed to teach the anatomical basis of surgical procedures with particular emphasis on laparoscopic skills while incorporating medical simulation.
   Materials and methods: An evaluation of the students' satisfaction of the Surgical Anatomy Course was completed using a mix of multiple choice and open-ended questions, and a six-point Liken` Scale. Questions were asked about the students' perceived improvement in surgical and laparoscopic skills. Manual skills were assessed using a laparoscopic simulator.
   Results: Both evaluation of the course structure and the general impression of the course were positive. Most students believed the course should be an integral part of a modern curriculum. The course supported the traditional surgical classes and improved anatomical knowledge and strengthened students' confidentiality and facilitated understanding and taking surgical rotations.
   Conclusions: A medical course combining the practical learning of anatomy and surgical-based approaches will bring out the best from the students. Medical students positively evaluated the Surgical Anatomy Course as useful and beneficial regarding understanding anatomical structure and relationship necessary for further surgical education.

AB Augmented reality (AR) is a relatively new technology that allows for digitally generated three-dimensional representations to be integrated with real environmental stimuli. AR can make use of smart phones, tablets, or other devices to achieve a highly stimulating learning environment and hands-on immersive experience. The use of AR in industry is becoming widespread with applications being developed for use not just for entertainment and gaming but also healthcare, retail and marketing, education, military, travel and tourism, automotive industry, manufacturing, architecture, and engineering. Due to the distinct learning advantages that AR offers, such as remote learning and interactive simulations, AR-based teaching programs are also increasingly being adopted within medical schools across the world. These advantages are further highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused an even greater shift towards online learning. In this review, we investigate the use of AR in medical training/education and its effect on students' experiences and learning outcomes. This includes the main goals of AR-based learning, such as to simplify the delivery and enhance the comprehension of complex information. We also describe how AR can enhance the experiences of medical students, by improving knowledge and understanding, practical skills and social skills. These concepts are discussed within the context of specific AR medical training programs, such as HoloHuman, OculAR SIM, and HoloPatient. Finally, we discuss the challenges of AR in learning and teaching and propose future directions for the use of this technology in medical education.

AB Background: Medical education faces problems caused by increasing restraints on resources. A multicenter consortium combined simulation and multimedia computer-assisted instruction (MCAI) to develop unique interactive teaching programs that can address a number of these problems. We describe the consortium, the MCAI system, the programs, and a multicenter evaluation of technical and educational performance.
   Methods: The MCAI system uses computer-controlled access to full-screen, full-motion, and full-color laser disc video in combination with digitized sound, images, and graphics stored on removable media. The Socratic teaching method enhances interaction and guides learners through the patient's history, cardiovascular physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and therapy. Self-instruction and instructor-led modes of function are possible. The first five programs, based on simulations of specific cardiology problems, were distributed to four medical centers. Questionnaires evaluated technical function and medical student opinions, while behaviors and scores were automatically tracked and tabulated by program administration software.
   Results: The MCAI system functioned reliably and accurately in all modes and at all sites. The programs were highly rated. Student ratings, scores, and behaviors were independent of institution and mode of use.
   Conclusion: A multicenter educational consortium developed a system to produce unique, sophisticated MCAI programs in cardiology. Both system and programs functioned reliably at four institutions and were highly rated by fourth-year medical students. With this enthusiastic reception, the economies an strengths associated with MCAI make it an attractive solution to a number of problem areas, and it will likely play an increasingly important role.

AB Courseware, i.e. computer based learning materials, usually includes some self-assessment for formative assessment. Insufficient attention has been paid. however, to the link between formal assessment and use of courseware: teachers and learners focus on examination syllabuses. Examinations bodies can use only the simplest forms of ICT-based assessment (objective or multiple choice tests) until learners are familiar with newer styles. This problem can be addressed on several fronts: with new ICT styles of tests, by developing websites supporting learners and teachers, by conducting field trials using computers under examination conditions and by commissioning new types of examination questions built around online interactive simulations.

AB The teaching of algorithm design is a subject of great difficulty, however, its value has not been addressed in the curriculum of computer studies in secondary schools. The aim of this paper is to discuss the development of the Traffic Light System Simulator (TLSS), a learner-centered multimedia tool for learning algorithm design. The primary goal of the TLSS is to provide a daily life problem in a learning environment. In solving the problem, students are encouraged to think and construct their own possible solutions. it is believed that the TLSS would inspire students to look beyond the traffic light simulation and transfer the insight to the learning of computer programming.

AB In recent decades, three-dimensional (3D) printing as an emerging technology, has been utilized for imparting human anatomy knowledge. However, most 3D printed models are rigid anatomical replicas that are unable to represent dynamic spatial relationships between different anatomical structures. In this study, the data obtained from a computed tomography (CT) scan of a normal knee joint were used to design and fabricate a functional knee joint simulator for anatomical education. Utility of the 3D printed simulator was evaluated in comparison with traditional didactic learning in first-year medical students (n = 35), so as to understand how the functional 3D simulator could assist in their learning of human anatomy. The outcome measure was a quiz comprising 11 multiple choice questions based on locking and unlocking of the knee joint. Students in the simulation group (mean score = 85.03%, +/- SD 10.13%) performed significantly better than those in the didactic learning group, P < 0.05 (mean score = 70.71%, +/- SD 15.13%), which was substantiated by large effect size, as shown by a Cohen's d value of 1.14. In terms of learning outcome, female students who used 3D printed simulators as learning aids achieved greater improvement in their quiz scores as compared to male students in the same group. However, after correcting for the modality of instruction, the sex of the students did not have a significant influence on the learning outcome. This randomized study has demonstrated that the 3D printed simulator is beneficial for anatomical education and can help in enriching students' learning experience.

TI Multi-institutional development and utilization of a Computer-assisted
   Learning Program for the Pediatrics Clerkship: The CLIPP Project
SO ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID CURRICULUM; EDUCATION
AB Computer-assisted instruction (CAI) holds significant promise for meeting the current challenges of medical education by providing consistent and quality teaching materials regardless of training site. The Computer-assisted Learning in Pediatrics Project (CLIPP) was created over three years (2000-2003) to meet this potential through multi-institutional development of interactive Internet-based patient simulations that comprehensively teach the North American core pediatrics clerkship curriculum.
   Project development adhered to four objectives: (1) comprehensive coverage of the core curriculum; (2) uniform approach to CAI pedagogy; (3) multi-institutional development by educators; and (4) extensive evaluation by users. Pediatrics clerkship directors from 30 institutions worked in teams to develop a series of 31 patient case simulations. An iterative process of case content and pedagogy development, case authoring, peer review, and pilot-testing ensured that the needs of clerkship directors and medical students were met.
   Fifty medical schools in the United States and Canada are presently using CLIPP. More than 8,000 students have completed over 98,000 case sessions, with an average of 2,000 case sessions completed per week at this time. Each CLIPP case has been completed by more than 3,000 students. The current cost of CLIPP development is approximately $70 per student user, or $6 per case session.
   The project's success demonstrates that multi-institutional development and implementation of a peer-reviewed comprehensive CAI learning program by medical educators is feasible and provides a useful model for other organizations to develop similar programs. Although CAI development is both time-consuming and costly, the initial investment decreases significantly with broad use over time.

AB A new Bachelor of Science Nanotechnology track within the School of Engineering and Technology at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is being developed under NSF NUE program*. This paper covers the educational elements from the first phase of the project. A sequence of two courses was offered in the fall and spring semesters within both the School of Engineering & Technology and the School of Sciences. Students from electrical engineering, computer engineering, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, physics, and chemistry disciplines, were enrolled in these courses. A total of five faculty members from both engineering and sciences collaborated in developing and teaching these two courses. Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute (INDI), a nanotechnology umbrella institute at IUPUI, played a leading role in bringing together the two schools, five departments, and a number of faculties to collaborate and develop these courses, including examples of multidisciplinary projects and term papers prepared by the students will be presented. The syllabus and the contents of the courses were developed by combining the research and teaching experience of the faculty members at the IUPUI campus. The paper also details the teaching and learning methodologies implemented in the class and outside of the class which integrates the traditional means of learning from textbooks with new tools and technologies including scientific journal articles, web-based communication and file sharing, multimedia, and simulation and modeling software (e.g. Coventor). The paper also presents the organization of the courses, including usage of laboratories for hands-on experience and software for learning through simulation and modeling. Students' feedback, reflecting the impact of the two courses on their career prospective will also be reported.

AB In recent years, games have been proven to be an effective tool in supplementing traditional teaching methods. Through game playing, students can strengthen their cognitive-recognition architecture and can gain satisfaction as well as a sense of achievement. This study presents a conceptual framework for examining various effective strategies by which instructors can both integrate games into courses and strengthen games' positive influence on students' learning motivations. We used a flexible web-based instructional game called the Simulation of Production and Logistics Environment (SIMPLE) game in three decision-science courses in industrial engineering. Through this use, we evaluated the perceptions and the learning motivation attributable to a group of students after they played the SIMPLE game. We also explored the relationships between the course design and the students' learning motivations. We collected data from 139 students in the three courses and analysed the materials by using descriptive statistics, an independent t-test, a multiple regression analysis, one-way analysis of variance and Pearson correlation. Results showed that instructors' teaching strategies enhanced students' motivation to play the SIMPLE game and that students' learning motivation affected the students' acceptance of the SIMPLE game. The results also showed a clear and strong relationship between students' background and students' acceptance of the SIMPLE game in these three courses. By combining appropriate approaches to adopting the SIMPLE game and appropriate approaches to teaching students about production and logistics decision-making situations, instructors can create an effective learning environment for peer interaction, for learning motivation and for course-directed learning interest.

AB As more academic institutions are developing MOOC courses, there is a need to make the courses more interactive and to reflect and incorporate 21st century learning skills. This presentation reports on the findings of a pilot MOOC course offering a different model that emphasizes teaching and learning adapted to the 21st century transmitted in a virtual environment. Seven teacher colleges joined to develop a MOOC course entitled Introduction to Multiculturalism. The course was developed and adapted in three languages - Hebrew, Arabic and English. The new model integrates cuttingedge pedagogy and technology and is based upon collaborative experiential learning with simulations and role plays.

DE Visualization; simulation; affine transformations; conceptualization
AB A new perspective in the approach to mathematic teaching in tandem with technology development has led to content integration of lineal algebra with mathematic entities. This integration results in the iteration of an elemental geometric process that originates a final structure of complex characteristics called fractals. This work describes an experience carried out in the computer lab of the University Basic Science Department with a class of chemical engineering students in the Algebra & GA subject. Students were asked to use concepts from lineal transformations to design fractal structures. Affine transformations that are part of Algebra & GA subject require a certain level of abstraction during teaching. In this line, students were invited to develop a reflexive and autonomous activity while looking into the aspects of an iterative sequence of function in the lab practice with the aim of visualizing 2D and 3D geometric structures.
   The possibilities available from computational system have aided the reformulation of the teaching methods and subject syllabus including a revision of students' competences. This leads to a multidisciplinary teaching perspective in engineering careers as students can learn mathematics supported by new technologies and simulation software to analyse different aspects of an engineering system that can be furthered over the applied technology cycle in the career. This approach also prompts academic development underpinned by innovative views which in turn encourage engineering students to approach new mathematical contents through appropriate applications. The transformation in the current teaching context may lead to the creation of virtual labs to provide meaningful learning situations and work with systems numerically and symbolically extending the knowledge of the subject area.

AB Three days into the academic year, the COVID-19 pandemic abruptly led to emergency remote teaching, ERT, of Chemical Experimentationa revised alternative to the majors General Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Costa Rica. The course was reoriented to support students development of nontechnical experimentation skills and scientific practices relevant to the conventional course. Assignments ranged from problem-based projects to prescriptive online simulations, included team and individual work, lasted one or several weeks, and were hands-on or relied on computer-based animations, simulations, and demonstrations. Assignments were completed asynchronously and supported by synchronous weekly discussion sessions, extended office hours, and online forums. Online modules on topics pertinent to the course were available for perusal at students convenience. Instruction of technical skills was deferred until public health conditions allow. End-of-course survey data suggest the ERT course effectively supported development of nontechnical experimental skills and scientific practices, e.g., asking scientific questions, planning and executing investigations, collecting, analyzing, and constructing explanations, creating arguments from evidence, and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating scientific information. Ongoing phenomenological work will advance the understanding of the nature and extent of learning during ERT and how it occurred. Although in-laboratory experiences are not completely substitutable, course designs may incorporate meaningful activities away from the lab to fulfill some of the objectives of experimental instruction. Current concerns over academic laboratory costs make optimization of instructional resources compelling. This communication describes the context, the course model, and basics of the ERT design.

TI Effectiveness of a Clay Pelvic Model A Hands-on Approach to
   Understanding Pelvic Floor Anatomy
SO OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY
LA English
DT Editorial Material
AB BACKGROUND: Understanding pelvic anatomy is an important part of education during obstetrics and gynecology residency. Traditional teaching methods to learn pelvic anatomy have obstacles and are often costly.
   METHOD: We provide a self-constructed clay pelvic model to aid in the mastery of pelvic anatomy for obstetrics and gynecology residents and to estimate whether building a clay pelvic model would increase residents' confidence and knowledge in pelvic anatomy.
   EXPERIENCE: Each resident constructed a clay pelvic model on a bony pelvis, along with the traditional didactic on pelvic anatomy. Demographics of the participants were obtained, followed by a knowledge test and confidence level and satisfaction surveys. Descriptive analysis and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used for data analysis. Nine residents (three postgraduate year [PGY]-1, one PGY-2, two PGY-3, three PGY-4) completed the knowledge and confidence questions before and after the simulation, along with the satisfaction survey. The median score from the 10 multiple-choice knowledge questions was 50% (30-70%) on the pretest and 70% (40-100%) on the posttest (P=not significant). Although most residents scored higher on the posttest, two residents scored 10% lower. Overall, 66.7% of residents improved their knowledge scores up to 30% after the simulation session. Self-assessed confidence level scores improved from 2-3 to 4 (1, lowest; 5, highest) for all questions asked (P=.010 to approximately .019). A majority of residents responded with 4 or 5 to the satisfaction statements.
   CONCLUSION: A low-budget clay pelvic model is easy to build and did increase residents' confidence in pelvic anatomy knowledge and satisfaction. Self-constructing a clay pelvic model would provide an excellent way of reviewing the major landmarks of pelvic anatomy.

AB This work describes educational approaches in the field of wheeled mobile robotics. On the case of an engineering course in masters study programme, we present how the course has evolved in the past few years to the current format. Our tendency is to organize the course lectures and laboratory practice in a way that an appropriate balance between the traditional and contemporary inductive learning and teaching methodologies is achieved. We present application of various inductive teaching methodologies, such as simulation challenges, individual projects, multi-team projects and competition challenges, to the course. Several project examples from the course are given. (C) 2017, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 3D animation representations and dynamic operations invite learners to become involved in learning ambience, and when applied to math learning, increases learners' math learning interests and calculation abilities. Therefore, this study uses computer 3D animation to visualize gradual changes in graphs as a supplement for learners to understand math operations. When applied to teaching, teachers can compare the diagram coordinates with steps of math problem solving to help students deduce the solution; they can also use learning programs to enhance students' understanding and memory by visualization. When learners successfully solve math questions, their learning motives will be activated. In the long-term, learners will have better learning motives, as well as higher learning efficiency.

AB Multimedia computer-aided learning (CAL) is an area that has become increasingly prevalent in biomedical science. Here we describe the advances that have taken place in the computing industry that have led to this trend. We also outline areas within the subject of biomedical science that can most benefit from using multimedia CAL as a teaching aid. Furthermore, issues concerning the design of CAL (i.e. iterative design, structure, development tools) are discussed. iis the evaluation of CAL is an essential part of the iterative design process, we look at new approaches to evaluation that hare emerged in response to the superficial focus on usability that many evaluations take.

AB Interoperability of systems based on knowledge is a very important element for reducing their development cost and enabling an easy-to-perform service enrichment. Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) may be described as distant learning systems, which base their work on the simulation of the "real" teacher in the learning and teaching process. ITSs base their interoperability on the interchange of domain knowledge, knowledge about learning and teaching process and knowledge about students. This paper describes DiSNeT, a distance learning system we designed based on the intelligent tutoring paradigm, on knowledge presentation using distributed semantic networks and on using agents in the learning and teaching process. We also present a methodology for ensuring interoperability between DiSNeT and other ITSs.

AB The mathematical concept of function is an essential underpinning for advanced study in mathematics, such as calculus, and influences success in higher mathematics. Teaching about functions is challenging as many students find it difficult to understand. Effective teaching strategies are reliant on a teacher's knowledge of the current understandings of their students. The gestures of the twenty-three middle-secondary Australian students (14-15 years old) in this study clarified the meaning of their words as they were interviewed whilst viewing two different computer simulations. Five ways in which students used their hands when providing multiple representations of mathematical functions are presented, which provide insights into students' thinking about functions not available in their words alone.

AB Today's students have grown up in an electronic world. There is no doubt that the approaching generation will be even more technologically advanced than our current students. Computer technology offers us a powerful and versatile tool that can dramatically change teaching and learning. The result is an improved ability to present abstract or complex material with increased student comprehension and interest. Case studies and computer simulations help develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills by providing students with an opportunity to apply their knowledge. Studies indicate that instruction via computers results in higher test scores compared to conventional methods, as well as greater long-term retention. The time has come for faculty to consider how computer technology can best be used in their classes.

AB It has become more obvious over the last decade that the information technology has an increasing role in education, bringing along a series of undeniable benefits. This changes and diversifies the ways of teaching as well as those of learning. Medical training is one, of the fields that can greatly benefit from these new learning methods. Concepts as e-Learning, active learning and virtual patient are increasingly present in university projects, university curricula or in health institutions having as final goal the improvement of the educational process. This paper investigates the current state in the field of virtual patient platforms and compares important features that make them valuable tools for enhancing performance in medical education.

AB An important movement in European science education is that learning should be inquiry-based and represents realistic scientific practice. The inquiry-based nature of science education is essential to interest more young people for a career in science and technology. Creating models is broadly seen as an essential part of those scientific practices. Dynamic models play a central role in science as a main vehicle to express and evaluate our understanding of complex systems. Therefore, the ability to reason with and about models and to create models of dynamic systems is an important higher order thinking skill and as a means to foster the development of scientific attitudes. In teaching children how to model, the choice for model representation is important. Representations can vary from mathematical formula, programming languages and diagrammatic representations. This chapter will present modelling based on drawings, and the SimSketch software with which children can create dynamic, multi-agent models. By representing systems in drawings, assigning behaviour to elements of the drawing and simulate the resulting model, children can express and test their ideas about natural and artificial systems. The chapter discusses conceptual and technical issues related to SimSketch as well as studies in which children have used SimSketch to represent systems such as the solar system, traffic and the spreading of diseases. The role of this approach will be discussed in the context of developments in European educational research.

AB We are building in LON-CAPA an integrated learning environment that will enable the development, dissemination and evaluation of PER-based material. This environment features a collection of multi-level research-based homework sets organized by topic and cognitive complexity. These sets are associated with learning modules that contain very short exposition of the con tent supplemented by integrated open-access videos, worked examples, simulations, and tutorials (some from ANDES). To assess students' performance accurately with respect to a system-wide standard, we plan to implement Item Response Theory. Together with other PER assessments and purposeful solicitation of student feedback, this will allow us to measure and improve the efficacy of various research-based materials, while getting insights into teaching and learning.

AB In this paper, the domain expert system, that a generator of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) includes with the applications it produces, will be presented. This system, MeT (Methodology Tutor), is responsible for the description and teaching of the procedural domain knowledge (called methodology) of the ITS. The knowledge handled by the system is represented with frames. MeT operates in two modes: during authoring mode, several editors are provided to support the authors in the description of the methodology that will be taught. In tutoring mode, three agents are provided: a guide for the simulation of the methodology evolution, a learn-by-discovery agent that comments on the students' actions and a judge that validates the students' selections. Finally, a part of the procedural knowledge of an example application is presented.

AB The adoption of Mobile and Wireless Technologies (MWT), such as smartphones, tablets and their Apps has created new possibilities for teaching and learning Chemistry. Within the sphere of Chemistry Education, the MWT have made it possible to develop interactive activities, experimentation by means of simulations, visualization and the "manipulation" of representations of chemical structures, access to chemical data tables, and other possibilities that broaden the understanding of this science. However, sometimes, matters of infrastructure, restriction of access to smartphones and tablets, as well as the incompatibility between the operational systems that are installed in these devices, may limit the adoption of MWT in education. Hoping to overcome some of these limitations by implementing teaching and learning strategies in the context of "BYOD - Bring Your Own Device", the need emerges to investigate the multiplatform Apps that enable working from this perspective. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify, select and categorize multiplatform Apps for teaching and learning Chemistry. For this, a search for Apps was performed in the virtual stores 'Play Store' (Android operational system") and 'App Store' (iOS operational system). The data obtained from each of the virtual stores were compared, selecting only the free Apps that were available in both virtual stores. Forty-five (45) multiplatform Apps, with a free download and access to content were identified, selected and analyzed. The analysis of the 45 Apps allowed us to classify them into categories as to their functionality (games, instruction material, visualization of chemical structures, simulation, database and periodical table) and also to identify the "field of chemistry" for which they are appropriate. The detailing of these Apps, including the categories and "fields of chemistry" identified will be presented in the final article. Based on these results it was possible to identify the main free multiplatform Apps that can contribute to the Chemistry teaching and learning processes from the perspective of BYOD.

AB Opportunities for building learning activities around real patients have decreased. Therefore, various forms of representative simulation have become an increasingly common alternative. The use of virtual patients is one such simulation developed to support the delivery of clinical teaching. Virtual patient scenarios offer opportunities for 'game-informed learning'. This is due to their experiential and problem-based learning approaches as prime pedagogic drivers. A region has been developed in Second Life that aims to deliver game-based learning activities for delivery of virtual patients that can drive experiential, diagnostic, and role-play learning activities concerning diagnoses, and selection of, investigations and treatment. The game-based learning activities for virtual patients were designed based on the four-dimensional framework developed by De Freitas and Martin, as well as other design considerations that look at emergent narratives and modes of representation.
   This paper will present the three-component architecture for the delivery of Virtual Patients following game-based learning activities in a multi-user virtual environment (MUVE), such as Second Life. The proposed architecture consists of different virtual patient components that provides the personal and clinical data relevant to the clinical scenario, a data availability model that enables the sequencing and progressive disclosure of a virtual patient identifying triggers and scaffolding information, and an activity model which encodes the activities available and how the learner will be able to engage with the virtual patient. It is anticipated that this three-component architecture will accommodate many different deployment and delivery options for virtual patients in a MUVE.
   An overview of recent trials is also provided. The trials aim to explore the experience of computer and videogame play among medical students, and to identify any gender-related differences and social propensities that might exist between high gamers (frequently play computer games) and low gamers (rarely play computer games) in their approaches to game-based learning in Second Life.

AB The widespread adoption of technology-enhanced learning in various knowledge disciplines has pushed forward the development of information technology-assisted media for language learning and teaching. However, most of the existing electronic-learning (e-learning) solutions have underexplored and under-addressed given specific characteristics of grammar learning, which is one of the most demanding areas of language education. The lack of pedagogically informed instructional design to enhance learning performance on the current system can result in low motivation and engagement due to an imbalance and excessive increase of the cognitive load. This paper attempts to address these deficiencies posed by the existing systems by proposing smart communication networks that are driven by the student learning experience to manage cognitive load in the context of grammar learning. The e-grammar learning networks serve as a collaborative learning platform that combines a pedagogically informed instructional model named attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction (ARCS) and cyber interaction among teaching/learning agents. From the technological perspective, our numerical simulations demonstrate the desirable performance indicators of the proposed networks to facilitate information exchange and learning. From the education perspective, our empirical studies show that the overall smart network-enabled e-grammar learning system has desirable characteristics to motivate learners (m = 3.78) and manage their overall cognitive load (m = 1.73), which suggest the promising capability of the proposed system.

AB Multimedia-supported e-learning is considered useful as it can offer an enjoyable independent learning experience to learners. However, the effectiveness of e-learning for self-regulated science learning is still inconclusive. This study aimed to explore primary school students' perceptions and experiences of self-regulated science learning in a multimedia-supported e-learning environment. A total of 11 classes from grades 3 to 6 from four Hong Kong schools participated in this study. All e-learning lessons were observed, and 33 (3 from each class) were interviewed using cognitive walkthroughs of how they made use of the multimedia resources and system tools, scaffolds, or prompts to direct their own learning in each of the three self-regulated learning phases (forethought, performance, and reflection). Results revealed that the combined use of the discussion forum and statistics table seemed to facilitate the students' diagnosis of their prior knowledge of natural phenomena in the forethought phase. In the performance phase, the students mostly enjoyed learning with the graphic data, animations, and/or simulation experiments. Some perceived the prompts or tools from the e-learning system as useful for operation and science learning. In the reflection phase, the students self-assessed their learning using quizzes with emoticons as positive feedback which seemed to increase their enthusiasm for learning science. However, not all students were able to effectively use the system tools or prompts, to keep focused self-discipline, or to achieve deeper science learning without the teacher's guidance. Hence, this study suggests providing more opportunities for students' exposure to e-learning resources, while at the same time assisting them in the use of digital tools or resources, in adjusting their learning strategies, and in internalizing scientific ideas and inquiry processes so as to ensure more effective self-regulated science learning.

ID SELF-EXPLANATIONS
AB This paper presents a conversational, multimedia, virtual science tutor for elementary school students. It is built using state of the art speech recognition and spoken language understanding technology. This virtual science tutor is unique in that it elicits self-explanations from students for various science phenomena by engaging them in spoken dialogs and guided by illustrations, animations and interactive simulations. There is a lot of evidence that self-explanation works well as a tutorial paradigm, Summative evaluations indicate that students are highly engaged in the tutoring sessions, and achieve learning outcomes equivalent to expert human tutors. Tutorials are developed through a process of recording and annotating data from sessions with students, and then updating tutor models. It enthusiastically supported by students and teachers. Teachers report that it is feasible to integrate into their curriculum.

AB Teaching computing courses is a major challenge for the majority of lecturers in Libyan Higher Education institutions. These courses contain numerous abstract concepts that cannot be easily explained using traditional educational methods. The main aim of this article is to present a conceptual framework for laboratory-based learning designed to teach a computer programming module with the help of an e-learning package. The framework could be used for a single module or one of several modules with a specific aim. The framework should be useful for designers of online learning modules and teachers who are interested in the design of online courses on the Internet. The proposed framework will enable the current generation of students to be better prepared for a workplace where computers, the Internet and related technologies are becoming increasingly ubiquitous.

AB The need for rapid and cost-effective development Intelligent Tutoring Systems with flexible pedagogical approaches has led to a demand for authoring tools. The authoring systems developed to date provide a range of options and flexibility, such as authoring simulations, or authoring tutoring strategies. This paper describes FlexiTrainer, an authoring framework that enables the rapid creation of pedagogically rich and performance-oriented learning environments with custom content and tutoring strategies. FlexiTrainer provides tools for specifying the domain knowledge and derives its power from a visual behavior editor for specifying the dynamic behavior of tutoring agents that interact to deliver instruction. The FlexiTrainer runtime engine is an agent based system where different instructional agents carry out teaching related actions to achieve instructional goals. FlexiTrainer has been used to develop an, ITS for training helicopter pilots in flying skills.

AB Educational hypermedia offers flexible access to information, supports convenient learning styles, and provides a number of teaching advantages. The student's desire to learn can be enhanced by involving them in the education process and by presenting the course material in an attractive manner to encourage student participation. A well-implemented multimedia curriculum is an effective tool in technical education. Detailed mathematical models and simulations of pilot-plants have been developed in order to create virtual plants. Students can be trained to operate and test these virtual plants in order to learn about their behaviour. Student assignments and projects based on these simulated process plants provide self and group learning opportunities at a pace comfortable to the students. This paper reviews a case study in the setting up of simulated process plants for such flexible learning.

AB This paper describes two innovative and linked approaches to teaching and student learning in the environmental and development geography of the Mekong region, a region remote from students' normal experiential options. The first approach is field-based learning through Field Schools carried out in Vietnam, Laos and Thailand. The second approach is a structured role-playing web-based simulation exercise (e-Sim) on Mekong Basin environmental management challenges. This paper discusses the complementarities of these approaches and considers the degree to which these two experiential approaches to teaching and learning have contributed to key competences, namely cross-cultural communication and understanding, multi-disciplinary approaches to environment and development, and regional knowledge of Southeast Asia.

AB Recent engineering education research has suggested that most engineering curricula does not promote attainment of many characteristics desired in practicing engineers [1][2]. One such characteristic is effective communication with workers in other disciplines. A method to attain improved communication is simulation of workplace situations in the educational environment [3][4]. In an effort to improve communication between trades and to foster a higher appreciation for the other field, a project simulating the working relationship between engineers and machinists was implemented via a joint semester project coupling a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining course and an engineering design course.
   A significant body of knowledge exists regarding multidisciplinary education for engineering students. Nearly all of the multidisciplinary projects involve one discipline of engineering working with another engineering discipline (i.e. mechanical engineering students working with electrical engineering students). The multidisciplinary work between different disciplines of engineering students has documented benefits; however, the two groups of students are on a similar communication level. By coupling junior and senior level bachelor degree-seeking engineering students with students primarily pursuing a 1 year CNC machining certificate, many communication barriers are encountered that are not seen in typical university multidisciplinary projects.
   The students from the engineering class were tasked with designing a simple assembly that performs a specified function. The engineering student was responsible for generating a complete set of manufacturing prints. Each engineering student was matched with a group of two or three CNC machining students, who were responsible for manufacturing the parts designed by the engineering student. This type of collaboration closely simulates the design engineer working with the manufacturing shop floor employee in determining how a part is best produced and taking the project to completion by manufacturing and assembly of that part. Data collection methods included student surveys and instructor observations. Primary student outcomes appeared to be; 1) an appreciation for the importance of communication and, 2) greater understanding of the complete process needed to produce a product. The primary difficulties the students encountered were due to communication issues and project management breakdowns. Efforts to address these issues and other lessons learned will be discussed.

AB Virtual Reality technology has begun to be rapidly adopted by the public and industry which has increased the need for integration into 3D Digital Design education curriculum. There have been additional new 3D design tools from multiple fields converging into 3D digital design. Two topics of investigation will be presented: Methods for evaluating new technologies to integrate into curriculum by presenting how VR and previous technologies have been pursued in curriculum and how to build an adaptive curriculum which accommodates a continuous new integration, adoption and obsolescence filtering process.
   Design thinking and education continues to evolve as new technologies are rapidly being added to every field. Virtual Reality within 3D Computer Graphics tools continue to evolve at a rapid pace. New hardware for doing motion capture, simulation, photogrammetry, augmented and virtual reality are on the edge of further transforming this field with additional crossover and multi field convergence. Several strategies for analyzing and adopting new technologies will be presented. A specific case study will be presented from two courses at the Rochester Institute of Technology: Real Time Design and Physical Interface Design. These classes have prototyped and integrated multiple new technologies over the last 5 years. The focus of this discussion will conclude with integration of the HTC Vive Virtual Reality platform as the start of a new technology cycle with some speculation as to what additional technology integration will be connected to this in the near future.
   Many technologies in the Real Time Design and Physical Interface Design courses have been tested by the professor and students, then integrated into the curriculum. The analysis and context for how they are "taught" as well as questions asked to the students have been more valuable as learning tools. The key element of learning with new technologies has been the research within the education process of anticipated future technologies. Finally, there will be a presentation of the transition and filtering process that has gone on with various software and hardware over the past 5 years which will present for discussion strategies used in adopting, retaining and planning for technology obsolescence while constantly updating curriculum.

AB Despite being one of the pillars of physics and a well-known subject, the electric force is sometimes not immediately evident to students. Discovery-based learning has proven to be very effective in science education; nevertheless, it can become stressful for students if they don't have the necessary scaffolding and training to construct knowledge by themselves. In this work, examples of obstacles to students were the absence of the necessary background knowledge, distractions in multimedia environments, and that some students prefer regular instruction in order not to be left alone in the face of active learning dynamics. Therefore, we designed and implemented an assisted active learning sequence that includes moderated intervention from two different lecturers on an Electricity and Magnetism course at a private university in Mexico to compare the normalized learning changes with a standard directed lecture. The primary objective of the active learning sequence was to introduce students to the discovery of the electric force via a simulated experiment using a web-based physics simulation, Newtondreams. By comparing normalized learning changes between four groups, two control, and two experimental groups, we show that students in the experimental groups performed significantly better than the control groups (< c > = 0.469 and 0.435 for the experimental groups, and < c > = 0.08 and 0.077 for the control groups). We performed a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test to examine the normalized gains between the groups. Observed p-values show that there is significant difference between experimental and control groups: CG1 vs. EG1 (p = 0.00109), CG2 vs. EG2 (p = 0.00079). On the contrary there are no observed significance on the effect of the instructor CG1 vs. CG2 (p = 1), EG1 vs. EG2 (p = 1). Then, that active learning is more effective than regular instruction. Studying the concentration factors we also found that active learning develop better comprehension that regular instruction lecture. At the end of the experiments, we performed student interviews that also showed they felt less stressed and more involved when using the assisted active learning sequence, making the learning experience more amenable when the instructor changes their role from presenter to a guide.

ID MEDICAL-STUDENTS; THINKING
AB Clinical reasoning is a critical core competency in medical education. Strategies to support the development of clinical reasoning skills have focused on methodologies used in traditional settings, including lectures, small groups, activities within Simulation Centers and the clinical arena. However, the evolving role and growing utilization of virtual patients (VPs) in undergraduate medical education; as well as an increased emphasis on blended learning, multi-modal models that include VPs in core curricula; suggest a growing requirement for strategies or guidelines that directly focus on VPs. The authors have developed 12 practical tips that can be used in VP cases to support the development of clinical reasoning. These are based on teaching strategies and principles of instructional design and pedagogy, already used to teach and assess clinical reasoning in other settings. Their application within VPs will support educators who author or use VP cases that promote the development of clinical reasoning.

   INTRODUCTORY ARCHAEOLOGY
SO AMERICAN ANTIQUITY
LA English
DT Article
AB The introductory archaeology course at the University of California at Santa Barbara has undergone a dramatic metamorphosis in the past two years. The course has gone from a largely passive, lecture-centered learning experience to a much more student-centric one. One aspect of that shift has been the incorporation of interactive computer exercises and simulations. While a substantial change in itself the incorporation of computer exercises is only a small part of the total transformation of the course. The key to the successful use of the new technology in the course was a fundamental shift in our approach to teaching the material. Some elements of that shift include: reducing lecture time; increasing opportunities for one-on-one interaction between instructors and students; mixing small-group and individual exercises; and creating a more democratized information network incorporating instructors, teaching assistants, computer resources, readings, and students into a learning community.

AB The authors consider the future of special education personnel preparation by responding to an overarching question: What frameworks might teacher educators use as a basis to promote special education teacher effective performance now and in the future? In answering this question, they summarize current trends in the context of schooling and special education (i.e., Common Core State Standards [CCSS], multi-tiered systems of support [MTSS]) and what these contexts demand of special education teachers. The authors propose a practice-based model for fostering effective special education teacher performance. Grounded in the science of learning, the model includes approaches in teacher education that align with this literature. Implications for implementing the model are provided, which recognize current constraints on schools and colleges of education, to better promote this model for fostering effective performance.

AB Surgical laboratory in pregraduate students in medicine is beneficial and improves learning processes in cognitive aspects and skills acquisition. It is also an early initiation into scientific research. The laboratory is the introductory pathway into basic concepts of medical science (meaningful learning). It is also where students gain knowledge in procedures and abilities to obtain professional skills, an interactive teacher-student process. Medicine works rapidly to change from an art to a science. This fact compromises all schools and medical faculties to analyze their actual study plans. Simulators give students confidence and ability and save time, money and resources, eliminating at the same time the ethical factor of using live animals and the fear of patient safety. Multimedia programs may give a cognitive context evolving logically with an explanation based on written and visual animation followed by a clinical problem and its demonstration in a simulator, all before applying knowledge to the patient.

AB This article examined how teacher candidates' thoughts shifted regarding social inequity in a sophomore-level Foundations of Education course located in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. First, we described in detail the teacher education program and course, as well as class simulations, school observations, course readings and class discussions. Then, we examined the narratives of our teacher candidates' transformation. We found that the afore-mentioned experiences successfully supported transformative thinking regarding social justice. By the end of the course, many teacher candidates began to take ownership over their learning and started viewing themselves as responsible change agents. They began to examine education as embedded in larger social contexts, scrutinized their own schooling experiences and stepped outside of their own conceptions of education to initiate discussions of social justice.

AB Introduction: Medical Imaging and Radiotherapy (MIR) education is challenging due to the complexity and variety of clinical scenarios, which require the acquisition of knowledge and development of interpersonal, systemic and instrumental competencies in a safe and controlled environment. Teaching and learning (T&L) methodologies that promote the application of theoretical concepts to practical MIR procedures, initially in controlled simulation contexts (between peers and in phantoms) and later in patients, are approaches of active and experiential T&L strategies. These strategies require several medical imaging equipment as well as information and communication systems and allow a gradual development of skills throughout the education process, promoting safety when students start to perform procedures on real patients. Furthermore, T&L strategies that promote the involvement of the students in their own formative process, developing a reflective capacity over their performance and progress over time, become more and more critical for the success of education. The goals of this work are to report the active and experiential T&L strategies applied in MIR programme at the School of Health Sciences of the University of Aveiro (ESSUA) and to evaluate how the students perceive and value these strategies.
   Methods: A survey of the T&L process, as defined by the teachers in each of the Curricular Units (CU) of the MIR programme, was done, identifying active learning strategies (e.g., role-play, case study analysis, computer games) as well as the resources that facilitate experiential learning (e.g., phantoms, medical imaging equipment, simulation centre, image post-processing workstations).The perception of the identified T&L strategies by the students was evaluated using a questionnaire regarding active and experiential learning with 3 multiple-choice and 38 five-points Likert scale questions, delivered to all the MIR students matriculated in the academic year 2018/19.
   Results: A total of 61 students (62% of the universe of MIR students, 46 female, 15 male, aged 21.20 +/- 3.79 years old), homogeneously distributed over the four curricular years, answered the proposed questionnaire. The students identified, among all, the MIR specific CU as those in which active and experiential T&L strategies are applied. The use of workstations, role-play and case study analysis were pointed out as the most frequently used active T&L strategies. In the development of clinical practice skills and abilities, students highly value (median 5) simulation scenarios and hospital setting classes while value (median 4) the use of workstations, role play and case study analysis. 86.2% of the questions that evaluated student's perception of the experiential learning strategies received high scores (72.4% with a median of 4; 13.8% with a median of 5). Answers pointed out an equilibrium between expositive classes and active/experiential learning activities with student's engagement into the competencies acquisition. Generally, no statistically significant differences were found among the answers of students belonging to different curricular years.
   Conclusions: The MIR students perceive that T&L methodologies, which reinforce active participation in their own education, are valuable resources in the acquisition of competencies for clinical practice. Since the early stages of the MIR programme, the students get and feel involved in clinical learning scenarios through active and experiential T&L strategies.

TI Designing translucent learning analytics with teachers: an elicitation

AB Learning Analytics (LA) systems can offer new insights into learners' behaviours through analysis of multiple data streams. There remains however a dearth of research about how LA interfaces can enable effective communication of educationally meaningful insights to teachers and learners. This highlights the need for a participatory, horizontal co-design process for LA systems. Inspired by the notion of translucence, this paper presents LAT-EP (Learning Analytics Translucence Elicitation Process), a five-step process to design for the effective use of translucent LA systems. LAT-EP was operationalised in an authentic multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) study in the context of teamwork in clinical simulation. Results of this process are illustrated through a series of visual proxies co-designed with teachers, each presenting traces of social, physical, affective and epistemic evidence captured while teams of student nurses practised clinical skills in a simulated hospital setting.

AB Interactive multimedia simulations and computer game elements can be successfully combined in order to create new advanced educational resources for teaching today's generation of students. Such a learning environment, a game-based learning model (GBLm), has been designed as a research prototype. This paper describes one type of GBLm for computer engineering, which we have used in the subject of computer graphics for the teaching unit Z-buffer algorithm, in order to facilitate the learning process. The implementation of a GBLm for graphical algorithms (GBL4CAl) is presented in detail as a multimedia interactive learning module designed to motivate students by making learning a more enjoyable process. During the design of the GBL4CAl module, special attention was paid to the integration of pedagogical and game-play aspects.

ID FACULTY; GENDER
AB Background: Studies in K-12 and college students show that their learning preferences have been strongly shaped by new media technologies like video games, virtual reality environments, the Internet, and social networks. However, there is no known research on medical students' game experiences or attitudes towards new media technologies in medical education. This investigation seeks to elucidate medical student experiences and attitudes, to see whether they warrant the development of new media teaching methods in medicine.
   Methods: Medical students from two American universities participated. An anonymous, 30-item, cross-sectional survey addressed demographics, game play experience and attitudes on using new media technologies in medical education. Statistical analysis identified: 1) demographic characteristics; 2) differences between the two universities; 3) how video game play differs across gender, age, degree program and familiarity with computers; and 4) characteristics of students who play most frequently.
   Results: 217 medical students participated. About half were female (53%). Respondents liked the idea of using technology to enhance healthcare education (98%), felt that education should make better use of new media technologies (96%), and believed that video games can have educational value (80%). A majority (77%) would use a multiplayer online healthcare simulation on their own time, provided that it helped them to accomplish an important goal. Men and women agreed that they were most inclined to use multiplayer simulations if they were fun (97%), and if they helped to develop skill in patient interactions (90%). However, there was significant gender dissonance over types of favorite games, the educational value of video games, and the desire to participate in games that realistically replicated the experience of clinical practice.
   Conclusions: Overall, medical student respondents, including many who do not play video games, held highly favorable views about the use of video games and related new media technology in medical education. Significant gender differences in game play experience and attitudes may represent male video game design bias that stresses male cognitive aptitudes; medical educators hoping to create serious games that will appeal to both men and women must avoid this.

AB Curricular schooling can benefit from the usage of educational computer games, but it is difficult to integrate them in the formal schooling system. Here, we investigate one possible approach to this integration, which capitalizes on using a micro-game that can be played with a teacher's guidance as a supplement after a traditional expository lecture followed by a debriefing. The game's purpose is to reinforce and integrate part of the knowledge learnt during the lecture. We investigated feasibility of this approach in a quasi-experimental study in 70 min long seminars on the topic of animal learning at 5 classes at 4 different high-schools in the Czech Republic. Each class was divided to two groups randomly. After an expository lecture, the game group played a game called Orbis Pictus Bestialis while the control group received an extra lecture that used media-rich materials. The time allotment was the same in both groups. We investigated the immediate and one month delayed effects of the game on students' knowledge reinforced and integrated by the game as well as on knowledge learnt during the expository lecture but not strengthened by the game. We also investigated students' overall appeal towards the seminar and its perceived educational value. Data from 100 students were analysed. The results showed that a) the game-playing is comparable to the traditional form of teaching concerning immediate knowledge gains and has a significant medium positive effect size regarding retention, b) the game-playing is not detrimental to information transmitted in the expository lecture but not strengthened by the game, c) perceived educational value and the overall appeal were high in the game group, nevertheless the perceived educational value was slightly lower in the game group comparing to the traditional group. Our results suggest that the proposed approach of harnessing educational computer games at high-schools is promising. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Teaching Statistics in engineering career is fundamental for learning the methods and tools to analyze data and obtain the underlying information they possess and contributes to the generation of statistical thinking in the future engineer. Statistical thinking is the knowledge of systems, processes and their interconnections through the acquisition of data, observation of data's variability, and the search for methods to reduce it. Observing and obtaining information provided by the processes and systems that we detect and recognize, solving the variability problems through the analysis of said information is the goal for the control and optimization of the environment [1]. The evolution of statistical thinking in students is an essential pillar to achieve the career incumbencies. However, Sometimes, Statistics is dictated in isolation from the core subjects of the career, vaguely related to engineering processes. For a connection with real situations, presentations are often made with the use of statistical packages that provide many graphics [2][3]. In turn, the most complex topics of the subject are studied with simple examples that allow a manual construction of graphics, which contributes to learning by presenting the results in a legible and clear. However, the statistical graphs have certain characteristics in an image perspective, such as the schematization, show only spot views or sections in space and time, isolated or partial views of a set, and finally, views in 2D of something that has 3 or more dimensions. The graphs of inference, errors, control, etc. can be difficult to understand by the students, who must imagine the situations, detect at what moment and in what plane arises the representation they are observing, and if they are one or several data sets. In addition, for current students, accustomed to the technological deployment in all canals, the vision of static graphics is poor, limited and boring. As a reference, there are animations of graphs of descriptive statistics, being attractive and clarifying. The animation and simulation of complex topics such as inference, hypothesis testing, data analysis, statistical process control, etc., provides an instrument of understanding that goes beyond what the imagination can build, it will be a representation valid, verified, showing correctly the concepts of a formal Statistics topic. For animations creation, we use examples of data analysis of stochastic processes, their variability, presentation of multiple samples of a population, the relationship between several of these elements. The animation can also be interactive and focused on topics that students demand support, because of their level of complexity. Learning whit these dynamic animations collaborates with the insertion in the mind of the students of the statistical thinking as the main axis on which the other specific knowledge of the career will be based. They are constructed based on real processes, which are simulated to obtain validated data from the model. Then the simulated data are used in the 3D animation of the most representative Statistics graphs, constituting a significant support for teaching. The animation is done to highlight the central points of each theme. The graphics are available on the web media available at the Rosario Regional School and are public access.

DE Digital modulations; problem-based teaching; learning-to-learn;
   innovative teaching; MATLAB simulator
AB New methodologies and materials are required to optimize the transference of knowledge between teacher and student yielding the improvement of the educational process. Nowadays, this process is focused on the student autonomy that is understood as the competence of learning-to-learn. Consequently, the development of new approaches of teaching should be oriented to reinforce the learning-to-learn competence.
   This work describes an original experience based on these principles of innovative teaching. The experience has been carried out the last two academic years in the subject "Communication Theory" for students belonging to Telecommunication Engineering Bachelor in the University of Jaen (Spain). The main idea is to develop a communication system over the acoustic channel using the multimedia hardware of a PC. The speakers are the transmitters while the microphone is the receiver of the communication system. A simulator in MATLAB has been implemented to be able to perform the transmission and reception over the acoustic channel. Some digital modulations are introduced during this subject, concretely, the family of modulations M-PSK, M-FSK and M-QAM. The simulation software allows the parameterization of digital modulations in order to evaluate their performance over the acoustic channel.
   In this teaching experience, new material associated to digital modulations has been generated and organized following the principles of problem-based teaching. The student revises the material and interacts with the simulator in real-time in order to assert the theoretical concepts. The material and the simulation program are available in the web-based platform ILIAS of the University of Jaen. In this way, the autonomous study is reinforced making use of web-based resources.
   In order to demonstrate the advantages of the methodology, an evaluation is performed before and after the introduction of the new material. The results show an improvement about 0,8 (in a 0 to 10 scale) in the way the students understand the techniques and their associated problems.

AB This work seeks to add to the growing body of chemistry education research that emphasizes the teaching and learning of advanced topics, focusing on students' understanding of enzyme kinetics. The data corpus relevant to this study involved 14 second-year undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory biochemistry course taught in a chemistry department. During semistructured interviews, the students were prompted to discuss a typical enzyme kinetics reaction scheme (i.e., E + S (sic) ES -> E + P) and describe two enzyme kinetics graphs. The findings indicated that students had productive understanding regarding the meanings of the kinetic parameters (K-m and V-max) and the utility of Lineweaver-Burk plots; however, students needed more support in drawing connections between a conceptual understanding and the representations commonly used to model enzyme kinetics.

DT Article
AB In order to improve the dynamic evaluation ability of medical image multimedia courseware-assisted teaching effect, the evaluation of medical image multimedia courseware-assisted teaching effect based on a deep learning algorithm is proposed. The statistical data analysis model of medical image multimedia courseware-assisted teaching effect is established to estimate its utilization rate and scale parameters. Based on the prediction of spatial attribute parameters, the classification big data mining model of medical image multimedia courseware-assisted teaching is constructed by using the deep learning algorithm, mining association rules and frequent item sets that can dynamically reflect the quality of medical image multimedia courseware-assisted teaching, and extracting the statistical feature of the dataset of constraint indicators of medical image multimedia courseware-assisted teaching effect to improve the teaching quality of medical imaging course. The simulation results show that this method has a better precision delivery effect, higher dynamic matching degree of teaching evaluation parameters, more than 90% reliability, and better clustering of statistical eigenvalues.

AB Rich-media describes a broad range of digital interactive media that is increasingly used in the Internet and also in the support of education, where the complex visualization of the educational process becomes the necessity for the overall transfer of information from teacher to students. MERLINGO project (MEdia-rich Repository of LearnING Objects) is aimed at the building of the central repository of multimedia learning objects containing teachers' presentations. Last year, a special pilot audio-visual lecture room was built as a part of this project solution. It contains all the elements of the modern lecture room determined for the implementation of presentation recordings based on the rich-media technologies and their publication on-line or on-demand featuring the integrated ergonomic and intuitive control and access of all its elements in the automated mode including automatic editing. The Petri nets theory was significantly applied at the design, verification, simulation and implementation of the parallel algorithms ensuring this lecture room functionality.

CT 1st International Workshop on Agents for Games and Simulation

AB Educators increasingly turn to serious games to let students explore complex worlds in a safe environment. In serious games for ill-defined problem domains such as infrastructures and markets, students often interact with preconceived agents at an operational level. We hypothesize however that students could discover more about a domain's complexity at a strategic level by building and testing their own delegate agents. Testing this requires an environment where students and teachers can construct agents at their own level of expertise with recent modeling technologies. For instance, students may create agents not just directly, by building or modifying comprehensive agent models with visual programming languages, but also indirectly, by shaping agent behavior as it evolves in user-defined training scenarios or by enacting example behavior which agents learn to imitate. We propose a serious game concept that combines such modeling methods within a single intelligent simulation platform so that it becomes a low-threshold interface for continuous knowledge exchange and gain between teachers, students and agents.

AB Digital games are currently viewed, by many within the field of education, as a way to engage and motivate students, and to assist them in acquiring content knowledge and skills. Despite the growing interest in using digital games, including serious games, this is the first critical review of the literature on the effectiveness of digital narrative-driven educational games. Of 2550 articles initially screened, 130 were synthesised in the final review. The results suggest that such games can be more much more effective than traditional instruction for promoting attitude change, engagement, motivation, and skill acquisition; slightly more effective in promoting enjoyment and knowledge acquisition; and equal in fostering behaviour change. As such, they may be viewed as effective and versatile tools for teaching and learning.

AB Teaching and learning in outreach laboratories is suitable for completion of multiple hands-on experiences of students. Digital contents may support and further enrich individual haptic experiences. Nevertheless, individual variables such as computer-related self-concepts are supposed to intervene with the cognitive learning success within this context. This potential interrelationship was a major focus of our study completed in an outreach laboratory where an eLearning module specifically was integrated into a hands-on centered gene-technology module. By monitoring cognitive knowledge levels and simultaneously applying the computer-related self-concept of 162 German students (11th grade), an increase in knowledge became apparent independently of individual computer-related self-concepts. This missing relationship exemplarily fosters the assumption that computer-supported learning may suite every student regardless of computer-related self-concept scores. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Problem-based learning in pathophysiology: Report of a project and its
   outcome
SO TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: This article describes the application of problem-based learning (PBL) to a single discipline in a traditional medical curriculum. It covers the preparatory stages and the initial 3 years.
   Description: Preparatory workshops took place with emphasis on tutor training and the use of appropriate learning materials. The PBL format applied was the tutorial process supported by PBL modules (paper simulations bused on complete clinical cases).
   Evaluation: Students' PBL skills were assessed during the sessions, and the final examination consisted of a multiple-choice test (MCT). Students with higher PBL marks also scored significantly higher in the final MCT. Both students and teachers found the method motivating and useful in the learning of pathophysiology.
   Conclusions: A derailed PBL format was applied to a single discipline without major curricular changes. Although the effects on other disciplines are still minor, the project allowed for the development of educational activities at the institutional level, including the establishment of a Department of Medical Education.

TI Realizing the actual magnitudes of aortic diameter and cardiac output: a
   multisensory learning approach
SO ADVANCES IN PHYSIOLOGY EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
DE cardiocirculatory variables; multisensory learning; practical teaching
AB The conventional physiology courses consist of theoretical lectures, clinical application seminars, numerical exercises, simulations, and laboratory practices. However, in subjects that involve relevant physical quantities, even students who successfully pass exams may be unable to realize the actual quantities involved. For example, students may know what the values of the aortic diameter and cardiac output are, and they may be skilled at calculating changes in variables without being able to realize the actual physical magnitudes of the variables, resulting in limited understanding. To address this problem, here we describe and discuss simple practical exercises specifically designed to allow students to multisensory experience (touch, see, hear) the actual physical magnitudes of aortic diameter and cardiac output in adult humans at rest and exercise. The results obtained and the feedback from a student survey both clearly show that the described approach is a simple and interesting tool for motivating students and providing them with more realistic learning.

AB Currently, Big Data Analytics help educators better analyze students and monitor their progress and likelihood of success. The online learning experience applies to the experiences in the online computer-mediated digital system to collect information. An essential part of education training programs is challenging and effectively implemented between teachers and students in the online learning feedback system. Hence, a Big Data Visualization assisted Multimodal Feedback Framework (BDVMFF) is proposed to boost students' confidence, self-consciousness, and motivation in the online learning platform. The BDVMFF offers the teacher a digital workflow to effectively exchange both the writing and the input to use multimodal feedback effectively. This system provides teachers and students with an effective and straightforward digital learning environment. The simulation results of BDVMFF show the highest performance ratio (97.9%), the efficiency ratio (96.1%), the grade analysis ratio (93.5%), the computation ratio (95.3%), and the lowest response time compared to existing methods.

AB Teaching in technical subjects requires the use of programming and computer tools but sometimes many difficulties are found in the acquisition of both substantial learning and practical computer skills. Although the immediate objective of this work is the comprehension of a specific topic, diffusion in solids as a random physical process, the broader goal is to present computer tools, in this case an Excel macro developed by the authors, not only as a way of processing data but also as a representation item that facilitate learning. This multimedia learning object includes an interactive simulation of the random motion of particles, which is the base of the physical phenomenon of solid diffusion and consequently must be taught in some engineering subjects. Students need to be familiar with Excel spreadsheets because a basic Excel management is assumed. They participate in the construction of the learning object, i.e. in the programming of the macro, and they finally simulate diffusion and interact with the multimedia tool.

AB The purpose of this study is to investigate how three teachers guided their students to learn science using interactive dynamic visualizations incorporated in an inquiry digital unit. The results show that the teachers' guidance varied in frequency, occasion, and content type. Each teacher demonstrated a different instructional approach in terms of the two dimensions of facilitating versus informing, and responsive, norm-revealing inquiry guidance versus planned, meaning-defining inquiry guidance. The study illustrates the range of inquiry instruction supporting learning with interactive dynamic visualizations. Moreover, the teacher effect was significant on the students' learning outcomes when instructional time and the students' pre-test scores were controlled using a multiple regression model. Effective teaching strategies that augment students' integrated understanding of science phenomena through interactive dynamic visualizations are discussed based on the association between teaching effects and learning outcomes.

AB In this paper, we examine the implementation of a digital learning environment-namely, the physics software,Algodoo-which is less-constrained in its design than the digital learning environments typically used in physics education. Through an analysis of a case study, we explore a teaching arrangement wherein physics teachers responsively guide small groups of students as they useless-constrained DLEsin a mostly self-directed manner. Our analysis leads to practical recommendations for physics teachers in terms of (1) how to glean useful information about students' existing physics knowledge through observation and (2) how to responsively intervene so as to productively guide students toward the learning of particular physics content. These recommendations stem from our use of the variation theory of learning as a lens for physics students' use of digital learning environments.

DE Dynamic learning; interactive learning units; development of skills
AB Recently, the Engineering Faculty of the UNAM has been involved in the process of updating the plans and curricula of their careers, being, therefore, extremely timely and pertinent to update materials and educational strategies with innovative and effective contributions to the new generations of students, which updates the teaching practice and strengthen and reinforce student learning processes.
   New plans of the electrical electronic engineering, telecommunications and computing degrees, cover the subject in Systems and Signals (SyS), each one with its specific approach, incorporating laboratory practice in this update.
   Systems and Signals is the theoretical core for the degree courses before mentioned, it emanates essential concepts that govern in each of the disciplines, hence its importance and significance.
   These topics addressed in a traditional way, tend to be dense, tedious and laborious for the pupil, since they include a strong dose of concepts of mathematical analysis, ambient that prevails during a conventional format which does not favor that the student attend effectively the continuity in topics and therefore lose their interest in the subject.
   To address this situation, a project for the development of a compendium of educational materials, which is based in interactive learning units (ILU) (set of contents, resources and educational multimedia materials), has been proposed. It strategically links theory, simulation and practice across a wide range of resources and learning activities that make the material interactive and dynamic, so that the student can conduct experiments and exercise effectively the theory through simulations in any place and at any time, or in an experimental laboratory, allowing them to achieve effective and quality learning, not only in the themes of the subject itself, but in the skills and abilities acquired through the management of software, hardware, and use of ICT.
   This document presents the approach of the institutional project and some results about a compendium of educational materials which aims to achieve a dynamic learning in students of systems and signals class. Also the development process of the proposed scheme, the description of materials developed, the use of digital repositories for distribution, experience and skills which students manifest have acquired with their use.
   The teaching of the new courses will enter into force until February 2017, however, the established goals, materials, their implementation and other aspects have been assessed through pilot groups.

AB Background: In the face of severe faculty shortages in resource-constrained countries, medical schools look to e-learning for improved access to medical education. This paper summarizes the literature on e-learning in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), and presents the spectrum of tools and strategies used.
   Methods: Researchers reviewed literature using terms related to e-learning and pre-service education of health professionals in LMIC. Search terms were connected using the Boolean Operators "AND" and "OR" to capture all relevant article suggestions. Using standard decision criteria, reviewers narrowed the article suggestions to a final 124 relevant articles.
   Results: Of the relevant articles found, most referred to e-learning in Brazil (14 articles), India (14), Egypt (10) and South Africa (10). While e-learning has been used by a variety of health workers in LMICs, the majority (58%) reported on physician training, while 24% focused on nursing, pharmacy and dentistry training. Although reasons for investing in e-learning varied, expanded access to education was at the core of e-learning implementation which included providing supplementary tools to support faculty in their teaching, expanding the pool of faculty by connecting to partner and/or community teaching sites, and sharing of digital resources for use by students. E-learning in medical education takes many forms. Blended learning approaches were the most common methodology presented (49 articles) of which computer-assisted learning (CAL) comprised the majority (45 articles). Other approaches included simulations and the use of multimedia software (20 articles), web-based learning (14 articles), and eTutor/eMentor programs (3 articles). Of the 69 articles that evaluated the effectiveness of e-learning tools, 35 studies compared outcomes between e-learning and other approaches, while 34 studies qualitatively analyzed student and faculty attitudes toward e-learning modalities.
   Conclusions: E-learning in medical education is a means to an end, rather than the end in itself. Utilizing e-learning can result in greater educational opportunities for students while simultaneously enhancing faculty effectiveness and efficiency. However, this potential of e-learning assumes a certain level of institutional readiness in human and infrastructural resources that is not always present in LMICs. Institutional readiness for e-learning adoption ensures the alignment of new tools to the educational and economic context.

DE new pedagogy; characteristics; paperless high-school; partnership
AB Theoreticians as well as practitioners in the 21(st) century are still engaged in the improvement of learning and instruction (Stigler & Hiebert, 2009). It is common knowledge that within technological environments students' learning is enhanced (Nachmias, Mioduser & Forkosh-Baruch, 2008). The study presented hereafter is a result of a partnership between a college of education and a fully technological paperless high-school where pre-service teachers who study at the college experience teaching. The aim of the qualitative study within the phenomenological research paradigm was to explore the meaning of new pedagogy from the perspectives of fourteen participants in the partnership who enrolled in the study - college lecturers and researchers, position holders and teachers in the high-school, pre-service teachers and high-school students of the ninth grade. The outline of the study involved an integration of several qualitative research designs and data collection instruments (Creswell, 2013). Research design incorporated data obtained from two sources - five meetings held in the paperless school in 2015, and sixteen reflections that teachers in that school have written. In the five meetings the meaning of new pedagogy was contemplated by fourteen participants in the study in a discussion that followed a simulation - a pedagogical demonstration of a lesson or project previously taught in that school. The five meetings were documented and transcribed and data analysis involved direct content analysis of the transcripts (Shannon & Hsieh, 2005), and was performed by four of the participants - the researchers. Sixteen reflections of sixteen teachers in that high-school who have described one lesson that each of them had chosen were also analyzed through direct content analysis by the four researchers. Findings point to fourteen immanent characteristics of new pedagogy that were identified in the five meetings as well as in the sixteen reflections - engagement, higher order thinking skills, collaboration, accessibility, creativity, gaming, immediacy, multimodality, authenticity, the use of simulations and models, multidiscipline, dissolution of boundaries of time and place, switching roles, and choice. Some of the characteristics are inter-dependent and form a culture of pedagogy that is context specific, is perceived as optimal pedagogy in recent research (Pederson, 2004), and differs from traditional contexts of learning and instruction.

AB Enhanced podcasts increase learning, but evidence is lacking on how they should be designed to optimize their effectiveness. This study assessed the impact two learning instructional design methods (mental practice and modeling), either on their own or in combination, for teaching complex cognitive medical content when incorporated into enhanced podcasts. Sixty-three medical students were randomised to one of four versions of an airway management enhanced podcast: (1) control: narrated presentation; (2) modeling: narration with video demonstration of skills; (3) mental practice: narrated presentation with guided mental practice; (4) combined: modeling and mental practice. One week later, students managed a manikin-based simulated airway crisis. Knowledge acquisition was assessed by baseline and retention multiple-choice quizzes. Two blinded raters assessed all videos obtained from simulated crises to measure the students' skills using a key-elements scale, critical error checklist, and the Ottawa global rating scale (GRS). Baseline knowledge was not different between all four groups (p = 0.65). One week later, knowledge retention was significantly higher for (1) both the mental practice and modeling group than the control group (p = 0.01; p = 0.01, respectively) and (2) the combined mental practice and modeling group compared to all other groups (all ps = 0.01). Regarding skills acquisition, the control group significantly under-performed in comparison to all other groups on the key-events scale (all ps aecurrency sign 0.05), the critical error checklist (all ps aecurrency sign 0.05), and the Ottawa GRS (all ps aecurrency sign 0.05). The combination of mental practice and modeling led to greater improvement on the key events checklist (p = 0.01) compared to either strategy alone. However, the combination of the two strategies did not result in any further learning gains on the two other measures of clinical performance (all ps > 0.05). The effectiveness of enhanced podcasts for knowledge retention and clinical skill acquisition is increased with either mental practice or modeling. The combination of mental practice and modeling had synergistic effects on knowledge retention, but conveyed less clear advantages in its application through clinical skills.

AB This study aims to improve the creative thinking skills of prospective physics teacher as the impact of the application of interactive thermodynamics multimedia (ITMM). The research method used is quasi experiment with control group pretest- posttest design. The subjects consisted of 34 students in the experimental group and 33 students in the control group. Participant students are physics physics semester fourth, in one of the state universities in East Kalimantan. The research instrument consists of multiple choice test items charged with creative thinking skills. Data were analyzed by using difference test of two averages. The normalized gain gain score <g> of creative thinking skill aspect on the experimental group is 0.60 and the control group is 0.31. This indicates that the creative thinking skills of the prospective physics teacher increase significantly after they experience thermodynamic learning with interactive multimedia. Thus it can be concluded that the use of interactive multimedia improve the creative thinking skills of prospective physics teachers. (C) 2017 Jurusan Fisika FMIPA UNNES Semarang

AB To provide a good understanding of many abstract concepts in the field of electricity above that of their students is often a major challenge for secondary school teachers. Many educational researchers promote conceptual learning as a teaching approach that can help teachers to achieve this goal. In this paper, we present Physlet-based materials for supporting conceptual learning about electricity. To conduct research into the effectiveness of these materials, we designed two different physics courses: one group of students, the experimental group, was taught using Physlet-based materials and the second group of students, the control group, was taught using expository instruction without using Physlets. After completion of the teaching, we assessed students' thinking skills and analysed the materials with an independent t test, multiple regression analyses and one-way analysis of covariance. The test scores were significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (p < 0.05). The results of this study confirmed the effectiveness of conceptual learning about electricity with the help of Physlet-based materials.

AB Rationale and Objectives. The application of information technology to teaching radiology will profoundly change the way learning is mediated to students. In this project, the integration of veterinary medical students' knowledge of sonography was promoted by a computer-assisted instruction program and a subsequent practical class.
   Methods. The computer-assisted instruction program emphasized the physical principles of clinical sonography and contained simulations and user-active experiments. In the practical class, the students used an actual sonographic machine for the first time and made images of a tissue-equivalent phantom. Students' responses to questionnaires were analyzed.
   Results. On completing the overall project, 96% of the students said that they now understood sonographic concepts very or reasonably well, and 98% had become very or moderately interested in clinical sonography.
   Conclusions. The teaching and learning initiatives enhanced an integrated approach to learning, stimulated student interest and curiosity, improved understanding of sonographic principles, and contributed to an increased confidence and skill in using sonographic equipment.

AB According to Baas, van den Eijnde, and Junger (2001) an electronic course book (in short, ECB) is a learning module consisting of menu-driven hyperdocuments with a functional use of interactivity and multimedia, presented oil the WWW and/or CDROM. The main purpose of this paper is to propose a model for the development of a computer network ECB based on (a) the integration of several tools, which are dispersed in the WWW as university course materials and that for their multimedia nature could not be inserted in a paper book, and (b) on WWW usability criteria, which make the design of the book very different from that of a printed book. The ECB will turn out to be useful both to teachers (while giving their lectures) since they will take advantage of the slide-based presentation of the text and of the several simulation tools included in the ECB, and to students (while studying the material) since they will be able to learn by reading, by doing and by answering.

ID ASSURANCE
AB The Major Field Test in Business (MFTB) is a nationally administered student evaluation that measures the accumulated knowledge of undergraduates enrolled in a four-year degree program. Research to date has focused primarily on understanding how different variables correlate with performance on this standardized test - such as student grades, gender and ethnicity. The research objectives of this essay are to analyse the ambiguous results found in previous studies and to highlight how interaction effects among variables can be used to better explain test success. Using data on student performance collected over 11 semesters at a Canadian university, this essay uses a multi-variable regression model to understand the factors affecting scores on the MFTB. The model results suggest that examining the interaction between variables provides important insights and can help to better explain the ambiguity in prior studies. This study is unique in that it uses a statistical measure known as the extra sum of squares F-test to demonstrate the significance of interaction variables.

AB Adaptive e-learning materials can help teachers to educate heterogeneous student groups. This study provides empirical data about the way academic students differ in their learning when using adaptive e-learning materials. Ninety-four students participated in the study. We determined characteristics in a heterogeneous student group by collecting demographic data and measuring motivation and prior knowledge. We also measured the learning paths students followed and learning strategies they used when working with adaptive e-learning material in a molecular biology course. We then combined these data to study if and how student characteristics relate to the learning paths and strategies they used. We observed that students did follow different learning paths. Gender did not have an effect, but (mainly Dutch) BSc students differed from (international) MSc students in the intrinsic motivation they had and the learning paths and strategies they followed when using the adaptive e-learning material.

AB Expert operative information is a prerequisite for any form of surgical training. However, the shortening of working hours has reduced surgical training time and learning opportunities. As a potential solution to this problem, multimedia programs have been designed to provide computer-based assistance to surgical trainees outside of the operating theatre. Few studies, however, have focused on the interface features of surgical multimedia programs, the successful design of which could be conducive to the evaluation of the effectiveness of learning. This study evaluated a multimedia CD-ROM designed for teaching minor skin surgery. A questionnaire, based on an existing user interface rating tool, was administered to 20 trainees (both junior and senior) in plastic surgery. Findings from the study revealed trainees' high rating of the CD-ROM on a scale of 1-10 (mean=8); the analysis of which contributes towards an understanding of both the characteristics of the learning material and the learners in the evaluation of the user interface.

TI Order Matters: Sequencing Scale-Realistic Versus Simplified Models to

AB Teachers choosing between different models to facilitate students' understanding of an abstract system must decide whether to adopt a model that is simplified and striking or one that is realistic and complex. Only recently have instructional technologies enabled teachers and learners to change presentations swiftly and to provide for learning based on multiple models, thus giving rise to questions about the order of presentation. Using disjoint individual growth modeling to examine the learning of astronomical concepts using a simulation of the solar system on tablets for 152 high school students (age 15), the authors detect both a model effect and an order effect in the use of the Orrery, a simplified model that exaggerates the scale relationships, and the True-to-scale, a proportional model that more accurately represents the realistic scale relationships. Specifically, earlier exposure to the simplified model resulted in diminution of the conceptual gain from the subsequent realistic model, but the realistic model did not impede learning from the following simplified model.

AB In this special issue on virtual biomedical universities and e-learning we will make a survey on the principal existing teaching applications of ICT used in medical Schools around the world. In the following we identify five types of research and experiments in this field of medical e-learning and virtual medical universities.
   The topics of this special issue goes from educational computer program to create and simulate virtual patients with a wide variety of medical conditions in different clinical settings and over different time frames to using distance learning in developed and developing countries program training medical informatics of clinicians. We also present the necessity of good indexing and research tools for training resources together with workflows to manage the multiple source content of virtual campus or universities and the virtual digital video resources. A special attention is given to training new generations of clinicians in ICT tools and methods to be used in clinical settings as well as in medical schools.

AB This paper proposes to improve instruction in Operations Management by taking the student as a reference. The results show the need to make the subjects more understandable and motivating, given the student's lack of interest in developing professionally in this area. The aim should therefore be for the teaching strategy to act upon these variables. Three educational environments (computer-assisted learning, presential seminar and traditional distance teaching) have been analysed with this goal in mind in order to determine their influence on such variables as motivation, perceived difficulty, understanding of the material and perception of the learning. Said educational environments have been evaluated making use of such aids as factor analysis and variance analysis. We have determined the environments that are best suited to dealing with the problems that instruction in such an important discipline for business administration presents for students.

AB This paper presents a methodology for applying automated essay scoring in educational settings. The methodology was tested and validated on a dataset of 173 reports (in Dutch language) that students have created in an applied game on environmental policy. Natural Language Processing technologies from the ReaderBench framework were used to generate an extensive set of textual complexity indices for each of the reports. Afterwards, different machine learning algorithms were used to predict the scores. By combining binary classification (pass or fail) and a probabilistic model for Precision, a trade-off can be made between validity of automated score prediction (Precision) and the reduction of teacher workload required for manual assessment. It was found from the sample that substantial workload reduction can be achieved, while preserving high precision: allowing for a precision of 95% or higher would already reduce the teacher's workload to 74%; lowering precision to 80% produces a workload reduction of 50%.

AB The transmission of clinical knowledge occurs traditionally through lectures, theoretical and practical courses, bed-side teaching as well as case-oriented teaching in small groups. The realisation is, however often very laborious and problematical because of low resources. For these reasons the development of computer-based, and in particular internet-based tutorials have increased dramatically in recent years. Furthermore,the transmission of knowledge by means of internet-based tutorials offers several advantages. The content can be quickly updated and multimedia presentations are possible. The use of these sources is normally independent of time and location. The possibilities of internet-based teaching and learning are on-line lectures, case simulations and online quizzes. At present the number of ophthalmological applications on the internet is still restricted. Internet-based multimedial tutorials represent a meaningful supplement to traditional forms of teaching. Especially in ophthalmology, a visual presentation of details can be performed in an easier way via multimedial tools and the training is followed without causing stress for the patients.

AB Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) represent a particular kind of eleaming systems, which base their operation on the simulation of a human teacher in the learning and teaching process. With the advent of the mobile computing paradigm, m-learning systems, as the "portable and personal" fashion of e-learning, paved the way to the introduction of mobile intelligent tutoring. Mobile intelligent tutoring systems (MITSs) are targeted to fit into a mobile learner's daily routine without disrupting her/his other activities, but conversely enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of learning in the context of handheld terminals of restricted capabilities. As in the non-portable ITS counterparts, MITSs' tasks are taken over by agents, making them agent-based systems. In this paper we discuss the mobile intelligent tutoring paradigm, as well as the agent types to be used in the m-learning environment along with the presently affordable agent infrastructure enabling MITS implementation, and corroborate this with the description of a mobile intelligent tutoring model we are developing.

AB This paper proposed a new kind of online education mode, MOOE (Massive Open Online Experiment). MOOE was produced based on the thoughts of the Internet thinking and the opening-and-sharing resources and was the organic combination of MOOC and experimental teaching. The main contributions were made: (1) Instructed MOOE's concept and characteristics. MOOE build a network laboratory with the advanced information technology to make experimenters complete all the experimental activities through the Internet without the limitation of time, space and resources. (2) Analyzed the similarities and differences between MOOE and MOOC. MOOE was the extension and expansion of MOOC, which realized the online learning of all the teaching activities including the theoretical courses and their related experiments. MOOE inherited the advantaged of MOOC, but paid more attention to the virtualization of experimental equipment, operations and contents. (3) Described the implement and application of MOOE by taking an experimental course titled "FPGA Based Multi-core Computing" as an example. The feasibility and advantage of MOOE were proved by the actual statistical data of the course.

AB Teaching and understanding evolution is challenging because students must synthesize several biological processes that are traditionally taught separately. We developed a set of free online lessons and activities centered on a single evolutionary phenomenon - why deer mice have different fur colors in different subpopulations - to help high school students better understand how these different biological processes, operating at different scales, work together to influence a single organismal trait. Through scaffolded investigations, guiding questions, model building, and pointed analysis, students learn how ecology, cellular biology, molecular biology, genetic inheritance, and population genetics all work together to influence a shift in fur color over time. Using an innovative multilevel simulation, students manipulate and examine these different processes from the population level all the way down to the DNA level. In this article, we describe the lessons and materials we have developed for high school biology students. We outline the learning goals and highlight the major components of the technology and activities in each lesson. We then provide information on how to access our curricular and support materials, and conclude with user feedback from our pilot testing.

AB A novel idea of merging the profound and comprehensive modeling of the most low brain functions with education process is proposed. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to create a computer education system based on low level simulation of the pupil learming process. Comprehensive models of the human memory are possible only for the most fundamental processes of memorizing. Teaching mathematical facts in primary school is one of strict examples. A detailed model of the memory allows creating a computer educational system for teaching the multiplication table. The system stores pupil's answers in a neural associative memory and tunes the neural model to simulate the pupills behavior. The computer model helps to select the most promising tasks guiding the pupil to learn educational materials in the best way and maldng the learning process more effective. The first tests in real school teaching process show the potential of the concept and open doors for further study of the approach. Additionally, the results of computer model application to the teaching process can be used as an immense data bank for testing and adjusting known models of the human memory.

AB At the Open University (OU), the perception of computer assisted learning (CAL) is shifting from its current position as an optional extra in a battery of course components to that of a key teaching medium. This paper presents the authors' experiences of the evaluation of a range of current OU produced computer assisted learning materials, mainly but not exclusively in science and technology reported in terms of evaluation framework. These materials include interactive tutorial packages, simulations used largely in a support role to the main teaching and multimedia packages which are expected to carry more of the initial presentation of key ideas in the courses. The overall purpose of the evaluations was to gain insight into how computers can have an impact on learning, particularly of science and technology subjects, and to explore a portfolio of evaluation techniques to be used in the development and assessment of computer based learning materials. In this paper the techniques are discussed and illustrated with reference to a number of case studies of a range of programs used by students. Some conclusions are drawn about how the use of programs leads to the support of students' science and technology learning. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Covid-19 has significantly impacted children's lives, requiring them to process multiple messages with significant emotional, social, and behavioural implications. Yet, the vast majority of these messages solely focus on behaviour. This is an oversight as children and young people can understand the biological properties and mechanisms of viruses when supported appropriately, thereby presenting an important opportunity for educators. However, like many other invisible scientific phenomena, understanding of viruses greatly depends upon how they are represented. Thus, we sought to understand the relative benefits and limitations of different forms for learning about the underlying biology of Covid-19. Applying an embodied learning lens, we analysed pictures, 3d models, gestures, dynamic visualisations, interactive representations, and extended reality identified through a state-of-the art-review. In so doing, we address the affordances and limitations of these forms in general and variation within them. We used this to develop a representational checklist that teachers and other adults can use to help them support children and young people's learning about the biology of Covid-19.

DE Design of Experiments; Experiential Learning Activities; Response
   Surface Management
AB Experiential Learning Activities (ELA) allow a natural teaching-learning process, in special in some difficult statistics terms. This paper focuses on the description of an ELA using catapults applied to Design of Experiments (DOE). In addition, results of the activities are shown and discussed, based on a simulation of the activity. The learning objectives are split into two main areas: DOE and Taguchi Methods, although many additional concepts can be learned during the activity. In both cases, the catapult offers a multilevel and multifactor device to work with. The learning process is led in an inductive way. At first, simple concepts are demonstrated and analysed. In a second step, harder requirements are set, in order to improve knowledge and skills on the subject. The instructor will lead the students from DOE to Taguchi Methods and finally all concepts and procedures will be summarised. This activity is a relaxed and fun activity, that with the help of the instructor, may capture the interest of the students while at the same time the learning objectives are being acquired. Preliminary results and additional details to increase student's interest are also discussed.

DE CLIL; content and language integrated learning; developing teaching
   methods; student-centred teaching methods
AB As the business of the Finnish forest industry companies expands increasingly over the borders of our country, a newly graduated engineer must possess professional skills, know the international business and marketing, understand multicultural business life situations and speak English fluently. In this paper the authors describe an International Pulp and Paper Technology (IPPT) specialization option at Tampere Polytechnic University of Applied Sciences and pedagogical means that have been adopted as a response to the challenges that globalisation causes to engineering education in pulp and paper technology. The main idea of the IPPT specialization option is to achieve content and language integrated learning (CLIL). In order to achieve this, versatile pedagogical means have been adopted such as pre-lecture assignments, cooperative learning sessions, miniseminars and seminars, negotiation simulations and writing learning journals. The first implementation of a renewed pulp and paper specialization option is described as well as the impact of the changes on student learning. The pros and cons of adapting quite a few different teaching methods are also discussed. This research is a case study and can be classified as action research with evaluative features.

AB Tutoring is assumed to be a conversational activity shared among the learner, the machine tutor and the educator/developer. The sort of student model that the machine should build, update and run simulations on, to help all three to be effective, is then derived. This derivation amounts to a demand for a new and different architecture for intelligent computer aided learning support systems. It is argued from cybernetic theory, and on the basis of empirical attribute-treatment results, that the student model must be a dynamic multi-level, and multi-personae model that also incorporates in rudimentary form the student's model of the teacher. Human tutors use multi-level models of learners' various characteristics to advantage. The promise of doing this in intelligent CAL systems is evaluated. Specific learner characteristics (including aspirations, expectations and cognitive style) are considered as elements of intelligent CAL student models. Since little is known yet about the moment-by-moment variability of many important learner characteristics, an intelligent CAL system is arguably a better laboratory for studying them. A formal connexion-matrix based language, and a fuzzy-logic based lesson planner, are advocated as a means for implementing and exploiting more adequate learner models in intelligent CAL systems.

AB This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the Interactive Visualizations for Chemistry Teaching and Learning ACS CHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education online ConfChem held from May 8 to June 4, 2015. Mr. Paul Grossman, Chief Regional Attorney (retired), Office of Civil Rights, United States Department of Education, succinctly places the development of American disability rights protections and principles within the broader context of race, sex, and national origin civil rights laws in the United States. Starting with the Emancipation Proclamation and ending with the revolutionary changes in education heralded by technology, Mr. Grossman's guide provides a background to understanding the modern evolution of disability law and how it relates to accessibility in education. The resulting discussion included resources for learning about how to make education technology accessible, the use of screen readers for reading chemistry content, how to design interactive simulations with accessibility in mind, and experiences of students with disabilities and their teachers.

AB We identify three challenges in cybersecurity education that could be addressed through game-based learning: conveying cybersecurity fundamentals, assessment of understanding, and recruitment and retention of professionals. By combining established epistemologies for cybersecurity with documented best practices for educational game design, we are able to define four research questions about the state of cybersecurity education games. Our attention is focused on games for ages 12-18 rather than adult learners or professional development. We analyze 21 games through the lens of our four research questions, including games that are explicitly designed to teach cybersecurity concepts as well as commercial titles with cybersecurity themes; in the absence of empirical evidence of these games' efficacy, our analysis frames these games within educational game design theory. This analysis produces a three-tier taxonomy of games: those whose gameplay is not associated with cybersecurity education content (Type 1); those that integrate multiple-choice decisions only (Type 2); and those that integrate cybersecurity objectives into authentic gameplay activity (Type 3). This analysis reveals opportunities for new endeavors to incorporate multiple perspectives and to scaffold learners progression from the simple games to the more complex simulations.

AB The incorporation of informal science modules with traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) engages students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. During the summers 2012-2015, I?isagvik Tribal College, located in Barrow, AK, hosted an average of 12 rural Alaska Native middle-school and high school students per year in the college's summer STEM program called "Climate and Permafrost Changes on the North Slope: In Cultural Context." Teaching the carbon cycle as a core concept, this 2-week STEM program examined climate change and its effects on the local landscape from a multitude of perspectives. Elders shared their observations and experiences associated with climate change. Local and visiting scientists gave presentations and taught through games, hands-on laboratory simulations, and practical field work-all relevant to the camp's science content. Pre-assessments and post-assessments using the Student Assessment of Learning Gains measured student interests and conceptual understanding. Students developed and enhanced their understanding of science concepts and, at the end of the camp, could articulate the impact of climactic changes on their local environment.

AB Chemistry is a science that operates at many levels, but perhaps the most fascinating is the level that explores the complexities of chemistry at the invisible molecular level. Over the years chemists have devised ever more useful and complex representations of molecular-level structures and interactions. The introduction of computers in the latter half of the 20th century led to the development of powerful visualization and modeling tools that have enhanced chemistry research capabilities. These techniques allowed more accurate and informative images of the molecular level to be generated for use in education, and animations were developed to communicate how atoms and molecules might interact and move. Assessment of conceptual understanding was also updated to reflect the use of visualizations in the learning of chemistry. Because scientific visualizations and animations can be complex and difficult to understand, multidisciplinary teams are now studying how the use of visualization techniques in the teaching and learning of chemistry can be optimized. These collaborations are revealing how students perceive and interpret various kinds of molecular animations and are showing how best to develop and use static graphics and dynamic visualizations for the learning of chemistry.

TI Step-wise evolution of mental models of electric circuits: A
   "learning-aloud" case study
SO JOURNAL OF THE LEARNING SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
ID MISCONCEPTIONS; INSTRUCTION; SCIENCE; ANALOGY
AB Various methods have been tried for fostering conceptual change in science including the use of analogies, discrepant events, and visual models. In this article we describe an approach to teaching complex models in science that takes a model construction cycle of generation, evaluation, and modification as an organizing framework for thinking about when to use each of the previous strategies. This approach of model evolution uses all of the previous methods as students are led to reassess and revise their model many times in the course of the lessons.
   We reported on the case study of a student in a tutoring experiment using this approach in the study of electric circuits. We concentrated on the student's moments of surprise as motivators of conceptual change. Most of these came from discrepant events, but I of them appeared to come from the student's own sensed lack of coherence in an intermediate model. In this case study, the teaching method appears to lead to the construction of an explanatory model that is fairly deeply understood by the student in the sense that it can generate predictions and coherent explanations of a complex-system. in a transfer problem.
   Some of our conclusions and hypotheses generated with respect to learning processes are as follows: (a) Discrepant events produced reactions of surprise and were eventually followed by model revisions, leading us to hypothesize a motivating and guiding role for these events; (b) the subject was able to map and apply an air pressure analogy used for electric potential and continued to exhibit traces of it through the posttest interview; (c) the subject's spontaneous use of similar depictive hand motions during the instruction and during the posttest provides initial evidence that the instruction fostered development of dynamic mental models, such as those of fluid-like flows caused by pressure differences, that can generate new mental simulations for understanding relatively difficult transfer problems. This leads us to describe the core of her new knowledge as explanatory models at an intermediate level of generality that allow her to run imagistic simulations and to hypothesize a "transfer of runnability" from the analog conception to the model in this case; (d) we hypothesize that the process underlying model generations and revisions was 1 of scaffolded abductive knowledge construction rather than induction or deduction; that evaluation and revision cycles can make up for the conjectural nature of individual abductions; and that engagement and comprehension in the cycle was fostered by small step sizes for revisions from using multiple "small" discrepant events and analogies built into the lessons.

AB The use of virtual worlds in the school is an extraordinary tool to engage the children in the process of e-learning. Although one can find many examples that describe the use of such a technology in teaching regular educational contents, very few examples replicate other classical outdoor educational activities such as a visit to a museum, including the remote interaction with the docents of the visited institution. In this work, the results of a study of the user experience of three groups of children within a flexible virtual space that connects schools and museums are described and evaluated. This integrated educational space not only includes the exploration of exhibition areas but also the telepresence talks on the part of museum personnel, simulations, educational work in the form of virtual quests, all within a multi-user virtual environment based on OpenSim and simultaneously accessible from the different institutions involved in the experiment. The results obtained could serve as a starting point for a future implementation of this platform for connecting educational institutions and museums across an entire city.

AB A deep understanding of chemistry requires internal visualization of structures and processes at the molecular level to rationalize observable chemical and physical properties, and make sense of chemistry symbolism and mathematical relationships. The paper argues that accurate mental models of the molecular world are needed to address the student misconceptions described in the literature, and describes the potential and limitations of the VisChem animations to develop useful mental models. A constructivist learning design has been developed and evaluated as a best practice strategy for effectively using the VisChem resources for learning. This communication summarizes one of the invited papers to the Interactive Visualizations for Chemistry Teaching and Learning ACS CHED Committee on Computers in Chemical Education online ConfChem held from May 8 to June 4, 2015. The lively discussions that followed addressed the difficulty of showing the crucial role of ion hydration without producing cognitive overload, the need to build a visual literacy through repeated and progressive use molecular animations, and the complementary nature of animations and simulations to portray the molecular world.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence / effectiveness of teacher's mediation in the learning of the structure of the subject and the changes in physical state at the microscope level, by students of the 5th grade of schooling. The study was based on two research questions: (1) "What is the influence / effectiveness of the teacher's mediation, in tasks with equal orientation, in the understanding of the changes in the physical state of the subject, at the corpuscular level, by students of the 5th year of schooling?" (2) "What assessment does the student attribute to the autonomy given by the teacher?" The study was conducted in two groups of 15 students each. Data on the teaching and learning process were collected, in particular audio recordings, images and student work. With these data were constructed multimodal narrations, whose analysis allowed to verify that the mediation of the teacher was different in the two groups and that this difference may have influenced the degree of performance of the students and the perception of autonomy provided by the teacher.

AB Recent research shows that the engineering students have problems connecting the required computation to a conceptual understanding, as well as translating a graphical understanding of the process to a symbolic mathematical representation, especially when handling the multiple steps of the procedures. The students are usually able to perform sequences of the underlying calculations but cannot piece together the higher conceptual relationship that drives these procedures. This work-in-progress paper presents a viable approach and a new teaching and learning paradigm to enhance the effectiveness of teaching fast Fourier transform and significantly improve the learning outcomes. By integrating the mobile and cloud computing technologies, we are developing a handheld real-world relevance laboratory that includes an integrated learning module for Fourier transform and a shared intelligent project repository to host the module and real-world relevant data. This development is expected to overcome the intellectual inaccessibility of transform techniques and tackle the challenges in existing approaches: the prohibitive cost of project-based approach; limited access and real-world relevance data in simulation-based approach, and unreliable and unsustainable support.

DE Simulated Patient; Training; Disabled Persons
AB Introduction: Simulated patients constitute a real possibility of providing learning, due to their potential to fulfil conditions close to ideals and to manage disadvantages regarding the use of a real patient by training people or actors to perform their roles in realistic situations in the teaching institution. The use of simulated patients in educational units to train abilities and to evaluate students is a resource to make skills. This method is disseminated by enabling the provision of formative evaluation and learning through the proper correction of errors.
   Objective: To report the experience of training blind simulated patients.
   Method: This is an experience report from a dissertational study that aimed at evaluating the communication skills of nurses with the blind patient. The research was carried out from May 2015 to June 2016. The study population comprised three blind people chosen by means of an association for visually impaired people. Participants were trained according to the protocol developed on screen research to work as a hypertensive blind subject during the Nursing consult. This research is part of a multicenter study that had been approved by the Ethics Committee, under protocol number 652.134.
   Results and Discussion: Training was conducted in five meetings. The first one presented the research proposal and verified the availability of volunteers; whereas the second meeting presented the script that participants had to memorize for the act, and each item was read slowly in sequence after the explanation and exemplification. Volunteers asked doubts, especially regarding behaviors that they had to show when nurses did not make the consults properly; examples included tapping the feet, moving the head, frowning, and bumping the furniture, which were mentioned and explained properly. In the third meeting, the participants were introduced to the simulated environment. One by one, they walked around the room, touched the furniture and equipment and were informed about the cameras and their location. They took part in the first simulation activity, and a previously trained nurse was invited to conduct the Nursing consult. New simulations were performed in the two next meetings and, finally, an evaluative instrument was applied to validate the training - all participants showed skills to work as simulated patients.
   Final considerations: Training of a simulated patient is an efficient method to systematize scientific data collection, to obtain reliable results and to control the studied variable in a better way. It is also an efficient method to train professional skills. The benefit of using simulated patients in the professional formation and qualification increases the need of scientific strictness; therefore, literature is still incipient and should be developed to fill the lacks in the scientific field.

ID VIRTUAL-REALITY; EDUCATION; SIMULATION
AB Background: Anatomy has been the cornerstone of medical education for centuries. However, given the advances in the Internet of Things, this landscape has been augmented in the past decade, shifting toward a greater focus on adopting digital technologies. Digital anatomy is emerging as a new discipline that represents an opportunity to embrace advances in digital health technologies and apply them to the domain of modern medical sciences. Notably, the use of augmented or mixed and virtual reality as well as mobile and platforms and 3D printing in modern anatomy has dramatically increased in the last 5 years.
   Objective: This review aims to outline the emerging area of digital anatomy and summarize opportunities and challenges for incorporating digital anatomy in medical science education and practices.
   Methods: Literature searches were performed using the PubMed, Embase, and MEDLINE bibliographic databases for research articles published between January 2005 and June 2021 (inclusive). Out of the 4650 articles, 651 (14%) were advanced to full-text screening and 77 (1.7%) were eligible for inclusion in the narrative review. We performed a Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis to evaluate the role that digital anatomy plays in both the learning and teaching of medicine and health sciences as well as its practice.
   Results: Digital anatomy has not only revolutionized undergraduate anatomy education via 3D reconstruction of the human body but is shifting the paradigm of pre- and vocational training for medical professionals via digital simulation, advancing health care. Importantly, it was noted that digital anatomy not only benefits in situ real time clinical practice but also has many advantages for learning and teaching clinicians at multiple levels. Using the SWOT analysis, we described strengths and opportunities that together serve to underscore the benefits of embracing digital anatomy, in particular the areas for collaboration and medical advances. The SWOT analysis also identified a few weaknesses associated with digital anatomy, which are primarily related to the fact that the current reach and range of applications for digital anatomy are very limited owing to its nascent nature. Furthermore, threats are limited to technical aspects such as hardware and software issues.
   Conclusions: This review highlights the advances in digital health and Health 4.0 in key areas of digital anatomy analytics. The continuous evolution of digital technologies will increase their ability to reinforce anatomy knowledge and advance clinical practice. However, digital anatomy education should not be viewed as a simple technical conversion and needs an explicit pedagogical framework. This review will be a valuable asset for educators and researchers to incorporate digital anatomy into the learning and teaching of medical sciences and their practice.

AB The paper aims to present the Bachelor Degree in Business Administration in Complex Learning, at the Department of Management (University of Turin, Italy). Started in 2014/2015, the bachelor aims to allow workers, off-site and professional students to attend university lessons and, then, to graduate; all lessons are delivered only in e-learning modality (or distance education, with a registration and an academic fee) to favour the participation in courses. The degree, a three-year-long undergraduate course, will be available on a specific platform based on Moodle that allows to log into all educative contents and didactical materials. Students can attend lessons through videos and multimedia contents (virtual simulations, power point presentations, slide-talks, audio presentations, pdf contents, surveys, video-conferences, case-histories videos and CEOs' interviews.), participate in communities of practice - in virtual rooms - where they can collaborate with others to study or develop projects and share knowledge. Besides, a community manager and some online tutors (e-tutors) are also present to support students in all their activities and educative processes (both to registration and career plan and educative activities). All activities use the distance learning modality; only exams and dissertation difenses are done face to face in University classrooms. Nowadays, the bachelor in complex learning includes 34 courses, 656 users enrolled and 7,000 videos; in June 2018, the platform had 38,755 logins (students, professors and tutors); since January 2018, the platform had 174,436 users' logins.
   Each course is organized into several video-lesson units (normally, each video is 12-20 minutes long) and related exercises (such as tests, multiple choice questions, SCORM, forums.) to verify the learning goals and to prepare exams. These sections are also based on several html5 contents, such as interactive videos and tests to help students to develop an active approach in their studying phases. All video-lessons are based on several forms, partly according to Paivio's Dual-coding theory and, above all, Richard Mayer's directions to favour a better multimedia learning experience.
   During 2017/2018, we have carried out an online survey for starting an exploratory research to evaluate the effectiveness of the experience and to verify the efficacy of videos and professors' main communicative skills (from the point of view of students). In this paper, we will explain both the models of our multimedia products and survey's results of this first evaluation phase.

AB This study aims to identify the needs of Android-based interactive multimedia in basic physics learning in South Sulawesi. The instrument of this study consisted of test and non-test instruments, the test instruments used were tests of understanding basic physics concepts for prospective physics teacher students, while the non-test instruments took the form of student questionnaires about the multimedia needs of basic physics learning. The number of participants in this study was 39 students who were candidates for physics teachers at one of the private universities in South Sulawesi. The results of the research data analysis showed that the level of understanding of basic physics concepts, namely at a very difficult level of 15.1%, was difficult 46.7%, while at an easy level it was 31.3% and very easy at 6.9%. At the level of the need for the type of learning media, data were obtained that the highest level of needs in a row was interactive multimedia (35.3%), video/simulation (32.5%), mobile learning (21.9%), and broadcast material/power point (10.3%). In conclusion, the need for Android-based interactive multimedia is still very high, this is to balance the technological developments in the field of education, especially basic physics.

AB Because the educational technology research literature is so broad, it is difficult for researchers to acquire an accurate sense of the issues and trends across the entire field. There has not been any recent effort to synthesize or critically analyse the systematic reviews in the area of educational technology. This study analysed 73 systematic literature reviews, including meta-analyses, focused on the evaluation of technology in educational contexts, in order to holistically understand the impact of learning technology use across different aspects of evaluation. Among these reviews, the most common theme examined was learning outcomes (89%), followed by affective elements (45%), behaviours (25%), technological elements (21%) and teaching/pedagogical aspects (19%). Most of the reviews found that the use of technology improved learning outcomes and affective perceptions. Approaches involving interaction, gamification, constructivism, student-centred learning and feedback were most effective. The analysis highlighted the need for more reviews focusing on multiple aspects of learning technology evaluation, on school level education and on the use of technology in naturalistic (non-interventional) settings. Critical reflections are also cast on the methods used to conduct systematic reviews in the educational technology field.

ID COMPUTER-ASSISTED-INSTRUCTION; MEDICINE
AB Background: Principles in the field of cognitive psychology and problem-based learning together with recent progress in multimedia technologies are providing the basis for the development of case-based and computer-assisted learning systems. With reference to the information-overload of theoretical and factual knowledge in medical education these programs can be an efficient tool to satisfy the current need for new, practical, skill-related forms of knowledge transfer.
   Methods: Apple-Macintosh Computers were selected to develop interactive, multimedia patient-simulations on mitral stenosis, angina pectoris and myocardial infarction.
   Instructional aim and contents: The user acquires knowledge and skills about the leading symptoms, differential diagnoses, the use and analysis of laboratory examinations and the process of diagnostic reasoning while working through the computer-simulated cases.
   Pedagogical design and conclusion: Important pedagogical principles associated with computer-assisted learning were employed in the program. Clinical situations can be simulated repeatedly and for every student in an authentic manner. Therefore the program can serve as a preparation for and a supplement to practical clinical education. Compared to conventional teaching media the development of instructional multimedia software requires a tremendous amount of time and resources. Thus, controlled studies are important to objectify the overall advantages such programs can have.

AB There many times theoretically and evidently discussed that visualization is useful in science education process. By the change of education paradigms it is important to create theoretical model that could enclose all indicators proving the education success using externalized visual artifact. The created model is based on multimodal multidimensional visualisation, characterized by the great interactivity or simulation possibilities. According to it, students more actively learn independently and they construct knowledge by themselves. Learners learn to find information, to review it, to link it with the verbal one, to memorise and to rethink it in order to consolidate the knowledge. The student is constantly interacting with educational environment, where visual and verbal codes of information are applied, giving the greater possibility to construct, consolidate and inspect the knowledge. Using current model within the context of the post-modern paradigm of learning the pedagogue reveal oneself as the organizer of the educational process, the master, the advisor, the consultant becoming more free from speaking and explaining all the lesson. The pedagogue psychologically activates and encourages students. Multimodality of visualisation would help the educator to differentiate and individualize the educational content, to adapt it for students with heterogeneous needs by orienting not only to the discursive, but also to the visual transmission of information.

AB This article deals with the model of mathematics and computer science teachers' training based on the use of mathematical and didactic modeling methods of teaching. As a result of this, prospective teachers should show competence in interdisciplinary studies. This methodology is a special case of the concept of "problem-based learning" (PBL) in mathematics and computer science studies, as well as disciplines where mathematics is applied. The result of the study is that the implementation of interdisciplinary links creates a mental setting which is an effective tool for the development of informative interest of students in the learning process. This setting is based on the problems associated with activities in developing the model. The process of thinking is continuously accompanied by subjective emotions. Imposition of various "sensual" can lead to a change in the MS as a whole and give a boost (inspiration) to mental activity. In the study of educational process by means of MDM, we are required to consider the student and the teacher as constituent parts of the generated model. (C) 2016 Published by Future Academy.

AB While experience is often the best teacher, learning from precursors is much less painful. The aviation and health care industries have greatly benefited from proactively analyzing and developing measures to address sentinel events and learning from various data sources. Such reflective learning is typical of High Reliability Organizations (HROs) with strong learning cultures. As technology like Positive Train Control increasingly integrates into the rail industry, the resulting data they inevitably produce can provide a wealth of knowledge that can greatly improve safety if the data streams are well managed and not blindly mined. For example, simulators generate data while locomotive engineers use them. During training, such data can indicate weak points where the engineer can improve. Examining such data over multiple engineers can establish general areas of strengths and weaknesses among trainees where instructors can place more or less focus and develop better overall training options. Such data could potentially be used to improve cab design and establish how trains and cab care would operate along a given rail line. This paper will explore the use of data streams from various sources, including those currently used like injury reports, emerging ones like simulation training evaluations and data logs to develop better safety cultures within the rail industry.

AB Medical Imaging is a multidisciplinary field which combines the knowledge of physics, mathematics, electrical and computer engineering in order to create images of anatomy and function of the human body for clinical and research purposes. The necessity to know the techniques of Medical Imaging in clinical and research laboratories has made Medical Imaging a major training area in Biomedical Engineering. The tremendous amount of information and rapid changes in the medical imaging field require teaching material to be more flexible to fit into the available class hours. Internet/Web-based education is one of the tools with which education is popularly delivered. Web-based interactive teaching models increase students learning gain in the field of medical imaging. We have developed interactive simulations and animation of Nuclear medicine imaging. These learning applications provide an easy understanding of the physics, principles and methods behind nuclear medicine to successfully deliver information for students. We simulated PET physics; the diverse mathematical derivations for image generation, recognition and reconstruction, and the parameters that influence resolution in a PET camera. The metabolism rate of glucose using [18F] fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG) with 3 compartmental models has been simulated. Animation of the major processes and routes in PET Reporter Gene Imaging using animal subject was also performed.

AB A significant component of design pedagogy is the need to foster critical design thinking and to support students in understanding links between educational exercises and their potential application in professional design practice. Problem solving is central to design so it is also essential that students understand that there can be multiple solutions to a design brief, and are supported in creative experimentation and in generating imaginative outcomes. This article examines some innovative approaches to addressing these pedagogical needs. It investigates the effectiveness of pedagogical design incorporating the Immerse Lab, a three-wall projection room at an Australian university, as a learning context for design practice, for generating ideas and for supporting learning involving the comparative display of design outcomes. Anonymous student survey results revealed that the majority of students found learning in the Immerse Lab to be beneficial; comparative review more effective than in standard tutorial rooms; that the activity generated new ideas; it encouraged students to think differently about their designs; and it inspired students to develop their existing designs or create new ones. The project demonstrated that curricula involving immersive spaces can be effective in supporting engaging and relevant design pedagogy.

AB Following the rationale that learning is an active process of knowledge construction as well as enculturation in to a community of experts, we developed a novel web-based learning environment in bioinformatics for high school biology majors in Israel. The learning environment enables the learners to actively participate in a guided inquiry process by solving a problem in the context of authentic research in genetics. Through the learning environment, the learners are exposed to a genetics problem which was developed on the basis of research, in which mutated gene, which causes deafness, was identified. They follow, step by step, the way scientists try to solve it, using the current geneticists' toolbox. The environment uses an adapted version of the BLAST program (a bioinformatics tool which enables to find similarities between sequences), which was modified in a way that enables the teachers and students to use it easily. Using quantitative and qualitiative research approaches, we were able to show that-learning through the bioinformatics evironment promotes construction of new knowledge structures and influences students acquisition of a deeper and multidemensional understanding of the genetics domain. In addition, learning through the bioinformatics environment influences students' of the practices and scientific ways of thinking.

AB This article presents a role-play game for software project management (SPM) in a three-dimensional online multiuser virtual world. The Opensimulator platform is used for the creation of an immersive virtual environment that facilitates students' collaboration and realistic interaction, in order to manage unexpected events occurring during the development of a software project. Through the simulation of a real-life company, the game aims to enhance experiential learning of human-related issues, such as project team members' communication and collaboration, which are not easy to be taught through ordinary teaching methods. Roles are assigned to the participating students, who have to overcome problems initiated by non-player-units (software controlled units) while collaborating with other students and the instructor. The instructor, holding a key role in the game, is able to observe the players, intervene and dynamically alter specific game scenario parameters adapting to player encounter difficulties. The environment is combining the experience of a typical game (based on an event-driven SPM scenario and interaction with non-player-units), with the experience of a virtual world (interacting with other players) and has been positively evaluated by the participants regarding the overall game experience and the learning effect.

ID REPRESENTATIONS
AB The purposes of this article are to present the design of a technology-enhanced learning environment (Air Pollution Modeling Environment [APoME]) that was informed by a novice-expert analysis and to discuss high school students' development of modelling practices in the learning environment. APoME was designed to help high school students understand that air quality is the result of complex interactions among air pollutants, topographic effects, and meteorological variables. Using a novice-expert analysis, my research team specified atmospheric scientists' modelling practices as learning objectives, designed a dynamic modelling tool in light of the knowledge bases of scientists and students, provided students with dynamic simulations to help them visualise complex processes, and designed learning activities to encourage model-based reasoning. One teacher and 29 10th-graders participated in an implementation study that examined students' conceptual understandings and modelling practices in APoME. The results show that students' understandings about air quality were significantly improved after they engaged in the APoME activities. Students designed plans with detailed procedures, identified more major variables relevant to air pollutant dispersion, carefully controlled and manipulated variables to test their model, and provided multiple ways for data collection. These findings suggest that APoME is effective in supporting students to demonstrate expert-like modelling practices.
