AB This study addresses the group controllability of continuous-time multi-agent systems. The problem is investigated in the leaderless framework where the whole group is consisted of a number of dynamic agents with autonomous capability, which can complete the large-scale complex task through local interaction and can be divided into some subgroups. This study concentrates on the group controllability problems of continuous-time multi-agent systems, gives the general definition of the group controllability, and establishes group controllability criteria. Sufficient and necessary conditions are derived for the group controllability of continuous-time multi-agent systems. Finally, the numerical example and simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB Consensus problems, as basic topics in distributed coordination of multi-agent systems, have drawn a great deal of attention from different research fields. Generally, consensus refers to the asymptotic convergence of state variables of all agents with time evolution. In this paper, a concept on partial component consensus in multi-agent system is first given, which is a weaker dynamic behavior of group than the consensus in general, and then the problem of partial component consensus in leader-following first-order multi-agent system with the directed network topology is discussed. By designing an appropriate pinning control protocol and building corresponding error system, partial component consensus in multiagent system is transformed into the partial variable stability of the error system. Using matrix theory and stability theory, a sufficient condition is given to realize partial component consensus in multi-agent system. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB In this paper, the group consensus problems of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with fixed and switching topologies are investigated. First, a class of distributed group consensus protocol is proposed for achieving the group consensus of heterogeneous multi-agent systems by using the neighbours' information. Then, some corresponding sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the achievement of group consensus. Rigorous proofs are given by using graph theory, matrix theory and Lyapunov theory. Finally, numerical simulations are also given to verify the theoretical analysis.

AB In this study, a new formation behavior problem for second-order multi-agent systems with time delay is investigated in the presence of antagonistic interactions. We first proposed a formation behavior protocol with time delay for each agent in the antagonistic network. Then, by a frequency-domain analysis, a sufficient and necessary condition is derived to guarantee the consensus stability of the multi-agent system. It is shown that the agents in the same group form their own desired formation while keeping a desired relative position with other groups. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the obtained results.

AB Although distributed computing is necessary to execute massively multi-agent applications, the distribution of agents is challenging especially when the communication patterns among agents are continuously changing. This paper proposes two adaptive agent allocation mechanisms for massively multi-agent applications: one mechanism aims at minimizing agent communication cost, while the other mechanism attempts to prevent overloaded computer nodes from negatively affecting overall performance. We synthesize these two mechanisms in a multiagent framework called Adaptive Actor Architecture (AAA). In AAA, each agent platform monitors the workload of its computer node and the communication patterns of agents executing on it. An agent platform periodically reallocates agents according to their communication localities. When an agent platform is overloaded, the platform migrates a set of agents, which have more intra-group communication than inter-group or inter-node communication, to a lightly loaded agent platform. These adaptive agent allocation mechanisms are developed as fully distributed algorithms, and they move the selected agents as a group. In order to evaluate these mechanisms, preliminary experimental results with large-scale micro UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) simulations are described.

DE Multi-Agents Systems; Petri Nets; Self-Organisation; Social Theories
AB This contribution summarises the core results of the transdisciplinary ASKO project, part of the German DFG's programme Sozionik, which combines sociologists' and computer scientists' skills in order to create improved theories and models of artificial societies. Our research group has (a) formulated a social theory, which is able to explain fundamental mechanisms of self-organisation in both natural and artificial societies, (b) modelled this in a mathematical way using a visual formalism, and (c) developed a novel multi-agent system architecture which is conceptually coherent, recursively structured (hence non-eclectic) and based on our social theory. The article presents an outline of both a sociological middle-range theory of social self-organisation in educational institutions, its formal, Petri net based model, including a simulation of one of its main mechanisms, and the multi-agent system architecture SONAR. It describes how the theory was created by a re-analysis of some grand social theories, by grounding it empirically, and finally how the theory was evaluated by modelling its concepts and statements.

AB The study of social norms is one of the most active topics studied by researchers from several areas such as multiagent systems, economics, or social science. Self-organizing systems have taken social norms as a mechanism that distribute the self-governance tasks to all their members. This thesis tackles the problem of analyzing the specific conditions that catalyze the imposition on a certain pre-existing norm. We have taken a cross-methodological approach where we combine theory from complex systems, agent-based social simulation, empirical laboratory experiments with humans and behavioural modelling for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of social norms in virtual societies.

In the simulation, travelers are divided into three groups first,and then links, intersections and travelers are treated as agents respectively. Three different experiments, namely traveling scales, traveler groups and network structure experiments, are carried out by the simulation. Through comparing and analyzing the simulation results from the perspectives of system scale and structure,we try to find and explain the macroscopic phenomena and the possible emergence phenomena coming from the microscopic level in urban transportation system.

AB A group of agents can be used to perform patrolling tasks in a variety of domains ranging from computer network administration to computer wargame simulations. Despite its wide range of potential applications, multiagent architectures for patrolling have not been studied in depth yet. First state of the art approaches used to deal with related problems cannot be easily adapted to the patrolling task specificity. Second, the existing patrolling-specific approaches are still in preliminary stages. In this paper, we present an original in-depth discussion of multi-agent patrolling task issues, as well as an empirical evaluation of possible solutions. In order to accomplish this study we have proposed different architectures of multi-agent systems, various evaluation criteria, two experimental scenarios, and we have implemented a patrolling simulator. The results show which kind of architecture can patrol an area more adequately according to the circumstances.

AB In this paper, an adaptive protocol is proposed to solve the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with high-order nonlinear dynamics by using neural networks (NNs) to approximate the unknown nonlinear system functions. It is derived that all agents achieve consensus if the undirected interaction graph is connected, and the transient performance of the multi-agent system is also investigated. It shows that the adaptive protocol and the consensus analysis can be easily extended to switching networks by the existing LaSalle's Invariance Principle of switched systems. A numerical simulation illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocol. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley and Sons Asia Pte Ltd and Chinese Automatic Control Society

AB In this paper, a multi-consensus problem for networked multi-agent systems in a weighted and directed graph with a nonlinear protocol is investigated. By using convergence theory, matrix theory and the method of Lyapunov functions, a sufficient condition for the networked multi-agent systems to achieve multi-consensus is derived. And the agreement of each group is studied. A feedback controller for the networked multi-agent systems is then designed to drive the system to achieve multi-consensus. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB In this paper, we investigate the group consensus for leaderless multi-agent systems. The group consensus protocol based on the position information from neighboring agents is designed. The network may be subjected to frequent cyberattacks, which is close to an actual case. The cyber-attacks are assumed to be recoverable. By utilizing algebraic graph theory, linear matrix inequality (LMI) and Lyapunov stability theory, the multi-agent systems can achieve group consensus under the proposed control protocol. The sufficient conditions of the group consensus for the multi-agent networks subjected to cyber-attacks are given. Furthermore, the results are extended to the consensus issue of multiple subgroups with cyber-attacks. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB In this paper, the fixed-time group tracking problem for multi-agent systems with unknown inherent nonlinear dynamics is studied. A distributed tracking control protocol is introduced to ensure that the follower agents in each subgroup can track their respective leaders in a prescribed time regardless of the initial conditions. Compared with the existing works on group (tracking) consensus, we do not require the inter-group balance condition, and the leaders are allowed to interact with follower agents in different subgroups. Some conditions have been derived to choose appropriate control gains to achieve the fixed-time group tracking. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the availability of our results.

AB Controllability is a fundamental issue concerning control of multi-agent networks and a very important research topic in the modeling, analysis and coordination control of multi-agent systems, Group controllability problem. is a further extension of the controllability problem of the general multi-agent systems, which mainly studies the cooperation and control of multi-agent systems with multiple. sub-groups or multiple intelligence clusters., Comparing with the controllability of the general multi:agent systems, the group controllability is not only to consider the information interaction among the groups, but also to, consider.-the information interaction between different groups, which makes the system reflect the effect of a whole and also the internal,structure of the sub-groups. This paper addresses the group controllability problems of discrete-time multi-agent systems with time-delay, in which both switching topology and fixed topology are considered. This paper also proposes the general definition of the group controllability, as well as establishes group controllability criteria from the algebraic and graphical perspectives. Numerical examples and simulations are proposed to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2016 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is concerned with the second-order consensus problem of multi-agent systems with a virtual leader, where all agents and the virtual leader share the same intrinsic dynamics with a locally Lipschitz condition. It is assumed that only a small fraction of agents in the group are informed about the position and velocity of the virtual leader. A connectivity-preserving adaptive controller is proposed to ensure the consensus of multi-agent systems, wherein no information about the nonlinear dynamics is needed. Moreover, it is proved that the consensus can be reached globally with the proposed control strategy if the degree of the nonlinear dynamics is smaller than some analytical value. Numerical simulations are further provided to illustrate the theoretical results. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB As utility calculus cannot account for an important part of agents'. behaviour in Multi-Agent Systems, researchers have progressively adopted a more normative approach. Unfortunately, social laws have turned out to be too restrictive in real-life domains where autonomous agents' activity cannot be completely specified in advance. The idea of Rights is a halfway concept between anarchic and off-line constrained interaction. Rights improve coordination and facilitate social action in Multi-Agent domains, they allow agents enough freedom, and at the same time constrain them (prohibiting specific actions). So far rights have not been tested or proven experimentally. We are comparing experimentally the three mentioned interaction architectures in the domain of agent-based traffic simulation.

ID DESIRE
AB Much research concerning the design of multi-agent systems (at a conceptual level) addresses complex agents that exhibit complex interaction patterns. Due to this complexity, it is difficult to perform rigorous experimentation. On the other hand, systematic experimental work regarding behaviour of societies of more simple agents, while reporting valuable results, often lacks conceptual specification of the system under consideration. In this paper, the compositional multi-agent modelling framework DESIRE is not only successfully used to develop a conceptual specification of the simple agents discussed by A. Cesta, M. Miceli and P. Rizzo (Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence, vol. 1038, Springer-Verlag: Berlin, pp. 128-138, 1996), but also to simulate the behaviour in a dynamical environment. In the DESIRE framework, a conceptual specification, which provides a high-level view of an agent, has enough detail for automatic prototype generation. The prototype implementation of the conceptual specification of the simple agents has been used to replicate, and extend, one of the experiments reported by Cesta et al.

AB This paper investigates the second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems subject to the cluster-delay consensus. The multi-agent systems consist of leader and agents, whose dynamics are second-order nonlinear. The objective is that the agents track the leader asymptotically with different time delays, i.e., the agents in different groups reach delay consensus, while the agents in the same group reach identical consensus. To guarantee the cluster-delay consensus for the second-order multi-agent systems, a new control protocol is proposed. Then some corresponding conditions for cluster-delay consensus are derived by using Lyapunov directed method and matrix theory. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis results are verified by some numerical simulations.

AB There are Numerous researches in the fields of social sciences and multi-agent systems that are dedicated to studying the role of diversity vs. individual capabilities in design and performance of human and artificial societies. This paper addresses more complex multi-level structures, namely holarchies, in multi-agent systems, and conducts several analyses on the effect of individuals' behavioral diversities in the constitution and performance of the whole system. The hypothesis is that diversity directly affects the structure and performance of a holonic organization. In order to check this, we first proposed a diversity-based holonic model for multi-agent systems and then carried out a set of simulations in which a holonic multi-agent system is employed in a function optimization application. In these simulations, we manipulated the behavioral diversity of the agents in various ways and carefully observed the changes that occur on the effectiveness of the system. These observations include the quality of solutions, the height and composition of the constructed systems, and the time efficiency of the model. The empirical results show that as the diversity of intra-holon agents increases, the height of holarchy is reduced while the sizes of the holons tend to increase. On the other hand, this increase in diversity results in an increase in the performance of the system in situations that diversity of the initial population is high. However, when the diversity of the initial population is low, the diversities inside the holons need to be adjusted around 60 percent in order to boost the performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Multi-agent systems have been used for fifteen years to simulate the dynamics of social phenomena. They help conceptualize interactions between an organized set of agents and to explore the structures that emerge through the formalization of complex situations where heterogeneous agents operate at various levels. This paper presents and discusses a framework of thought which articulates the relevant fields (empirical, conceptual, model) in a general way, and in the case of multi-agent systems. It then develops an analytical framework to capture the various uses of these systems, exploring in particular the methodological opposition between parsimonious models (KISS) and descriptive models (KIDS), which in fact reflect different stages in scientific investigation. Finally, it uses this framework and grid to analyse several examples from sociology, economics and geography (residential segregation, educational inequality, the emergence of norms, market operation, urban hierarchy) and concludes with methodological proposals based on an abductive approach to the use of multi-agent systems in social science.

AB This article addresses a formal model of a distributed computation multi-agent system. This model has evolved from the experimental research on using multi-agent systems as a ground for developing fuzzy cognitive maps. The main paper contribution is a distributed computation multi-agent system definition and mathematical formalization based on automata theory. This mathematical formalization is tested by developing distributed computation multi-agent systems for fuzzy cognitive maps and artificial neural networks - two typical distributed computation systems. Fuzzy cognitive maps are distributed computation systems used for qualitative modeling and behavior simulation, while artificial neural networks are used for modeling and simulating complex systems by creating a non-linear statistical data model. An artificial neural network encapsulates in its structure data patterns that are hidden in the data used to create the network. Both of these systems are well suited for formal model testing. We have used evolutionary incremental development as an agent design method which has shown to be a good approach to develop multi-agent systems according to the formal model of a distributed computation multi-agent system.

ID CLUSTER SYNCHRONIZATION; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB In this paper, the problems of group consensus for linearly coupled multi-agent networks including first-order and second-order are investigated, respectively. Based on the Laplacian matrix associated with the weighted adjacency matrix of the system, we present two novel linear protocols which can exactly reflect the interactive influence between the agents of the multi-agent network. Instead of relying on other conservative assumptions presented by the majority of the relevant research works, some promising criteria which can guarantee the reaching of group consensus of the multi-agent network are also obtained analytically. In addition, we also extend our work to study the group consensus for the multi-agent network with generally connected topology which neither needs to be strongly connected nor needs to contain a directed spanning tree. The conclusion that we have obtained should be more representative. Finally, the validity and correctness of our theoretical results are verified by several numerical simulated examples.

ID TRACKING CONTROL
AB This paper studies the event-triggered fault-tolerant control problem of nonlinear multiagent systems. The goal is to ensure the stability of event-based sampling multi-agent systems when the actuator faults occurs. The neural networks approximate property is used to approximate unknown ideal control parameters, which can reduce the exact requirements of control parameters. Based on the states information of neighboring agents, a distributed fault-tolerant consensus controller is designed for the leaderless multi-agent systems. Moreover, an event-triggered mechanism with special definition of event-triggered error is applied to reduce the amount of communications. In addition, the Zeno behaviour is avoided. By using Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that all signals are bounded in the closed-loop systems. Finally, a numerical simulation result is presented to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB The combination of multi-agent technology and reinforcement learning methods has been recognized as an effective way which is used in path planning-based crowd simulation. However, the existing solution is still not satisfactory due to the problem in the mutual influence of agents. Therefore, an improved multi-agent reinforcement learning method (IMARL algorithm) is introduced. In this method, the intersection of the pedestrian trajectory extracted from the real video is first used as the state space for reinforcement learning. The crowd is grouped and the leader is selected. A bulletin board is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm of multi-agent to store the empirical knowledge of the learning process, and the navigation agent passes information between the leader and the bulletin board. The original social force model was improved, and the cohesive force of visual factors was added to the force formula. The IMARL algorithm is combined with the improved social force model for crowd evacuation simulation. Using a two-layer control mechanism, the leader in the upper layer uses the decision process based on the IMARL algorithm to select the path, and the individuals in the bottom group use the improved social force model to evacuate. The method of this paper not only solves the dimensionality disaster problem of reinforcement learning but also improves the convergence speed. The evacuation efficiency is effectively improved in crowd evacuation simulation experiments. In addition, it can also provide specific guidance scheme for crowd evacuation improvement and assistant decision support for the prevention and management of large-scale group trampling incidents.

ID SIMULATED ANNEALING ALGORITHM; GENETIC ALGORITHM; RANDOM KEY; SEARCH
AB In this paper, a multi-agent optimization algorithm (MAOA) is proposed for solving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In the MAOA, multiple agents work in a grouped environment where each agent represents a feasible solution. The evolution of agents is achieved by using four main elements in the MAOA, including social behavior, autonomous behavior, self-learning, and environment adjustment. The social behavior includes the global one and the local one for performing exploration. Through the global social behavior, the leader agent in every group is guided by the global best leader. Through the local social behavior, each agent is guided by its own leader agent. Through the autonomous behavior, each agent exploits its own neighborhood. Through the self-learning, the best agent performs an intensified search to further exploit the promising region. Meanwhile, some agents perform migration among groups to adjust the environment dynamically for information sharing. The implementation of the MAOA for solving the RCPSP is presented in detail, and the effect of key parameters of the MAOA is investigated based on the Taguchi method of design of experiment. Numerical testing results are provided by using three sets of benchmarking instances. The comparisons to the existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MAOA for solving the RCPSP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article studies a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm based on agent action prediction. In multi-agent system, the action of learning agent selection is inevitably affected by the action of other agents, so the reinforcement learning system needs to consider the joint state and joint action of multi-agent based on this. In addition, the application of this method in the cooperative strategy learning of soccer robot is studied, so that the multi-agent system can pass through the environment. To realize the division of labour and cooperation of multi-robots, the interactive learning is used to master the behaviour strategy. Combined with the characteristics of decision-making of soccer robot, this article analyses the role transformation and experience sharing of multi-agent reinforcement learning, and applies it to the local attack strategy of soccer robot, uses this algorithm to learn the action selection strategy of the main robot in the team, and uses Matlab platform for simulation verification. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the research method, and the superiority of the proposed method is validated compared with some simple methods.

ID MODEL
AB Many exciting, emerging applications require that a group of agents share a coherent view of the world given spatial distribution, incomplete and uncertain sensors, and communication constraints. This article describes an analysis and design methodology for distributed algorithms that coordinate the exchange of information for extremely large groups of agents maintaining a coherent belief in some environment property. The design methodology uses the tools of statistical mechanics to create a probability distribution which relates groupings of agents, called Sharing Groups, to pair-wise agent divergences and social temperature. Social temperature is a decision parameter, the same for all agents, that agents use probabilistically to decide when to join a Sharing Group. We show empirically as well as via Monte-Carlo simulations that for a critical value of social temperature the Sharing Groups formed result in bandwidth efficiency and divergence from ground truth that is simultaneously optimal independent of the method of information exchange.

AB In studies about office arrangements that have individuals working from remote locations, researchers usually hypothesize advantages for collocators and disadvantages for remote workers. However, empirical findings have not shown consistent support for the hypothesis. We suspect that there are unintended consequences of collocation, which can offset well-recognized advantages of being collocated. To explain these unintended consequences, we developed a multi-agent model to complement our laboratory-based experiment. In the lab, collocated subjects did not perform better than the remote even though collocators had faster communication channels and in-group favor towards each other. Results from the multi-agent simulation suggested that in-group favoritism among collocators caused them to ignore some important resource exchange opportunities with remote individuals. Meanwhile, communication delay of remote subjects protected them from some falsely biased perception of resource availability. The two unintended consequences could offset the advantage of being collocated and diminish performance differences between collocators and remote workers. Results of this study help researchers and practitioners recognize the hidden costs of being collocated. They also demonstrate the value of coupling lab experiments with multi-agent simulation.

AB Multi-carrier energy systems have received wide attentions due their flexibility and sustainable characteristics. Although these systems show significant efficiency in providing and consuming energy, the performance of the whole system can be degraded owing to uncertainties arising from different sources. This paper presents a stochastic decentralized model for considering the uncertainties of a system including different types of thermal and electrical private loads using a multi-agent framework. In other words, agents have private ownership and seek for social welfare as well as optimized personal profits. In the proposed model, the gradient projection method is used to implement a fully-decentralize energy trading model. Also, various stochastic scenarios of solar irradiance, prices, and loads are considered using the fast-forward selection algorithm to take into account the uncertainties. Then, to assess the proposed stochastic multi-agent model, "AnyLogic" is used for conducting the simulation studies. The numerical results show that the clearing price is directly affected by the renewable agent without any supervisory control. Moreover, the total operating cost of the considered multi-carrier energy system decreases by similar to 7 % considering these uncertainties compared with a deterministic one. However, social welfare declines due to the intrinsically beneficial behavior in private cooperation.

The leaders are particular agents playing a part in external inputs to steer other member agents. The followers can arrive at any predetermined configuration by regulating the behaviors of the leaders.

AB Event-triggered control has been recently proposed as an effective strategy for the consensus of multi-agent systems. We present an improved distributed event-triggered control scheme that remedies a shortcoming of some previous event-triggered control schemes in the literature. This improved distributed event-triggered method has no need for continuously monitoring each agent' neighbors. Moreover, each agent in the multi-agent systems will not exhibit the Zeno behavior. Numerical simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus control.

AB Practical aerial swarm applications are limited by the need to provide fast, robust feedback. To consider how biological agents incorporate visual feedback in multiagent environments, this study extends a well-developed model of bioinspired visual feedback for individual agent to feedback in multiagent dynamic environments. A multiagent visual model is developed and analyzed for an individual agent operating in a group of other agents. The theoretical model indicates a stable equilibrium trajectory within the neighboring agents. When a minority of agents conducting bioinspired visual feedback are introduced into a planar swarm simulation, results show robustness of agents to perturbations from reference condition. The bioinspired feedback rule is implemented experimentally using ground microbots for two cases identified by a theoretical observability condition. The experimental performance of the single agent in an established swarm is consistent with the theoretical stability and observability predictions. The results indicate insect visuomotor response can help participate in established swarms, and indicate the importance of optic flow input in maintaining group motion.

AB In a competitive electricity market, suppliers seek the optimal bidding strategy, maximising their individual profit. Due to the uncertainties, unknown parameters and dynamics of electricity market, the optimal bidding strategies cannot be attained through straightforward optimisation methods. In this study, the supply function equilibrium model is considered together with uniform price market clearing mechanism. The interaction among suppliers is modelled as an incomplete information game problem and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is utilised to find the optimal bidding strategy of the suppliers in a non-cooperative game. The proposed framework is an extension, from single agent Markov decision process to Markov game process, which is suitable for studying multi-agent decision making problems in stochastic environments. In this study, a Markov game model of the electricity market is proposed and a new state-action and Markov model of electricity market is proposed to built up the MARL environment. In addition, a learning-based non-cooperative MARL method is utilised for learning the optimal bidding strategies of the suppliers in a day-ahead electricity market. The proposed method is successfully applied to IEEE-30-bus power system. To examine the statistical significance of the results, the T-test method is applied to compare the competitive behaviour of the players in both multi- and single-agent frameworks.

A distributed formation control algorithm is proposed for each agent to realize the antagonistic formation motion. A sufficient condition is derived to ensure that all of the agents make an antagonistic formation motion in a distributed manner. It is shown that all of the agents can be spontaneously divided into several groups and that agents in the same group collaborate while agents in different groups compete. Finally, a numerical simulation is included to demonstrate our theoretical results.

The aim of the vehicles is to achieve circular motion around a virtual reference beacon. A control law is proposed, which guarantees global asymptotic stability of the circular motion with a prescribed direction of rotation, in the case of a single vehicle. Equilibrium configurations of the multi-vehicle system are studied and sufficient conditions for their local stability are given, in terms of the control law design parameters. Practical issues related to sensory limitations are taken into account. The transient behavior of the multi-vehicle system is analyzed via numerical simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ROBOT NAVIGATION; MOTION; MODEL; DYNAMICS
AB We present a navigation planning framework for dynamic, multi-agent environments, where no explicit communication takes place among agents. Inspired by the collaborative nature of human navigation, our approach encodes the concept of coordination into an agent's decision making through an inference mechanism about collaborative strategies of collision avoidance. Each such strategy represents a distinct avoidance protocol, prescribing a distinct class of navigation behaviors to agents. We model such classes as equivalence classes of multi-agent path topology, using the formalism of topological braids. This formalism may naturally encode any arbitrarily complex, spatiotemporal, multi-agent behavior, in any environment with any number of agents into a compact representation of dual algebraic and geometric nature. This enables us to construct a probabilistic inference mechanism that predicts the collective strategy of avoidance among multiple agents, based on observation of agents' past behaviors. We incorporate this mechanism into an online planner that enables an agent to understand a multi-agent scene and determine an action that not only contributes progress towards its destination, but also reduction of the uncertainty of other agents regarding the agent's role in the emerging strategy of avoidance. This is achieved by picking actions that compromise between energy efficiency and compliance with everyone's inferred avoidance intentions. We evaluate our approach by comparing against a greedy baseline that only maximizes individual efficiency. Simulation results of statistical significance demonstrate that our planner results in a faster uncertainty decrease that facilitates the decision-making process of co-present agents. The algorithm's performance highlights the importance of topological reasoning in decentralized, multi-agent planning and appears promising for real-world applications in crowded human environments.

AB This paper addresses multi-agent control under an environment where both agent-to-agent communication and one-to-all broadcast are available. The problem studied here is a consensus problem for a pre-specified location, i.e. collecting the agents at a desired location in an n-dimensional space, with a limited communication range and an unlimited broadcast range, which is a nice example to be solved under the mixed environment. For solving this, we first introduce a concept of the connected agent group. Using this notion, the problem is reduced to a consensus problem for the group-to-group relation and that for the agent-to-agent relation in the groups, from which we derive a controller achieving the consensus with probability 1. Finally, the performance of the proposed controller is demonstrated by numerical simulation.

AB This paper addresses the group-delay consensus of second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems by piecewise adaptive pinning control in part of time interval. The topology of the networked system is assumed to be directed and weakly connected. The agents in each group can be classified into three subsets, which are inter-act agent, intra-act agent with zero in-degree and the other agents. According to the agents' property and intrinsic dynamics, the protocol is designed to guarantee that agents in the same group reach consensus, and the agents in different groups reach group-delay consensus. By using Lyapunov stability theory, graph theory and matrix theory, some consensus criteria are derived in the form of matrix inequalities. At last, a numerical simulation is also given to verify the correctness of theoretical analysis. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We analyze a general model of multi-agent communication in which all agents communicate simultaneously to a message board. A genetic algorithm is used to evolve multi-agent languages for the predator agents in a version of the predator-prey pursuit problem. We show that the resulting behavior of the communicating multi-agent system is equivalent to that of a Mealy finite state machine whose states are determined by the agents' usage of the evolved language. Simulations show that the evolution of a communication language improves the performance of the predators. Increasing the language size (and thus increasing the number of possible states in the Mealy machine) improves the performance even further. Furthermore, the evolved communicating predators perform significantly better than all previous work on similar prey. We introduce a method for incrementally increasing the language size, which results in an effective coarse-to-fine search that significantly reduces the evolution time required to find a solution. We present some observations on the effects of language size, experimental setup, and prey difficulty on the evolved Mealy machines. In particular, we observe that the start state is often revisited, and incrementally increasing the language size results in smaller Mealy machines. Finally, a simple rule is derived that provides a pessimistic estimate on the minimum language size that should be used for any multi-agent problem.

AB In this study, a novel adaptive neural network (NN)-based leader-following consensus approach is proposed for a class of non-linear second-order multi-agent systems. For the existing NN consensus approaches, to obtain the desired approximation accuracy, the NN-based adaptive consensus algorithms require the number of NN nodes to must be large enough, and thus the online computation burden often are very heavy. However, the proposed adaptive consensus scheme can greatly reduce the online computation burden, because the adaptive adjusting parameters are designed in scalar form, which is the norm of the estimation of the optimal NN weight matrix. According to Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed approach can guarantee the leader-following consensus behaviour of non-linear second-order multi-agent systems to be obtained. Finally, a numerical simulation and a multi-manipulator simulation are carried out to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed consensus approach.

AB In this study, the distributed event-triggered consensus problem in multi-agent systems with non-linear protocols is discussed. In the proposed strategies, each agent adopts a local control based on a combination of non-linear functions of relative states, and the couplings among agents are not necessarily symmetric and constant. By using a graph-theoretical-reasoning based Lyapunov function, the authors present two kinds of distributed event-triggered strategies, namely state-dependent and time-dependent strategies. Through the transmission of states at discrete instants, the former can simultaneously reduce the updates of both control and communication. By virtue of global information such as the path between arbitrary two agents, the latter can decide the updating time sequence for each agent by its own state and a given time-dependent function. In both cases, a positive lower bound for inter-event times can be found such that the Zeno behaviour is eliminated. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the above two strategies.

AB Human societies appear in many types of simulations. Particularly, a lot of new computer games contain a virtual world that imitates the real world. A few of the most important and the most difficult society elements to be modelled are the social context and individuals cooperation. In this paper we show how the social context and cooperation ability can be provided using agents that are equipped with internal visions of mutual social relations. Internal vision is a representation of social relations from the agent's point of view so, due to being subjective, it may be inconsistent with the reality. We introduce the agent model and the mechanism of rebuilding the agent's internal vision that is similar to that used by humans. An experimental proof of concept implementation is also presented.

AB In this paper, group consensus of multi-agent systems with cooperative-competitive interaction and communication delay is investigated in switching topologies networks. The delta operator method and linear matrix inequality technique are used to establish the criteria on group consensus of this system. Combined with the stability theory, some sufficient conditions are given to guard the success of the group consensus of the multi-agent systems with switching topologies. Using this method, the problem of group consensus can be transformed into determining the globally asymptotically stable of a system with communication delay. The results can be applied to two situations on faults and communication delay without meeting the in-degree balance condition or spanning tree of part topologies. Several numeric simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper proposes a coverage problem of multi-agent systems, in which a group of agents enter a given region at different times and are required to cover the given region cooperatively. The focus of this paper is to solve the coverage problem of multi-agent systems with a non-convex optimization approach. By introducing appropriate assumptions, a gradient-based control law is designed based on the information of the previous stage agents. However, the performance index of each stage is nonlinear and generally non-convex and may have multiple local optima to which a gradient may converge. Thus, an effective boosting function, which is used to prevent the non-convex optimization problem getting into local optimum, is shown. It is proved in the sense of Lyapunov that the global coverage for the multi-agent systems with different entry time for coming into the given region can be achieved. Numerical simulations with cooperative control of industries subsystems show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB In this paper, group multiple lags consensus of fractional-order leader-following multi-agent systems with nonlinear dynamics are investigated, in which two kinds of lag consensus are considered. One is said to be outergroup lag consensus, which means that different group leaders reach lag consensus. The other one is called innergroup lag consensus, that is to say, the followers will reach lag consensus with their own group leader. Based on Mittag-Leffler stability for fractional-order systems, algebraic graph theory, a class of novel control protocols is designed and the corresponding sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the achievement of group multiple lags consensus. Furthermore, considering parametric uncertainties, an adaptive control technology is employed to solve the group multiple lags consensus for fractional order multi-agent systems, and the corresponding adaptive control protocols and sufficient conditions are proposed. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.

AB This paper investigates the finite-time optimal formation problem of multi-agent systems on the Lie group SE(3), for the situation when the formation time and/or the cost function need to be considered. Under the condition that the formation time is given according to the task requirement, a finite-time optimal formation controller is proposed for the two-agent case to guarantee that the desired formation is achieved at the given time and the corresponding cost function is optimal. For the systems with multiple agents, the obtained finite-time optimal formation control law has second-order approximation accuracy. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Inspired by the fact that in most existing swarm models of multi-agent systems the velocity of an agent can be infinite, which is not in accordance with the real applications, we propose a novel swarm model of multi-agent systems where the velocity of an agent is finite. The Lyapunov function method and LaSalle's invariance principle are employed to show that by using the proposed model all of the agents eventually enter into a bounded region around the swarm center and finally tend to a stationary state. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The artificial market, named TEMMAS (The Electricity Market Multi-Agent Simulator), explores the integration of two design constructs: (i) the specification of the environmental physical market properties and (ii) the specification of the decision-making (deliberative) and reactive agents. TEMMAS is materialized in an experimental setup involving distinct power generator companies that operate in the market and search for the trading strategies that best exploit their generating units' resources. The experimental results show a coherent market behavior that emerges from the overall simulated environment. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB After reviewing numerous theories and experiments, our research adopted the field-theoretical deductive approach to shed new light on complex social systems as coherent neurodynamic processes taking place in individual minds. In this interdisciplinary study, we have outlined some general fundamental design principles of the field-theoretical view of the oscillating agent as well as of coherent social systems. From the systems point of view, ordered social systems by their own intrinsic nature are interpreted as coherent activations via the mind-field medium of social agents. Consequently, this study not only provides the major conceptual assumptions of the proposed (Oscillation-Based Multi-Agent System [OSIMAS]) paradigm but also presents an electroencephalography-based inductive experimental validation framework and some empirical results to validate major OSIMAS assumptions. Based on the conceptual and experimental findings, we constructed modelling framework and presented oscillations-based micro (coupled oscillator energy exchange model) and macro (MEPSM1) simulation models. We also systemized some other studies and applications, which are most relevant to the work presented here.

A discrete-time protocol is designed to solve the L 1 group consensus problems via general stochastic inputs. Under some mild assumptions, we derive sufficient conditions to guarantee the L 1 group consensus based on algebraic graph theory and ergodicity theory for finite Markov chains. Moreover, the boundedness of the expected infinite sum of the inputs ensures the boundedness of the expected trajectory. Numerical simulations instantiating the inputs as varied independent and identically distributed random processes as well as autoregressive processes are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

A typical event is defined as some error signals exceeding a given threshold. By applying Lyapunov functional approach and skills of computing function limit, consensus of the controlled multi-agent systems can be reached asymptotically. Meanwhile, the event-triggered algorithm can exclude Zeno behaviours. Finally, a numerical simulation is exploited to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical result.

DT Article
AB In open multi-agent systems, agents are mobile and may leave or enter the system. This dynamicity results in two closely related agent communication problems, namely, efficient message passing and service agent discovery. This paper describes how these problems are addressed in the Actor Architecture (AA). Agents in AA obey the operational semantics of actors, and the architecture is designed to support large-scale open multi-agent systems. Efficient message passing is facilitated by the use of dynamic names: a part of the mobile agent name is a function of the platform that currently hosts the agent. To facilitate service agent discovery, middle agents support application agent-oriented matchmaking and brokering services. The middle agents may accept search objects to enable customization of searches; this reduces communication overhead in discovering service agents when the matching criteria are complex. The use of mobile search objects creates a security threat, as codes developed by different groups may be moved to the same middle agent. This threat is mitigated by restricting which operations a migrated object is allowed to perform. We describes an empirical evaluation of these ideas using a large scale multi-agent UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) simulation that was developed using AA.

A distributed event-triggered strategy is proposed to utilize in fractional multi-agent systems, under which the network can achieve consensus. Also, Zeno behavior can be precluded to ensure the feasibility of the devised event-triggered strategy. Furthermore, in order to avoid keeping track of the measurement errors continuously, a self-triggered strategy is designed, in which the next update time instant of each agent can be computed by using its local history state information. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to indicate the validity of the devised control strategies.

AB In this paper, the problem of formation control is studied for second-order multi-agent systems with practical issues like mismatched uncertainties and obstacle avoidance. A reference correction algorithm based sliding mode control scheme is proposed to ensure the boundedness of each agent's position tracking error. Both disturbance observer and artificial potential field are implemented to first tackle the problem of obstacle avoidance with the existence of mismatched uncertainties. The unreachable reference scenarios are then defined to describe the passive correcting behaviours of the multi-agent system when agents are trying to avoid obstacles. A distributed reference correction algorithm is developed for each agent to attenuate the harmful effects of passive correcting behaviours. The effectiveness of obstacle avoidance and boundedness of position tracking error are both verified by Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, multi-robot system based numerical simulations and comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and controller.

AB An electric vehicle (EV) centred ecosystem has not yet been formed, the existing limited statistic data are far from enough for the analysis of EV users' travel and charge behaviors, which however tends to be affected by many certain and uncertain factors. An experimental economics (EE) based simulation method can be used to analyze the behaviors of key participants in a system. However, it is restricted by the system size, experimental site and the number of qualified human participants. Therefore, this method is hard to be adopted for the behavioral analysis of a large number of human participants. In this paper, a new method combining a questionnaire statistics and the EE-based simulation is proposed. The causal relationship is considered in the design of the questionnaires and data extraction, then a multi-agent modeling integration method is introduced in the EE-based simulation, which enables the integration of causal/statistical/behavioral models into the multi-agent framework to reflect the EV users' travel willingness statistically. The generated multi-agents are used to replace human participants in the EE-based simulation in order to evaluate EV users' travel demands in different scenarios, and compare the differences of simulated or measured travel behaviors between potential EV users and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle users.

AB Large-scale models are currently used for the simulation, analysis and control of real systems, whether technical, biological, social or economic. In multi-agent simulations of virtual economies, it is important to schedule a large number of agents across the cities involved, in order to establish a functional supply chain network for industrial production. This study describes an experimental evaluation of path planning approaches in the field of multi-agent modelling and simulation, applied to a large-scale setting. The experimental comparison is based on a model in which agents represent economic entities and can participate in mutual interactions. For the purposes of experiment, the model is scaled to various degrees of complexity in terms of the numbers of agents and transportation nodes. Various numbers of agents are used to explore the way in which the model's complexity influences the runtime of the path-planning task. The results indicate that there are significant differences between the runtime performances associated with single approaches, for differing levels of system complexity and model sizes. The study reveals that the appropriate sharing of shortest path information can significantly improve path-planning activities. Hence, this work extends current research in the field of path-planning for multi-agent simulations by conducting an experimental performance analysis of five distinct path-planning approaches and a statistical evaluation of the results. This statistical evaluation contrasts with performance analyses conducted on the basis of 'Big O' notation for algorithmic complexity, which describes the limiting behaviour of the algorithm and gives only a rough performance estimate.

AB In this paper, we propose a distributed control approach for flocking and group maneuvering of nonholonomic agents, with constrained kinematic properties commonly found in practical systems, such as fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. Flocking of agents with differential drive kinematics is addressed by introducing a virtual leader-follower mechanism into the Olfati-Saber's algorithm, which is originally proposed for holonomic agents with double integrator kinematics. Then, group maneuverability of the flock is achieved by superimposing a group motion onto each agent's flocking motion. Moreover, it is proven that speed limits are intrinsically guaranteed by the approach, which renders it more applicable in practical systems. Experimental results in MATLAB and Gazebo, a popular robotic simulator, are presented to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This technical note addresses the new nonlinear protocol class of doubly stochastic quadratic operators (DSQOs) for coordination of consensus problem in multi-agent systems (MAS). We derive the conditions for ensuring that every agent reaches consensus on a desired rate of the group's decision where the group decision value in its agent's initial statuses varies. Besides that, we investigate a nonlinear protocol sub-class of extreme DSQO (EDSQO) to reach a consensus for MAS to a common value with nonlinear low-complexity rules and fast time convergence if the interactions for each agent are not selfish. In addition, to extend the results to reach a consensus and to avoid the selfish case we specify a general class of DSQO for reaching a consensus under any given case of initial states. The case that MAS reach a consensus by DSQO is if each member of the agent group has positive interactions of DSQO (PDSQO) with the others. The convergence of both EDSQO and PDSQO classes is found to be directed towards the centre point. Finally, experimental simulations are given to support the analysis from theoretical aspect.

AB In this paper, we propose a simulator for integrated long-term care systems using as a starting point a holistic model of care systems for people that need long term care, the Sustainable Socio-Health Model (SSHM). The implementation of the simulator on the Jason multi-agent platform allows the tool to include the human interactions, preferences, and social abilities that take place between elderly people and the staff of healthcare systems (doctors, social workers and nurses). In addition, the use of this multi-agent platform provides the required scalability for simulating population sizes of different orders of magnitude. The paper shows the model to be implemented in the simulator, the simulator architecture, the types of agents considered, their functionality and the information flow among them. Additionally, it shows the validation of the simulator with real data obtained from empirical studies conducted by the Polibienestar Research Institute in Spain, as well as a performance evaluation that sketches the performance of the simulator when using the centralized Jason infrastructure under different population sizes. Effectively, simulation can provide policy makers with the option of going into a decision theatre and virtually knowing the consequences of different policies prior to determining the real policy to be adopted.

AB Traditional experimental economics methods often consume enormous resources of qualified human participants, and the inconsistence of a participant's decisions among repeated trials prevents investigation from sensitivity analyses. The problem can be solved if computer agents are capable of generating similar behaviors as the given participants in experiments. An experimental economics based analysis method is presented to extract deep information from questionnaire data and emulate any number of participants. Taking the customers' willingness to purchase electric vehicles (EVs) as an example, multi-layer correlation information is extracted from a limited number of questionnaires. Multi-agents mimicking the inquired potential customers are modelled through matching the probabilistic distributions of their willingness embedded in the questionnaires. The authenticity of both the model and the algorithm is validated by comparing the agent-based Monte Carlo simulation results with the questionnaire-based deduction results. With the aid of agent models, the effects of minority agents with specific preferences on the results are also discussed.

AB Flexible routing requires scheduling to be responsive and robust. Multi-agent systems have the potential to achieve robustness and provide a means for real-time planning and scheduling. The objective of this paper is to propose a multi-agent scheduling system with a good solution quality and robustness. The proposed multi-agent approach is designed for dynamic job shops with routing flexibility and sequence-dependent setup. A bio-inspired strategy based on division of labour in insect societies is presented for coordination among agents. The strategy is accomplished using a computational model which is composed of response threshold, response intention, and machine-centred reinforcement learning. The bio-inspired scheduling is compared with an agent-based approach and a dispatching rule-based approach. The experiments were performed using simulation and statistical analysis. Results show that the proposed bio-inspired scheduling model performs better than the other two methods on all eight common scheduling metrics.

AB This paper is concerned with the event-triggered consensus problem of discrete time second-order multi-agent network. First, a novel distributed discrete time event-triggered scheme is proposed. The controller is updated only at the errors of the state and velocities exceed the threshold. Then, by using bilinear transformation technique, the integral inequality technique and matrix theory, some sufficient conditions for the consensus of multi-agent network are obtained. Different from existing works, our conditions reveal how the Laplacian matrix eigenvalues and scaling strengths affect the consensus of discrete time second-order multi-agent network with event-based control strategy. Moreover, the Zeno-like behavior of triggering time sequences is excluded. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the correctness of theoretical results.

AB In this paper, we investigate consensus and disturbance attenuation in a chain of mobile agents, which include non-autonomous agents, semi-autonomous agents and autonomous agents. In particular, the nonlinear dynamics of non-autonomous agents is given and cannot be designed, while the dynamics of semi-autonomous and autonomous agents can be partially and fully designed, respectively. To improve the robustness of multi-agent chains against disturbances, we propose a nonlinear control framework for semi-autonomous and autonomous agents such that they mimic the behavior of non-autonomous agents for compatibility while also exploiting long-range connections with distant agents. This framework ensures the existence of a unique consensus equilibrium, which is independent of the network size, connectivity topologies, control gains and information delays. Robustness of multi-agent chains against disturbances is investigated by evaluating the frequency response at the nonlinear level. For infinitely long multi-agent chains with recurrent patterns, we also derive a condition that ensures the disturbance attenuation but only requires the analysis of the linearized model. A case study is conducted for a connected vehicle system where numerical simulations are used to validate the analytical results. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper, we investigate the group consensus issues of a continuous-time heterogeneous multi-agent networks. The system consists of two types of agents, the first-order and second-order, respectively. Be distinct from the related works, we propose a new distributed group consensus protocol which modeled by the agents' competition interaction. Based on stability theory and the method of frequency domain, the systems' group consensus including these two cases are discussed: without and with the influence of time delays. Meanwhile, the corresponding criteria are theoretically obtained. Specially, these criteria we obtained do not rely on the conservative conditions which exist in the relevant research works, such as in-degree balance and so on. Furthermore, we also theoretically establish the tolerable upper bounds of the time delays for achieving group consensus. The validity of our findings is verified through some numerical simulation examples. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper continues our previous hierarchical consensus work by considering a nonlinear case. All agents are partitioned into a set of groups, each of which contains a value called group information, representing a convex combination of all agents' states inside. The control input for each agent consists of two parts, i.e., agent state inside its associated group and its group information. When the received group information is a nonlinear transformation, it is shown that the consensus can be achieved under the proposed scheme in both discrete time and continuous time. Finally, the numerical simulations are performed to validate the theoretical results.

AB This paper investigates the impact of reward shaping in multi-agent reinforcement learning as a way to incorporate domain knowledge about good strategies. In theory, potential-based reward shaping does not alter the Nash Equilibria of a stochastic game, only the exploration of the shaped agent. We demonstrate empirically the performance of reward shaping in two problem domains within the context of RoboCup KeepAway by designing three reward shaping schemes, encouraging specific behaviour such as keeping a minimum distance from other players on the same team and taking on specific roles. The results illustrate that reward shaping with multiple, simultaneous learning agents can reduce the time needed to learn a suitable policy and can alter the final group performance.

AB This paper studies the consensus problem for multi-agent systems with quantised information communication via event-triggered control. First, the asynchronous event-triggered control for multi-agent systems is considered based on distributed uniform-quantised protocols. It is shown that practical consensus among agents is guaranteed and occurrence of Zeno behaviour is prevented under the designed event-triggering mechanisms. Second, under the proposed protocols using logarithmic quantised information, both synchronous and asynchronous event-triggered control algorithms are given to solve the practical consensus problem. Meanwhile, Zeno behaviour of the closed-loop systems can be excluded under the proposed event-triggered algorithms. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived results.

AB This paper introduces a novel multi-agent model for simulating water sharing scenarios under various irrigation policies, together with a novel self adaptive learning algorithm that achieves efficient resource allocation. The main contribution of this work lies in the fact that both the multi-agent model and the proposed learning algorithm operate under the lack of communication between the users of the resource, thus, no assumptions about the development of relations of trust between them are made. Moreover, the proposed learning algorithm uses only local information and operates in a decentralized manner, thus its implementation does not entail significant costs. The model was calibrated using data from a real world ecosystem and experimental results provided statistical and qualitative figures of merit for assessing typical irrigation policies. For all the irrigation policies examined, even if the users of the resource acted under profit maximization criteria, the proposed learning algorithm provided a means of achieving efficient resource allocation, despite the lack of communication. Thus, the proposed model and learning algorithm are valuable tools for assessing alternative irrigation policies and providing the best policy for any given scenario.

AB This paper addresses the bipartite flock control problem where a multi-agent system splits into two clusters upon internal or external excitations. Using structurally balanced signed graph theory, LaSalle's invariance principle and Barbalat's Lemma, we prove that the proposed algorithm guarantees a bipartite flocking behavior. In each of the two disjoint clusters, all individuals move with the same direction. Meanwhile, every pair of agents in different clusters moves with opposite directions. Moreover, all agents in the two separated clusters approach a common velocity magnitude, and collision avoidance among all agents is ensured as well. Finally, the proposed bipartite flock control method is examined by numerical simulations. The bipartite flocking motion addressed by this paper has its references in both natural collective motions and human group behaviors such as predator-prey and panic escaping scenarios.

AB In this paper, a decentralized control algorithm is proposed for a group of nonholonomic vehicles to form a class of collective circular motion behavior. Without the guidance of a global beacon, the desired collective behavior occurs provided that the multi-agent system is jointly connected. Moreover, a repulsion mechanism is considered to improve the distribution evenness of the agents' circular motion phases and hence to avoid collision. The effectiveness of the approach is verified through both theoretical analysis and numerical simulation. Moreover, some interesting variations of the circular motion model are investigated to enrich the collective behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID PROTOCOLS
AB Distinguished from the stationary group consensus problem, in this paper, the dynamic group consensus for a class of heterogeneous multi-agent systems under the influence of input time delays is investigated. A novel dynamic group consensus protocol is designed, where the coexisted cooperation and competition interaction relationships among the agents are considered. Two cases including identical and diverse input time delays are discussed, respectively. Based on matrix theory, system stability theory and pinning control strategy, some sufficient conditions for the heterogeneous systems are established to achieve dynamic group consensus asymptotically. The obtained results reveal that the achievement of systems' dynamic group consensus is related to systems control parameters, the in-degree and input time delays of the agents. Finally, the effectiveness of our theoretical results is verified by some numerical simulations.

AB Linked data is a decentralized space of interlinked Resource Description Framework (RDF) graphs that are published, accessed, and manipulated by a multitude of Web agents. Here, we present a multi-agent framework for mining hypothetical semantic relations from linked data, in which the discovery, management, and validation of relations can be carried out independently by different agents. These agents collaborate in relation mining by publishing and exchanging inter-dependent knowledge elements, e.g., hypotheses, evidence, and proofs, giving rise to an evidentiary network that connects and ranks diverse knowledge elements. Simulation results show that the framework is scalable in a multi-agent environment. Real-world applications show that the framework is suitable for interdisciplinary and collaborative relation discovery tasks in social domains.

We developed the simulation model "ArrierosAlife" to explore the behavior of changes in social networks over time. The model is based on empirical data, a result out of a longitudinal field work. The focus of this research is a comparison of network changes over time in the "real world" compared with the emergence of social networks in an artificial society. "Ascape" was used as a modeling frame work to facilitate the development and analysis of the simulation model. We will give a brief overview of the developed model and describe the experiences using "Ascape" as a framework.

DE Synchronisation; Internal-Model Principle; disturbance attenuation;
   multi-agent systems; controller design; synchronous trajectory
AB The paper investigates the synchronisation of disturbed multi-agent systems. The first result shows that dynamical local controllers have to be used to introduce the model of the disturbances into each of the extended agents. This result generalises the Internal-Model Principle from multivariable control to multi-agent systems with arbitrary communication structure. A test for the satisfaction of the Internal-Model Principle is provided. The second result is a necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic synchronisation of the disturbed agents. Third, the synchronisability of the agents is investigated and it is shown that additional dynamics in the local controllers may be necessary to make the extended agents synchronisable. Fourth, a design method is proposed to find a networked controller that synchronises the agent outputs and simultaneously attenuates the disturbances. Finally, the analysis of the resulting synchronous trajectory shows that the disturbance model included in the extended agents may dominate the overall system behaviour. The results are illustrated by numerical examples.

First, for a group of single-integrator agents, the controllability is studied in a unified framework for both networks with leader-following structure and networks with undirected graph. Some new necessary/sufficient conditions for the controllability of networks of single-integrator agents are established. Second, we prove that, under the same topology and same prescribed leaders, a network of high-order dynamic agents is completely controllable if and only if so is a network of single-integrator agents. Third, how the selection of leaders and the coupling weights of graphs affect the controllability is analyzed. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

ID LINEAR MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; CONSENSUS; SYNCHRONIZATION
AB This paper describes a solution to the problem of consensus/synchronisation for a general class of networked nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) using a distributed control strategy with an event-triggered communications (ETC) mechanism. We consider the case where the dynamics of each agent contain linear and Lipschitz nonlinear terms and the underlying communication graph is directed. The strategy proposed has two important properties: (i) it achieves practical consensus, i.e. the synchronisation error that measures the disagreement among the agents' states converges to a ball centred at the origin, with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small and (ii) the minimum of the inter-event times for each agent is lower bounded by a strictly positive number, hence Zeno behaviour is excluded. Furthermore, it affords system designers adequate tools to trade off the frequency of communications among agents against the level of performance achieved in MAS consensus/synchronisation. Numerical simulation results are also given.

AB Multi-agent systems are ubiquitous in the real-world and have received an increasing attention by many researchers worldwide. A multi-agent system is composed of many agents interconnected by a communication network. This paper aims to further investigate the flocking and preserving connectedness in multi-agent nonholonomic systems with proximity graphs, in which the positions and the relative distances are not available to the distributed controllers. Several sufficient conditions are derived to resolve the above problem based on the kinematic model and the dynamic model, respectively. These sufficient conditions indicate that, for any given distinct initial positions and connected initial graph, there always exist gains of the linear protocols to preserve the connectedness of the graph and realize flocking. Moreover, under an additional condition on initial heading angles, the similar result is obtained for a nonlinear protocol with the form of Kuramoto model. Finally, numerical simulations are given to validate the above theoretical results.

The asynchronous event-triggered control algorithms are proposed based on the triggering time sequences of all agents. The main contribution of this paper is to extend the event-triggered control method to investigate general linear multi-agent systems. First, by applying variable substitution method, we give the asynchronous triggering conditions. Based on the conditions, the consensus can be achieved both under fixed and switching topologies. Meanwhile, all the proposed event-triggered algorithms can exclude Zeno behaviours of the closed-loop systems. Then, the asynchronous results are applied to cope with formation control problem. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the part event-triggered protocol designs.

AB This paper considers a high-order consensus problem of multi-agent system with feedforward nonlinear and time-varying input delay in a directed network. In order to achieve the consensus, we propose a low gain distributed protocol which can get rid of impacts of feedforward nonlinearity and an arbitrarily bounded input delay on the consensus problem. Moreover, for any upper bound time-varying delay and strongly connected diagraph, the proposed controller can solve the consensus problem of multi-agent systems with feedforward nonlinearity if the designed parameter theta is great than the threshold value. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results.

AB The hypothesis is that the exchanges of goods structure the society, and especially the non-merchant exchanges. Their aim is to express unselfishness, but also to generate a moral debt that builds strong reciprocal links. A multi-agent system was built with 100 agents and a resource, the interactions being only gifts. For the simulations, the agents have different rules to perform gifts and to organize their memory. The results are analyzed by the agent as well as by the modeller, with different points of view: either local or global and with different time length.

AB Traditional multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) methods focus on weights calculation of sub-attributes and experts' preferences, but lack the discussion on the decision-makers' affective interaction, and its influence on the decision preference and group consistency. To address this problem, the present study proposed a new multilayer affective computing model based on "personality-mood-emotion" pattern, under the multi-agent decision system framework. In addition, we introduced the group trending index and affection-preference incentive mechanism, which can help simulate MAGDM process and learn group experts' decision preferences. Further, we proposed a new multi-agent affective interactive MAGDM (MAAI-MAGDM) method, where we defined a novel group convergence index and an alternative decision entropy to explain the convergence process of decision and group consistency. Compared to the traditional MAGDM approaches, the proposed MAAI-MAGDM method fully considered the affective features of each expert, reduced the dependence on aggregation operators and weight analysis, alleviated the workload of group experts, and effectively reduced the complexity of decision-making calculation process. Finally, we verified that the proposed method can effectively assist the decision-making processes by employing two numerical cases.

DE hierarchical reinforcement learning; cooperative multi-agent systems;

AB In this paper, we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We introduce a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework, and propose a hierarchical multi-agent RL algorithm called Cooperative HRL. In this framework, agents are cooperative and homogeneous (use the same task decomposition). Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform each individual subtask, the order in which to carry them out, and how to coordinate with other agents. We define cooperative subtasks to be those subtasks in which coordination among agents significantly improves the performance of the overall task. Those levels of the hierarchy which include cooperative subtasks are called cooperation levels. A fundamental property of the proposed approach is that it allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of cooperative subtasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination at the level of primitive actions. We study the empirical performance of the Cooperative HRL algorithm using two testbeds: a simulated two-robot trash collection task, and a larger four-agent automated guided vehicle (AGV) scheduling problem. We compare the performance and speed of Cooperative HRL with other learning algorithms, as well as several well-known industrial AGV heuristics. We also address the issue of rational communication behavior among autonomous agents in this paper. The goal is for agents to learn both action and communication policies that together optimize the task given a communication cost. We extend the multi-agent HRL framework to include communication decisions and propose a cooperative multi-agent HRL algorithm called COM-Cooperative HRL. In this algorithm, we add a communication level to the hierarchical decomposition of the problem below each cooperation level. Before an agent makes a decision at a cooperative subtask, it decides if it is worthwhile to perform a communication action. A communication action has a certain cost and provides the agent with the actions selected by the other agents at a cooperation level. We demonstrate the efficiency of the COM-Cooperative HRL algorithm as well as the relation between the communication cost and the learned communication policy using a multi-agent taxi problem.

AB Scenarios, which constrain the behavior of agents, can be the interface between computer experts (agent system developers) and application designers (scenario writers), as well as the interface between scenario writers and agents. It raises a number of challenging issues to execute multi-agent scenarios: 1) How can scenario writers generate customized scenarios easily? 2) How can scenario writers monitor and control scenario execution so as to debug errors in scenarios? 3) How can agents negotiate for scenarios to achieve robust behavior against scenario errors? So, in this paper, we provide a web style CUI (Graphical User Interface) for scenario writers to customize scenarios. We propose a meta-level architecture for scenario writers to trace and control the execution of scenarios by observing scenarios, and for agents to negotiate with others as well as scenario writers for scenarios. The meta-level architecture is illustrated by an experimental multi-agent system of evacuation simulation.

AB Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been proved to be more suitable than reinforcement learning for path planning in large-scale scenarios. In order to more effectively complete the DRL-based collaborative path planning in crowd evacuation, it is necessary to consider the space expansion problem brought by the increase of the number of agents. In addition, it is often faced with complicated circumstances, such as exit selection and congestion in crowd evacuation. However, few existing works have integrated these two aspects jointly. To solve this problem, we propose a planning approach for crowd evacuation based on the improved DRL algorithm, which will improve evacuation efficiency for large-scale crowd path planning. First, we propose a framework of congestion detection-based multi-agent reinforcement learning, the framework divides the crowd into leaders and followers and simulates leaders with a multi-agent system, it considers the congestion detection area is set up to evaluate the degree of congestion at each exit. Next, under the specification of this framework, we propose the improved Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (IMADDPG) algorithm, which adds the mean field network to maximize the returns of other agents, enables all agents to maximize the performance of a collaborative planning task in our training period. Then, we implement the hierarchical path planning method, which upper layer is based on the IMADDPG algorithm to solve the global path, and lower layer uses the reciprocal velocity obstacles method to avoid collisions in crowds. Finally, we simulate the proposed method with the crowd simulation system. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

AB Significant prior research has shown that facilitation is a critical part of GSS transition. This study examines an under-researched aspect of facilitation-its contributions to self-sustained GSS use among group members. Integrating insights from Adaptive Structuration Theory, experimental economics, and the Collaboration Engineering literature, we formalize interactions of group members in GSS transition as strategic interactions in a minimum-effort coordination game. The contributions of facilitation are interpreted as coordination mechanisms to help group members achieve and maintain an agreement on GSS use by reducing uncertainties in the coordination game. We implement the conjectured coordination mechanisms in a multi-agent simulator. The simulator offers insights into the separate and combined effects of common facilitation practices during the lifecycle of GSS transition. These insights can help the Collaboration Engineering community to identify and package the facilitation routines that are critical for group members to achieve self-sustained GSS use and understand how facilitation routines should be adapted to different stages of GSS transition lifecycle. Moreover, they indicate the value of the multi-agent approach in uncovering new insights and representing the issue of GSS transition with a new view.

AB Image segmentation techniques have been an invaluable task in many domains such as quantification of tissue volumes, medical diagnosis, anatomical structure study, treatment planning, etc. Image segmentation is still a debatable problem due to some issues. Firstly, most image segmentation solutions are problem-based. Secondly, medical image segmentation methods generally have restrictions because medical images have very similar gray level and texture among the interested objects. The goal of this work is to design a framework to extract simultaneously several objects of interest from Computed Tomography (CT) images by using some priori-knowledge. Our method used properties of agent in a multi-agent environment. The input image is divided into several sub-images, and each local agent works on a sub-image and tries to mark each pixel as a specific region by means of given priori-knowledge. During this time the local agent marks each cell of sub-image individually. Moderator agent checks the outcome of all agents' work to produce final segmented image. The experimental results for CT images demonstrated segmentation accuracy around 91% and efficiency of 7 seconds.

AB Partial component consensus means that some components of all state variables in a multi-agent system tend to be convergence as time tends to be infinite. It is a dynamics behavior that is weaker than identical consensus. In this paper, partial component consensus of nonlinear multi-agent systems via intermittent pinning control is investigated for the first time, and the intermittent signal can be aperiodic. With the help of permutation matrix method, the corresponding error system is reduced to a new error system. Then, partial component consensus in the multi-agent system is converted into the stability of the new error system with respect to partial variables. Based on matrix theory, graph theory and stability theory of partial variables, some sufficient conditions to guarantee exponential partial component consensus are derived. Finally, numerical simulations are shown to demonstrate correctness of the theoretical results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This work studies the consensus problem of a group of agents with nonlinear dynamics while directional communications between agents with delay are assumed. To reflect the practical situation of having reconnections or disconnections between agents, the communication topology is considered to be switched within a finite set of digraphs. The consensus criterion with exponential convergence is established by the use of linear matrix inequalities and multiple Lyapunov functional theory. It is interesting to point out that consensus is still possible even though some agents are isolated from the others intermittently. These theoretical results are also well illustrated with numerical simulations.

AB In this paper, a resilient distributed control scheme against replay attacks for multi-agent networked systems subject to input and state constraints is proposed. The methodological starting point relies on a smart use of predictive arguments with a twofold aim: 1) Promptly detect malicious agent behaviors affecting normal system operations; 2) Apply specific control actions, based on predictive ideas, for mitigating as much as possible undesirable domino effects resulting from adversary operations. Specifically, the multi-agent system is topologically described by a leader-follower digraph characterized by a unique leader and set-theoretic receding horizon control ideas are exploited to develop a distributed algorithm capable to instantaneously recognize the attacked agent. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to show benefits and effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB This paper studies the output-based event-triggered consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems with communication delay under directed communication graphs. The influence of time delay on performance of multi-agent systems is investigated : the stability margin of time delay is explicitly calculated to measure the capability of proposed control algorithm to tolerate the time delay. By the designed output-based event-triggered mechanism, both communication among agents and update of controller are intermittent without Zeno behavior. Consequently, this control mechanism prolongs the lifespan of multi-agent systems in the sense that it saves intensive resource for communication and update of controller. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the correctness of results in this paper. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A key prediction of motivational theories of automatic imitation is that people imitate in-group over out-group members. However, research on this topic has provided mixed results. Here, we investigate the possibility that social group modulations emerge only when people can directly compare in- and out-group. To this end, we conducted three experiments in which we measured automatic imitation of two simultaneously shown hands: one in-group and one out-group hand. Our general hypothesis was that the in-group hand would be imitated more than the out-group hand. However, even though both explicit and implicit manipulation checks showed that we succeeded in manipulating participants' feelings of group membership, we did not find support for the predicted influence of group membership on automatic imitation. In contrast to motivational theories, this suggests that group membership does not influence who we do or do not imitate, not even in a contrastive multi-agent paradigm.

AB In this paper, the synchronisation problems of multi-agent systems with asynchronous and synchronous event-triggered control under a novel event-triggered condition are solved. Our event-triggered control protocols only require each agent to send its state information to its neighbouring agents when an event-triggered condition is satisfied. Such control protocols substantially reduce the cost of communication. It is worth mentioning that the proposed protocols also ensure that the synchronisation of the multi-agent system with asynchronous and synchronous event-triggered can be achieved asymptotically without Zeno-behaviour. Meanwhile, an ultimate synchronisation trajectory is given. Moreover, our results are applied to solve the formation control problem. Some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our protocols.

AB This paper proposes a formation control algorithm to create separated multiple formations for an undirected networked multi-agent system while preserving the network connectivity and avoiding collision among agents. Through the modified multi-consensus technique, the proposed algorithm can simultaneously divide a group of multiple agents into any arbitrary number of desired formations in a decentralized manner. Furthermore, the agents assigned to each formation group can be easily reallocated to other formation groups without network topological constraints as long as the entire network is initially connected; an operator can freely partition agents even if there is no spanning tree within each subgroup. Besides, the system can avoid collision without loosing the connectivity even during the transient period of formation by applying the existing potential function based on the network connectivity estimation. If the estimation is correct, the potential function not only guarantees the connectivity maintenance but also allows some extra edges to be broken if the network remains connected. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the feasibility and performance of the proposed multi-subgroup formation control.

AB This paper is devoted to investigating the finite-time consensus problem for a multi-agent system in networks with undirected topology. A new class of global continuous time-invariant consensus protocols is constructed for each single-integrator agent dynamics with the aid of Lyapunov functions. In particular, it is shown that the settling time of the proposed new class of finite-time consensus protocols is upper bounded for arbitrary initial conditions. This makes it possible for network consensus problems that the convergence time is designed and estimated offline for a given undirected information flow and a group volume of agents. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented as a proof of concept.

For this purpose, the behaviours of two particular control solutions, characterised by a different degree of decision-making delegation assigned to physical and information units in the production system, have been simulated. The experimental campaign is divided into three trials, in order to measure the performances of the two architectures not only under stable and predictable conditions, but also in case of unexpected events, such as the release of urgent manufacturing orders and the occurrence of failures in production resources.

AB This paper presents an analytic approach that can be used to study opinion dynamics in multi-agent systems. The results of such an analytic approach can be used as a descriptive tool capable of predicting the long-term properties of a multi-agent system, and they can also be considered a prescriptive tool that supports the design of multi-agent systems with desired asymptotic characteristics. The agents that form the multi-agent system are divided into disjoint classes characterized by different values of fixed parameters to account for the specific behaviors of single agents. Each class is characterized by the number of agents in it, by the initial distribution of the opinion, and by the characteristic propensity of single agents to change their respective opinions when interacting with other agents. The proposed approach is based on the possibility of interpreting the dynamics of the opinion in terms of the kinetic theory of gas mixtures, which allows expressing the dynamics of the average opinion of each class in terms of a suitable differential problem that can be used to derive interesting asymptotic properties. Analytic solutions of the obtained differential problem are derived and it is shown that, under suitable hypotheses, the average opinions of all classes of agents converge to the same value. The results presented in this paper differ from those commonly derived in standard kinetic theory of gas mixtures because the microscopic equations which describe the effects of interactions among agents are explicitly meant to model opinion dynamics, and they are different from those normally used to describe collisions among molecules in a gas. All presented analytic results are confirmed by simulations presented at the end of the paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our motivation is to build multi-agent based simulations of human societies that would exhibit more realistic simulation behaviours. This in turn will allow researchers to study more complex issues regarding individual and organisational performance than is possible with present systems. Drawing on studies into naturalistic decision making, which looks at people's decision making in their natural environments, we propose ways of integrating a recognition-primed decision making approach with the popular BDI agent architecture, and report on preliminary empirical studies.

We introduce an extension of an existing agent testbed for artificial societies making it possible to formally analyze the dynamics of the simulated agent system. The extension generates temporally annotated logical terms that describe parts of the dynamics of the simulated system. Based on these terms, it is possible to validate hypotheses about the system on different levels of aggregation, i.e. agent, group and system level. We present first results from a set of simple experiments in a class of artificial societies.

ID SYSTEMS
AB All agents being informed and the virtual leader traveling at a constant velocity are the two critical assumptions seen in the recent literature on Hocking in multi-agent systems. Under these assumptions, Olfati-Saber in a recent IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL paper proposed a flocking algorithm which by incorporating a navigational feedback enables a group of agents to track a virtual leader. This paper revisits the problem of multiagent flocking in the absence of the above two assumptions. We first show that, even when only a fraction of agents are informed, the Olfati-Saber Hocking algorithm still enables all the informed agents to move with the desired constant velocity, and an uninformed agent to also move with the same desired velocity if it can be influenced by the informed agents from time to time during the evolution. Numerical simulation demonstrates that a very small group of the informed agents can cause most of the agents to move with the desired velocity and the larger the informed group is the bigger portion of agents will move with the desired velocity. In the situation where the virtual leader travels with a varying velocity, we propose modification to the Olfati-Saber algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm enables the asymptotic tracking of the virtual leader. That is, the position and velocity of the center of mass of all agents will converge exponentially to those of the virtual leader. The convergent rate is also given.

AB This paper investigates the distributed event-triggered control problems of second-order nonlinear multi-agent systems (MASs) with directed graph. Firstly, an event-triggered consensus algorithm is developed for second-order nonlinear MASs. It is proved that MASs reach practical consensus and Zeno-behavior doesn't occur. Secondly, for leader-follower MASs, an event-triggered tracking algorithm is presented, which ensures that follower agents track leader agent even when leader agent has a nonzero input. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to show effectiveness of the proposed consensus algorithm. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we consider a dynamic coverage problem for multi-agent systems, where the main objective of a group of mobile agents is to explore a given compact region. We propose a novel control scheme, where we introduce a supervisor that assists a group of agents with the centralized coverage control law and the global trajectory tracking control law. The coverage control law ensures the coverage task is done until the agents end up in local minima, and when they do, the global trajectory tracking control law ensures that the agents are deployed to uncovered regions. Our control scheme is designed to be decoupled such that only one control law is active at a given time. In addition to the coverage objective, we design control laws for coverage agents to avoid collisions and maintain proximity to a supervisor. Moreover, we utilize feedback linearization to use the proposed control scheme for coverage control of kinematic unicycle agents. We validate our approach via numerical simulations.

AB This paper deals with multi-agent based modeling of artificial stock market by using the coevolutionary Genetic Programming (GP) by considering social learning. Cognitive behaviors of agents are modeled by using the GP to introduce social learning as well as individual learning. Assuming five types of agents, in which rational agents prefer forecast models (equations) or production rules to support their decision making, and irrational agents select decisions at random like a speculator. Rational agents usually use their own knowledge base, but some of them utilize their public (common) knowledge base to improve trading decisions. By using the result of simulation studies on artificial market, it is shown that the time series for stock price is resemble to real stock price statistically. It is also shown that the lack of social learning leads the system to a very monotone market, and only a simple behavior of the market is realized. Moreover, we can see the effectiveness of classifier systems where we utilize a pool of decision rules in which not only prominent but also rules having potential rewards in fluctuating environment. It is also seen that the growth of wealth of irrational agent is almost always better than rational agents even though they analyze and behaves on reasonable decision. The result provide us the way to analyze real market where traders usually use social learning and environment-dependent rules.

AB With rapid economic growth, the ecological environment is subject to a huge test. The environment has become a bottleneck restricting the further development of the economy. Built on waste recycling, ecological industry chain is an important way to realize the sustainable development of economy and society. This paper establishes a three stage evolutionary game model of ecological industry chain. By mathematically analyzing the equilibrium points of replicator dynamics equations, we get the evolutionary stable strategies. By studying the evolutionary rules and taking the bottom-up modeling method, this paper constructs a multi-agent computational experimental model to analyze the evolutionary paths and trend of each subject. Besides, the case of Poyang Lake ecological economic zone is applied to verify the evolutionary game model.

AB An event-triggered protocol is recently developed to achieve finite-time consensus in the commented paper. Although the Zeno behaviour is excluded by the lower-bounded inter-event time in Theorem 2, the misuse of Lemma 1 leads to the doubtful result in the proof. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulation, this letter reveals that the Zeno behaviour is unavoidable under the protocol when approaching consensus in finite time. Furthermore, an alternative trigger function is presented to achieve practical consensus.

AB This paper solves the robust output synchronization problem for a group of linear agents subject to constant disturbances on directed graphs. A new distributed control protocol with integral action is first proposed with the assumption that each agent has access to its own state. Then, an observer-based implementation of the control protocol is illustrated for the case that the agents do not have access to their states. Compared with existing methods, the new distributed protocol does not require exchanging of the controller states or output states among neighboring agents. Finally, simulation results of a group of low-speed experimental unmanned aerial vehicles show the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In this paper, based on adaptive control, the consensus problem of fractional general linear multi-agent systems is studied. A new adaptive consensus control is designed and applied to the fractional multi-agents systems by distributed event-triggered strategy. The consensus can be achieved for any undirected connection network in the proposed method. Meanwhile, in order to ensure the feasibility of designed controller, a proof is strictly given to exclude Zeno behavior. Furthermore, an adaptive self-triggered algorithm is also proposed to relax the requirement for continuously checking the measurement errors, in which the next update time for each agent is determined according to its local history state information. Effectiveness of proposed control strategies is verified by some numerical simulations.

AB In this article, a robust consensus tracking problem for a multi-agent system with integrator-type dynamics has been addressed in the presence of disturbances and unmodelled dynamics. The desired trajectory to be tracked is only provided to a small group of team members. An identifier is developed to estimate the unknown disturbances and unmodelled dynamics. A consensus controller is developed based on this identifier to achieve asymptotic consensus tracking using the local information obtained from neighbouring agents. The closed-loop stability is proved using the Lyapunov-based analysis and an invariance-like theorem. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed robust consensus controller.

AB Real-time motion planning and control for groups of heterogeneous and under-actuated robots subject to disturbances and uncertainties in cluttered constrained environments is the key problem addressed in this paper. Here we present the Multi-agent Rapidly-exploring Pseudo-random Tree (MRPT), a novel technique based on a classical Probabilistic Road Map (PRM) algorithm for application in robot team cooperation. Our main contribution lies in the proposal of an extension of a probabilistic approach to be used as a deterministic planner in distributed complex multi-agent systems, keeping the main advantages of PRM strategies like simplicity, fast convergence, and probabilistic completeness. Our methodology is fully distributed, addressing missions with multi-robot teams represented by high nonlinear models and a great number of Degrees of Freedom (DoFs), endowing each agent with the ability of coordinating its own movement with other agents while avoiding collisions with obstacles. The inference of the entire team's behavior at each time instant by each individual agent is the main improvement of our method. This scheme, which is behavioral in nature, also makes the system less susceptible to failures due to intensive traffic communication among robots. We evaluate the time complexity of our method and show its applicability in planning and executing search and rescue missions for a group of robots in S E3 outdoor scenarios and present both simulated and real-world results.

AB The purpose of this paper is to study how a multi-agent-based coordination mechanism can resolve conflicts among functional units in an enterprise. In the era of information technology, characterized by web technology, intelligent agents demonstrate the best interests of a functional unit when engaged in the highly delicate coordination process of an enterprise. Thus, behavioral problems that occur while coordinating conflicts among functional units can be avoided effectively. Since there are a number of functional units in an enterprise, the multi-agents are utilized to support the agent-based coordination of conflicts among several functional units. This paper proposes a new type of multi-agent-based coordination engine termed MACE in which the information exchange between multi-agents is properly controlled via a complicated algorithm. To illustrate the performance of MACE, we devised a cooperative organizational decision support system (CODSS) and incorporated MACE into CODSS, yielding MACE_CODSS, The combined case of production and marketing was introduced and tackled by MACE_CODSS, obtaining the proper coordination results. To verify the improved performance of MACE, we implemented three types of coordination DSS: Joint_CODSS. Separate_CODSS, and None_CODSS. With 12 simulation periods and 100 simulation runs, we obtained comparative coordination results for each coordination type. Statistical tests revealed that the proposed MACE_CODSS produced the most desirable coordination results. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the multi-target circumnavigation problem. The multi-target circumnavigation problems involve a group of agents circumnavigating moving targets in a coordinated fashion. To address the problem, a decentralised estimator is first constructed at each agent to estimate the geometric centre of the targets. Then, the distributed control strategy is developed by means of the estimator, which guarantees that the agents preserve the desired distance to the target centre and rotate around the targets at uniformly spaced angles. In particular, the topology structure of the agents only needs to be a tree rather than the ring. Thus, the control scheme is more feasible and robust and requires less information. The convergence of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated based on Lasalle's invariance principle and algebraic graph theory. Several numerical simulations are provided to validate the results.

DE Bipartite consensus; event-triggered control; multi-agent systems
ID NETWORKS; AGENTS
AB This paper investigates event-triggered control for first-order multi-agent systems with structurally balanced signed graphs. A distributed continuous event-triggered consensus mechanism is firstly proposed for each agent, including the control law based on local sampled states, and the triggering condition constructed with its own state, the sampled states of itself and its neighbours, and an extra signal. No knowledge of the global network is needed. By applying Lyapunov stability theory and the algebraic graph theory, we prove that all agents can reach agreement with identical magnitude but opposite sign while Zeno behaviour is excluded. Moreover, the periodic implementation of the event-triggered consensus algorithm is proposed. The criteria of co-designing the triggering condition parameter and the verification period is established to guarantee the bipartite consensus of the systems. Finally, simulations, including a numerical example and a group of multiple mobile robots, are shown to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed theoretical results.

AB In this paper, we consider the shape control in flocking behavior of a multi-agent system with a virtual leader. Besides the traditional flocking control terms, which include a gradient-based term, a velocity consensus term and a navigational feed-back in general, a new piecewise smooth neighbor-based local controller is added to regulate the configuration to the desired flocking shape. All agent velocities approach the desired velocity asymptotically, while collisions among agents can be avoided. Furthermore, based on the proved stability, we obtain three kinds of flocking shapes, such as those in a single line, vee shape or corner shape. Some numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate theoretical issues.

AB This paper investigates the event-triggered containment control for discrete-time multi-agent systems. Event-triggered control strategies are employed in order to reduce the number of controller actuation updates for multi-agent systems with limited resources. It is assumed that each follower in the system updates its state only at some instants which are determined by the proposed event-triggered condition. Both centralized and decentralized event-triggered strategies are proposed to solve the containment control problem. Convergence analysis is given with the help of matrix theory and Lyapunov method, and it is showed that the proposed strategy does not exhibit Zeno behaviors. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB In this paper, we focus on investigating group consensus of dynamical multi-agent networks via pinning scheme. The topology of the network is a general digraph, which needs neither being symmetric nor containing a spanning directed tree, and some criteria are proposed to guarantee the realization of group consensus instead of relying on other conservative assumptions presented by majority of the relevant research works, such as in-degree balance. In addition, it is interesting to find that the nodes with zero in-degree should be pinned first based on the property of M-matrix. Furthermore, an adaptive pinning control approach is developed to obtain the appropriate control gains. Finally, the effectiveness and correctness of our theoretical findings are verified by some numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ethno-religious conflict in multi-cultural societies has been one of the major causes of loss of life and property in recent history. In this paper, we present and analyze a multi-agent game theoretic model for computational study of ethno-religious conflicts in multi-cultural societies. Empirical fact-based research in sociology and conflict resolution literature have identified (a) ethno-religious identity of the population, (b) spatial structure (distribution) of the population, (c) existing history of animosity, and (d) influence of leaders as some of the salient factors causing ethno-religious violence. It has also been experimentally shown by Lumsden that multi-cultural conflict can be viewed as a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. Using the above observations, we model the multi-cultural conflict problem as a variant of the repeated PD game in graphs. The graph consists of labeled nodes corresponding to the different ethno-religious types and the topology of the graph encodes the spatial distribution and interaction of the population. We assume the structure of the graph to have the statistical properties of a social network with the high degree nodes representing the leaders of the society. The agents play the game with neighbors of their opponent type and they update their strategies based on neighbors of their same type. This strategy update dynamics, where the update neighborhood is different from the game playing neighborhood, distinguishes our model from conventional models of PD games in graphs. We present simulation results showing the effect of various parameters of our model to the propensity of conflict in a population consisting of two ethno-religious groups. We also compare our simulation results to real data of occurrence of ethno-religious violence in Yugoslavia.

AB In this study, the authors investigate the problem of flocking motion combined with topology optimisation for mobile multi-agent systems. In most of the recent literatures, all agents are assumed to be informed of target's information for all time to maintain connectivity. Actually, it is not essential to make all agents be informed. In this study, the authors present a distributed topology optimisation scheme to reduce the communication complexity of keeping connectivity while the multi-agent system pursuits a virtual target. This optimisation scheme is performed in the discrete space of graphs and relies on two key ideas. First, it generates optimally rigid graphs for each agent with its neighbouring flockmates. Second, partial agents are selected as the informed units to maintain the connectivity of the multi-agent system. Based on this scheme, the authors propose a distributed motion controller to make the mobile agents result in flocking behaviour. Applying the proposed algorithms, it is shown that the communication energy dissipation of the networked system is decreased. Stability analysis is further achieved by using differential conclusions and non-smooth analysis in switching topology. Numerical simulation examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB Electricity markets are complex environments, involving a large number of different entities, with specific characteristics and objectives, making their decisions and interacting in a dynamic scene. Game-theory has been widely used to support decisions in competitive environments; therefore its application in electricity markets can prove to be a high potential tool. This paper proposes a new scenario analysis algorithm, which includes the application of game-theory, to evaluate and preview different scenarios and provide players with the ability to strategically react in order to exhibit the behavior that better fits their objectives. This model includes forecasts of competitor players' actions, to build models of their behavior, in order to define the most probable expected scenarios. Once the scenarios are defined, game theory is applied to support the choice of the action to be performed. Our use of game theory is intended for supporting one specific agent and not for achieving the equilibrium in the market. MASCEM (Multi-Agent System for Competitive Electricity Markets) is a multi-agent electricity market simulator that models market players and simulates their operation in the market. The scenario analysis algorithm has been tested within MASCEM and our experimental findings with a case study based on real data from the Iberian Electricity Market are presented and discussed.

TI MetaMorph: an adaptive agent-based architecture for intelligent
   manufacturing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Global competition and rapidly changing customer requirements are forcing major changes in the production styles and configuration of manufacturing organizations. Traditional centralized manufacturing systems are not able to meet such requirements. This paper proposes an agent-based approach for dynamically creating and managing agent communities in such widely distributed and ever-changing manufacturing environments. After reviewing the research literature, an adaptive multi-agent manufacturing system architecture called MetaMorph is presented and its main features are described. Such architecture facilitates multi-agent coordination by minimizing communication and processing overheads. Adaptation is facilitated through organizational structural change and two learning mechanisms: learning from past experiences and learning future agent interactions by simulating future dynamic, emergent behaviours. The MetaMorph architecture also addresses other specific requirements for next generation manufacturing systems, including scalability, reliability, stability, maintainability, flexibility, real-time planning and scheduling, standardized communication, fault tolerance, and security. The proposed architecture is implemented as a multi-agent virtual manufacturing system, in simulation form, which incorporates heterogeneous manufacturing agents within different agent-based shop floors or factories. The experimental results have shown the potential of the agent-based approach for advanced manufacturing systems.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) relies on modelling the behavior of individual entities and their interactions in a virtual environment. Nowadays, MABS are used for studying various complex systems such as crowds, animal societies, ecosystems, traffic behaviors or the Market. So MABS are experimental research tools that contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms embedded in these complex systems. Still, studying some complex systems may require to consider millions of individuals. In such a case, the computing resources, which are required, represent a major obstacle for MABS end-users. In this respect, general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU) is a relevant approach for addressing performance and scalability issues. However, GPU programming requires expert skills, which strongly limits both the accessibility and the re-usability of the frameworks developed using GPGPU. This paper presents MABS design guideline, dedicated to the GPU context, which allows the use of the GPU power without sacrificing the accessibility of MABS frameworks.

AB The event-based broadcasting containment control problem for both first-order and second-order multi-agent systems under directed topology is investigated. Based on certain event, each agent decides when to transmit its current states to its neighbours and the agents' distributed control algorithms are based on these sampled state measurements, which can significantly decrease the number of the controllers' updates. All the agents are divided into two groups, namely, the leaders and the followers. The formation control is introduced. The leaders exchange their information to converge to a formation. The followers utilise the information from both their leader neighbours and their follower neighbours and are driven to the convex hull of the leaders using the proposed control algorithms. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

AB In this paper, a reverse group consensus problem is investigated for the dynamic agents with the inputs in the cooperation-competition network which can be divided into two sub-networks. The weights between the agents in the same sub-network are positive, while the weights between the agents among different sub-networks are negative. Then, the reverse group consensus is firstly studied without the in-degree balance condition. By defining the mirror graph and establishing the solution of the multi-agent system, it is found that the reverse group consensus problem can be achieved if the mirror graph is strongly connected. The explicit expression of the error level is also derived, which would be vanished for multi-agent systems with some special kinds of inputs. Furthermore, as an extension, the decomposing of the cooperation-competition network is discussed, where the concept of the condensation undirected graph and the path balance condition are defined, and several effective sufficient conditions are obtained. Finally, numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

   Interests between agents
AB A multi-agent system (MAS) is expected to be applied to various real-world problems where a single agent cannot accomplish given tasks. Due to the inherent complexity in the real-world MAS, however, manual design of group behaviors of agents is intractable. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is a framework for multiple agents in the same environment to learn their policies adaptively by using reinforcement learning, would be a promising methodology for such complexity in the MAS. To acquire the group behaviors by MARL, all the agents are required to understand how to achieve the respective tasks cooperatively. So far, we have proposed "bottom-up MARL", which is a decentralized system to manage real and large-scale MARL, with a reward shaping algorithm to represent the group behaviors. The reward shaping algorithm, however, assumes that all the agents are in cooperative relationships to some extent. In this paper, therefore, we extend this algorithm to allow the agents not to know the interests between them. The interests are regarded as correlation coefficients derived from the agents' rewards, which are numerically estimated in an online manner. Actually, in both simulations and real experiments without knowledge of the interests between the agents, they correctly estimated their interests, thereby allowing them to derive their new rewards to represent the feasible group behaviors in the decentralized manner. As a result, our extended algorithm succeeded in acquiring the group behaviors from cooperative tasks to competitive tasks.

AB Since many practical physical phenomena can be depicted more accurately and suitablely by fractional-order models, this work addresses the event-triggered consensus tracking for the fractional-order multiagent systems (FOMASs) governed by general linear models. Firstly, a distributed event-triggered control algorithm relied on state feedback is derived. Then, according to the Laplace transform, the Mittag-Leffler function, the comparison test of improper integral, and the technique of inequality, some consensus criteria are obtained to ensure all followers can track a dynamic leader and Zeno behavior can be avoided. Lastly, some numerical simulation results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the event-triggered method. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In physical systems, since the acceleration is always regard as the control input, it is meaningful to study the coordination problems of the second-order multi-agent system. This paper devotes to the mean-square H-infinity antagonistic formation control of second-order multi-agent systems with multiplicative noises and external disturbances under directed signed topologies. To force all agents achieve antagonistic formation and attenuate the effect of communication noises and external disturbances, a novel distributed consensus control protocol with a time-invariant control gain is proposed where only the information that received from neighbors is utilized. And then, by combining the theories of graph, robust H-infinity control and stochastic analysis, some matrix inequalities conditions are deduced. It is proved that under the designed control protocol, the state of each agent converge to its own desired formation in its allied groups in the sense of mean square. Furthermore, numerical simulations are given for the purpose of showing that the proposed theoretical results are effective. (C) 2019 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this technical note, we deal with the finite-time cluster average consensus in bidirectional networks. By designing distributed linear iterations involving stochastic matrices consistent with a network topology, we show that cluster average consensus can always be achieved in finite time for bidirectional networks containing cluster-spanning trees. An algorithm for the proposed finite-time cluster average consensus is presented. Numerical simulations on a realistic social network are presented to illustrate the availability of the obtained theoretical results.

AB The objective of this paper is to develop a novel consensus algorithm or protocol for multi-agent systems in the event of communication link failure over the network. The structure or topology of the system is modeled by an algebraic graph theory, and considered as a discrete time-invariant system with a second-order dynamics. Bernoulli distribution is applied to represent the data dropout during operation. The sufficient conditions for the stabilization controller design is developed by Lyapunov-based methodologies and Linear matrix inequality (LMIs) techniques. The feasibility of the given LMIs is analyzed to verify the stabilization of controller design, which ensures the MAS to achieve the consensus. Leader-following numerical simulations with a group of agents are successfully conducted based on the effect of data losses, initial values, communication weights, and number of agents to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel consensus algorithm in this paper. Finally, experimental studies are carried out by using two Pioneer 3-DX mobile robots and one Pioneer 3-AT mobile robot as a team to verify the proposed work.

We propose a decentralized motion coordination control for the agents so that they collectively move in a desired geometric pattern from any initial position. There are no predefined leaders in the group and only local information is required for the control. The control algorithm is developed using the ideas of information consensus, and its effectiveness is illustrated via numerical simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A group of distributed cooperative recursive filters, in the sense of minimum-variance unbiased, was developed, where the estimations of unknown input and state were combined. A necessary and sufficient existing condition is presented and proven for the proposed distributed cooperative filters. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the existing condition of the proposed filters is significantly relaxed, in comparison to that of conventional decentralized filters.

The vote of each agent is determined from four variables related to economic indicators, quality of public services, ethical conduct of the current administration, and political profile of the voting population. In addition, each agent can be influenced by the opinion of the nearest neighbors. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate how these variables affect the elected candidate. The proposed model is also used to reproduce the presidential elections held in Brazil in 2010 and in Uruguay in 2019. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The stability of consensus in linear and nonlinear multi-agent systems with periodically switched communication topology is studied using Floquet theory. The proposed strategy is illustrated for the cases of consensus in linear single-integrator, higher-order integrator, and leader-follower consensus. In addition, the application of Floquet theory in analyzing special cases such as switched systems with joint connectivity, unstable subsystems, and nonlinear systems, including the use of feedback linearization and local linearization in the Kuramoto model, is also studied. By utilizing Floquet theory for multi-agent systems with periodically switched communication topologies, one can simultaneously evaluate the effects of each subsystem's convergence rate and dwell time on overall behavior. Numerical simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in stability analysis of all these cases.

AB This paper solves the rotating consensus problem for a group of double-integrator agents with event-based communication only. We propose a distributed event-based rotating consensus protocol, which guarantees that a consensus regarding both position and velocity is achieved when all agents exhibit circular motion around the same center. It is observed that overall less communication is required as the communication between agents is only needed at event times. Moreover, with the proposed event-based protocol, it is proved that Zeno behavior can be strictly avoided for each agent. Numerical simulations show that this event-based control law can efficiently solve the rotating consensus problem.

AB In this paper, we consider the distributed flocking control problem of multi-agent nonholonomic systems with a virtual leader whose dynamics is unknown; state information is time varying and not available to all agents under both fixed and switching topologies. On the basis of the relative velocity and orientation information of neighboring agents, two distributed discontinuous control protocols are designed for fixed and switching topologies, respectively. By using tools from algebraic graph theory and nonsmooth analysis, the proposed distributed discontinuous control protocols guarantee that the velocities and orientations of the agents exponentially converge to the velocity and orientation of the virtual leader, respectively, while ensuring collision avoidance of the whole group, if the interaction graph among agents is undirected and the virtual leader with bounded time-varying velocity has directed paths to other agents. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. Copyright (C) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a successful approach used in the MASs to acquire new behaviors; most of these select exact Q-values in small discrete state space and action space. This article presents a joint Q-function linearly fuzzified for a MAS' continuous state space, which overcomes the dimensionality problem. Also, this article gives a proof for the convergence and existence of the solution proposed by the algorithm presented. This article also discusses the numerical simulations and experimental results that were carried out to validate the proposed algorithm.

AB Recently multi agent systems are used to solve complex problems. In these systems agents can cooperate when a problem is difficult or impossible to solve for an individual agent. Via learning, the agents attempt to maximize some of their utilities. In multi agent learning an agent learns to interact with other agents and considering their behaviors. By multi task learning, the agent simultaneously learns a set of related problems and with reinforcement learning, an agent learns a proper policy to achieve its goal. In learning process, using the experience of teammate agents by simple interactions among them is very beneficial. In this paper we have presented a simple model of agents' interactions using operators of an evolutionary algorithm. Applying the proposed model has improved significantly the performance of multi task learning in a nondeterministic and dynamic environment, specifically for the dynamic maze problem. The experimental results indicate our claim.

Very few works have focused on how an agent may infer the norms of a society without the norm being explicitly given to the agent. This paper describes a mechanism for identifying one type of norm, an obligation norm. The Obligation Norm Inference (ONI) algorithm described in this paper makes use of an association rule mining approach to identify obligation norms. Using agent based simulation of a virtual restaurant we demonstrate how an agent can identify the tipping norm. The experiments that we have conducted demonstrate that an agent in the system is able to add, remove and modify norms dynamically. An agent can also flexibly modify the parameters of the system based on whether it is successful in identifying a norm.

AB In this brief paper, we study the constraint consensus problem of heterogeneous multi-agent systems. First, we provide an invariant set, which can be exactly obtained by solving linear equations. Then, a virtual system is defined on this invariant set such that it is the largest common embedded system of all the individual agents. Afterwards, a linear consensus protocol is proposed with the corresponding constraint consensus criterion. In particular, the above virtual system can reveal all the asymptotic dynamical behaviors if heterogeneous multi-agent systems achieve consensus. Finally, an example with numerical simulations is given to illustrate the validity of our criterion.

ID SIMULATION
AB The deployment of multi-agent systems demands for justified confidence into their functioning, both with respect to correctness of behaviour and with respect to timeliness thereof. Depending. on the stage of the development process different mechanisms and abstractions are needed to facilitate the evaluation of interacting agents. We propose a modelling and simulation framework based on a discrete-event formalism for supporting the development process of multi-agent systems; from specification to implementation. The framework allows for the incremental refinement of agents and experimental set-ups while providing rigorous observation facilities. The benefit of using discrete-event modelling and simulation techniques for evaluating agents is illustrated using a simple example based on the Contract Net Protocol.

AB This paper investigates the formation control and obstacle avoidance problem for multi-agent systems (MASs), which aims to coordinate the pursuer agents to capture a mobile target. The target appears at a location randomly and its movement obeys Reactive Rabbit Model. The pursuers and the mobile target can be modeled as a Pursuit-Evasion Game (PEG). During the movement, not all of the pursuer agents can obtain the real-time information of the target. Moreover, the obstacle avoidance makes the formation of pursuer agents a big challenge to encircle the mobile target. In order to tackle these two problems, the formation control and obstacle avoidance algorithm is presented in this paper based on a novel virtual leader-follower strategy and potential functions. The obstacle avoidance problem can then be solved by constructing a velocity potential. The numerical analysis and simulation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Home Health Care (HHC) services are growing worldwide. HHC providers that employ their caregivers have to manage operational decisions such as assigning patients to caregivers and planning the caregivers' routes. Centralized "off-line" approaches are generally used to deal with both these problems. In this paper, we solved the caregiver routing problem in a dynamic and distributed way using a Multi-agent system (MAS) to simulate caregiver behavior. Four decision rules were developed for the caregivers: NPR (Nearest Patient Rule), NRR (No-wait Route Rule), SRR (Shortest Route Rule), and BRR (Balanced Route Rule). These decision rules were implemented and tested on a multi-agent platform to assess their performances. We designed an experimental plan based on case studies that represent different sizes of HHC provider inspired from real-world examples. The results obtained show the relevance of using local decision rules to plan the caregiver's route. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a cooperative adaptive control of leader-following uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems is proposed. The communication network is weighted undirected graph with fixed topology. The uncertain nonlinear model for each agent is a higher-order integrator with unknown nonlinear functions, unknown disturbances and unknown input actuators. Meanwhile, the gains of input actuators are unknown nonlinear functions with unknown sign. Two most common behaviors of input actuators in practical applications are hysteresis and dead-zone. In this paper, backlash-like hysteresis and dead-zone are used to model the input actuators. Using universal approximation theorem proved for neural networks, the unknown nonlinear functions are tackled. The unknown weights of neural networks are derived by proposing appropriate adaptive laws. To cope with modeling errors and disturbances an adaptive robust structure is proposed. Considering Lyapunov synthesis approach not only all the adaptive laws are derived but also it is proved that the closed-loop network is cooperatively semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (CSUUB). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied to agents modeled with highly nonlinear mathematical equations and inverted pendulums. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method in dealing with both numerical and practical multi-agent systems.

AB In this paper, the prescribed finite-time consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems (MASs) is considered based on distributed event-triggered control strategies. It has been presented in the literatures that the prescribed finite time is independent of initial conditions or any other parameters, and can be pre-specified by the designer. Different from the existing prescribed finite-time consensus control rules that are based on continuous communication between agents and their neighbors, the proposed control laws in this paper are built on event-triggered mechanism. Furthermore, because the control schemes involve a time-varying scaling function, the Zeno behavior is hard to be excluded by the traditional approaches. To solve this problem, a dynamical event-triggered controller concerning time-varying variables to agents is proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB The consensus problem of first-order multi-agent systems with time delay is investigated. The periodic sample and event hybrid control method is applied. Specifically, each agent samples its own states periodically and decides when to transmit its sampled states to its neighbors based on certain event. The agents' distributed consensus algorithms are based on these hybrid sampled and event-triggered state measurements, which can significantly decrease the number of the controllers' updates. The Zeno behavior which is discussed in most worlcs considering event-based consensus of multi-agent systems is excluded automatically since the span between two contiguous event-triggering time instants is not less than the sampling period. The cases of directed and undirected topologies are both considered. The obtained results improve the existing ones in the literature. A numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Interconnected social and environmental systems are the domain of ecological economics, and models can be used to explore feedbacks and adaptations inherent in these systems. Agent-based modeling (ABM) represents autonomous entities, each with dynamic behavior and heterogeneous characteristics. Agents interact with each other and their environment, resulting in emergent outcomes at the macroscale that can be used to quantitatively analyze complex systems. ABM is contributing to research questions in ecological economics in the areas of natural resource management and land-use change, urban systems modeling, market dynamics, changes in consumer attitudes, innovation, and diffusion of technology and management practices, commons dilemmas and self-governance, and psychological aspects to human decision making and behavior change. Frontiers for ABM research in ecological economics involve advancing the empirical calibration and validation of models through mixed methods, including surveys, interviews, participatory modeling, and, notably, experimental economics to test specific decision-making hypotheses. Linking ABM with other modeling techniques at the level of emergent properties will further advance efforts to understand dynamics of social-environmental systems.

AB We study the containment control problem for high-order heterogeneous nonlinear multi-agent systems under distributed event-triggered schemes. To achieve the containment control objective and reduce communication consumption among agents, a distributed event-triggered control scheme is proposed by applying the backstepping method, Lyapunov functional approach, and neural networks. Then, the results are extended to the self-triggered control case to avoid continuous monitoring of state errors. The developed protocols and triggered rules ensure that the output for each follower converges to the convex hull spanned by multi-leader signals within a bounded error. In addition, no agent exhibits Zeno behavior. Two numerical simulations are finally presented to verify the correctness of the obtained results.

This paper presents a Process for developing Efficient Agent-Based Simulators, called PEABS, which combines the use of an agent-oriented modeling language with a framework adapted for obtaining efficient agent-based simulators. The proposed process covers all the development phases from the requirements elicitation until the deployment of a complete functional multi-agent system for simulation. As a case study, a simulator, which consists of an agent-based system that imitates tourist behaviors when selecting routes in the historic center of Madrid city, is constructed following the new process. The process is evaluated with this simulator and another one that simulates the evolution of student sociograms. These simulators with the same specifications were developed using an alternative process. The experimental comparison shows that the time devoted to development are at least 22% shorter with the current process. The systems constructed with this new process are more efficient in terms of execution time and memory usage than the systems developed with the other process. The final systems developed with PEABS are also more usable for the domain experts than the ones developed with the alternative process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article we study the convergence of the positions of a multi-agent system in a cyclic pursuit under asynchronism and time delays. Each agent is assumed to operate on an infinite sequence of behaviors modeled by a finite state machine, which is represented by a discrete asynchronous mathematical model on a higher-level. The results on the convergence of the synchronous model are used in the proof of convergence of the asynchronous system. Numerical simulations are also performed to verify the theoretical results.

AB Without assuming that the communication topology can remain its connectivity frequently enough and the potential function can provide an infinite force during the evolution of agents, the flocking problem of multi-agent systems with second-order non-linear dynamics is investigated in this study. By combining the ideas of collective potential functions and velocity consensus, a connectivity-preserving flocking algorithm with bounded potential function is proposed. Using tools from the algebraic graph theory and matrix analysis, it is proved that the designed algorithm can guarantee the group of multiple agents to asymptotically move with the same velocity while preserving the network connectivity if the coupling strength of the velocity consensus term is larger than a threshold value. Furthermore, the flocking algorithm is extended to solve the flocking problem of multi-agent systems with a dynamical virtual leader by adding a navigation feedback term. In this case, each informed agent only has partial velocity information about the leader, yet the present algorithm not only can guarantee the velocity of the whole group to track that of the leader asymptotically, and also can preserve the network connectivity. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results.

The leader's input is nonzero and unavailable to the followers. Based on the relative output measurements of neighbouring agents, a novel observer-based cooperative tracking protocol is presented, where the a group of intermediate estimators are constructed to estimate the tracking errors and the combined signal of the disturbances and the leader's input simultaneously, then decentralised tracking protocols are designed based on the obtained estimates. The states of the global tracking error system are proved to be uniformly ultimately bounded. A numerical example of aircraft illustrates the effectiveness of the cooperative tracking protocol.

AB Agents of a multi-agent system (MAS) must synchronize whenever they want to perform simultaneous actions. In situated MASs, typically, the control over such synchronization is centralized, i.e. one synchronizer has the supervision on all agents of the MAS. As a consequence, all agents are forced to act at a global pace and that does not fit with autonomy of agents. Besides, global synchronization implies centralized control, in general an undesirable property of MASs. In this paper we present an algorithm that allows agents to synchronize with other agents within their perceptual range. The result of the algorithm is the formation of independent groups of synchronized agents. The composition of these groups depends on the locality of the agents and dynamically changes when agents enter or leave each others perceptual range. Since in this approach agents are only synchronized with colleagues in their region, the pace on which they act only depends on the acting speed of potential collaborating agents. The price for decentralization of synchronization is the communication overhead to set up the groups. In the paper, we discuss experimental results and compare the benefits of regional synchronization with its costs.

AB In this paper, a distributed event-triggered algorithm was proposed to solve a convex quadratic optimization problem of multi-agent systems under undirected and connected topologies. The event-triggered condition of each agent just requires its own state value and the state values of its neighbors at the triggering time, and hence the continuous communication and calculation are not required. Moreover, the minimum event-triggered interval is bounded by the sampling time and the Zeno behavior is therefore naturally avoided. The result is also extended to the networks with undirected and switching topologies. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB The paper aims to establish a general framework for robust output synchronization of a group of networked agents. The agents under investigation have nonlinear, uncertain and heterogeneous dynamics. Output synchronization denotes that all agents, through collaborative control, achieve output agreement and follow a desired pattern. In particular, the agreed trajectory is not defined by nor known to any agent in advance. Collaborative control is achieved using only output information from neighboring agents. Two concurrent actions are revealed in the proposed synchronization framework. This framework involves design strategies for both perturbed consensus and perturbed regulation problems, subject to a class of small gain conditions. The success of the framework is verified by constructive proof and numerical simulation.

ID DESIGN
AB This paper proposes a data-driven cooperative method for load frequency control (LFC) of the multi-area power system based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) in continuous action domain. The proposed method can nonlinearly and adaptively derive the optimal coordinated control strategies for multiple LFC controllers through centralized learning and decentralized implementation. The centralized learning is achieved by MA-DRL based on a global action-value function to quantify overall LFC performance of the power system. To solve the MA-DRL problem, multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is derived to adjust control agents parameters considering the nonlinear generator behaviors. For implementation, each individual controller only needs local information in its control area to deliver optimal control signals. Numerical simulations on a three-area power system and the fully-modeled New-England 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize control errors against stochastic frequency variations caused by load and renewable power fluctuations.

AB Choice set formation, location and mode preferences, coordinated scheduling, alternative utility valuations, and shared mobility resources are among the many activity-travel issues hypothesized to be significantly influenced by traveler interdependencies. Empirical evidence lags theory, particularly about the geography of social networks. A simulation tool is presented to let the experimenter construct and test hypothetical interdependencies between geography, socially-linked travelers, and activity-travel choices. The exploratory tool is integrated in the Multi-Agent Transportation Simulation Toolbox (MatSim-T). Initially, any social network can be constructed and embedded in geography. It can remain static, or be adapted to the travel patterns of the agents. The interactions and exchanges between agents influencing socializing and/or travel behavior can be defined in substance and in time/space. The reward for socializing or being socially linked can be varied. Finally, the co-dependence of social factors and travel behavior can be studied. This paper introduces the model and presents verification results which illustrate the coupling of extremely simplified socializing assumptions and travel behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper analytically investigates an event-triggered leader-following consensus in second-order multi-agent systems with time delay in the control input. Each agent's update of control input is driven by properly defined event, which depends on the measurement error, the states of its neighboring agents at their individual time instants, and an exponential decay function. Necessary and sufficient conditions are presented to ensure a leader-following consensus. Moreover, the control is updated only when the event-triggered condition is satisfied, which significantly decreases the number of communication among nodes, avoided effectively the continuous communication of the information channel among agents and excluded the Zeno-behavior of triggering time sequences. A numerical simulation example is given to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the distributed event-triggered cooperative output regulation problem for heterogeneous linear continuous-time multi-agent systems (MASs). To eliminate the requirement of continuous communication among interacting following agents, an event-triggered adaptive distributed observer is skillfully devised. Furthermore, a class of closed-loop estimators is constructed and implemented on each agent such that the triggering times on each agent can be significantly reduced while at the same time the desired control performance can be preserved. Compared with the existing open-loop estimators, the proposed estimators can provide more accurate state estimates during each triggering period. It is further shown that the concerned cooperative output regulation problem can be effectively resolved under the proposed control scheme and the undesirable Zeno behavior can be excluded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed results is verified by numerical simulations.

AB Public opinion inversion and other nonlinear phenomena often occur during online social network information dissemination (OSNID) in modern society. To explore the influence of overconfidence on OSNID, we develop a multi-agent simulation model integrating overconfidence and evolutionary games, as previous research has scarcely paid any attention to irrational behavior in information dissemination. This integrated paradigm provides an effective tool for managers to control the spread of OSNID and reduce the harm caused by rumors. The theoretical model is constructed from the perspective of an evolutionary game and, combined with overconfidence theory, three overconfidence scenarios are designed: benefit overconfidence, cost overconfidence, and both benefit and cost overconfidence. Then, a multi-agent simulation model of OSNID under different overconfidence scenarios is realized. The proposed simulation model exhibited better performance (e.g., faster diffusion speed) than the traditional Bass model; its performance was also validated by comparison with real-world cases. The results demonstrate that (1) with increasing benefit overconfidence, the convergence speed of OSNID will be accelerated, and the user group will reach stability at a faster speed. (2) With increasing cost overconfidence, the user's decision will change from adopting dominant to tit-for-tat, and the adoption ratio will gradually decrease. (3) Compared with overconfidence in earnings, overconfidence in costs is more conducive to improving stability. This study attempts to provide new ideas for OSNID and attempts to propose an integration framework for behavioral theory and simulation methods.

AB This multidisciplinary work presents synopsis of theories in the search for common field-like fundamental principles of self-organisation and communication existing on quantum, cellular, and even social levels. Based on these fundamental principles, we formulate conceptually novel social neuroscience paradigm (OSIMAS), which envisages social systems emerging from the coherent neurodynamical processes taking place in the individual mind-fields. In this way, societies are understood as global processes emerging from the superposition of the conscious and subconscious mind-fields of individual members of society. For the experimental validation of the biologically inspired OSIMAS paradigm, we have designed a framework of EEG-based experiments. Initial baseline individual tests of spectral cross-correlations of EEG-recorded brainwave patterns for some mental states have been provided in this paper. Preliminary experimental results do not refute the main OSIMAS postulates. This paper also provides some insights for the construction of OSIMAS-based simulation models.

AB A multi-agent model of travelers competing to utilize a roadway in time and space is presented in this paper to illustrate the effect of congestion and pricing on traveler behaviors and network equilibrium. To realize the spillover effect among travelers, N-player games are constructed in which the strategy set includes N+1 strategies. We solve the N-player game (for N <= 7) and find Nash equilibria if they exist. This model is compared to the bottleneck model. The results of numerical simulation show that the two models yield identical results in terms of lowest total costs and marginal costs when a social optimum exists.

AB This paper considers the distributed event-triggered consensus problem for multi-agent systems with general linear dynamics under a directed graph. We propose a novel distributed event-triggered consensus controller with state-dependent threshold for each agent to achieve consensus. In this strategy, continuous communication in both controller update and triggering condition monitoring is not required, which means the proposed strategy is fully continuous communication free. Each agent only needs to monitor its own state continuously to determine if the event is triggered. Additionally, the approach shown here provides consensus with guaranteed positive inter-event time intervals. Therefore, there is no Zeno behavior under the proposed consensus control algorithm. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB In this paper, we develop a novel self-propelled particle model to describe the emergent behavior of a group of mobile agents. Each agent coordinates with its neighbors through a local force accounting for velocity alignment and collision avoidance. The interactions between agents are governed by path loss influence and state-dependent rules, which results in topology changes as well as discontinuities in the local forces. By using differential inclusion technique and algebraic graph theory, we show that collective behavior emerges while collisions between agents can be avoided, if the interaction topology is jointly connected. A trade-off between the path loss influence and connectivity condition to guarantee the collective behavior is discovered and discussed. Numerical simulations are given to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the time-varying formation problem of general multi-agent systems with undirected topology via observer-based event-triggered control schemes. The distributed event-triggered control scheme and self-triggered control scheme are developed respectively. Each agent updates its next event time using current information without continuous communication in self-triggered control strategy. Formation error and state estimation error are considered simultaneously to get more accurate formation. Meanwhile, it is only when a request is received that each agent broadcasts its information. It is demonstrated that the time-varying formation can be achieved asymptotically under the two proposed control schemes and Zeno behavior can be excluded. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed observer-based event-triggered control strategies.

AB In open multiagent systems, agents depend on reputation and trust mechanisms to evaluate the behavior of potential partners. Often these evaluations are associated with a measure of reliability that the source agent computes. However, due to the subjectivity of reputation-related information, this can lead to serious problems when considering communicated social evaluations. In this paper, instead of considering only reliability measures computed from the sources, we provide a mechanism that allows the recipient decide whether the piece of information is reliable according to its own knowledge. We do it by allowing the agents engage in an argumentation-based dialog specifically designed for the exchange of social evaluations. We evaluate our framework through simulations. The results show that in most of the checked conditions, agents that use our dialog framework significantly improve (statistically) the accuracy of the evaluations, over the agents that do not use it. In particular, the simulations reveal that when there is a heterogeneity set of agents (not all the agents have the same goals) and agents base part of their inferences on third-party information, it is worth using our dialog protocol.

AB We address the issue of rational communicative behavior among autonomous self-interested agents that have to make decisions as to what to communicate, to whom, and how. Following decision theory, we postulate that a rational speaker should design a speech act so as to optimize the benefit it obtains as the result of the interaction. We quantify the gain in the quality of interaction in terms of the expected utility, and we present a framework that allows an agent to compute the expected utilities of various communicative actions. Our framework uses the Recursive Modeling Method as the specialized representation used for decision-making in a multi-agent environment. This representation includes information about the agent's state of knowledge, including the agent's preferences, abilities and beliefs about the world, as well as the beliefs the agent has about the other agents, the beliefs it has about the other agents' beliefs, and so on. Decision-theoretic pragmatics of a communicative act can be then defined as the transformation the act induces on the agent's state of knowledge about its decision-making situation. This transformation leads to a change in the quality of interaction, expressed in terms of the expected utilities of the agent's best actions before and after the communicative act. We analyze decision-theoretic pragmatics of a number of important kinds of communicative acts and investigate their expected utilities using examples. Finally, we report on the agreement between our method of message selection and messages that human subjects choose in various circumstances, and show an implementation and experimental validation of our framework in a simulated multi-agent environment.

AB Over the past decades, the formation control of a group of mobile agents has received extensive attention from industrial and academic communities due to its widespread applications, such as spacecraft clusters [1,2], mobile robot teams [3], coordination control of autonomous underwater vehicles [4], cooperative of unmanned aerial vehicles [5,6], etc. To execute these formation operations, the prime concern is to develop a sequence of distributed formation control strategies for networked multi-agent systems such that the desired geometric formation configuration can be achieved in real time [7,8]. So far, a variety of works have been devoted on the formation control design for MASs [9?12]. Meng et al. [13] investi
   In this work, the distributed fixed-time formation control problem for a group of second order multi-agent systems is investigated with consideration of collision avoidance, external disturbances, and connected undirected topology. As a stepping stone, a novel distributed fixed-time sliding manifold is proposed to achieve the predefined convergence performance. Furthermore, by combining repulsive potential function with the presented sliding manifold, an adaptive fixed-time formation protocol is developed to guarantee the tracking errors converge to small regions of zero, whilst providing collision avoidance ability for multiple agents. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

AB This paper investigates a circle formation control problem for multi-agent systems with directed topologies via pull-based distributed event-triggered control principles. Firstly, for scenarios of continuous communication, a pull-based distributed event-triggered principle is proposed. It is proved that if the communication topology is irreducible and has a directed spanning tree, the event-triggered coupling continuous communication can lead multiple agents to form a desired circle formation. Then, the results are extended to discontinuous communication scenarios, where all the agents use a model of their neighborhoods to generate self-triggered instants without monitoring continuously, update the local controller here, and if necessary, local broadcast information based on the adopted control inputs to neighboring agents. In addition, Zeno behavior can be excluded during the whole process. Finally, numerical simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed circle formation control methods.

AB This work addresses the leader-following consensus control of continuous-time single-integrator multi-agents systems with measurement noises and time-delays. As often happened in practical applications, the states information received by an agent from its neighbors are assumed with time-delays and contaminated by additive or multiplicative noises. Using stochastic analysis tools and algebraic graph theory, the mean square leader-following consensus and the almost sure leader-following consensus are proposed for multi-agent systems under additive and multiplicative noises, respectively. For the case with additive noises, the sufficient conditions of the mean square and the almost sure leader-following consensus are obtained by employing the variation of constants formula. As to the case with multiplicative noises, Lyapunov functional is constructed to get the sufficient conditions for the leader-following consensus, where the agents converge to the leader with an exponential rate. These results show that for any given time-delay and noise intensity, the two consensus can be achieved under the appropriate control gains. Numerical simulations are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a general solution to the formation control problem without collisions for first-order multi-agent systems is proposed. The case of an arbitrary number of mobile agents on a plane with saturated input velocity is analysed. Besides, conditions on the communication graph among agents are relaxed to the only requirement of containing a directed spanning tree. This general approach is an extended result from the simpler case of combinations of cyclic pursuit communication graphs. The proposed solution to this problem is designed in two steps. First, the asymptotic convergence in the absence of collisions is ensured. After this, the non-collision problem is faced by analysing the most general possible geometrical scenario which can lead to collision among agents. Discontinuous vector fields with unstable counterclockwise focus behaviour are applied by every agent in order to repel each other. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme.

We study networks with parameter uncertainties, resulting in heterogeneous agent dynamics, and we analyze the robustness of their output synchronization. The networks under consideration consist of non-identical double-integrators and harmonic oscillators. The geometric approach to linear control theory reveals structural requirements for non-trivial output synchronization in such networks. Furthermore, a clock synchronization problem and a circular motion coordination problem are discussed as applications corresponding to these two network types. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, the controller updates and communications between neighboring agents considered here are event-triggered, depending on the specified threshold of a certain measurement error by contrast with the norm of a function with state-dependent. Sufficient conditions on both uniform and arbitrary circle formation are derived under which the resulting asynchronous network executions converge to some equilibrium point. Furthermore, we show that the Zeno behavior can be avoided under the proposed control laws. Numerical simulation results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB In coordinative control of a network of multi-agent systems, to guarantee the stability of the coordinated motion, a basic assumption typically is that the underlying topology of the network can maintain its connectivity frequently enough during the motion evolution. However, for a given set of initial conditions, this assumption is very difficult to satisfy and verify. In particular, the connectivity of the initial network generally cannot guarantee the connectivity of the network throughout the evolution. In this paper, we propose a rendezvous protocol with double-integrator dynamics, which combines the functions of motion control and connectivity preservation. This protocol can enable the group of mobile agents to converge to the same position and move with the same velocity while preserving the connectivity of the whole net-work during the evolution if the initial network is connected. We find that there is a trade-off between the maximum overshoot and the settling time of the velocity convergence. Furthermore, we investigate the rendezvous protocol with a virtual leader and show that all agents can asymptotically attain a desired velocity even if only one agent in the team has information about the virtual leader. We finally show some numerical simulations to verify and illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Repeated practice is one of the most effective methods in improving the performance of coordination control tasks for groups of individuals, such as marching band, soldier (tank or warcraft) formation, and unmanned aerial vehicle flying queue. The key objective of this paper is to give a theoretical explanation for this observed behavior by considering a class of coordination learning problems for groups of mobile agents. To be specific, the agents are considered to preserve the desired relative formations between each other through a learning process, for which iterative rules are applied to construct distributed algorithms based on the relative information between each agent and its neighbors. Convergence results are derived by combining the graph theory based method and the Lyapunov analysis, which can address coordination learning problems for multi-agent systems both with and without a reference as the prior knowledge. In addition, numerical simulation results are provided to demonstrate the coordination learning performance for groups of mobile agents. (C) 2013 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID GENETIC ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper presents a novel approach to the facility layout design problem based on multi-agent society where agents' interactions form the facility layout design. Each agent corresponds to a facility with inherent characteristics, emotions, and a certain amount of money, forming its utility function. An agent's money is adjusted during the learning period by a manager agent while each agent tries to tune the parameters of its utility function in such a way that its total layout cost can be minimized in competition with others. The agents' interactions are formed based on market mechanism. In each step, an unoccupied location is presented to all applicant agents, for which each agent proposes a price proportionate to its utility function. The agent proposing a higher price is selected as the winner and assigned to that location by an appropriate space-filling curve. The proposed method utilizes the fuzzy theory to establish each agent's utility function. In addition, it provides a simulation environment using an evolutionary algorithm to form different interactions among the agents and makes it possible for them to experience various strategies. The experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a lower total layout cost compared with state of the art methods.

AB In this note, robust consensus for a class of nonlinear second-order multiagent systems with uncertainties is investigated from an event-triggered control approach. An event-triggered distributed control protocol is designed to achieve semiglobal robust leaderless consensus for directed graphs. To guarantee the feasibility of the proposed scheme, the event-based consensus is converted to an event-based stabilization for analysis. Zeno behavior is avoided under the proposed event-triggered mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered scheme is demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB This paper investigates the problem of controlling multiple mobile agents to maintain a desired geometric formation within a constrained environment. The influence of diversity of the perception radius and initial velocity is considered by using a fuzzy-logic-based potential function. A virtual leader is introduced to direct the group to track a desired path. Then the motion of the group is examined with the velocity damping and the mass of all the agents, respectively. By LaSalle's invariant principle, not only the system stability can be guaranteed, but also the desired formation pattern without collisions with given boundary of a multi-agent system can be achieved. Numerical simulations are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed control scheme.

AB Using a multi-agent system (MAS), the present research offers a model for an interactive decentralized operation of a multi-carrier energy system which includes electrical, thermal, and cooling loads. The novelty of the proposed model is that the photovoltaic (PV) agent as a renewable energy producer can directly influence the clearing price of electrical interaction without any supervisory control and only through communicating with other agents. Using battery storage status and upper grid energy price, this agent calculates its own power generation for each hour which results in optimization of social welfare and personal profit. In the current work, using decentralized private ownership in a multi-energy system leads to a plug and play feature which makes system development and scaling easier. Then, to evaluate decentralized approach, the proposed model is simulated with Any Logic programming package and its numerical results are compared to those of the centralized model. The results show that the effective presence of PV agent in electrical interaction decreases the social welfare while increases personal profit.

AB This paper addresses the problem of cluster formation control for a networked multi-agent system (MAS) in the simultaneous presence of aperiodic sampling and communication delays. First, to fulfill multiple formation tasks, a group of agents are decomposed into M distinct and nonoverlapping clusters. The agents in each cluster are then driven to achieve a desired formation, whereas the MAS as a whole accomplishes M cluster formations. Second, by a proper modeling of aperiodic sampling and communication delays, an aperiodic sampled-data cluster formation protocol (CFP) is delicately constructed such that the information exchanges among neighboring agents only occur intermittently at discrete instants of time. Third, a detailed theoretical analysis of cluster formability is carried out and a sufficient and necessary condition is provided such that the system is M-cluster formable. Furthermore, a discontinuous Lyapunov functional approach is developed to derive a design criterion on the existence of an admissible sampled-data CFP. Finally, numerical simulations on a team of nonholonomic mobile robots are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical result.

AB This paper investigates the sampled-data consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems via new event-based control. Both the leaderless and leader-following consensus problems are considered. Different from the existing results, the state information is assumed to be unknown for each following agent and only the relative output information between neighbouring agents can be measured. A new Kx-functional observer-based output feedback event-based protocol is designed, which may have lower dimension than the full-order and reduced-order observer. The improved event-based condition bounds each agent's measurement error by a time-dependent threshold. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is excluded by showing that the inter-event time between any two triggering events is lower bounded by a strictly positive value. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols.

AB In this paper, we propose an architecture for safe, collision-free formation reconfiguration of a team of autonomous agents. Our approach is based on abstracting the agent formation by a rectangular grid. We develop a discrete-event coordination strategy that plans collision-free transitions between arbitrarily defined formations. The coordination strategy implementation is based on a well-established control design methodology for manufacturing systems. Agent dynamics are modeled taking into account realistic, non-holonomic constraints. Using the concept of leader-to-formation stability, we propose controller tuning guidelines to ensure that the actual multi-agent system behavior conforms to the discrete-event motion plan. Group navigation is achieved by integrating a way point controller with this novel grid-based formation reconfiguration scheme. The proposed hybrid architecture is capable of driving a group of agents through a cluttered environment, while maintaining specified formation constraints. We present simulated and experimental results verifying the validity of our methodology.

ID SPACECRAFT FORMATION
AB Nonlinear control protocols are proposed for consensus control of a multi-agent system of N heterogeneous rigid bodies in the framework of the tangent bundles TSO(3) and TSE(3) associated with Lie groups SO(3) and SE(3), respectively. The control objective is to stabilise the relative pose configurations with velocity synchronisation of the rigid bodies which share their states according to a static undirected communication topology. The feedback control design is conducted on the dynamic level, and uses the rotation matrix as opposed to various attitude parameterisations. Almost global asymptotic stability of the consensus subspace is demonstrated both analytically using an extension of the Morse-Lyapunov (M-L) approach, and through numerical simulations. Also, the presence of unstable non-consensus equilibria in the closed-loop dynamics is discussed and shown in illustrative examples.

ID SIMULTANEOUS GRAPHIC GENERALIZATION; AUTOMATED MAP GENERALIZATION;
   BUILDING DISPLACEMENT
AB In automatic map compilation, both the scale reduction and the geometric transformation of map features may give rise to spatial conflicts. Several generalization approaches have been established to resolve this problem, mainly for the displacement operator. This paper proposes one such approach that is based on the snake model and multiple agents. It focuses on the resolution of various spatial conflicts that emerge when generalizing the rural areas of medium density. In this approach, the map features are converted into map agent, object agent, group agent, and conflicting agent, and the spatial relationships between these features are managed by an auxiliary relationship agent. Each agent is assigned with tasks accordingly, and all agents collaborate with each other to complete the generalization. The snake-based algorithm is applied in the conflicting agent when it identifies a certain configuration. The experimental results indicate that the approach proposed in this paper can obtain good results.

ID PHASE-TRANSITION; HARD; SYNCHRONIZATION
AB Chemical self-assembly has been considered one of the most important scientific problems in the 21st century; however, because the process of self-assembly is very complex, there is currently little mathematic theory describing it. Based on some assumptions of the classic hard sphere model, this paper presents a novel multi-agent system for chemical self-assembly that can be formulated as a group of stochastic differential equations. In consideration of this model, an existence and uniqueness theorem of the solution is presented. An optimal problem is proposed by taking the temperature as the control input and choosing the Hamiltonian as the optimal object, and a numerical solution for this optimal problem is also developed. Simulations show that the proposed control scheme can greatly improve the product of self-assembly. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

DE Cooperative global output consensus; nonlinear multi-agent systems;
   heterogeneous dynamics; event-triggered control protocol
AB In this paper, the cooperative global output consensus problem is studied for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems with a directed communication topology, where each agent has different nonlinear dynamics. A novel event-triggered control protocol with a dynamic compensator is proposed. By using Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the output tracking errors exponentially converge to zero under the event-triggered control protocol. At the same time, the states of all agents are not triggered synchronously, that is, whether each agent triggers or not only depends on its own state information. Moreover, with the unified frame work of the distributed event-triggered strategy, all the inter-event times are lower-bounded by a positive constant and the Zeno behaviour is excluded. Finally, some numerical simulation examples are given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed event-triggered consensus protocol.

AB In this paper, affine formation control problems of heterogeneous multi-agent systems with linear dynamics are studied. As a novel method, the affine formation control has the ability to handle various movement constraints based on the affine transformation. A proportional-integral (PI)-type control scheme is proposed to ensure the effective affine formation control of the leader-following group with directed interaction graphs and successfully eliminate the steady-state errors. Sufficient conditions for the selection of control parameters are given and proved. Considering that the followers are subjected to the external bounded time-varying disturbances, the designed protocol shows good robustness and can guarantee uniformly ultimate boundedness of affine formation errors. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the theoretical results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper considers the flocking problem of a group of autonomous agents moving in Euclidean space with a virtual leader. We investigate the dynamic properties of the group for the case where the state of the virtual leader may be time-varying and the topology of the neighbouring relations between agents is dynamic. To track such a leader, we introduce a set of switching control laws that enable the entire group to generate the desired stable flocking motion. The control law acting on each agent relies on the state information of its neighbouring agents and the external reference signal (or 'virtual leader'). Then we prove that, if the acceleration of the virtual leader is known, then each agent can follow the virtual leader, and the convergence rate of the centre of mass (CoM) can be estimated; if the acceleration is unknown, then the velocities of all agents asymptotically approach the velocity of the CoM, thus the flocking motion can be obtained. However, in this case, the final velocity of the group may not be equal to the desired velocity. Numerical simulations are worked out to illustrate our theoretical results.

AB We conducted movement analysis using ant experiments and simulation models. In our experiments, Japanese carpenter ants showed Levy-like movements when they were exposed to a bowl-shaped test container filled with other foragers. We also developed a one-dimensional multi-agent random walk algorithm. In our algorithm, agents interact with each other and change their probabilities of movements by locally anticipating other agents' moving directions. Agents also modulate those probabilities on the basis of local information, thereby producing fluctuations in averaged local directional information. We were able to induce agents in our model to achieve Levy-like movements. We also found that an agent occasionally moved or stayed together with another particular agent for a substantial duration in both experiments and simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The promise of agent-based for explicating properties of social systems has not yet been fully realized. Agent models sometimes provide only a veneer of, rather than substantive engagement with, social behavior. The problem will be illustrated with Axelrod's model for evolution of ethnocentrism (a biological model) versus Schelling's model for spatial segregation based on preferences (a cultural model). The examples show the need to incorporate both the biological and cultural basis for behavior through a schema that includes behavior based on cultural/cognitive processing of information and behavior based on biological/cognitive processing of information. An example of an agent-based model that implements decision making in this manner is discussed. The model accounts for heterogeneity in behavior outcomes and leads to two main predictions: (1) small scale, hunter-gatherer societies in resource scarce environments will have stable adaptations less affected by variation in resource abundance in comparison to groups in resource rich regions where inter-group conflict is more likely and (2) the relationship between community size, population size and administrative complexity will have two distinct patterns, one for patrilineally organized societies and the other for matrilineally organized societies. Both predictions have been verified empirically.

AB This paper presents the development of a multi-agent model for simulating realistic water-sharing scenarios and a means of studying and assessing an ecosystem's viability by taking under consideration environmental and socio-economical parameters. To account for farmer self-lucrative behaviours, exhibited due to the economic pressure exerted on them, the proposed model imposes constraints such as the lack of inter-farmer communication and observation. Additionally, a self-adaptive learning algorithm is proposed that compensates for such self-lucrative behaviours, despite the imposed constraints. The proposed model was calibrated using data derived from the Lake Koronia ecosystem, and experimental results provided statistical and objective figures of merit for assessing typical irrigation policies under study. As it will be demonstrated, the developed model is a viable means for assessing irrigation policies, and the proposed self-adaptive learning method is a means of guiding behaviours towards the viability of both the resource and its users.

AB This paper introduces a realistic 3D model supported virtual environment for environmental education, that highlights the importance of water resource sharing by focusing on the tragedy of the commons dilemma. The proposed virtual environment entails simulations that are controlled by a multi-agent simulation model of a real ecosystem consisting of a lake that is being drained by a community of farmers with different types of behaviours. This resembles real-life scenarios, where farmers operate under extreme economic pressure. The virtual environment provides realistic visualization of the elements of the multi-agent model in a comprehensible manner, while keeping the details and the complexity of the ecosystem hidden from the students. Extensive experiments were conducted using students divided in a control group, exposed to conventional teaching means, and an experimental group that used the proposed virtual environment. Both groups were administered questionnaires at pre-test and post-test intervals, and conclusions were drawn after qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results. It was revealed that the proposed virtual environment provided significant cognitive advancements for the students, especially for complex inter-related notions, thus constituting a valuable tool for environment education.

AB In this paper, we consider consensus of a group of heterogeneous agents with nonlinear dynamics in the presence of system uncertainties. It requires that all agent states reach an agreement which is governed by specified reference dynamics. However, the reference dynamics do not generate a specific reference trajectory for feedback regulation for any agent. For this purpose, the proposed controller integrates two fundamental actions, homogenization and consensus, concurrently. On one hand, it asymptotically regulates each individual (heterogeneous, nonlinear, and uncertain) agent dynamics to the common reference dynamics using a robust homogenization technique; on the other hand, it aligns agent trajectories, asymptotically governed by the common reference dynamics, to consensus through network cooperation. The effectiveness of the controller is verified in the rigorous proof and numerical simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB For a group of mobile agents, each agent can sense the local environment around it and directly communicate with others in its communication range. This article deals with the self-deployment problem of mobile agents to achieve a sensing coverage over the environment as large as possible, while keeping the underlying time-variant communication topology connected all the time. For this problem, a self-deployment algorithm is developed for each agent. It guarantees network connectivity by preserving the group core structure, which is extracted from the communication topology in a completely distributed, local manner and is renewed in each iteration period. Note that maintaining all the connecting edges in the core structure still remains a sufficient degree of freedom for each agent to traverse over a maximal distance from its neighbours. Thus, the distributed connected coverage objective can be achieved by spreading out the group members with the constraints of preserving the core structure. The performance of the self-deployment algorithm is demonstrated by both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations.

AB This paper studies the dynamic coverage control problem for cooperative region reconnaissance where a group of agents are required to reconnoitre a given region. The main challenge of this problem is that the sensing region of each agent is an ellipse. This modeling results in asymmetric(directed) interactions among agents. First, the region reconnaissance is formulated as a coverage problem, where each point in the given region should be surveyed until a preset level is achieved. Then, a coverage control law is designed that minimizes coverage performance index by finite switches between nominal control laws and perturbation control law. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to indicate the efficiency of the proposed control law.

DE multi-agent social systems; swarm intelligence; and models of
   intelligence
AB Multi-agent social systems (MASSes) are systems of autonomous interdependent agents, each pursuing its own goals and interacting with other agents and environment. The dynamics of the MASS cannot be adequately modeled by the methods borrowed from statistical physics because these methods do not reflect the main feature of social systems, viz., their ability to percept, process, and use external information. This important quality of distributed (swarm) intelligence has to be directly taken into account in a correct theoretical description of social systems. However, discussion of distributed intelligence (DI) in the literature is mostly restricted to distributed tasks, information exchange, and aggregated judgment, i.e., to the sum or average of independent intellectual activities. This approach ignores the empirically well-known phenomenon of collective insight in a group, which is a specific manifestation of MASS DI. In this paper, the state of art in modeling social systems and investigating intelligence per se is briefly characterized and a new modular model of intelligence is proposed. This model makes it possible to reproduce the most important result of intellectual activity, viz., the creation of new information, which is not reflected in the contemporary schemes (e.g., neural networks). In the framework of the modular approach, the correspondence between individual intelligence and MASS DI is discussed and prospective directions for future research are outlined. The efficiency of DI is estimated numerically by computer simulation of a simple system of agents with variable kinematic parameters (k(i)) that move through a pathway with obstacles. Selection of fast agents with a positive mutation of the parameters provides ca. 20% reduction in the average passing time after 200-300 generations and creates a swarm movement whereby agents follow a leader and cooperatively avoid obstacles.

AB In this paper, a model for a multi-agent swarm evolving in a d-dimensional space is proposed. The model consists of a balance among attraction to a given goal and attraction/repulsion among agents. One of the main characteristics of the model is the presence of an interaction matrix on agents' coordinates, defining some properties of the swarm formation. The paper focuses on the analysis of the new model highlighting the agents' steady-state behaviour both in terms of static and rotating configuration around the goal. Numerical simulations are provided to support the obtained results.

AB This paper investigates the consensus stabilization problem of stochastic multi-agent systems with noises, Markovian switching topology, and communication delays. To solve the consensus problem of the group of interacting agents, it is supposed to use the stochastic approximation type algorithm with the step-size non-decreasing to zero. For stochastic approximation based consensus algorithms with switching topologies, the existing convergence analysis methods may be difficult to guarantee for switching digraphs because these techniques heavily relies on quadratic Lyapunov functions. To overcome the inherent limitations of the existing methods, we develop a new ergodicity approach for backward products of degenerating stochastic matrices via a discrete time dynamical system approach to analyze the consensus stabilization problem of stochastic multi-agent systems with noises, Markovian switching topology, and communication delays; and we attain necessary and sufficient condition of the consensus stabilization. Our approach does not require the double stochasticity condition typically assumed for the existence of a quadratic Lyapunov function, and provides an effective tool for analyzing consensus problems via the existing theory of stochastic matrices and ergodicity of backward products. Finally, numerical simulation is shown to demonstrate theoretical results. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This work analyzes the adverse effects of cyber-physical attacks on discrete-time distributed multi-agent systems, and proposes a mitigation approach for attacks on sensors and actuators. First, we show how an attack on a single node snowballs into a network-wide attack and even destabilizes the entire system. Next, to overcome the adversarial effects of attacks on sensors and actuators, a distributed adaptive attack compensator is designed by estimating the normal expected behavior of agents. The adaptive attack compensator is augmented with the controller and it is shown that the proposed controller achieves secure consensus in the presence of the attacks on sensors and actuators. No restrictive assumption on the number of agents under adversarial input is assumed. Moreover, it recovers compromised agents under actuator attacks and avoids propagation of attacks on sensors without discarding information from the compromised agents. Finally, numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the presented theoretical contributions on a network of Sentry autonomous underwater vehicles.

AB In this paper, the event-triggered guaranteed cost consensus problem is considered for second-order multi-agent systems whose system states are unmeasurable. First, an observer-based distributed event-triggered condition is presented. The triggering time series for each agent is different, and the controller with a time-varying delay is updated only at the triggered times, which can reduce the communication time effectively. Second, using the event-triggered condition and the Lyapunov method, several sufficient conditions are obtained to achieve the guaranteed cost output feedback consensus. Moreover, for each event-triggered interval, a positive lower bound can be calculated, leading to the avoidance of Zeno behaviors. Third, appropriate controller and observer gains can be designed using the linear matrix inequality technique, which is verified through numerical simulations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB Time-varying group formation tracking control problems for second-order multi-agent systems with communication delays and multiple leaders are addressed in this paper. The followers are divided into multiple subgroups, and each subgroup is driven to complete the time-varying sub-formation and to track the average state of entire leaders simultaneously. A distributed protocol that considers communication delays and uses only local interaction information is presented. According to Lyapunov-like stability approach, sufficient conditions for the multi-agent systems to realize time-varying group formation tracking with multiple leaders are given. A variable-substitution based method is developed to get the unknown feedback matrix of the protocol and an algorithm is given to summarize the steps to construct the protocol. The theoretical results can be used in the problem of multiple targets enclosed by several subgroups of unmanned aerial vehicles. Finally, numerical examples are applied to verify the feasibility of the proposed results. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the node-to-node consensus problem for multi-agent networks possessing a leaders' layer and a followers' layer via the pinning control. In order to realize the consensus and reduce the update frequency of the controller, a suitable event-triggered mechanism is introduced into the control strategy. Furthermore, the phenomenon of packet loss is considered in the designed controller. Based on the M-matrix theory and Lyapunov stability theory, this paper presents the sufficient conditions for the node-to-node consensus of networks. Meanwhile, it is proved that the Zeno behaviour is excluded. Finally, two numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Event-triggered formation control of multiagent systems under an undirected communication graph is investigated using complex-valued Laplacian. Both continuous-time and discrete-time models are considered. The dynamics of each agent is described by complex-valued differential or difference equations. For each agent, only the discrete-time information of its neighbors is used in the design of formation controllers and event triggers. Triggering time instants for any agent are determined by certain events that depend on the states of its neighboring agents. Continuous updating of controllers and continuous communication among neighboring agents are avoided. The obtained results show that formation can reach specific but arbitrary formation shape. Furthermore, it is shown that the closed-loop system does not exhibit the Zeno phenomenon for the continuous-time dynamics case or the Zeno-like behavior for the discrete-time dynamics case. Finally, numerical simulations for both the continuous-time and the discrete-time dynamics cases are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed event-triggered control methods.

ID MOBILE AUTONOMOUS AGENTS; CONSENSUS
AB We describe a framework for the design of collective behaviors for groups of identical mobile agents. The approach is based on decentralized simultaneous estimation and control, where each agent communicates with neighbors and estimates the global performance properties of the swarm needed to make a local control decision. Challenges of the approach include designing a control law with desired convergence properties, assuming each agent has perfect global knowledge; designing an estimator that allows each agent to make correct estimates of the global properties needed to implement the controller; and possibly modifying the controller to recover desired convergence properties when using the estimates of global performance. We apply this framework to the problem of controlling the moment statistics describing the location and shape of a swarm. We derive conditions which guarantee that the formation statistics are driven to desired values, even in the presence of a changing network topology.

AB Increased demand of electric ship power with emerging requirements for serving highly dynamic loads at limited power sources, has motivated the development of medium voltage DC shipboard power systems. As different types of power converters can be involved in the same system, advanced load management scheme is required to ensure stable and optimal operation under various conditions. In this paper, a heterogeneous multi-agent system model is established for the load demand management of a zonal medium voltage DC shipboard power system, where different types of DC-DC converters with diverse conversion ratios are considered as heterogeneous agents. Then, a flocking based cooperative control protocol is designed to achieve the group objective, where navigational feedback is introduced to ensure that each agent runs within a limited range. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the performance of the proposed model. Compared with the existing work, our contribution lies in: 1) The heterogeneous multi-agent system model we formulated for a combination of DC-DC converters with different types and diverse voltage levels is more consistent with the actual power system and each converter can be controlled individually according to load ratings and priorities; 2) The modified navigational feedback with the function of confining the lower and upper bound of agents can significantly improve the control effect of the cooperative control protocol.

AB The more simulation becomes an established tool in the design of multi-agent systems, the more urgent the question becomes how valid the induced properties and behavior patterns are. Answering this question depends on the validity of the models, the correctness of the simulators, and the simulations. In all of these aspects, reuse and a declarative representation plays a crucial role. With James II, we developed a customizable framework for modeling and simulation. Its component-based architecture supports a reuse of models, simulators, and experimental settings. The benefits of this architecture for agent-based modeling and simulation will be illuminated by an excerpt of a simulation study about trading strategies for mobile ad hoc networks.

AB This paper investigates both the robust semi-global leaderless consensus problem and the robust semi-global containment control problem for a group of identical linear systems with imperfect actuators. The imperfect actuators are characterized by nonlinearities such as saturation and dead zone and there input output relationships are not precisely known. The dynamics of follower agents are also affected by the input additive disturbances. Low-and-high gain feedback consensus protocols are constructed to solve these problems. More specifically, it is shown that robust semi-global leaderless consensus can be achieved over a connected undirected graph and robust semi-global containment control can be achieved when each follower agent has access to the information of at least one leader agent. Numerical simulation illustrates the theoretical results.

AB This paper presents a multi-agent simulation of the production of step-level public goods in social networks. In previous public goods experimental research the design of the sequence ordering of decisions have been limited because of the necessity of simplicity taking priority over realism, which means they never accurately reproduce the social structure that constrains the available information. Multi-agent simulation can help us to overcome this limitation. In our model, agents are placed in 230 different networks and each networks success rates are analyzed. We find that some network attributes -density and global degree centrality and heterogeneity-, some initial parameters of the strategic situation -the provision point- and some agents' attributes -beliefs about the probability that others will cooperate-, all have a significant impact on the success rate. Our paper is the first approach to an explanation for the scalar variant of production of public goods in a network using computational simulation methodology, and it outlines three main findings. (1) A less demanding collective effort level does not entail more success: the effort should neither be as high as to discourage others, nor so low as to be let to others. (2) More informed individuals do not always produce a better social outcome: a certain degree of ignorance about other agents' previous decisions and their probability of cooperating are socially useful as long as it can lead to contributions that would not have occurred otherwise. (3) Dense horizontal groups are more likely to succeed in the production of step-level public goods: social ties provide information about the relevance of each agent's individual contribution. This simulation demonstrates the explanatory power of the structural properties of a social system because agents with the same decision algorithm produce different outcomes depending on the properties of their social network.

AB Trust is an important issue in trade. For instance in food trade, market actors have to rely on their trade partner's quality statements. The roles of trust and deception in supply networks in various cultural and organisational settings are subject of research in the social sciences. The Trust And Tracing game is an instrument for that type of study. It is a game for human players. Conducting experiments is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, it is hard to formulate hypotheses and to test effects of parameter changes, as this requires many participants. For these reasons the project reported in this paper investigated the feasibility of multi-agent simulation of the game and delivered a prototype. This paper briefly describes the game and introduces the process composition of the agents. The prototype uses simple, but effective models. The paper concludes with directions for refinement of models for agent behaviour.

TI Offensive Strategy in the 2D Soccer Simulation League Using Multi-group

AB The 2D soccer simulation league is one of the best test beds for the research of artificial intelligence (AI). It has achieved great successes in the domain of multi-agent cooperation and machine learning. However, the problem of integral offensive strategy has not been solved because of the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the environment. In this paper, we present a novel offensive strategy based on multi-group ant colony optimization (MACO-OS). The strategy uses the pheromone evaporation mechanism to count the preference value of each attack action in different environments, and saves the values of success rate and preference in an attack information tree in the background. The decision module of the attacker then selects the best attack action according to the preference value. The MACO-OS approach has been successfully implemented in our 2D soccer simulation team in RoboCup competitions. The experimental results have indicated that the agents developed with this strategy, along with related techniques, delivered outstanding performances.

AB This paper investigates group consensus for leaderless multi-agent systems with non-identical dynamics. The consensus protocol is put forward in the form of the distributed event-triggered control subject to saturation, which depends on information from neighboring agents at event-triggered instants. In order to exclude the Zeno behavior and save resources, the given event-triggered condition is detected only at discrete sampling times, where the sampling intervals can be variable. Based on the graph theory, Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method and by adopting the free-weighting matrix technique, some sufficient group consensus criteria in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived. Furthermore, optimization problems aiming at maximizing the event-triggered parameter and the consensus region are proposed. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This article studies a consensus problem for a group of high-order dynamic agents with fixed and switching topologies. Two linear consensus protocols, which only depend on the agent's own information and its neighbours' partial information, are proposed, respectively, for the group with and without communication time-delays. For the case of fixed topology and zero communication time-delay, a necessary and sufficient condition for the consensus is established. The parameter design of the protocol is also discussed. Under switching topology, the consensus is investigated for two cases: the case of zero communication time-delay and the case of nonuniform communication time-delays. For each case, a sufficient condition for the consensus is provided. Moreover, for a group of double/triple-integrator agents with fixed topology and uniform constant time-delay, some necessary and sufficient conditions for the consensus are given. Finally, numerical simulations are worked out to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

LA English
DT Article
DE Trust; Deception; Supply Chain; Multi-Agent System; Simulation
AB This paper describes a multi-agent simulation model of the Trust And Tracing game. The Trust And Tracing game is a gaming simulation for human players, developed as a research tool for data collection on human behaviour in food supply chains with asymmetric information about food quality and food safety. Important issues in the game are opportunistic behaviour (deceit), trust and institutional arrangements for enforcing compliance. The goal is to improve the understanding of human decision making with respect to these issues. To this end multi-agent simulation can be applied to simulate the effect of models of individual decision making in partner selection, negotiation, deceit and trust on system behaviour. The combination of human gaming simulation and multi-agent simulation offers a basis for model refinement in a cycle of validation, experimentation, and formulation of new hypotheses. This paper describes a first round of model formulation and validation. The models presented are validated by a series of experiments performed by the implemented simulation system, of which the outcomes are compared on aggregated level to the outcomes of games played by humans. The experiments cover in a systematic way the important variations in parameter settings possible in the game and in the characteristics of the agents. The simulation results show the same tendencies of behaviour as the observed human games.

DE Bipartite consensus; event-triggered mechanism; multi-agent systems;
   state observer
ID FEEDBACK
AB The event-triggered bipartite consensus problem of linear multi-agent systems with a connected structurally balanced signed graph is considered in this paper. The state observer is set to estimate the actual states of the system. In the system structure, two event-triggered mechanisms are configured for each agent. The one is placed in the output side of the agent and the other in the controller. Thus the establishment of the state observer is based on the discrete output information sampled at the corresponding triggering time instants. And the inter-neighboring transmission of the observed states occurs at the moments when the corresponding triggering condition of the agent is satisfied. The triggering conditions designed do not rely on continuous inter-neighboring communications. With the help of the algebraic graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved that the bipartite consensus can be achieved. Furthermore, Zeno behavior can be avoided in both sides. The effectiveness of the presented control strategy is demonstrated by a numerical simulation.

In this paper, we design a new control protocol called free protocol to describe this situation. First, we calculate consensus probabilities based on the information of the interaction networks. Then, sufficient conditions are obtained for all agents converging to a same value with probability one. Finally, numerical simulation results are given to verify the above results.

AB This article addresses the team-triggered fixed-time consensus problems for a class of double-integrator agents subject to uncertain disturbance. Compared with the finite-time results, the convergence time of the fixed-time results is independent of the initial conditions. Furthermore, a novel team-triggered control (TTC) strategy is presented. This control strategy incorporates the event-triggered control (ETC) and self-triggered control (STC). The ETC and STC are proposed to achieve the fixed-time consensus of second-order multiagent systems (MASs), and no Zeno behavior occurs. The TTC scheme, derived by combining the ETC scheme and the STC scheme, is able to relax the requirement of continuous communication and thus lowering the energy consumption of communication while ensuring the performance of the system. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated by numerical simulations.

AB A novel individual-based alignment/repulsion algorithm is proposed in this note for a flock of multiple agents. With this algorithm, each individual repels its sufficiently close neighbors and aligns to the average velocity of its neighbors with moderate distances. In both mathematical analysis and numerical simulation, we prove that the algorithm guarantees an uncrowded flocking behavior with asymptotic velocity synchronization when sufficiently intensive communication exists within the agents. Moreover, we provide the conditions for collision avoidance along the whole transient procedure. The proposed flocking model has its references in natural collective behaviors like escaping panic and traffic jam motions.

AB In this paper, we propose a prediction method for an acceptance limit value to society for service quality. The quality of service can be quantified by the subjective evaluation of an individual. The acceptance limit value to society is then defined by a stable limit of the social condition. We then calculate the stable limit in quantity by a numerical simulation using the Hierarchized Cellular Automata model. Results of the calculation show that the stable limit can be determined with the corresponding constants of the subject group. Finally we predict the acceptance limit with the result of calculations and an experimental constant for the subject group. Moreover, an applicable condition of the predicted value is discussed.

AB Distributed estimation has proven to be suitable for many multiagent system (MAS) applications, yet it relies heavily on information exchange via a costly and vulnerable communication network. This paper proposes a sensing-based distributed estimation algorithm that enables a local monitoring agent to expand its estimation capabilities beyond its sensing range without needing communication overhead. The key to expanding the limited sensing range is to incorporate the MAS's cooperative control protocol, allowing the monitoring agent to infer the state of out-of-range agents from the behavior of in-range agents that may interact with them. Then, the state estimation for out-of-range agents is performed through a Bayesian approach that considers the correlation of state estimates between in-range and out-of-range agents. This approach of only taking sensor measurements of local monitoring agents without interagent communications can successfully compensate for the existing communication-based distributed estimation methods. The performance of the proposed sensing-based distributed estimation algorithm is theoretically verified and demonstrated with numerical simulations of a multivehicle formation flight example.

AB This paper considers the problem of achieving time-varying formation for second-order multi-agent systems with actuator hysteresis, unknown system dynamics and external disturbances. A novel adaptive dynamic sliding mode scheme is developed to control a group of agents to follow desired trajectories. First, a dynamic sliding mode approach based on local formation tracking error is utilised to reject external disturbances and obtain smooth and chattering-free control input. Then, Chebyshev neural network is employed to estimate the nonlinear function related to the system's dynamic equation. A smooth projection law is also applied to regulate the output of the neural network. Moreover, a Bouc-Wen hysteresis compensator has been added to the current control law to offset the known actuator hysteresis effect. Finally, a numerical simulation based on a multiple omni-directional robot system is presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control law.

ID LEADER-FOLLOWING CONSENSUS; 2ND-ORDER CONSENSUS
AB In this paper, the exponential leader-following consensus problem is investigated for networked multi-agent systems. In order to further reduce the usage of the communication resources, event-triggered delayed impulsive control strategy is put forward, which successfully combines the delayed impulsive control and event-triggered mechanism, and the delayed impulsive controller is implemented only at event-triggered instants. By constructing the novel Lyapunov based event-triggered strategy and impulsive control theory, some easy-to-check conditions are derived such that the error system is exponentially stable. Furthermore, it is shown that the Zeno behavior can be eliminated from the event-triggering rules. Numerical simulation is proposed to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

ID PERSONALITY
AB Due to safety and ethical issues, traditional experimental approaches to modelling underground risk behaviours can be costly, dangerous and even impossible to realize. Based on multi-agent technology, a virtual coalmine platform for risk behaviour simulation is presented to model and simulate the human-machine-environment related risk factors in underground coalmines. To reveal mine workers' risk behaviours, a fuzzy emotional behaviour model is proposed to simulate underground miners' responding behaviours to potential hazardous events based on cognitive appraisal theories and fuzzy logic techniques. The proposed emotion model can generate more believable behaviours for virtual miners according to personalized emotion states, internal motivation needs and behaviour selection thresholds. Finally, typical accident cases of underground hazard spotting and locomotive transport were implemented. The behaviour believability of virtual miners was evaluated with a user assessment method. Experimental results show that the proposed models can create more realistic and reasonable behaviours in virtual coalmine environments, which can improve miners' risk awareness and further train miners' emergent decision-making ability when facing unexpected underground situations.

AB This paper addresses the synchronization problem of multi-agent systems with nonlinear controller outputs via event-triggered control, in which the combined edge state information is utilized, and all controller outputs are nonlinear to describe their inherent nonlinear characteristics and the effects of data transmission in digital communication networks. First, an edge-event-triggered policy is proposed to implement intermittent controller updates without Zeno behavior. Then, an edge-self-triggered solution is further investigated to achieve discontinuous monitoring of sensors. Compared with the previous event-triggered mechanisms, our policy design considers the controller output nonlinearities. Furthermore, the system's inherent nonlinear characteristics and networked data transmission effects are combined in a unified framework. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results.

AB In this paper, the event-triggered distributed containment control of heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems in the output regulation framework is studied. The leaders are treated as exosystems and the containment control problem will be converted into an output regulation problem. An event-triggered protocol is then designed for each follower by the output information of neighbours. It is proved that the followers can asymptotically converge to the dynamic convex hull spanned by multiple leaders under the designed protocol and triggered strategy. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed protocol and triggered condition can exclude Zeno behaviour, so the feasibility of the control strategy is verified. Finally, a numerical simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.

AB The study considers the problem of finite-time event-triggered H-infinity consensus for second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) with intrinsic nonlinear dynamics and external bounded disturbances. Based on the designed triggering function, a distributed event-triggered control strategy is presented on the basis of the designed triggering function to ensure consensus in the system, which effectively reduces the data transmission. Then, sufficient conditions for the finite-time consensus with H-infinity performance level of the resulting event-triggered MAS are derived by utilizing the Lyapunov function and finite-time stability theory. Furthermore, Zeno behavior is proven to be excluded under the proposed event-triggered scheme. Finally, the validity of the proposed results is verified by numerical simulation.

AB We propose two novel dynamic event-triggered control laws to solve the average consensus problem for first-order continuous-time multiagent systems over undirected graphs. Compared with the most existing triggering laws, the proposed laws involve internal dynamic variables, which play an essential role in guaranteeing that the triggering time sequence does not exhibit Zeno behavior. Moreover, some existing triggering laws are special cases of ours. For the proposed self-triggered algorithm, continuous agent listening is avoided as each agent predicts its next triggering time and broadcasts it to its neighbors at the current triggering time. Thus, each agent only needs to sense and broadcast at its triggering times, and to listen to and receive incoming information from its neighbors at their triggering times. It is proved that the proposed triggering laws make the state of each agent converge exponentially to the average of the agents' initial states if and only if the underlying graph is connected. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB The global consensus problem for first-order continuous-time multi-agent systems with input saturation is considered. In order to reduce the overall need of communication and system updates, we propose an event-triggered consensus protocol and a triggering law, which do not require any a priori knowledge of global network parameters. It is shown that Zeno behavior is excluded for these systems and that the underlying directed graph having a directed spanning tree is a necessary and sufficient condition for global consensus. We use a new Lyapunov function to show the sufficient condition and it inspires the triggering law. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB We investigate clustering behavior in mutually interacting agent swarms. Our model consists of identical active particles governed by pairwise attractive and repulsive interactions with different effective ranges. Specifically, in addition to the usual long-range attraction and short-range repulsion, we introduce a medium-range repulsive interaction between particles to break the particle group into clusters. We analyze the effect of the competing interactions on particle radial distribution in space and present both numerical simulations and analytical estimates of the average cluster size, the average nearest-neighboring cluster distance, and the average nearest-neighboring particle distance in the same cluster, in terms of the strength and the extent of the medium-range repulsion. The results are relevant to issues concerning cluster pattern formation control of dynamic multi-agent systems. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2011

AB The purpose of the next internet of things (IoT) is that of making available myriad of services to people by high sensing intelligent devices capable of reasoning and real time acting. The convergence of IoT and multi-agent systems (MAS) provides the opportunity to benefit from the social attitude of agents in order to perform machine-to-machine (M2M) cooperation among smart entities. However, the selection of reliable partners for cooperation represents a hard task in a mobile and federated context, especially because the trustworthiness of devices is largely unreferenced. The issues discussed above can be synthesized by recalling the well known concept of social resilience in IoT systems, i.e., the capability of an IoT network to resist to possible attacks by malicious agent that potentially could infect large areas of the network, spamming unreliable information and/or assuming unfair behaviors. In this sense, social resilience is devoted to face malicious activities of software agents in their social interactions, and do not deal with the correct working of the sensors and other information devices. In this setting, the use of a reputation model can be a practicable and effective solution to form local communities of agents on the basis of their social capabilities. In this paper, we propose a framework for agents operating in an IoT environment, called ResIoT, where the formation of communities for collaborative purposes is performed on the basis of agent reputation. In order to validate our approach, we performed an experimental campaign by means of a simulated framework, which allowed us to verify that, by our approach, devices have not any economic convenience to performs misleading behaviors. Moreover, further experimental results have shown that our approach is able to detect the nature of the active agents in the systems (i.e., honest and malicious), with an accuracy of not less than 11% compared to the best competitor tested and highlighting a high resilience with respect to some malicious activities.

AB This article presents an agent-based fuzzy cognitive map (ABFCM) developed injecting the concept of multi-agent system (MAS) into the fuzzy cognitive map (FCM). Fuzzy cognitive map is used for qualitative modeling and simulation. Compared to the FCM, the ABFCM enables different inference algorithms in each node enabling simulation of systems with diverse behavior concepts. Each map node can exhibit individual, more or less intelligent, behavior and still can interact with other nodes to conclude on system behavior. Resulting method also enables automatic results interpretation adding additional intelligence to a classic FCM. Explanation of the obtained system architecture with FCM and MAS integration is presented in the article. The experimental results in the article are obtained with the ABFCM prototype, developed on the basis of ABFCM structure given in the article. Multi-agent technology can bring new properties into existing fields and methods, like in the ABFCM case. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A novel adaptive event-based controller and a state-dependent triggering function are proposed for each agent. The consensus can be achieved without the assumption that (A,B) is stabilizable. Furthermore, the Zeno-behavior of the concerned closed-loop system is also excluded under certain conditions. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB Despite the rigour and ability of game theory to cope with oligopolistic electric markets, it fails to model many existing behaviours in the real-world circumstances. The traditional models such as statistical extrapolation or econometrics are not capable to anticipate the changes in the pattern of the market prices due to the future structural changes. Furthermore, in such free and open markets, there is a more intense need for each participant to benefit from a certain level of autonomy, while keeping some capabilities to interact, communicate, collaborate and negotiate with other participants in an efficient way. As a result, there is a need for a novel framework of modelling that could include game theoretical assumptions as well as other more complex assumptions. Agent technologies in general and agent-based simulation in particular offer this possibility. This paper proposes, in a decision-making perspective, a new multi-agent architecture specifically designed to support planning activities in decentralized electricity markets, with a certain level of flexibility. In this model, synthetic agents are created allowing flexible representations of the multi-functional market players and possible mergers and coalitions in the electricity market.

ID AVERAGE CONSENSUS
AB In this letter, we present a dynamic median consensus protocol for multi-agent systems using acoustic communication. The motivating target scenario is a multi-agent system consisting of underwater robots acting as intelligent sensors, applied to continuous monitoring of the state of a marine environment. The proposed protocol allows each agent to track the median value of individual measurements of all agents through local communication with neighbouring agents. Median is chosen as a measure robust to outliers, as opposed to average value, which is usually used. In contrast to the existing consensus protocols, the proposed protocol is dynamic, uses a switching communication topology and converges to median of measured signals. Stability and correctness of the protocol are theoretically proven. The protocol is tested in simulation, and accuracy and influence of protocol parameters on the system output are analyzed. The protocol is implemented and validated by a set of experiments on an underwater group of robots comprising of aMussel units. This experimental setup is one of the first deployments of any type of consensus protocol for an underwater setting. Both simulation and experimental results confirm the correctness of the presented approach.

AB This paper investigates the cooperative output regulation for heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems with an uncertain leader under the event-triggered control. Firstly, a local adaptive observer is designed to estimate the system matrices of the leader. Then, utilizing the estimated matrices, an adaptive estimator is proposed to observe the leader's dynamic behavior and an adaptive regulation law is presented to solve the output regulator equations online. Furthermore, by using the estimated state of the leader and the adaptive solutions of the output regulator equations, a distributed event-triggered controller and a novel self-triggered controller are designed such that the output of each follower can converge the leader's output, and Zeno behavior can be excluded for each agent. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control approaches.

AB In this paper, we discuss the consensus problem of non-linear multi-agent systems where an impulsive protocol with event-based asynchronously sampled data is adopted. Systems that communicate by data asynchronously sampled in limited time intervals are constructed. By separating time instants at which the sampling and communication occur into different ones, resources for such activations that every agent must execute can be reallocated to reduce the system load at communication instants. Event-based schemes are introduced to manipulate the sampling behavior. Two cases that with and without leader in directed networks topologies are both investigated. Sufficient conditions for system parameters and the event-based sampling schemes are given to guarantee the consensus. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, an adaptive event-triggered protocol is introduced to achieve the consensus problem for leader-following system. Then, two fully distributed event-triggered adaptive control protocols are designed. That is, the state feedback and dynamic output feedback controllers, which does not need global information about network topology of system. Under the proposed two control protocols, the cooperative output regulation problem can be solved and no Zeno behavior happens for each agent. Finally, a numerical simulation is used to corroborate the validity of the conclusions under two control laws. Moreover, a comparative experiment is carried out to highlight the advantages of the control protocol designed in this paper. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a spatial multi-agent programming model, which has been developed for assessing policy options in the diffusion of innovations and resource use changes. Unlike conventional simulation tools used in agricultural economics, the model class described here applies a multi-agent/cellular automata (CA) approach by using heterogeneous farm-household models and capturing their social and spatial interactions explicitly. The individual choice of the farm-household among available production, consumption, investment and marketing alternatives is represented in recursive linear programming models. Adoption constraints are introduced in form of network-threshold values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation of peers' experiences. The model's economic and hydrologic components are tightly connected into a spatial framework. The integration of economic and hydrologic processes facilitates the, consideration of feedback effects in the use of water for irrigation. The simulation runs of the model are carried out with an empirical data set, which has been derived from various data sources on an agricultural region in Chile. Simulation results show that agent-based spatial modelling constitutes a powerful approach to better understanding processes of innovation and resource use change. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science BN.

AB This paper is concerned with the leader-following consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems under directed topology graph. Compared with the most of the prior works, we assume that the state information is unknown for each following agent and only the relative output information between neighboring agents can be measured. Then, two new types of functional observer-based output feedback event-triggered protocols are designed, where the Kx-functional observer designed in this paper may have lower dimension than the full-order and reduced-order observer, which can ensure that leader-following consensus is achieved. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior is excluded by showing that the inter-event time between any two triggering events is lower bounded by a strictly positive value. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control protocols. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper studies the consensus problem of networked multi-agent systems (NMASs). Distributed delays are considered in the agent dynamics, and we propose a new type of impulsive consensus protocols that also takes into account of distributed delays. A novel method is developed to estimate the relation between the agent states at the impulsive instants and the distributed-delayed agent states, which helps to use the Razumikhin-type stability result to investigate the consensus of NMASs with distributed-delayed impulses. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that the network consensus can be reached via the proposed consensus protocols with fixed and switching topologies, respectively. Numerical simulations are also provided to demonstrate our theoretical results.

AB Most existing flocking algorithms rely on information about both relative position and relative velocity among neighbouring agents. In this article, we investigate the flocking problem with only position measurements. We propose a provably-stable flocking algorithm, in which an output vector is produced by distributed filters based on position information alone but not velocity information. Under the assumption that the initial interactive network is connected, the flocking algorithm not only can steer a group of agents to a stable flocking motion, but also can preserve the connectivity of the interactive network during the dynamical evolution. Moreover, we investigate the flocking algorithm with a virtual leader and show that all agents can asymptotically attain a desired velocity even if only one agent in the team has access to the information of the virtual leader. We finally show some numerical simulations to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB The problem of event-triggered guaranteed cost consensus for nonlinear multi-agent systems with time delay and uncertain parameters is solved in this paper. First, a distributed event-triggered strategy is presented, by which control protocol is updated only at the triggering time instants, leading to significant saving of communication resources. Second, based on the Lyapunov method and the proposed event-triggered strategy, some criteria are obtained to ensure that guaranteed cost consensus can be achieved. Moreover, it is proved that the Zeno behavior is excluded under the proposed event-triggered scheme. Third, an algorithm is given to design suitable control gains in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the validity of the proposed results in this paper is verified via numerical simulation.

AB This work investigates a flocking behavior for multi-agent system with time delay from a measurement perspective. While establishing an asymptotic flocking condition related to measurement delay, we also give a controllable range for this delay such that the emergence of flocking can be guaranteed under appropriate initial configurations. These allow us to propose analytical expressions that calculate the flock radius and the asymptotic flocking velocity respectively. By means of analyzing a two-particle flock system specifically and several simulation experiments numerically, it is confirmed that the measurement delay can impact the occurrence of flocking behavior and also illustrates that the theoretical results are feasible and practical.

AB This paper presents the concept and theoretical specification of a multi-agent based model for spatio-temporal simulation of a coupled human-landscape system. The model falls into the class of all agents, where the human population and the landscape environment are all self-organized interactive agents. The model framework is represented by four components: (i) a system of human population defining specific behavioural patterns of farm households in land-use decision-making according to typological livelihood groups, (ii) a system of landscape environment characterising individual land patches with multiple attributes, representing the dynamics of crop and forest yields as well as land-use/cover transitions in response to household behaviour and natural constraints, (iii) a set of policy factors that are important for land-use choices, and (iv) a decision-making procedure integrating household, environmental and policy information into land-use decisions of household agents. In the model, the bounded-rational approach, based on utility maximisation using spatial multi-nominal logistic functions, is nested with heuristic rule-based techniques to represent decision-making mechanisms of households regarding land use. Empirical verifications of the model's components and the application of the model to a watershed in Vietnam for integrated assessments of policy impacts on landscape and community dynamics are subjects of a companion paper.

AB This paper is to develop a novel distributed leader follower algorithm for multi-agent systems in the event of stochastic communication link failure over the network. Bernoulli distribution is applied to represent the data dropout during operation while the data dropout properties of each communication links are independent from each other. Sufficient conditions for a stabilizing controller design are developed by using Lyapunov-based methodologies and Linear Matrix Inequality (LMIs) techniques. The stability condition is then decomposed into small robust stability conditions with the size of a single agent, provided that the interaction topology of the followers is an undirected graph, which leads to efficient solutions even in case that the number of agents is large and a high order system dynamics of the agent is considered. The main result is to ensure the mean square exponential stability of the overall system reaching consensus. The case of consecutive data losses in any of the communication links is also discussed in the same framework. Leader-following numerical simulations with a group of agents including quadcopters are successfully conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel consensus algorithm in this paper. The results show that the consensus achievement is incorporating the data loss probability; however a higher data loss rate may cause a longer time for agents to achieve consensus.

AB We describe a new point of view that uses contextual information of the interrelated conditions in which criminality or deviant occurs by means of computer simulation to examine its role in a progressively changing society. Based on the functionalist point of view, we model society as a multi agent system and criminality as a noise. A noise is injected as training signals to the single layer perceptrons that functions as agents (i.e. society) and all agents must comply the fitness function. Failure to comply will result in the agent being removed from the "society" and be replaced-by a "newborn" that inherits some "upbringing" information from its "mother's agent". Our simulation studies point toward the constructive effects of criminality. The major contribution in our study is that new paradigm can show and measure criminality effects as in contrast to mere verbal descriptions of the social sciences. The new paradigm could be used to provide the functional explanation of atypical trends in criminality in East- and Middle European and some other countries and provide "artificial experimental data" for future studies.

ID MODEL; EMERGENCE; MAS
AB Organisations in multi-agent systems (MAS) have proven to be successful in regulating agent societies. Nevertheless, changes in agents' behaviour or in the dynamics of the environment may lead to a poor fulfilment of the system's purposes, and so the entire organisation needs to be adapted. In this paper we focus on endowing the organisation with adaptation capabilities, instead of expecting agents to be capable of adapting the organisation by themselves. We regard this organisational adaptation as an assisting service provided by what we call the Assistance Layer. Our generic Two Level Assisted MAS Architecture (2-LAMA) incorporates such a layer. We empirically evaluate this approach by means of an agent-based simulator we have developed for the P2P sharing network domain. This simulator implements 2-LAMA architecture and supports the comparison between different adaptation methods, as well as, with the standard BitTorrent protocol. In particular, we present two alternatives to perform norm adaptation and one method to adapt agents' relationships. The results show improved performance and demonstrate that the cost of introducing an additional layer in charge of the system's adaptation is lower than its benefits.

ID ENERGY MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM; SENSOR; POWER
AB To improve the power supply availability in an island microgrid, this paper proposes a new approach that integrates distributed energy sources economically, reliably and efficiently. In an island mode, a microgrid must ensure its self-sufficiency of energy production since it cannot make an energetic exchange with a main grid. However, in this mode, the random behavior of the resources affected by meteorological factors presents a major constraint. The challenge related to the power availability in microgrids is to find a solution that faces the operation of intermittent power sources. The microgrid should guarantee a useful power management in order to achieve a high availability of energy. In this paper, we present a mathematical model to describe the influence of the meteorological factors on the sources production. We propose a multi-agent control strategy based on the production forecasting and load shedding for a high availability of the microgrid power supply. The proposed multi-agent system uses the master-slave model in which the communication and negotiation between the defined agents are performed by a concept of tokens. The developed control system is implemented on Spartan 6 FPGA-Board. The paper's contribution is applied to a Tunisian petroleum platform where several blackouts are recorded between 2012 and 2014. Simulation and experimental results show clearly a high availability as a performance of the proposed control strategy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the authors investigate the cluster synchronisation of coupled harmonic oscillators with multiple leaders in an undirected fixed network. Unlike many existing algorithms for cluster synchronisation of complex dynamical networks or group consensus of multi-agent systems, which require global information of the underlying network such as eigenvalues of the coupling matrix or centralised control protocols, we propose a novel decentralised adaptive cluster synchronisation protocol for coupled harmonic oscillators. By using the decentralised adaptive cluster synchronisation protocol and without using any global information of the underlying network, all oscillators in the same group asymptotically synchronise with the corresponding leader even when only one oscillator in each group has access to the information of the corresponding leader. Numerical simulation results are presented to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB For individually motivated agents to work collaboratively to satisfy shared goals, they must make decisions about actions and intentions that take into account their commitments to group activities. This paper examines the role of social consciousness in the process of reconciling intentions to do group-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. We operationalize the notion of social consciousness and provide a first attempt to formally add social consciousness to a cooperative decision-making model. We define a measure of social consciousness; describe its incorporation into the SPIRE experimental system, a simulation environment that allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be studied; and present results of several experiments that investigate the interaction in decision-making of measures of group and individual good. In particular, we investigate the effect of varying levels of social consciousness on the utility of the group and the individuals it comprises. A key finding is that an intermediate level of social consciousness yields better results in certain circumstances than an extreme commitment. We suggest preliminary principles for designers of collaborative agents based on the results.

AB This article presents the design and implementation of an event-triggered control approach, applied to the leader-following consensus and formation of a group of autonomous micro-aircraft with capabilities of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL-UAVs). The control strategy is based on an inner-outer loop control approach. The inner control law stabilizes the attitude and position of one agent, whereas the outer control follows a virtual leader to achieve position consensus cooperatively through an event-triggered policy. The communication topology uses undirected and connected graphs. With such an event-triggered control, the closed-loop trajectories converge to a compact sphere, centered in the origin of the error space. Furthermore, the minimal inter-sampling time is proven to be below bounded avoiding the Zeno behavior. The formation problem addresses the group of agents to fly in a given shape configuration. The simulation and experimental results highlight the performance of the proposed control strategy.

AB In this paper, we investigate a novel finite-time median-related group consensus problem, where the finial consensus value can be identified as a desired function of the median of initial states instead of the much studied average value. The underlying communication topology is modelled by a weighted dynamical directed network. A distributed control protocol is firstly introduced to ensure that the agents can reach a median-related consensus in finite time in a collaboration network, meaning that all edge-weights of the communication network are non-negative. We then generalise the results to cooperation-competition networks, where the communication network is divided into predetermined collaboration subnetworks allowing possibly negative weights. Effective group control protocols are designed to guarantee the median-related group consensus in finite time. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the availability of our theoretical results.

AB In order to extend the ongoing academic and practitioner dialogs germane to Human, Social, Cultural, and Behavioral (HSCB) modeling and simulation, we introduce a novel extensible methodology for modeling Complex Adaptive Social Systems (CASS) that centers on capturing the emergence of dynamic Beliefs, Values, and Interests (BVIs) in the individuals and groups that compose a whole society. We follow Peter Blau, Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin, Duncan Watts and many others in positing that human behavior is best understood in terms of the complex social systems within which actions are taken, and that the representation of these social systems must make evident the endogenous structural constraints on opportunities for interpersonal contact and group affiliation. We further demonstrate that the ability to seed social simulations with representative social data about the society being modeled (e.g. from social surveys), and the use of social networks generated using principles of homophily from empirical social science, provide a compelling and actionable framework for both interpreting with and theory building from whole society simulations.

AB Efficient task assignments can significantly improve agent management and reduce communication load and energy consumption. This article investigates the cooperative control problem for multiagent systems with an active task assignment strategy, in which whether an agent exchanges the information with neighbors depends on a perceived mission. By defining a set of missions, a task assignment mechanism for cooperative control problem is first proposed, in which the tasks will be scheduled by intermittent communication signals associated with the actual optimization requirements. By allowing appropriate task assignment conditions, a class of tracking cooperative control protocol is designed and accordingly, the stability of the closed-loop systems under the intermittent communication will be guaranteed. We also consider a case that the communication links between the followers and the leader can be optimized. To maximize the quality of information interaction, a leadership competition mechanism is introduced to design the tracking cooperative control protocol. As an application, cooperative surveillance using a group of rotary-wing air vehicles is considered. Numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB We propose a distributed output-feedback model predictive control approach for achieving consensus among multiple agents. Each agent computes a distributed control action based on an output-feedback measurement of a local neighborhood tracking error and communicates information only to its neighbors, according to a communication network modeled as a directed graph. Each agent computes its distributed control action by solving a local min-max optimization problem that simultaneously computes a local state estimate and control input under worst-case assumptions on unmeasured input disturbances and measurement noise. Under easily verified controllability and observability assumptions, this distributed output-feedback model predictive control approach provides an upper bound on the group consensus error, thereby ensuring practical consensus in the presence of unmeasured disturbances and noise. A numerical example with four agents connected in a directed graph is given to illustrate the results. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, vulnerability of a distributed consensus seeking multi-agent system (MAS) with double-integrator dynamics against edge-bound content modification cyber attacks is studied. In particular, we define a specific edge-bound content modification cyber attack called malignant content modification attack (MCoMA), which results in unbounded growth of an appropriately defined group disagreement vector. Properties of MCoMA are utilized to design detection and mitigation algorithms so as to impart resilience in the considered MAS against MCoMA. Additionally, the proposed detection mechanism is extended to detect the general edge-bound content modification attacks (not just MCoMA). Finally, the efficacies of the proposed results are illustrated through numerical simulations. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB This work presents a new algorithm for flocking with a virtual leader by introducing a new sampling scenario, so-called multi-rate sampling. In the multi-rate sampling, the period of receiving data from different sources is different, but the updating time for all individuals is the same. Here, the authors assume that the period of receiving data from neighbour agents is T, and that from the virtual leader is an integer multiple of it, that is, mT. An upper bound for period T is attained from the upper bound of the energy function that guarantees the neighbouring network to be connected and collision to be avoided between agents. Also, an upper bound on m, which ensures the velocity of informed and uninformed agents to tend the virtual leader's velocity, is derived. The convergence analysis demonstrates that whatever the acquiring period of the virtual leader's information mT is further, then the convergence rate of the group's velocity to the virtual leader's velocity will be greater. Finally, to show the validity of the results, they present a simulation.

AB This paper considers the problem of semi-global leader-following consensus of a multi-agent system whose agent dynamics are represented by linear systems. The input output characteristics of the follower agent actuators, such as those of saturation and dead-zone, are imperfect, not precisely known, and subject to the effect of disturbances. Two consensus control algorithms, of the low-and-high gain feedback type and the low gain based variable structure control type, are proposed for solving the consensus problem. It is shown that both of these control algorithms achieve semi-global leader-following practical consensus in the presence of the imperfectness of the actuators when the communication topology among the follower agents is represented by a strongly connected and detailed balanced directed graph and the leader agent is a neighbor of at least one follower agent. The theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulation.

AB To reduce actuation burden in dynamical network environment, the event-triggering strategy is applied to consensus protocol for a class of nonlinear multi-agent systems with a switching topology. The considered switching topology is assumed to be sequentially connected, which is directed disconnected. The combinational measurement approach is adopted in the event-triggering strategy such that each agent updates control rule only at its own event-triggering instants. First, by using the iterative method, we establish the recursive relationship of maximal distance sequence. Then, sufficient conditions of event-based bounded consensus can be obtained by the contractive property of maximal distance sequence. Meanwhile, it is proved that the designed event-triggering rule can avoid Zeno behavior. Furthermore, as an extension, we consider the case of jointly connected topology, and the corresponding consensus problem is also explored. Finally, a numerical simulation is provided to confirm the derived theoretical results.

AB This paper investigates the problem of consensus tracking control for second-order multi-agent systems in the presence of uncertain dynamics and bounded external disturbances. The communication ?ow among neighbor agents is described by an undirected connected graph. A fast terminal sliding manifold based on lumped state errors that include absolute and relative state errors is proposed, and then a distributed finite-time consensus tracking controller is developed by using terminal sliding mode and Chebyshev neural networks. In the proposed control scheme, Chebyshev neural networks are used as universal approximators to learn unknown nonlinear functions in the agent dynamics online, and a robust control term using the hyperbolic tangent function is applied to counteract neural-network approximation errors and external disturbances, which makes the proposed controller be continuous and hence chattering-free. Meanwhile, a smooth projection algorithm is employed to guarantee that estimated parameters remain within some known bounded sets. Furthermore, the proposed control scheme for each agent only employs the information of its neighbor agents and guarantees a group of agents to track a time-varying reference trajectory even when the reference signals are available to only a subset of the group members. Most importantly, finite-time stability in both the reaching phase and the sliding phase is guaranteed by a Lyapunov-based approach. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller and show that the proposed controller exceeds to a linear hyperplane-based sliding mode controller.

AB Simulating and evaluating the impact that a building design might produce on its prospective occupants is a key challenge in architectural design. Prior work demonstrated the capabilities of narrative-based modeling to coordinate the collaborative behavior of virtual occupants. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the scalability and applicability of narrative-based modeling to support the pre-occupancy evaluation of alternative design options in complex real-world hospital facilities. To do so, we developed a narrative-based pre-occupancy evaluation platform that extends pre-existing narrative-based capabilities with (a) a newly developed library space, actor, activities, and narrative entities that support the simulation of real-world human behavior patterns while accounting for the impact that a building design produces on how the patterns unfold, and (b) a newly integrated evaluation module able to generate and visualize numerical data-logs and spatiotemporal data-maps of key performance indicators in hospital settings. We applied the platform to conduct a comparative pre-occupancy evaluation of two different architectural designs for an outpatient ophthalmology clinic. Results demonstrate the scalability and applicability of narrative-based modeling to help design stakeholders visualize and analyze how design decisions may impact future building operations in outpatient clinics.

AB To reduce energy consumption and improve residents' quality of life, "smart cities" should use not only modern technologies, but also the social innovations of the "Internet of Things" (IoT) era. This article attempts to solve transport problems in a smart city's office district by utilizing gamification that incentivizes the carpooling system. The goal of the devised system is to significantly reduce the number of cars, and, consequently, to alleviate traffic jams, as well as to curb pollution and energy consumption. A representative sample of the statistical population of people working in one of the biggest office hubs in Poland (the so-called "Mordor of Warsaw") was surveyed. The collected data were processed using spatial data mining methods, and the results were a set of parameters for the multi-agent system. This approach made it possible to run a series of simulations on a set of 100,000 agents and to select an effective gamification methodology that supports the carpooling process. The implementation of the proposed solutions (a "serious game" variation of urban games) would help to reduce the number of cars by several dozen percent, significantly reduce energy consumption, eliminate traffic jams, and increase the activity of the smart city residents.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB The use of MABS (Multi-Agent Based Simulations) is analysed as the modelling of distributed (usually social) systems using MAS (Multi-Agent Systems) as the model structure. It is argued that rarely is direct modelling of target systems attempted but rather an abstraction of the target systems is modelled and insights gained about the abstraction then applied back to the target systems. The MABS modelling process is divided into six steps: abstraction, design, inference, analysis, interpretation and application. Some types of MABS papers are characterised in terms of the steps they focus on and some criteria for good MABS formulated in terms of the soundness with which the steps are established. Finally some practical proposals that might improve the informativeness of the field are suggested.

AB One of the reasons for attending to agent technology is the ever-growing complexity of information systems and the increasing difficulty to foresee and plan for all potentially arising situations. Unfortunately, some pressing issues in practical applications still remain outside the focus of agent research. Chief among them is robustness in environments that are prone to disturbances, failures or uncontrolled interactions. In our research effort, we provide a middleware, based on database transactions, that formally guarantees robustness of execution of agent actions and automates many standard actions carried out in case of disturbances. We built a simulator to test the scalability of the proposed middleware. The simulator also gives us a better understanding of the behavior of the various planning strategies reflected by the transaction trees executed by the middleware and is a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of any multi-agent system before its actual deployment. In this paper, the agent transaction model executed by the middleware is outlined. The simulator is described and the experimental results of simulating a growing number of antagonist agents with collective conflicts over a common database are presented.

AB This paper presents a study of distributed cooperative formation control of a generic multiple agent robots which is applicable for underwater system application such as multiple-autonomous surface vehicles (ASV). The control objective of the group of ASV agent is to maintain a certain formation in a predefined geometric pattern, notably a symmetric formation shape. In addition, the centroid of this to-be-sustained formation is to follow a designated leader agent whose dynamics resembles that of its followers. The contribution made in this paper is the introduction of an adaptive law capable of adjusting the strength of the state consensus control. Despite of partial information available to subset of agents, the formation control objective can still be achieved. The control scheme features a robustification term owed by a signum function which forces the state consensus error to zero. The control scheme is verified through numerical simulation which shows convergence of state consensus error to zero.

AB Multi-agents simulation reports a project in agents-based computer simulation of processes of economics in a population of boundedly rational learning agents. The same family of models will be simulated under different assumptions about the nature of the learning process and details of the production and economics process. The purpose of this procedure is to establish a relationship between the assumptions and the simulation results.
   The simulation techniques with baseline simulations of boundedly rational learning processes, and do not involve the complications of dealing with economies. Can simulation "explain" the puzzles of finance regulation and particularly the key puzzle of growth and learning processes that produce the puzzling results? And just what assumptions of the simulation are not predictable associated with puzzling results?
   Typical problems are multi-agents case can also offer opportunities for inference of hidden action and agent monitoring agent. Extraordinary creativity remains a mystery, no one make dependable long term predictions of what inventions will occur and when, or what their effects will be.
   Agency theory drops the assumption that most individuals treat conformity as instrumental to the achievement of their personal goals.
   Agents can be dependent upon to conform only when held property accountable to effective incentives. Agents need to limit the recipients of their messages as much as possible and often need to share information across both time and space and learning this becomes a case of information sharing. Mechanism such as genetic programming can improve the behavior of a species of agents over successive generation and construct markets in the environment can enable an agent community as a whole to learn.

SO SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY

ID SOCIAL FORCE MODEL; ROUTE-CHOICE; DYNAMICS
AB Pedestrian simulation is complex because there are different levels of behavior modeling. At the lowest level, local interactions between agents occur; at the middle level, strategic and tactical behaviors appear like overtakings or route choices; and at the highest level path-planning is necessary. The agent-based pedestrian simulators either focus on a specific level (mainly in the lower one) or define strategies like the layered architectures to independently manage the different behavioral levels. In our Multi-Agent Reinforcement-Learning-based Pedestrian simulation framework (MARL-Ped) the situation is addressed as a whole. Each embodied agent uses a model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to learn autonomously to navigate in the virtual environment. The main goal of this work is to demonstrate empirically that MARL-Ped generates learned behaviors adapted to the level required by the pedestrian scenario. Three different experiments, described in the pedestrian modeling literature, are presented to test our approach: (i) election of the shortest path vs. quickest path; (ii) a crossing between two groups of pedestrians walking in opposite directions inside a narrow corridor; (iii) two agents that move in opposite directions inside a maze. The results show that MARL-Ped solves the different problems, learning individual behaviors with characteristics of pedestrians (local control that produces adequate fundamental diagrams, route-choice capability, emergence of collective behaviors and path-planning). Besides, we compared our model with that of Helbing's social forces, a well-known model of pedestrians, showing similarities between the pedestrian dynamics generated by both approaches. These results demonstrate empirically that MARL-Ped generates variate plausible behaviors, producing human-like macroscopic pedestrian flow. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The goal of the dispersion algorithm is to maintain the communication network between agents and to enlarge the coverage area as widely as possible. The communication density, or the number of communication links, is the only information needed. A dispatch rule for releasing agents at a base station is also designed based on the dispersion algorithm. The proposed algorithms have been extensively tested by software simulation. Statistics concerning the coverage area, network partition rate, and spending time are analyzed to verify the feasibility and advantages of the algorithms. Potential applications of the proposed algorithms include rescue in a damaged area, planetary exploration, military reconnaissance, and geophysical mapping.

AB Urban segregation represents a significant barrier to achieving social inclusion in cities. To mitigate this problem, it is necessary to implement policies founded upon a better understanding of segregation dynamics. This paper proposes MASUS, a multi-agent simulator for urban segregation, which provides a virtual laboratory for exploring the impacts of different contextual mechanisms on the emergence of segregation patterns. We illustrate the potential of MASUS through three experiments on segregation in Sao Jose dos Campos, a medium-sized city in southeast Brazil. The first experiment compares simulated outputs with empirical data, the second exemplifies the ability of MASUS to test theories, and the third tests an anti-segregation policy. We also discuss limitations of the current version of the model, and we recommend directions for further research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A robotic system can consist of a single or multiple agents with a fixed or mobile base, with full or under-actuation, and possibly redundancy. Collision avoidance is a crucial task for any robotic system and is necessary to ensure safe operation. In this paper, we use a set-based approach to ensure collision avoidance as a high-priority task of a robotic system while simultaneously defining one or more tasks for the system to achieve. The set-based approach is highly generic and flexible, and we present theoretical results, practical implementation and experimental results of the approach applied to a redundant, fully actuated robot manipulator, a full-scale underactuated surface vessel and a multi-agent system of unicycles.

AB The paper investigates the distributed convex optimisation problem of multi-agent systems over strongly connected and balanced digraph with time delay. To reduce the traffic among agents and the control inputs' update frequency, a sample-based distributed event-triggered zero-gradient-sum optimisation algorithm has been proposed. A sufficient stability condition with respect to the related parameters and time delay is derived via the Lyapunov function approach. Moreover, it is proved that the states of agents asymptotically converge to the global optimal point. Since the sampling control is adopted, Zeno behaviour can be naturally excluded. The results of the numerical simulation illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB In this paper, a comprehensive model is introduced to investigate the influence of energy flow on the lifetime of stochastic multi-species prey-predator artificial ecosystems. The model consists of a non stationary hosting environment with food sources and a few species of competing herbivore and carnivore birds that can perform several individual and collective behaviors such as flocking, breeding, competing, resting, hunting, escaping, seeking, and foraging. The experimental results of 11,000 simulations analyzed by Cox univariate analysis and hazard function suggest that only a fraction of associated energy variables and pairwise interactions between them influence the lifetime. The proposed stochastic model can be utilized to simulate the complex multi-agent systems and their emergent behavior. Also, the proposed statistical analysis of energy flow to estimate the system stability and lifetime can be generalized to other physical and economical complex systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the problem of flocking control in networks of multiple dynamical agents with intermittent nonlinear velocity measurements is studied. A new flocking algorithm is proposed to guarantee the states of the velocity variables of all the dynamical agents to converge to consensus while ensuring collision avoidance of the whole group, where each agent is assumed to obtain some nonlinear measurements of the relative velocity between itself and its neighbors only on a sequence of non-overlapping time intervals. The results are then extended to the scenario of flocking with a nonlinearly dynamical virtual leader, where only a small fraction of agents are informed and each informed agent can obtain intermittent nonlinear measurements of the relative velocity between itself and the virtual leader. Theoretical analysis shows that the achieved flocking in systems with or without a virtual leader is robust against the time spans of the agent speed-sensors. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the new design. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Simulation, which creates abstractions of the system is an appropriate approach for studying complex systems that are inaccessible through direct observation and measurement. The problem with simulation of great numbers of interacting entities is that it is difficult to create a reliable and tractable abstraction of the real system. Indeed, simulating large numbers of entities requires great computing resources. A solution to avoid this problem is to use macroscopic models. However, this type of model may be unavailable or not reliable for the problem at hand and it does not allow the observation of individual behaviours. in this paper, a multilevel simulation model is proposed to allow the use of both microscopic and macroscopic techniques. This model is based upon Holonic Multi-Agent Systems which offer a promising approach for developing applications in complex domains characterised by a hierarchical structure. The proposed approach provides a generic scheduling model for multilevel Simulations: dynamically adapting the level of simulated behaviours while being as faithful as possible to the simulated model. it does not only manage the level of entities' behaviour but also of behaviours classically assigned to the environmental part of a simulation. A set of physics-based indicators is also introduced to dynamically determine the most suitable level for each entity and to maintain the best trade-off between simulation accuracy and constraints (dependent on the model or the experimental context).

AB This paper is devoted to the dynamic event-triggered consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems under fixed and switching directed topologies. Two distributed dynamic event-triggered strategies, where internal dynamic variables are involved, are introduced for each agent to achieve consensus asymptotically. Compared with the existing static triggering strategies, the purposed dynamic triggering strategies result in larger inter-execution times and less communication energy among agents. In addition, neither controller updates nor triggering threshold detections require continuous communication in the purposed control strategies. It is also proven that the Zeno behavior is strictly ruled out under fixed and switching directed topologies. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis is demonstrated by numerical simulations. (C) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The classification of municipal household waste is a complex, adaptive system containing multiple agents, where behavior between the agents is interactive. This study focuses on the willingness of bounded, rational individuals to sort waste within complex social networks, and the evolution of group behavior. An individual cognition-behavior model was established, based on the theory of planned behavior. In this model, the intention under-pinning individual waste classification is influenced by the behavioral attitude of the individual, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral results. A multi-agent-based simulation within a social network based on the opinion propagation dynamics and a scale-free network was developed to simulate the behavior change of the agents. The results suggest that under the principle of selective connection and the hypothesis of network growth, the clustering trend of the whole network towards several central nodes becomes increasingly apparent; this means, the degree of network node centralization becomes clear. Lowering the threshold of social information interaction improved the transmission of waste classification information and increased the proportion of urban residents who carry out waste classification. Economic profits and spiritual satisfaction were considered important driving factors that impacted decision-making on waste classification, and effectively stimulated the willingness of urban residents to implement waste sorting behavior. Notably, official organizations and institutions, that is, influencers with higher connectivity were found to have a greater influence on the decisions made by residents. These findings are useful as a theoretical reference to inform the development of waste management policies.

ID ORGANIZATION
AB The goal of self-adapting self-organizing emergent multi-agent systems applied to problems with dynamically appearing tasks is to reduce operation and design costs. This is accomplished through the design of autonomous agents, which interact to produce behaviors required for flexible and scalable operation. However, when combined with agent autonomy, emergent behaviors are unpredictable resulting in a lack of trust for applications desiring efficiency such as logistics. An additional consultation agent, known as an efficiency improvement advisor (EIA), has been shown to increase efficiency through autonomy preserving advice provided as exception rule adaptations to agents. The problem addressed in this paper is that, in order for EIA-adapted systems to be deployed, the stakeholders must be assured that the risks of both autonomous and adapted behavior are properly assessed and managed. This paper presents a complete framework for a risk-aware EIA (RA-EIA) which uses reflection in order to manage the risks associated with autonomous agents and prospective adaptations. Monte Carlo simulation is used to reduce the frequency of emergent misbehavior appearing during regular operation. Meanwhile, an exploratory testing method, termed evolutionary learning of event sequences, is used to deal with the possibility of severe emergent misbehavior as the result of an malicious adversary or a series of unfortunate events. The experimental evaluations and accompanying descriptive example, for the application area of logistics via pickup and delivery problems, demonstrate that the risk-aware adaptations provided from consultation with the RA-EIA agent allow the client system to be trusted for long-term independent and reliable operational efficiency.

AB Currently, depression has become a common mental disorder and one of the main causes of disability worldwide. Due to the difference in depressive symptoms evoked by individual differences, how to design comprehensive and effective depression detection methods has become an urgent demand. This study explored from physiological and behavioral perspectives simultaneously and fused pervasive electroencephalography (EEG) and vocal signals to make the detection of depression more objective, effective and convenient. After extraction of several effective features for these two types of signals, we trained six representational classifiers on each modality, then denoted diversity and correlation of decisions from different classifiers using co-decision tensor and combined these decisions into the ultimate classification result with multi-agent strategy. Experimental results on 170 (81 depressed patients and 89 normal controls) subjects showed that the proposed multi-modal depression detection strategy is superior to the single-modal classifiers or other typical late fusion strategies in accuracy, f1-score and sensitivity. This work indicates that late fusion of pervasive physiological and behavioral signals is promising for depression detection and the multi-agent strategy can take advantage of diversity and correlation of different classifiers effectively to gain a better final decision.

AB This paper poses the enclosing control problem with identical geometry for a group of targets which are either stationary or moving and offers consensus-based distributed control protocols. An estimator is first introduced to estimate the central position of the targets. We then propose a target-enclosing control law with velocity information based on the centre estimating algorithm and consensus theory. A target-enclosing control law without the velocity information is further designed. The Lyapunov theory and Lasalle's invariance principle are applied to show the convergence of the proposed control algorithms. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy.

AB Event-triggered sampling control is motivated by the applications of embedded microprocessors equipped in the agents with limited computation and storage resources. This paper studied global consensus in multi-agent systems with inherent nonlinear dynamics on general directed networks using decentralised event-triggered strategy. For each agent, the controller updates are event-based and only triggered at its own event times by only utilising the locally current sampling data. A high-performance sampling event that only needs local neighbours' states at their own discrete time instants is presented. Furthermore, we introduce two kinds of general algebraic connectivity for strongly connected networks and strongly connected components of the directed network containing a spanning tree so as to describe the system's ability for reaching consensus. A detailed theoretical analysis on consensus is performed and two criteria are derived by virtue of algebraic graph theory, matrix theory and Lyapunov control approach. It is shown that the Zeno behaviour of triggering time sequence is excluded during the system's whole working process. A numerical simulation is given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB The location of public electric vehicle charging stations (PEVCSs) has a great influence on the operational efficiency of charging stations, charging behaviours of EVs and the power quality of grids. To optimise the PEVCS locations for plug-in electric taxis (PETs), this study proposes to utilise the multi-agent system (MAS) and evidential reasoning (ER) approach. First, an MAS simulation framework for PET operation is proposed to dynamically simulate the PETs' daily operation and estimate the charging demands of PETs, where a variety of agents are built to simulate not only the operation related players but also the operational environments. To accelerate the convergence rate and provide better operational strategies for PETs, a multi-step learning is developed to make decisions for PET agents whether to find passengers or to charge under various situations. Moreover, a multi-objective model for optimising the location of PEVCSs is developed considering the benefits of PETs and the power grid. Finally, an ER approach is applied to determine the final optimal siting considering the uncertainties of the assessor's cognition. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed MAS simulation framework and ER approach can effectively optimise the PEVCS locations.

DE multi-agent simulation; dilemma game of environment; value system
ID PRISONERS-DILEMMA; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION
AB To induce whether we can obtain a sustainable society by shifting our paradigm from the materialistic to the eco-conscientious, we established a multi-agent simulation model. The model primarily featured a dilemma structure encouraged by a conflict between each agent's private desire to earn more and the need for environmental conservation. Another important feature is that the model has two evolutionary layers. The subordinate layer is a learning system comprised of a finite state machine (FSM) and a genetic algorithm (GA) primarily, which is carried with each individual agent to determine his/her next behavior and how much he/she must earn to maximize an individual fitness function. The supra layer is the so-called value system, the gene pool of which is shared within the society. The value system stipulates an agent's fitness function, which in turn affects the agent's behavior. The value system of each agent was set up to be entirely ego-oriented at the beginning of the simulation episode. A numerical experiment based on the model reveals a scene in which, under a certain condition related to assumptions of the value system, a group of agents undergoes a paradigm shift from the ego-oriented materialism to the eco-conscious sustainable society. The key condition is a latent existence of several values that ultimately lead to sustainability, even though they do not work at all at the beginning of the episode. In terms of the evolutionary game theory, this implies that changing game structure on the way of a simulation episode by transforming the fitness function seems to be much powerful measures for the emergent collective cooperation among the agents than ordinal options to support cooperation. In addition, we made a detailed analysis on how assumed agents have obtained a sustainable value system. Each agent has an individual decision-making process based on the input with a learning mechanism. We focus here on two types of learning system, the finite state machine (FSM) plus genetic algorithm (GA), and profit shearing (PS). Observation of the generative trails of FSM and the value table of PS lead us to a profound understanding of what kind of inception triggers the emergence of a sustainable society.

AB This paper illustrates the use of computer simulation for the formalization of theories. The multi-agent model Dreamscape is an operationalization of Esser's Rational Choice Theory with a multi-agent system. The author examines the dynamics of the Rational Choice Theory by analyzing the emergence of social order our of the "state of nature" (Hobbes). The computer-based rational choice model Dreamscape models the "state of nature" as described by Hobbes with relative exactness. The computer-based analysis shows that conjunct norms emerge if deadly violence is not allowed. Oil the other hand, if individuals use deadly violence no social order emerges. A further result is the demand for an extension of the rules that regulate the creation of bridge hypotheses, which guide the operationalization of Esser's rational choice theory.

AB In recent years, formation control of multi-agent has been a significant research subject in the field of cooperative control. However, previous works have mainly concentrated on formation control for simple point-mass model and linear model. In contrast, this paper presents a novel cooperative algorithm for multiple air vehicles formation control, which aims to devise a control strategy based on guidance route to achieve precisely coordinated formation control for a group of fixed-wing aircraft in a complex task environment. The proposed method introduces the leader-follower structure for effective organization of the multi-agent coordination. Moreover, the Partial Integrated Formation and Control (PIFC) is adopted to design the control law for Guidance-Route based Formation Control (GRFC). Additionally, the proposed approach designs two guidance-route generation strategies for two special situations to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRFC in complex task environments. Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed control protocol for guidance command can ensure the overall stability and tracking accuracy of the system. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results, and verify that the proposed approach can achieve coordinated formation control precisely in a complex task environment.

ID SOCIAL NETWORKS; TRUST; REPUTATION
AB A great deal of effort has been made to introduce trust models to assess trustworthiness within virtual societies. The great majority of them makes extensive use of direct experience as the main source of information, considering recommendation/reputation and inferential processes just later, as a secondary mechanism to refine trust assessment. In this kind of networks, unfortunately, direct experience might not always represent the best solution to assess trustworthiness. In fact, their highly dynamic structure promotes an increase of the average number of interconnections among agents. This in turn negatively affects the degree of knowledge the agents possess about each specific individual, i.e. direct experience. To date, however, it has not been said much about how to face these situations.
   It is fundamental to find an effective approach for trust assessment even in lack of direct experience, which is the central focus of this research. By the means of a multi-agent social simulation, we consider the situation in which an agent can just access indirect knowledge for trust assessment, namely recommendations of specific individuals or whole categories of individuals. Then, we compare the efficiency of these two approaches in order to identify when it is more convenient to rely on the first or on the second one. As expected, our results confirm that the dynamic nature of these networks strongly affects the role of categories. We modeled this feature introducing the "turnover" in the simulations, whereby the higher is the turnover the more convenient it is relying on categories. Besides this confirmatory result, our simulations highlight the higher degree of robustness of categories in the presence of unreliable recommenders. Such a result is even more significant if there is no available information about how reliable the recommenders are.
   The results we obtained are in accordance with the current literature and can be of important interest for the development of this sector. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Among real-system applications of AI, the field of traffic simulation makes use of a wide range of techniques and algorithms. Especially, microscopic models of road traffic have been expanding for several years. Indeed, Multi-Agent Systems provide the capability of modeling the very diversity of individual behaviors. Several professional tools provide comprehensive sets of ready-made, accurate behaviors for several kinds of vehicles. The price in such tools is the difficulty to modify the nature of programmed behaviors, and the specialization in a single purpose, e.g. either Studying resulting flows, or providing an irnmersive virtual reality environment. Thus, we advocate for a more flexible approach for the design of multi -purpose tools for decision support. Especially, the use of geographical open databases offers the opportunity to design agent-based traffic simulators which can be continuously informed of changes in traffic conditions. Our proposal also makes decision support systems able to integrate environmental and behavioral modifications in a linear fashion, and to compare various scenarios built from different hypotheses in terms of actors, behaviors, environment and flows. We also describe here the prototype tool that has been implemented according to our design principles.

AB Since its dawn as a discipline, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has focused on mimicking the human mental processes. As AI applications matured, the interest for employing them into real-world complex systems (i.e., coupling AI with Cyber-Physical Systems-CPS) kept increasing. In the last decades, the multi-agent systems (MAS) paradigm has been among the most relevant approaches fostering the development of intelligent systems. In numerous scenarios, MAS boosted distributed autonomous reasoning and behaviors. However, many real-world applications (e.g., CPS) demand the respect of strict timing constraints. Unfortunately, current AI/MAS theories and applications only reason "about time" and are incapable of acting "in time" guaranteeing any timing predictability. This paper analyzes the MAS compliance with strict timing constraints (real-time compliance)-crucial for safety-critical applications such as healthcare, industry 4.0, and automotive. Moreover, it elicits the main reasons for the lack of real-time satisfiability in MAS (originated from current theories, standards, and implementations). In particular, traditional internal agent schedulers (general-purpose-like), communication middlewares, and negotiation protocols have been identified as co-factors inhibiting real-time compliance. To pave the road towards reliable and predictable MAS, this paper postulates a formal definition and mathematical model of real-time multi-agent systems (RT-MAS). Furthermore, this paper presents the results obtained by testing the dynamics characterizing the RT-MAS model within the simulator MAXIM-GPRT. Thus, it has been possible to analyze the deadline miss ratio between the algorithms employed in the most popular frameworks and the proposed ones. Finally, discussing the obtained results, the ongoing and future steps are outlined.

AB This paper studies the leader-following bounded consensus problem for multi-agent systems (MAS) in the present of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by means of event-triggered control strategy. Due to the existence of DoS attacks, the original system is transformed into a switched system with both stable and unstable modes. Moreover, DoS attacks can be characterized by frequency and duration constraints under which the bounded consensus can be still guaranteed. It is shown that the duration constraint can be replaced by choosing appropriate mode-dependent average dwell time (MDADT) for each subsystem. In order to obtain a smaller consensus bound and feedback gain matrices simultaneously, an optimization approach is proposed. In addition, the Zeno behavior that may be introduced by event-triggered control is excluded. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the bounded consensus can be still achieved under the co-designed event-triggered control strategy despite the presence of DoS attacks.

AB The number of computationally-based models of human social behavior is growing rapidly. In fact, the current ease of programming is resulting in a plethora of tools with impressive interfaces but little theoretical power under the hood. Further, the overabundance of new toolkits for building models is facilitating the excessively rapid growth of simple proof-of-concept, or intellective, models. The current state of models range from the simplistic to the elaborate, from the conceptual to the empirical, and from the purely notional to the validatable. This review briefly describes the state of human social behavioral modeling. Key issues surrounding analysis and validation are discussed.

ID LANGUAGE EVOLUTION
AB We simulate the evolution of a domain vocabulary in small communities. Empirical data show that human communicators can evolve graphical languages quickly in a constrained task (Pictionary), and that communities converge towards a common language. We propose that simulations of such cultural evolution incorporate properties of human memory (cue-based retrieval, learning, decay). A cognitive model is described that encodes abstract concepts with small sets of concrete, related concepts (directing), and that also decodes such signs (matching). Learning captures conventionalized signs. Relatedness of concepts is characterized by a mixture of shared and individual knowledge, which we sample from a text corpus. Simulations show vocabulary convergence of agent communities of varied structure, but idiosyncrasy in vocabularies of each dyad of models. Convergence is weakened when agents do not alternate between encoding and decoding, predicting the necessity of bi-directional communication. Convergence is improved by explicit feedback about communicative success. We hypothesize that humans seek out subtle clues to gauge success in order to guide their vocabulary acquisition.

AB This paper studies a class of multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to deception signal and communication interference. The objective of the present work is to establish a flexible and generalized distributed dynamic event-triggered control (DDETC) with impulsive signal to make the investigated MASs achieve secure consensus under redundant signal and communication interference. It is shown that Zeno behavior can be precluded with such a DDETC. The challenging but valuable new designed DDETC scheme shows the trigger is developed to achieve itself away from exceeding the data transmission load through parameter adjustment, to reduce redundant triggering, to flexibly adjust the triggered frequency, and even to replace sampled-data scheme as special cases. By the impulsive DDETC, anti deception and anti-interference techniques, the secure consensus criteria of MASs are constructed cleverly. Numerical examples with simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and control protocol. (C) 2020 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the leader-tracking and the containment control problems for heterogeneous high-order Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) sharing information through a directed communication topology. To solve both the control problems, a fully-distributed Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control strategy is proposed, whose stability is analytically proven by exploiting the regulator equations and the Static Output Feedback (SOF) procedure adapted to the MASs framework. The application of SOF allows recasting the PID control design problem into a state-feedback control design one and, hence, finding the proper values of the proportional, integral and derivative actions via classical state-feedback approaches, such as the Linear-Quadratic-Regulator (LQR) strategy. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guaranteeing that each follower tracks the leader behavior in the case of leader-tracking and that each follower converges to the convex hull spanned by the multiple leaders in the case of containment control.

AB This article presents an overview of multi-agent system models of land-use/cover change (MAS/LUCC models). This special class of LUCC models combines a cellular landscape model with agent-based representations of decision making, integrating the two components through specification of interdependencies and feedbacks between agents and their environment. The authors review alternative LUCC modeling techniques and discuss the ways in which MAS/LUCC models may overcome some important limitations of existing techniques. We briefly review ongoing MAS/LUCC modeling efforts in four research areas. We discuss the potential strengths of MAS/LUCC models and suggest that these strengths guide researchers in assessing the appropriate choice of model for their particular research question. We find that MAS/LUCC models are particularly well suited for representing complex spatial interactions under heterogeneous conditions and for modeling decentralized, autonomous decision making. We discuss a range of possible roles for MAS/LUCC models, from abstract models designed to derive stylized hypotheses to empirically detailed simulation models appropriate for scenario and policy analysis. We also discuss the challenge of validation and verification for MAS/LUCC models. Finally, we outline important challenges and open research questions in this new field. We conclude that, while significant challenges exist, these models offer a promising new tool for researchers whose goal is to create fine-scale models of LUCC phenomena that focus on human-environment interactions.

AB Control of collective behavior is one of the most desirable goals in many applications related to social networks analysis and mining. In this work we propose a simple yet effective algorithm to control opinion formation in complex networks. We aim at finding the best spreaders whose connection to a reasonable number of informed agents results in the best performance. We consider an extended version of the bounded confidence model in which the uncertainty of each agent is adaptively controlled by the network. A number of informed agents with the desired opinion value is added to the network and create links with other agents such that large portion of the network follows their opinions. We propose to connect the informed agents to nodes with small in-degrees and high out-degree that are connected to high in-degree nodes. Our experimental results on both model and real social networks show superior performance of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art heuristic methods in the facet of opinion formation models.

AB This work introduces and illustrates the potential of intelligent agent-based modelling and simulation as a tool for understanding individual action and group performance in common-pool resource dilemmas. A model was developed, based on previously documented common-pool resource experiments, and simulated using the Swarm multi-agent simulation environment. Agents in these models were designed to represent the actions of the individual appropriators in the experiments and the common-pool resource itself. The intelligent agents developed for these simulations possess adaptive capabilities. They select amongst alternative strategies the one that appears to yield the best performance under current conditions. Simulations of this model rendered observations of some potential relationships between individual action and group performance in common-pool resource experimental situations. In particular adaptive agents generated group level behaviour with similar performance characteristics to groups in actual experiments. Some potential future directions for this research, and possible applications iri natural resources management, are discussed. (C) 1999 Academic Press.

The fixed-time consensus is obtained via an event-triggered control, and it can be reached within a settling time for any initial state. Continuous communication can be avoided both in the update of the controller and triggering condition monitoring. Consequently, the energy consumption can be significantly reduced. It is proven that no Zeno behavior occurs under the proposed event-triggered consensus control strategies. Finally, some numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB During the past decades, high-fidelity realistic simulations of various flying insects exhibiting collective behavior have been broadly used in entertainment industries and virtual reality applications. However, due to the intrinsic complexity and high computational cost, shape constrained simulation of collective behaviors remains a challenging topic. In this paper, we present a robust multi-agent model for large-scale controllable shape constrained simulation of flying insects. Specifically, we design an internal force model to biologically mimic an individual insect. We also propose an external force model based on a trade-off mechanic to guide the insects smoothly deforming into a target shape. Our experimental results and comparative studies show our method is able to simulate realistic and dynamic flying insects with various user-specified shape constraints.

ID INTELLIGENCE
AB This paper describes an architecture for controlling and coordinating autonomous agents, building on previous work addressing reactive and deliberative control methods. The proposed multilayered hybrid architecture allows a rationally bounded, goal-directed agent to reason predictively about potential conflicts by constructing knowledge level models that explain other agents' observed behaviors and hypothesize their beliefs, desires, and intentions; at the same time, it enables the agent to operate autonomously, to react promptly to changes in its real-time environment, and to coordinate its actions effectively with other agents. A principal aim of this research is to understand the role different functional capabilities play in constraining apt agent's behavior under varying environmental conditions. To this end, an experimental test bed has been constructed comprising a simulated multi-agent world in which a variety of agent configurations and behaviors have been investigated. A number of experimental findings are reported.

AB This paper studies an event-triggered distributed optimal coordination problem for heterogeneous linear multi-agent systems with external disturbances. A new distributed optimal coordination algorithm based on event-triggered communication is proposed to deal with heterogeneous agents having a relative degree two. By utilizing the input-to-state stability guaranteed by the proposed algorithm, a novel distributed event-triggering condition is designed. It is showed that the robust distributed optimal coordination problem can be solved practically without Zeno behavior. Moreover, the relationship between the parameters in event-triggering conditions and the system performance is also studied. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The persistent coverage control problem is formulated based on cell discretisation of two-dimensional mission space and time-increasing cell ages. A new performance function is defined to represent the coverage level of the mission space, and time behaviour is evaluated by the probabilistic method based on the detection model of agents. For comparison, persistent coverage controllers are designed by a target-based approach and a reactive approach. Both controllers are designed in a distributed manner using Voronoi tessellation and Delaunay graph-based local information sharing. Numerical simulation is performed to analyse the evaluated mean age of cells and evaluated coverage level over time for the designed persistent coverage controllers. The differences between the evaluation model and simulation situation are discussed.

AB In energy markets, regulators are often tempted to use price schedules to improve economic efficiency and promote a reasonable resource allocation. Time-of-use pricing is very popular with economists, and many researchers have been written estimating and exploring the optimal time-of-use pricing for electricity markets. Yet, such pricing has rarely been used in the natural gas sector. In this paper, we propose an optimal time-of-use pricing in urban gas market based on an evolutionary game-theoretic perspective. As the urban gas market is a nonlinear complex economic system with several interacting agents, we use a multi-agent system comprising a government agent, a local gas distribution operator agent, and different types of end-user agents. A power structure demand response program is employed to simulate the user demand response. A mixed-integer linear programming is formulated to determine the time-of-use price-signal delivering maximum gas operator profit and the optimal load pattern for end-users. In an illustrative example, we simulate and compare the time-of-use block prices and time of-use hourly prices with traditional fixed pricing using real-world data of Wuhan in China. The numerical results indicate that time-of-use pricing schedules have significant potential for peak-shaving and load-shifting for urban gas pipeline network systems and would thus lower operating costs. Furthermore, different gas users exhibit different demand responsiveness intensity. Finally, we evaluate the impact on total social welfare of regulation scenarios and find that welfare decreases with deregulation, implying that the urban gas market is immature and reasonable regulation is still necessary.

AB A multi-agent spin model for changes of prices in the stock market is considered, based on the Ising-like cellular automaton with global, randomly varying in time interactions between traders. The presence of "fundamentalists" is taken into account by introducing additional term in the local field acting on each agent, dependent on the ratio between the actual stock price and its fundamental value. Numerical multi-agent as well as mean-field simulations show that for properly chosen parameters, the time series of logarithmic price returns exhibit bursting typical of volatility clustering, due to appearance of attractor bubbling in the model. Distributions of price returns show the power-law tails, and the corresponding cumulative distributions have regions of power scaling, with exponents comparable to those observed in empirical time series of stock price returns.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate lag-bipartite consensus of linear multiagent systems under saturating input with dead-zone constraint where two separate groups of follower agents reach the modulus of the leader state, but of opposite sign with a certain delay. The leader-follower bipartite consensus problem of saturating input with dead-zone is considered with the input signals of the followers being subjected to leader-influenced input additive uncertainties and disturbances. It is shown that if the agents interacting with each-other over the structurally balanced undirected graph having a directed spanning tree rooted at the leader are asymptotically null controllable with bounded controls, then the two proposed control laws - (i) a low-high gain based control law and (ii) a low-gain based variable-structure continuous tracking control law, can achieve lag-bipartite consensus as long as the initial conditions of all the agents remain within a priori bounded set. The numerical simulations establish the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

TI The role of reflection in simulating and testing agents: An exploration

SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Simulation methods offer an experimental approach for analyzing the dynamic behavior of multi-agent systems. Multi-agent systems are able to access their own behavior. If agents are specified in the modeling language and become part of the simulation, the simulation system has to support reflection, i.e., models which access their own structure and behavior. The system theoretic formalism DYNDEVS allows to specify reflective dynamic models and their behavior and forms a sound base to implement systems for simulating and testing agents. Within a simulation system, the behavior of agents can be analyzed, based on conceptual models, or by coupling software agents and simulation system. To support the latter, in JAMES, models are equipped with peripheral ports to enable them to communicate with externally running processes, e. g., agents. Thereby, models form an interface between simulation and agents and can easily be used to reflect "online'' the state and activities of the externally running agent. To intertwine simulation and agent execution, method calls of the agents have to be redirected from the normal runtime environment to the simulation. In the opposite direction, events of the simulation have to be transformed into concrete method calls. Higher-order programming mechanisms, such as the reflection mechanisms in Java, are useful for implementing this type of interaction between simulation and agents. Thus, from theory to implementing, reflection in its many facets plays a crucial role in developing simulation systems for agents.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to reveal the pattern of passengers' transferring on occasion of a large crowd being stranded at transportation hubs (such as a bus station, railway station, airport, etc.) in climate disasters, and then propose the proper policy recommendations for the government to evacuate stranded passengers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A model is established based on Bayesian network and influence diagram to catch the features of a passenger's decision-making process, and the transition probabilities of passengers are revised on the basis of the theory of herd behaviors in information to describe the influence of group behaviors on passenger individuals. Subsequently, a multi-agent model is developed in Repast platform in Java language, and simulation and analysis are also made.
   Findings - The results of simulation show that it is possible to apply the theory of herd behaviors and the multi-agent method in analyzing the effectiveness of government policies on evacuating stranded passengers in climate disasters.
   Originality/value - The research of this paper has important practical significance for the government to developing policies to evacuating stranded passengers in climate disasters, and is a useful exploration to open up new methodologies for emergency management.

AB In this note, the problem of second-order leader-following consensus by a novel distributed event-triggered sampling scheme in which agents exchange information via a limited communication medium is studied. Event-based distributed sampling rules are designed, where each agent decides when to measure its own state value and requests its neighbor agents broadcast their state values across the network when a locally-computed measurement error exceeds a state-dependent threshold. For the case of fixed topology, a necessary and sufficient condition is established. For the case of switching topology, a sufficient condition is obtained under the assumption that the time-varying directed graph is uniformly jointly connected. It is shown that the inter-event intervals are lower bounded by a strictly positive constant, which excludes the Zeno-behavior before the consensus is achieved. Numerical simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the correctness of theoretical results.

AB A multi-agent spin model for changes of prices in the stock market based on the Ising-like cellular automaton with interactions between traders randomly varying in time is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The structure of interactions has topology of scale-free networks with degree distributions obeying a power scaling law with various scaling exponents. The scale-free networks are obtained as growing networks where new nodes (agents) are linked to the existing ones according to a preferential attachment rule with an initial attractiveness ascribed to each node. In certain ranges of parameters, depending on the exponent in the degree distribution, the time series of the logarithmic price returns exhibit intermittent bursting typical of volatility clustering, and the tails of the distributions of returns obey a power scaling law with exponents comparable to those obtained from the empirical data. The distributions of returns show also dependence on the number of agents, in particular in the case of networks with the scaling exponents of the degree distributions typical of the social and communications networks.

AB This article outlines a new approach to the study of religious commitment. Starting with a variant on Schelling's classic model of mobility and segregation, we develop a multi-agent religion simulation (MARS) that incorporates insights from theories of religious choice, social influence, and preference formation. Compared to standard statistical methods, MARS does a better job of linking individual choices and collective outcomes. In particular, it demonstrates that stable regional patterns require a balanced combination of attachment to personal identity and adaptation to the social environment.

AB When working in conjunction with multiagent systems, virtual organizations attempt to simulate the functions and interactions of entities in different environments. Recent studies have addressed the problem of assigning roles to agents that form part of the organization, and incorporating new agents to carry out certain tasks. However, these studies are limited to defining the norms and rules that determine the behavior of the organization. The present study proposes a virtual organization model for egovernment environments to assign resources and minimize the required personnel by forecasting workloads. To this end, a neural network, queuing theory, and CBR are used to obtain an efficient distribution. Queuing theory can establish the number of agents with a specific role that are necessary to maximize profits, while the network distributes roles among agents according to their respective efficiency. The final part of the paper is focused on validating the plan developed inside a case study centered on e-government in order to obtain empirical results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Collision avoidance decision-making models of multiple agents in virtual driving environment are studied. Based on the behavioral characteristics and hierarchical structure of the collision avoidance decision-making in real life driving, delphi approach and mathematical statistics method are introduced to construct pair-wise comparison judgment matrix of collision avoidance decision choices to each collision situation. Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is adopted to establish the agents' collision avoidance decision-making model. To simulate drivers' characteristics, driver factors are added to categorize driving modes into impatient mode, normal mode, and the cautious mode. The results show that this model can simulate human's thinking process, and the agents in the virtual environment can deal with collision situations and make decisions to avoid collisions without intervention. The model can also reflect diversity and uncertainty of real life driving behaviors, and solves the multi-objective, multi-choice ranking priority problem in multi-vehicle collision scenarios. This collision avoidance model of multi-agents model is feasible and effective, and can provide richer and closer-to-life virtual scene for driving simulator, reflecting real-life traffic environment more truly, this model can also promote the practicality, of driving simulator.

AB Honey bees show the impressive ability to choose collectively (through swarm intelligence) between nectar sources of different quality by selecting the energetically optimal one. We here present results from a multi-agent simulation of a cohort of foraging bees. The model, which is built on proximate individual mechanisms, leads to interesting results on the (global) colony level. The simulation allows us to investigate collective foraging decisions in a variety of experimental setups that can be reproduced experimentally with real bees. Because our model allows us to project the daily net honey gain of the simulated honey bee colony, it enables us to explore the economic results of foraging decisions, even in a fluctuating environment. We used the model to investigate the dynamics and efficiency of a bee colony's decentralized decision system in terms of minimizing the potential cost of lost nectar income due to changes in food quality in a fluctuating environment.

The proposed controller is based on the disturbance observer which is a robust output feedback controller. It is noted that agents are allowed to use only outputs of their neighbors and the proposed controller uses only relative measurements. Since only outputs are exchanged among agents, the amount of information exchange does not depend on the dimension of agents' dynamics. Numerical simulations are included to validate the theory.

AB Minimising the damage caused by natural disasters such as tsunamis in vulnerable coastal areas requires the development of an emergency action plan. An evacuation plan can reduce the damaging impact of an unexpected tsunami. One of the most important factors in developing an action plan is a guideline for choosing proper evacuation routes in order to minimise loss of life and property. In this study, an evacuation network is designed to develop an evacuation plan based on a hierarchical network design problem used in communication networks, public transport, and social organisation network designs. Experimental analyses have been carried out in order to find effective evacuation plans at Haeundae Beach, Busan, Korea, using multi-agent transportation simulation (MATSim). In order to design an effective hierarchical evacuation network, a hierarchical evacuation network design is developed using the concepts of hub location, clustering, and network design. Further, we consider contraflow in the evacuation network, as well as determination of corridor lines by the minimum distance rule, maximal flow rule, maximum accessible rule, and minimum travel time rule. As a result of running each scenario using MATSim, a criterion for establishing the corridor line is evaluated. An optimal evacuation route is found to minimise overcrowded queues of evacuees, when the total evacuation time from the area of the tsunami is approximately 3 hours and 30 minutes.

AB This paper studies the distributed finite-time containment control for a group of mobile agents modeled by double-integrator dynamics under multiple dynamic leaders with bounded unknown acceleration inputs. A class of distributed finite-time containment protocols is proposed without relying velocity and acceleration measurements. This kind of protocols can drive the states of the followers to track the convex hull spanned by those of the leaders in finite time under the constraint that the leaders' acceleration inputs are unknown but bounded for all the followers. Further, by computing the value of the Lyapunov function at the initial point, the finite settling time can also be theoretically estimated for the second-order finite-time containment control problems. Finally, the effectiveness of the results is illustrated by numerical simulation.

AB Multi-agent (or MA) -based design approaches have received much research attention lately for modeling immunological systems due to their efficacy in representing non-heterogeneous behaviors in the population under dynamic environmental and topological conditions. The update scheme of a MA model refers to the frequency of agent state updates and how these are related in temporal order. In contrast to verifiable agent behavioral rules at the individual level, the update scheme is a design decision made by the model developer at the systems level that is subject to realism and computational efficiency issues that directly affect the credibility and the usefulness of the simulation results. Previous works have mainly focused on the issue of realism with respect to synchrony of updates but have often overlooked the necessary heterogeneity in update frequencies due to multi-timescales in immunological phenomena. To incorporate such multi-timescales for realism, the efficiency of the update scheme arises as a nontrivial issue. An event-scheduling based asynchronous update scheme has the advantage of allowing arbitrary smaller timescales for realism and avoiding unnecessary execution and delays to achieve efficiency. In this paper we present the application of the event-scheduling update scheme to realistically model the B cell life cycle, and empirically compare its simulation performance with the widely adopted uniform time-step update scheme. The simulation results show a significantly reduced execution time (40 times faster) and also reveal the conditions where the event-scheduling update scheme is superior.

AB Human behavior Modeling and simulation has become one of the most challenging research topics in many sectors where safety and organizational complexity are key issues. This paper involves constructing an integrative behavior framework for autonomous virtual miner agents that populate believably virtual coalmine environment to simulate human behaviors of underground coalmine. In this study, we present an emotional behavior model for virtual miner based on cognitive appraisal theories. The proposed models can generate more believable behaviors in virtual environment based on the personalized emotion states, internal motivation needs, and behavior selection thresholds of virtual miners. In addition, we take into account the impacts of underground mine workers' personality straits on the intensity threshold of emotions, the emotion's decay, and the motivation update process. Finally, we implement an interactive virtual environment for underground human behavior simulation. The behavior believability of virtual miner was evaluated with user assessment method. Experimental results show that the proposed models can create more realistic real-time virtual coalmine environments to simulate human behavior resulting in underground accidents.

AB Organizational structures are complex and vary according to sector, field, and type of business or service. In order to be effective, an organization needs to tailor its activities to the environment in which is it located. Based on contingency perspectives, this study is focused on investigating effective ways to design team diversity and maximize team creativity according to task difficulty levels. Considering the organizational team member as an agent, the study employed a multi-agent simulation method to understand the progress of creative manifestation, by observing the exploration and exploitation activity of team members over certain periods of time. The results first reveal that the level of team diversity influences the amount of creativity manifested by team members' activities, such as exploration and exploitation. Second, managers have to properly facilitate either exploration or exploitation depending on task difficulty by striking a balance between them. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Using poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) particles for drug encapsulation and delivery has recently gained considerable popularity for a number of reasons. An advantage in one sense, but a drawback of PLGA use in another, is that drug delivery systems made of this material can provide a wide range of dissolution profiles, due to their internal structure and properties related to particles' manufacture. The advantages of enriching particulate drug design experimentation with computer models, are evident with simulations used to predict and optimize design, as well as indicate choice of best manufacturing parameters. In the present work, we seek to understand the phenomena observed for PLGA micro- and nanospheres, through Cellular Automata (CA)agent-based Monte Carlo (MC) models. Systems are studied both overlarge temporal scales (capturing slow erosion of PLGA) and for various spatial configurations (capturing initial as well as dynamic morphology). The major strength of this multi-agent approach is to observe dissolution directly, by monitoring the emergent behaviour: the dissolution profile manifested, as a sphere erodes. Different problematic aspects of the modelling process are discussed in details in this paper. The models were tested on experimental data from literature, demonstrating very good performance. Quantitative discussion is provided throughout the text in order to make a demonstration of the use in practice of the proposed model. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Staggered working hours has the potential to alleviate excessive demands on urban transport networks during the morning and afternoon peak hours and influence the travel behavior of individuals by affecting their activity schedules and reducing their commuting times. This study proposes a multi-agent-based Q-learning algorithm for evaluating the influence of staggered work hours by simulating travelers' time and location choices in their activity patterns. Interactions among multiple travelers were also considered. Various types of agents were identified based on real activity-travel data for a mid-sized city in China. Reward functions based on time and location information were constructed using Origin-Destination (OD) survey data to simulate individuals' temporal and spatial choices simultaneously. Interactions among individuals were then described by introducing a road impedance function to formulate a dynamic environment in which one traveler's decisions influence the decisions of other travelers. Lastly, by applying the Q-learning algorithm, individuals' activity-travel patterns under staggered working hours were simulated. Based on the simulation results, the effects of staggered working hours were evaluated on both a macroscopic level, at which the space-time distribution of the traffic volume in the network was determined, and a microscopic level, at which the timing of individuals' leisure activities and their daily household commuting costs were determined. Based on the simulation results and experimental tests, an optimal scheme for staggering working hours was developed.

DT Article

ID FOOT PATROL; HOT-SPOTS; DISPLACEMENT; SIMULATION
AB This paper presents a formal game-theoretic belief learning approach to model criminology's routine activity theory (RAT). RAT states that for a crime to occur a motivated offender (criminal) and a desirable target (victim) must meet in space and time without the presence of capable guardianship (law enforcement). The novelty in using belief learning to model the dynamics of RAT's offender, target, and guardian behaviors within an agent-based model is that the agents learn and adapt given observation of other agents' actions without knowledge of the payoffs that drove the other agents' choices. This is in contrast to other crime modeling research that has used reinforcement learning where the accumulated rewards gained from prior experiences are used to guide agent learning. This is an important distinction given the dynamics of RAT. It is the presence of the various agent types that provide opportunity for crime to occur, and not the potential for reward. Additionally, the belief learning approach presented fits the observed empirical data of case studies, producing statistically significant results with lower variance when compared to a reinforcement learning approach. Application of this new approach supports law enforcement in developing responses to crime problems and planning for the effects of displacement due to directed responses, thus deterring offenders and protecting the public through crime modeling with multi-agent learning.

AB This article presents a self-adaptive, wasp-based control model for real-time part routing in a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). Inspired from the natural system of a wasp colony, the proposed control model is a multi-agent system that exhibits adaptive behaviour. It uses simple rules built on a decentralized architecture and hence it overcomes the drawbacks of traditional agent-based systems, such as long negotiation times among agents. The production problem, which has been previously studied in the literature, includes real-time routing of parts with the objective of minimizing average waiting times and average cycle times in a large FMS that consists of 40 machines. The proposed wasp-based control model is benchmarked via simulation under various experimental conditions against those previously published studies. The simulation study shows that it outperforms the previously reported studies when the production system is heavily loaded and prone to congestion. The self-adaptive nature of the proposed model makes it robust in the presence of such dynamic, unexpected changes occurring in the FMS.

AB The uncertainties arising from the plant model and topologies have been a major challenge in multiagent consensus control. This article presents a distributed robust control method for an uncertain multiagent system with eigenvalue-bounded topologies. The heterogeneity of node dynamics is described as the uncertainties of a linear model with a common certain part. The linear transformation method is adopted to decompose topologically coupled controllers. Then, the linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) technique is used to numerically solve the distributed robust controller problem. It is proved that such a controller is robust stable under the condition that the topology is eigenvalue-bounded. The effectiveness of this method is validated by the simulation of a group of unmanned ground vehicles compared with the LQR controller.

AB Many tracking problems in flocking are related to a single (virtual) leader with a constant velocity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of controlling a group of mobile autonomous agents to track multiple virtual leaders with varying velocities in the sense that agents with the same virtual leader attain the same velocity and track the corresponding leader. We propose a provably-stable flocking algorithm. Moreover, we show that the position and velocity of the center of the mass of all agents will exponentially converge to weighted average position and velocity of the virtual leaders. Numerical simulations are worked out to illustrate theoretical results.

AB Physarum Polycephalum is a unicellular and multi-headed slime mold, which can form high efficient networks connecting spatially separated food sources in the process of foraging. Such adaptive networks exhibit a unique characteristic in which network length and fault tolerance are appropriately balanced. Based on the biological observations, the foraging process of Physarum demonstrates two self-organized behaviors, i.e., search and contraction. In this paper, these two behaviors are captured in a multi-agent system. Two types of agents and three transition rules are designed to imitate the search and the contraction behaviors of Physarum based on the necessary and the sufficient conditions of a self-organized computational system. Some simulations of foraging process are used to investigate the characteristics of our system. Experimental results show that our system can autonomously search for food sources and then converge to a stable solution, which replicates the foraging process of Physarum. Specially, a case study of maze problem is used to estimate the path-finding ability of the foraging behaviors of Physarum. What's more, the model inspired by the foraging behaviors of Physarum is proposed to optimize meta-heuristic algorithms for solving optimization problems. Through comparing the optimized algorithms and the corresponding traditional algorithms, we have found that the optimization strategies have a higher computational performance than their corresponding traditional algorithms, which further justifies that the foraging behaviors of Physarum have a higher computational ability.

ID ARGUMENTATION
AB Argumentation-based negotiation (ABN) is an effective means of resolving conflicts in a multi-agent society. However, it consumes both time and computational resources for agents to generate, select and evaluate arguments. Furthermore, in many cases, argumentation is not the only means of resolving conflicts. Thus, some could be avoided either by finding an alternative means (evading the conflict) or by modifying the intended course of action (re-planning). Therefore, it would be advantageous for agents to identify those situations and weigh the costs and the benefits of arguing before using it to resolve conflicts. To this end, we present a preliminary empirical analysis to evaluate the performance of a simple ABN system, with respect to other non-arguing approaches, in a particular task allocation scenario. In our experiments, we simulate a multiagent community and allow the agents to use a combination of ABN, evasion and re-planning techniques to overcome conflicts that arise within the community. Analysing the observed results, we show that, in our domain, ABN presents an effective means of resolving conflicts when the resources are constrained. However, we also show it is a more costly and less effective means, compared to evasion and re-planning methods, when resources are more abundant.

AB A multi-agent simulation (MAS) was developed to assess the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue in southern France, a non-endemic area where mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles (Culicidae) live. The contact rate between people and potential malaria vectors, or the human biting rate, is one of the key factor to predict the risk of re-emergence of malaria, would the parasite be introduced in the region. Our model (called MALCAM) represents the different agents that could influence malaria transmission in the Camargue people, mosquitoes, animal hosts and the landscape - in a spatially explicit environment. The model simulates spatial and temporal variations in human biting rate at the landscape scale. These variations depend on the distribution of people and potential vectors, their behaviour and their interactions. A land use/cover map was used as a cellular-spatial support for the movements of and interactions between mobile agents. The model was tested for its sensitivity to variations in parameter values, and for the agreement between field observations and model predictions. The MALCAM model provides a tool to better understand the interactions between the multiple agents of the disease transmission system, and the land use and land cover factors that control the spatial heterogeneity in these interactions. It allows testing hypotheses and scenarios related to disease dynamics by varying the value of exogenous biological, geographical, or human factors. This application of agent-based modelling to a human vector-borne disease can be adapted to different diseases and regions. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE conformity; group polarization; information interaction mode;

ID RECOMMENDATION; ALGORITHM
AB Currently, group behaviors happen frequently with the development of network technology. As a typical social group behavior, group polarization has been attracted more and more academic attention due to its significant disturbance to public's daily lives. At present, the classic J-A (proposed by Jager and Amblard) and D-W (proposed by Deffuant and Weisbuch) models are used to analyze group polarization process. However, the main shortcomings existing in these models are that the individuals' psychology and their network relationships are rarely considered. In order to overcome the limitations, this article integrates the influence factors such as conformity and network relationship strength integrated into the polarization model. Besides, the BA (proposed by Barabasi and Albert) network model is used as the agent adjacency model due to its closer to the real social network structure. Subsequently, the experimental simulations are carried out with the multi-agent Monte-Carlo method so as to testify the efficiency and effectiveness. The results indicate that different information interaction modes have essential influence on group attitude polarization. Moreover, conformity parameters and the intensity of relationship have dual impacts on both speeding up and slowing down the polarization process.

TI Modeling the emergence of multi-protein dynamic structures by principles

   software
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CELL
AB Background: There is an increasing need for computer-generated models that can be used for explaining the emergence and predicting the behavior of multi-protein dynamic structures in cells. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been proposed as good candidates to achieve this goal.
   Results: We have created 3DSpi, a multi-agent based software that we used to explore the generation of multi-protein dynamic structures. Being based on a very restricted set of parameters, it is perfectly suited for exploring the minimal set of rules needed to generate large multi-protein structures. It can therefore be used to test the hypothesis that such structures are formed and maintained by principles of self-organization. We observed that multi-protein structures emerge and that the system behavior is very robust, in terms of the number and size of the structures generated. Furthermore, the generated structures very closely mimic spatial organization of real life multi-protein structures.
   Conclusion: The behavior of 3DSpi confirms the considerable potential of MAS for modeling subcellular structures. It demonstrates that robust multi-protein structures can emerge using a restricted set of parameters and allows the exploration of the dynamics of such structures. A number of easy-to-implement modifications should make 3DSpi the virtual simulator of choice for scientists wishing to explore how topology interacts with time, to regulate the function of interacting proteins in living cells.

AB Language emergence and evolution have recently gained growing attention through multi-agent models and mathematical frameworks to study their behavior. Here we investigate further the Naming Game, a model able to account for the emergence of a shared vocabulary of form-meaning associations through social/cultural learning. Due to the simplicity of both the structure of the agents and their interaction rules, the dynamics of this model can be analyzed in great detail using numerical simulations and analytical arguments. This paper first reviews some existing results and then presents a new overall understanding.

AB The automatic training of agent-based simulators can be a complex task because of (a) their common nondeterministic behavior and (b) their complex relationships between their input parameters and the outputs. This work presents a technique called ATABS for automatically training agent-based simulators. This technique is based on a novel mechanism for generating random numbers that reduces the variability of the global results. This work provides a framework that automates this training by considering the relationships between the simulation parameters and the output features. This technique and framework have been applied to automatically train two different simulators. The current approach has been empirically compared with the most similar alternative. The results show that ATABS outperforms this alternative considering (1) the similarity between simulated and real data and (2) the execution time in the training process. The ATABS framework is publicly available. In this way, it ensures not only the reproducibility of the experiments, but also allows practitioners to apply the current approach to different agent-based simulators. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

DE Norms; Normative systems; Norm synthesis; Evolutionary algorithm
ID SOCIAL LAWS; EMERGENCE; CONVENTIONS; NORMS
AB Within the area of multi-agent systems, normative systems are a widely used framework for the coordination of interdependent activities. A crucial problem associated with normative systems is that of synthesising norms that will effectively accomplish a coordination task and that the agents will comply with. Many works in the literature focus on the on-line synthesis of a single, evolutionarily stable norm (convention) whose compliance forms a rational choice for the agents and that effectively coordinates them in one particular coordination situation that needs to be identified and modelled as a game in advance. In this work, we introduce a framework for the automatic off-line synthesis of evolutionarily stable normative systems that coordinate the agents in multiple interdependent coordination situations that cannot be easily identified in advance nor resolved separately. Our framework roots in evolutionary game theory. It considers multi-agent systems in which the potential conflict situations can be automatically enumerated by employing MAS simulations along with basic domain information. Our framework simulates an evolutionary process whereby successful norms prosper and spread within the agent population, while unsuccessful norms are discarded. The outputs of such a natural selection process are sets of codependent norms that, together, effectively coordinate the agents in multiple interdependent situations and are evolutionarily stable. We empirically show the effectiveness of our approach through empirical evaluation in a simulated traffic domain.

AB Computational modeling pervades virtually every industrial process. By using numerical representations of the behavior of elements that constitute a system it is possible to obtain efficient and safe designs. Moreover, system operation can be better defined by using such models, thus enabling greater reliability and control. In this paper the use of agents to solve the equations describing fast transients in water networks is investigated. As the simulation of hydraulic transients in pressurized systems is a naturally distributed problem, the authors argue that a multi-agent based system is very suitable for the solution of this complex engineering phenomenon. A hybrid solution is built by deploying agents to work with sets of equations describing hydraulic transient behavior in pipeline systems. The details necessary to assemble a complete and lubricated machine to model the complex phenomenon of hydraulic transients in pressurized systems are described. This research develops a platform that constitutes an efficient and versatile tool of great interest for water supply managers when analyzing water hammer effects in their networks.

In this paper, we investigate the evolutionary game dynamics (prisoner's dilemma game and snowdrift game) on a weighted social network consisted of rational agents and focus on the evolution of cooperation in the system. Simulation results show that the cooperation level is strongly affected by the weighted nature of the network. Moreover, the variation of time series has also been investigated. Our work may be helpful in understanding the cooperative behavior in the social systems.

TI REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR DECISION-MAKING IN A BUSINESS SIMULATOR

DT Article
DE Reinforcement learning; business simulator; multi-agent learning;

AB Business simulators are powerful tools for both supporting the decision-making process of business managers as well as for business education. An example is SIMBA (SIMulator for Business Administration), a powerful simulator which is currently used as a web-based platform for business education in different institutions. In this paper, we propose the application of reinforcement learning (RL) for the creation of intelligent agents that can manage virtual companies in SIMBA. This application is not trivial, given the particular intrinsic characteristics of SIMBA: it is a generalized domain where hundreds of parameters modify the domain behavior; it is a multi-agent domain where both cooperation and competition among different agents can coexist; it is required to set dozens of continuous decision variables for a given business decision, which is made only after the study of hundreds of continuous variables. We will demonstrate empirically that all these challenges can be overcome through the use of RL, showing results for different learning scenarios.

AB Event-triggered sampling control is motivated by the application of embedded microprocessors equipped in the agents with limited computation and storage resources. This paper studies the global consensus in second-order multi-agent systems with the inherent non-linear dynamics on general directed networks using decentralized event-triggered strategy. For each agent, only utilizing local and current sampling data, the update of controllers is event-based and only triggered at their own event times. A high-performance sampling event that only needs neighbors' states at their own discrete time instants is presented. Furthermore, we introduce two kinds of general algebraic connectivity for strongly connected networks and strongly connected components of directed networks containing a spanning tree to describe the system's ability to reach consensus. A detailed theoretical analysis on consensus is performed and two criteria are derived by the virtues of algebraic graph theory, matrix theory, and Lyapunov control approach. It is shown that the continuous communication between neighboring agents can be avoided and the Zeno-behavior of triggered time sequence is excluded during the system's whole working process. In addition, numerical simulation is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The main objective of this paper is to give an example of how expert systems techniques for distributed decision-making can be combined with contemporary numerical optimization techniques for the purposes of supply chain optimization and to describe the resulting software implementation. In this paper, multi-agent modelling techniques are applied to simulate and control a simple demand-driven supply chain network system, with the manufacturing component being optimized through mathematical programming. The system measures supply chain performance and the effect of different parameters in the replenishment control system, and can be used to simulate the behaviour of a system that uses optimization for part of its decision-making. The objective of this supply chain network system is to reduce operating cost, while maintaining a high level of customer order fulfilment.

AB This paper presents a machine-learning approach to the multi-robot coordination problem in an unknown dynamic environment. A multi-robot object transportation task is employed as the platform to assess and validate this approach. Specifically, a flexible two-layer multi-agent architecture is developed to implement multi-robot coordination. In this architecture, four software agents form a high-level coordination subsystem while two heterogeneous robots constitute the low-level control subsystem. Two types of machine learning-reinforcement learning (RL) and genetic algorithms (GAs)-are integrated to make decisions when the robots cooperatively transport an object to a goal location while avoiding obstacles. A probabilistic arbitrator is used to determine the winning output between the RL and GA algorithms. In particular, a modified RL algorithm called the sequential Q-learning algorithm is developed to deal with the issues of behavior conflict that arise in multi-robot cooperative transportation tasks. The learning-based high-level coordination subsystem sends commands to the low-level control subsystem, which is implemented with a hybrid force/position control scheme. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptivity of the developed approach. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Underwater sensors provide one of the possibilities to explore oceans, seas, rivers, fish farms and dams, which all together cover most of our planet's area. Simulators can be helpful to test and discover some possible strategies before implementing these in real underwater sensors. This speeds up the development of research theories so that these can be implemented later. In this context, the current work presents an agent-based simulator for defining and testing strategies for measuring the amount of fish by means of underwater sensors. The current approach is illustrated with the definition and assessment of two strategies for measuring fish. One of these two corresponds to a simple control mechanism, while the other is an experimental strategy and includes an implicit coordination mechanism. The experimental strategy showed a statistically significant improvement over the control one in the reduction of errors with a large Cohen's d effect size of 2.55.

AB The integration of intermittent renewable energy sources coupled with the increasing demand of electric vehicles (EVs) poses new challenges to the electrical grid. To address this, many solutions based on demand response have been presented. These solutions are typically tested only in software-based simulations. In this paper, we present the application in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) of a recently proposed algorithm for decentralised EV charging, prediction-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (P-MARL), to the problem of optimal EV residential charging under intermittent wind power and variable household baseload demands. P-MARL is an approach that can address EV charging objectives in a demand response aware manner, to avoid peak power usage while maximising the exploitation of renewable energy sources. We first train and test our algorithm in a residential neighbourhood scenario using GridLAB-D, a software power network simulator. Once agents learn optimal behaviour for EV charging while avoiding peak power demand in the software simulator, we port our solution to HIL while emulating the same scenario, in order to decrease the effects of agent learning on power networks. Experimental results carried out in a laboratory microgrid show that our approach makes full use of the available wind power, and smooths grid demand while charging EVs for their next day's trip, achieving a peak-to-average ration of 1.67, down from 2.24 in the baseline case. We also provide an analysis of the additional demand response effects observed in HIL, such as voltage drops and transients, which can impact the grid and are not observable in the GridLAB-D software simulation.

AB In this paper, the leader-following consensus problem of general linear multi-agent systems without direct access to real-time state is investigated. A novel observer-based event-triggered tracking consensus control scheme is proposed. In the control scheme, a distributed observer is designed to estimate the relative full states, which are used in tracking consensus protocol to achieve overall consensus. And an event-triggered mechanism with estimated state-dependent event condition is adopted to update the control signals so as to reduce unnecessary data communication. Based on the Lyapunov theorem and graph theory, the proposed event-triggered control scheme is proved to implement the tracking consensus when real-time state cannot direct obtain. Moreover, such scheme can exclude Zeno-behavior. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Although various methods have been adopted to reliably predict bus stop dwell time, little research has explored how the adopted measures influence the efficiency of passenger boarding from the perspective of personal micro-scale behavior. Using the multi-agent concept, this study provides a simulation model based on the social force paradigm that can be applied to extract the movement characteristics of boarding passengers and calculate bus stop dwell time. For each passenger, the model incorporates five different forces that drive individual agents' boarding and alighting. Three statistical indicators (Doorway Flow Rate, Doorway Crowdedness and Waiting Entropy) are proposed to analyze the impact of static measures in different simulation scenarios. The simulation results illustrate that measures for enlarging platform areas and installing guide guardrails can observably reduce the variation in bus dwell times, but not the length of the time itself. This is because the boarding order in these measures requires a certain amount of time per passenger. However, the application of these two measures could improve the psychological experience of passenger boarding. Therefore, we recommend that transit operators in Nanjing should fully consider the gains and losses based on the implementation of the measures to make the best decision.

ID REINFORCEMENT
AB Individual learning in an environment where more than one agent exist is a challenging task. In this paper, a single learning agent situated in an environment where multiple agents exist is modeled based on reinforcement learning. The environment is non-stationary and partially accessible from an agents' point of view. Therefore, learning activities of an agent is influenced by actions of other cooperative or competitive agents in the environment. A prey-hunter capture game that has the above characteristics is defined and experimented to simulate the learning process of individual agents. Experimental results show that there are no strict rules for reinforcement learning. We suggest two new methods to improve the performance of agents. These methods decrease the number of states while keeping as much state as necessary.

AB This paper is concerned with the consensus tracking problem for heterogeneous interdependent group systems with fixed communication topologies. First, the interdependent model of the heterogeneous system is built from the perspective of the difference of the individual characteristic and the difference of the subgroup topology structure. A class of distributed consensus tracking control protocol is proposed for realizing the consensus tracking of the heterogeneous interdependent group system via using local information. Then, for fixed communication topologies, some corresponding sufficient conditions are given to ensure the achievement of the consensus tracking. Two parameters are defined, which denote, respectively, the proportion of interdependence individual and the redundancy of interdependence. The effects of these parameters are analyzed on the consensus tracking of group systems. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.

TI DEPNET: How to benefit from social dependence
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, two different views of sociality, one based upon interferences, and the other based upon complementarity, or interdependence, are confronted. The latter is shown to present a number of theoretical advantages over the former, allowing for an account of different types of social actions-influencing, exchange, cooperation-and of how these emerge from structural social conditions. A formal model of dependence relations is presented, and an algorithm for calculating the dependence networks and situations in a multi-agent context is briefly shown. A simulator of dependence relations, which edits a set of agents (in terms of their goals, actions, and plans) and applies the algorithm to calculate their dependence relations relative to any given goal, is described, and its applications are discussed. Some elementary simulations are exemplified in order to illustrate the experimental application of the simulator in a two-agent context. Future expansions of the simulator are finally discussed.

Econ. 102 (1994) 975-1005], where a representative selection dynamics was proposed to explain experimental data. Assuming that the agents adjust their moves in the direction of the best response, we derive a formal analysis of the stability of the equilibria. We show by simulation that the interior equilibrium is robustly reached even when considerable heterogeneity is allowed among the agents. Our truly multi-agent game is capable of approximating quite well both the "median" game convergence and the experimental data. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses the finite-time and the prescribed finite-time event-triggered consensus tracking problems for second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) with uncertain disturbances. The prescribed finite-time event-triggered consensus of the second-order disturbed MASs was obtained for the first time and the controller is nonsingular. Furthermore, a new self-triggered control scheme is presented for the finite-time consensus tracking, and the continuous communication can be avoided in the triggering condition monitoring. Hence, the finite-time consensus tracking can be achieved with intermittent communication. Moreover, Zeno behavior is excluded for each follower. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms is verified by numerical simulations.

ID COMPANION; EMOTIONS; PAIN
AB For more than a century, empathy has been a central topic in the study of human emotion. It plays a crucial role in our everyday social life, having implications for the survival of the species. In the case of agents that inhabit virtual worlds and interact socially among each other and with humans, empathy has also been considered to be an important mechanism to promote engaging and believable interactions. However, creating empathic agents, until recently, has been accomplished mostly through the implementation of specific empathic behaviors or by using domain-dependent empirical models. In this article, we propose a generic computational model of empathy that is grounded on recent psychological theories about empathy. The proposed model treats empathy as a process in which the intensity of the empathic response is modulated by a set of factors that involve the relationship between the agents of the empathic interaction, namely, the similarity and affective link, as well as some characteristics of the empathizer agent, such as mood and personality. This model was implemented into an affective agent architecture, which was then used in an evaluation that had 77 participants. The results indicate that our empathy model, when used to simulate a social scenario with a small group of agents, significantly changed the way that the users perceived and described the interactions between those agents.

AB If local circumstances can generate local social trends, it follows that global circumstances can generate global trends. Furthermore, modern global circumstances match the conditions used to create artificial evolutionary systems. If it is possible for evolutionary forces to arise in global society, then it is possible that key forces shaping global society are evolutionary in nature. We can experimentally test for the possibility of evolutionary forces in global society by using a multi-agent simulation. This paper presents a simulation programmed to capture the evolutionary prerequisites observed in global society. Trends arising from this simulation are tested against three known trends and three assumed trends arising from global society. The results from this experiment support the hypothesis that a wealth aggregation evolutionary imperative is shaping key trends in global society.

Empirical data from a survey on individual investors' decision-making and social interaction was used to formalize the trading and interaction rules of the agents of the artificial stock market SimStockExchange. Multiple simulation runs were performed with this artificial stock market, which generated macro level results, like stock market prices and returns over time. These outcomes were subsequently compared to empirical macro level data from real stock markets. Partial qualitative as well as quantitative agreement between the simulated asset returns distributions and the asset returns distributions of the real stock markets was found.

AB Multi-agent simulation is applied to explore how different types of task variety cause workgroups to change their task allocation accordingly. We studied two groups, generalists and specialists. We hypothesised that the performance of the specialists would decrease when task variety increases. The generalists, on the other hand, would perform better in a high task variety condition. The results show that these hypotheses were only partly supported because both learning and motivational effects changed the task allocation process in a much more complex way. We conclude that although no task variety leads to specialisation and high task variety leads to generalisation, in general, performance is better when task variety is low. Further, in case of no task variety, specialists outperform generalists. In case of moderate variety the opposite is true. With high task variety, since there is no space for any expertise and motivational development, the behaviour of specialists and generalists becomes more similar, and, consequently also their performance.

AB The emergence of mutual knowledge is a major cognitive mechanism for the robustness of complex socio-technical systems. It has been extensively studied from an ethnomethodological point of view and empirically reproduced by multi-agent simulations. Whilst such simulations have been used to design real work settings the underlying theoretical grounding for the process is vague. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the emergence of mutual knowledge (MK) in a group of colocated individuals can be explained as a percolation phenomenon. The followed methodology consists in coupling agent-based simulation with dynamic networks analysis to study information propagation phenomena: After using an agent-based simulation the authors generated and then analyzed its traces as networks where agents met and exchanged knowledge. Deep analysis of the resulting networks clearly shows that the emergence of MK is comparable to a percolation process. The authors specifically focus on how changes at the microscopic level in the proposed agent based simulator affect percolation and robustness. These results therefore provide theoretical basis for the analysis of social organizations.

AB This paper addresses the distributed finite-time tracking problem for a group of mobile agents modeled by double-integrator dynamics under a leader with bounded unknown acceleration. First, a distributed finite-time tracking protocol is designed based on both the relative position and the relative velocity measurements. This protocol can drive the states of the followers to track the leader in finite time under the constraint that the leader's acceleration is bounded but unknown to the followers. Then, a novel position-based tracking protocol is designed,and analyzed for solving the distributed finite-time tracking problem when both velocity and acceleration measurements are not available for the followers. It is theoretically proved that the followers can move to be with the leader in finite time if the network topology is undirected among the followers but has a directed path from the leader to each follower. In particular, the position-based protocol does not require the relative input information between the agents. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB Agent-based model (ABM) simulation is a bottom-up approach that can describe the phenomena generated from actions and interactions within a multiagent system. An ABM is an improvement over model simulations which only describe the global behavior of a system. Therefore, it is an appropriate technology to analyze emergent phenomena in social sciences and complex adaptive systems such as vehicular traffic and pedestrian crowds. In this paper, a hybrid agent-based modeling framework designed to automate decision-making processes during traffic congestion is proposed. The model provides drivers with real-time alternative routes, computed via a decentralized multi-agent model, that tries to achieve a system-optimal traffic distribution within an entire system, thus reducing the total travel time of all the drivers. The presented work explores a decentralized ABM technique on an autonomous microgrid that is represented through cellular automata (CA). The proposed model was applied to high-density traffic congestion events such as car accidents or lane closures, and its effectiveness was analyzed. The experimental results confirm the efficiency of the proposed model in not only accurately simulating the driver behaviors and improving vehicular traffic flows during congestion but also by suggesting changes to traffic dynamics during the simulations, such as avoiding obstacles and high-density areas and then selecting the best alternative routes. The simulation results validate the ability of the proposed model and the included decision-making sub-models to both predict and improve the behaviors and intended actions of the agents.

AB We here describe a novel multi-agent model of the decentralized task selection process in honeybee colonies. The model is based on individual behavioural programs represented as hierarchical finite state automatons. We successfully simulated empirical experiments (with real honeybees) using the model. We shed more light on task specialization and polyethism in honeybees by modelling the heterogeneous environment that emerges over time inside the colony and by considering the changing differences in stimuli strength in each small area of the hive. Our simulation experiments presented here investigate the model's reaction to changing values in crucial model parameters and investigate the stability of the predicted colony behaviours.

AB A distributed encirclement points deployment scheme for a group of autonomous mobile agents is addressed in this paper. Herein, each agent can measure its own azimuth related to the common target and can at least communicate with its two adjacent neighbors. Given its space-cooperative character, the encirclement points deployment problem is formulated as the coverage control problem on a circle. The measurement range of azimuth sensor is taken into consideration when doing problem formulation, which is closer to the facts in real-world applications. Then, the fully distributed control protocols are put forward based on geometric principle and the convergence is proved strictly with algebraic method. The proposed control protocols can steer the mobile agents to distribute evenly on the circle such that the coverage cost function is minimized, and meanwhile the mobile agents' spatial order on the circle is preserved throughout the systems' evolution. A noteworthy feature of the proposed control protocols is that only the azimuths of a mobile agent and its two adjacent neighbors are needed to calculate the mobile agent's control input, so that the control protocols can be easily implemented in general. Moreover, an adjustable feedback gain is introduced, and it can be employed to improve the convergence rate effectively. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed distributed control protocols.

AB The typically large numbers of interactions in agent-based simulations come at considerable computational costs. In this article, we present an approach to reduce the number of interactions based on behavioural patterns that recur during runtime. We employ machine learning techniques to abstract the behaviour of groups of agents to cut down computational complexity while preserving the inherent flexibility of agent-based models. The learned abstractions, which subsume the underlying model agents' interactions, are constantly tested for their validity: after all, the dynamics of a system may change over time to such an extent that previously learned patterns would not reoccur. An invalid abstraction is, therefore, removed again from the system. The creation and removal of abstractions continues throughout the course of a simulation in order to ensure an adequate adaptation to the system dynamics. Experimental results on biological agent-based simulations show that our proposed approach can successfully reduce the computational complexity during the simulation while maintaining the freedom of arbitrary interactions.

AB Determining the best market pricing rule is a controversial issue in the design of electricity auction markets. Pay-as-bid (PAB) has been proposed to replace the market-clearing price (MCP) in deregulated electricity markets, with the expectation that it would lower market prices and reduce price volatility. A multi-agent based experiment was constructed to compare and analyze the balanced process of the two auction mechanisms. Each adaptive agent represents a generator who develops a bid price and quantity based on a reinforcement learning algorithm. In the simulation experiments, the experimental results are not as expected. Before the market reaches equilibrium, the market price with the PAB mechanism is lower than it is with the MCP mechanism. However, the market price in the PAB mechanism is higher than it is with the MCP when the market achieves a state of equilibrium. With the PAB mechanism, the volatility of volume and price of each generator is less than it is with the MCP system, as expected. The experimental results also show that unconscious collusion behaviors by generators during the game process are a key reason for producing generator market power in the two auction mechanisms.

AB Effects of agents' misreporting behaviour on system cooperation are studied in a multi-agent iterated prisoner's dilemma game. Agents, adopting combined trust strategy (denoted by CTS) are classified into three groups, i.e., honest CTS, positive-reporting CTS and negative-reporting CTS. The differences of cooperation frequency and pay-off under three different systems, i.e., system only with honest CTS, system with honest CTS and positive-reporting CTS and system with honest CTS and negative-reporting CTS, are compared. Furthermore, we also investigate the effects of misreporting behaviour on an exploiter who adopts an exploiting strategy (denoted by EXPL) in a system with two CTSs and one EXPL. At last, numerical simulations are performed for understanding the effects of misreporting behaviour on CTS. The results reveal that positive-reporting behaviour can strengthen system cooperation, while negative-reporting behaviour cannot. When EXPL exists in a system, positive-reporting behaviour helps the exploiter in reducing its exploiting cost and encourages agents to adopt exploiting strategy, but hurts other agents' interests.

AB This paper reports progress in the development of a multi-agent model which simulates pedestrian destination, route choice and scheduling behavior. In this model, the simulation of movement is embedded in a more comprehensive model of activity scheduling and choice behavior. We assume that pedestrians will be activated to visit a store if the store is suited to conduct any of the activities that are still scheduled, and that they are aware of this store. When pedestrians are aware of a store and the store is included in their consideration set, they will be activated and gradually move to a store. We assume that activation level is a stochastic variable. To estimate the activation function, survey data were collected. Visitors were interviewed about various aspects of their behavior such as familiarity with stores, motivation, and expectations about store aspects like assortment, sphere, quality and service. In this paper, we will discuss some of the findings of this data collection.

AB In this paper, under a fixed directed graph, the distributed cooperative synchronization of heterogeneous uncertain nonlinear chaotic delayed fractional-order multi-agent systems (FOMASs) with a leader of bounded unknown input is investigated, where the fractional orders and system parameters are uncertain and the controller gains are heterogeneous due to imperfect implementation. It should be noted that the study is more general by considering the FOMASs with time delays, unknown leader, heterogeneity, and unknown nonlinear dynamics. Firstly, a differential evolution-based parameter estimation method is proposed to identify the uncertain parameters. Then based on the identified parameters, by using the matrix theory, graph theory, fractional derivative inequality, and comparison principle of linear fractional equation with delay, a heterogeneous discontinuous controller is designed to achieve the distributed cooperative synchronization asymptotically. Thirdly, a heterogeneous continuous controller is further constructed to suppress the undesirable chattering behavior, where uniformly ultimately bounded synchronization tracking errors can be achieved and tuned as small as desired. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed parameter estimation scheme and the designed control algorithms.

We consider three cases: 1) DAT for single-integrator dynamics with a chain of integrators in algorithm design; 2) DAT with swarm behavior for single-integrator dynamics; and 3) DAT with swarm behavior for double-integrator dynamics. First, a continuous distributed algorithm with a chain of two integrators is proposed for single-integrator dynamics, where each agent needs its own and its neighbors' filter outputs obtained through communication besides its absolute position, local relative positions, reference signal, and reference velocity. The introduced algorithm can deal with a wide class of reference signals with steady deviations among reference velocities. Then, two swarm-based DAT algorithms for, respectively, single- and double-integrator dynamics are presented. In the first swarm-based algorithm for single-integrator dynamics, each agent needs to measure the relative positions between itself and its neighbors, while in the second swarm-based algorithm for double-integrator dynamics, relative velocity information is required too. In both cases, the information can be obtained through local sensing. If correct initialization constraints can be achieved, the center of the agents will track the average of the reference signals and the agents will maintain connectivity and avoid interagent collision. Numerical simulations are also presented to illustrate the theoretical results. Finally, the algorithms presented in this paper are experimentally implemented and validated on a multirobot platform.

AB The dynamic average consensus problem for a group of agents is considered. Each agent in the group is supposed to estimate the average of inputs applied to all agents and the estimation should be done in a distributed way. By reinterpreting the proportional integral type estimator, a new structure for the average estimator which can embed the internal model of inputs is proposed and conditions which result in the zero estimation error in the steady state are derived. We present constructive design procedures for the cases of constant inputs and time-varying inputs employing the root locus for the former and LQR-based design for the latter. The theory is validated through numerical simulations.

AB Achieving cooperation and coordination in a network of multi-agent systems is key to solving the consensus problem. Synchronization of such systems requires consistent communication between agents to reach a consensus, which is not feasible in the presence of delays, data loss, disturbances, and other unpredictable factors. Communication delays combined with environmental uncertainties can cause adverse effects and negatively change the behavior of the networked system preventing synchronization. In this paper, the stability of the delayed networked systems is analyzed using delay differential equations. Solving these equations has not been feasible, because of the infinite number of characteristic roots. The approach based on the Lambert W function has the capability of analytically solving delay differential equations. The approach is used to quantify and analyze the stability of the delayed networked systems. The communication between the agents is modeled using the graph theory and the Laplacian matrix. The stability is analyzed by incorporating the Laplacian matrix into the Lambert W function based approach which provides the locus of the eigenvalues of the system as delay changes. Sensitivities and convergence speed with respect to delay for various topologies of the network are presented for comparison. The numerical results and implementation using MATLAB/Simulink are presented for illustration.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe current practice in the game theory literature, to identify particular characteristics that ensure the literature is remote from anything we observe and to demonstrate an alternative drawn from agent based social simulation. The key issue is the process of social interaction among agents. A survey of game theoretic models found no models representing interaction among more than three agents, though sometimes more agents were involved in a round robin tournament. An ABSS model is reported in which there is a dense pattern of interaction among agents and outputs from the model are shown to have the same statistical signature as high-frequency data from competitive retail and financial markets. Moreover, the density of agent interaction is seen to be necessary both to obtain the validating statistical signature and for simulated market efficiency. As far as competitive markets are concerned, game theoretic models evidently assume away the source of the properties observed in real high frequency data and also the properties required for market efficiency.

AB This paper investigates the bipartite leader-following consensus of second-order multi-agent systems with signed digraph topology. To significantly reduce the communication burden, an event-triggered control algorithm is proposed to solve the bipartite leader-following consensus problem, where a novel event-triggered function is designed. Under some mild assumptions on the network topology and node dynamics, a sufficient condition is derived using Lyapunov stability method and matrix theory to guarantee the bipartite consensus. In particular, it is shown that the continuous communication can be avoided and the Zeno-behavior can be excluded for the designed event-triggered algorithm. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of the theoretical analysis. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a real-time algorithm to infer the intention of a user's avatar in a virtual environment shared with multiple human-like agents. Our algorithm applies the Bayesian Theory of Mind approach to make inferences about the avatar's hidden intentions based on the observed proxemics and gaze-based cues. Our approach accounts for the potential irrationality in human behavior, as well as the dynamic nature of an individual's intentions. The inferred intent is used to guide the response of the virtual agent and generate locomotion and gaze-based behaviors. Our overall approach allows the user to actively interact with tens of virtual agents from a first-person perspective in an immersive setting. We systematically evaluate our inference algorithm in controlled multi-agent simulation environments and highlight its ability to reliably and efficiently infer the hidden intent of a user's avatar even under noisy conditions. We quantitatively demonstrate the performance benefits of our approach in terms of reducing false inferences, as compared to a prior method. The results of our user evaluation show that 68.18% of participants reported feeling more comfortable in sharing the virtual environment with agents simulated with our algorithm as compared to a prior inference method, likely as a direct result of significantly fewer false inferences and more plausible responses from the virtual agents.

AB With advancements in mobile robot olfaction, networked multiagent systems (MASs) are used in odor source localization (OSL). These MASs are often equipped with small microprocessors that have limited computing capabilities, and they usually operate in a bandwidth and energy-constrained environment. The exigent need for a faster localizing algorithm under communication and computational resource constraints invites many design challenges. In this paper, we have designed a two-level hierarchical cooperative control strategy for heterogeneous nonlinear MASs for OSL. The agents are forced toward consensus expeditiously once the information on the whereabouts of the source is attained. The synthesis of the controller occurs in a hierarchical manner-obtaining a group decision, followed by resource-efficient robust control. Odor concentration and wind information have been used in a group decision-making layer to predict a probable location of the source as a tracking reference. This reference is then fed to the control layer that is synthesized using event-triggered sliding-mode control (SMC). The advantage of using event-triggered control scheduling in conjunction with the SMC is rooted in retaining the robustness of the SMC while lowering the resource utilization burden. Numerical simulations confirm the efficiency of the scheme put forth.

AB Recently, incorporating sustainability into the buyer-supplier sourcing decisions has achieved a considerable amount of attentions among researchers and industrial enterprises who are attempting to move towards sustainable production. Moreover, by investigating further in the buyer-supplier relationships, the literature suggests that proper communication and structured information exchange are important components in establishing a long-term partnership and maintaining such a relationship. Toward this end, a Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) approach is proposed as a mean of automating and facilitating the process of sustainable supplier selection and order allocation (SSS&OA) resulting in a more co-operative partnership. This research shows that financial performance of manufacturing companies adopting environmental and social sustainability in their operations strategy enhanced their competitive advantage that can lead to long-term sourcing relationships for the buyer-supplier dyad. Additionally, it was also shown that applying MASs to the SSS&OA problem can be utilized as an approach to facilitate communications and automate information exchange processes in Supply Chains (SCs) where suppliers and manufacturer are looking to maintain a long-term SC partnership. The applicability of the developed MAS approach and its incorporated sustainable supplier evaluation and order allocation models is demonstrated using an adopted practical scenario from an industrial case study operating in the electronics sector in medical device industry.

AB We suggest a model of a multi-agent society of decision makers taking decisions being based on two criteria, one is the utility of the prospects and the other is the attractiveness of the considered prospects. The model is the generalization of quantum decision theory, developed earlier for single decision makers realizing one-step decisions, in two principal aspects. First, several decision makers are considered simultaneously, who interact with each other through information exchange. Second, a multistep procedure is treated, when the agents exchange information many times. Several decision makers exchanging information and forming their judgment, using quantum rules, form a kind of a quantum information network, where collective decisions develop in time as a result of information exchange. In addition to characterizing collective decisions that arise in human societies, such networks can describe dynamical processes occurring in artificial quantum intelligence composed of several parts or in a cluster of quantum computers. The practical usage of the theory is illustrated on the dynamic disjunction effect for which three quantitative predictions are made: (i) the probabilistic behavior of decision makers at the initial stage of the process is described; (ii) the decrease of the difference between the initial prospect probabilities and the related utility factors is proved; (iii) the existence of a common consensus after multiple exchange of information is predicted. The predicted numerical values are in very good agreement with empirical data. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Context: A common distributed intelligent system architecture is Multi Agent Systems (MASs). Creating systems with this architecture has been recently supported by Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies. But two questions remain: how do we determine the suitability of a MAS implementation for a particular problem? And can this be determined without AOSE expertise?
   Objective: Given the relatively small number of software engineers that are AOSE experts, many problems that could be better solved with a MAS system are solved using more commonly known but not necessarily as suitable development approaches (e.g. object-oriented). The paper aims to empower software engineers, who are not necessarily AOSE experts, in deciding whether or not they should advocate the use of an MAS technology for a given project.
   Method: The paper will construct a systematic framework to identify key criteria in a problem requirement definition to assess the suitability of a MAS solution. The criteria are first identified using an iterative process. The features are initially identified from MAS implementations, and then validated against related work. This is followed by a statistical analysis of 25 problems that characterise agent-oriented solutions previously developed to group features into key criteria.
   Results: Key criteria were sufficiently prominent using factor analysis to construct a framework which provides a process that identifies within the requirements the criteria discovered. This framework is then evaluated for assessing suitability of a MAS architecture, by non-AOSE experts, on two real world problems: an electricity market simulation and a financial accounting system.
   Conclusion: Substituting a software engineer's personal inclination to (or not to) use a MAS, our framework provides an objective mechanism. It can supplant current practices where the decision to use a MAS architecture for a given problem remains an informal process. It was successfully illustrated on two real world problems to assess the suitability of a MAS implementation. This paper will potentially facilitate the take up of MAS technology.

ID BIG DATA
AB With the development of Internet, the amount of data increases exponentially. With the development of network technology, human beings have entered the era of big data. Therefore, it is very important to find valuable information from massive network data. At present, most of the network security products in the market record the system test results in the form of logs. Users can view and analyze the log information one by one to find out the suspicious behavior and carry out the next diagnosis. Finally, they can defend the identified attacks. Intrusion detection system usually stores detection results in the form of alert files. There may be a large number of redundant or false alarm information in the alarm file, so the heavy cognitive burden of users has become one of the disadvantages of traditional intrusion detection system. In consideration of the above situation, visualization technology has been introduced into the field of network security by researchers. The network visualization analysis displays the massive network data and log information in the way of graph and image, and uses the developed human vision to process the massive graphical data. Data visualization is a method of transforming abstract symbols into concrete geometric figures, which presents the results of simulation and calculation in the form of figures and images. In this paper, multi-agent model is used to build a network data visualization analysis model. The experimental results show that the method in this paper can effectively visualize a large number of network data, and the experimental results are easy to understand.

ID COOPERATIVE CONTROL
AB In this article, we study the formation problem for a group of mobile agents in a plane, in which the agents are required to maintain a distribution pattern, as well as to rotate around or remain static relative to a static/moving target. The prescribed distribution pattern is a class of general formations where the distances between neighboring agents or the distances between each agent and the target do not need to be equal. Each agent is modeled as a double integrator and can merely perceive the relative information of the target and its neighbors, and the acceleration of the target. In order to solve the formation problem, a limit-cycle-based controller design is delivered. We divide the overall control objective into two subobjectives, where the first is target circling that each agent keeps its own desired distance to the static/moving target as well as rotating around or remaining static relative to the target as expected, and the second is distribution adjustment that each agent maintains the desired distance to its neighbors. Then, we propose a controller comprised of two parts, where a limit cycle oscillator named a converging part is designed to deal with the first subobjective, while a layout part is introduced to address the second subobjective. One key merit of the controller is that it can be implemented by each agent in its local frame so that only local information is utilized without knowing global information. Theoretical analysis of the convergence to the desired formation, of which the agents are required to be evenly distributed on a circle around the target, is provided for the multiagent system under the proposed controller. Numerical simulations are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for the cases of general formations, and to show that no collision between agents ever takes place throughout the system's evolution.

AB This paper proposes a new framework of fare optimization & game model for studying the competition between two travel modes (high speed railway and civil aviation) in which passengers' group behavior is taken into consideration. The small-world network is introduced to construct the multi-agent model of passengers' travel mode choice. The cumulative prospect theory is adopted to depict passengers' bounded rationality, the heterogeneity of passengers' reference point is depicted using the idea of group emotion computing. The conceptions of "Langton parameter" and "evolution entropy" in the theory of "edge of chaos" are introduced to create passengers' "decision coefficient" and "evolution entropy of travel mode choice" which are used to quantify passengers' group behavior, The numerical simulation and the analysis of passengers' behavior show that (1) the new model inherits the features of traditional model well and the idea of self-organizing traffic flow evolution fully embodies passengers' bounded rationality, (2) compared with the traditional model (logit model), when passengers are in the "edge of chaos" state, the total profit of the transportation system is higher.

AB This review deals with several microscopic ('agent-based') models of financial markets which have been studied by economists and physicists over the last decade: Kim-Markowitz, Levy-Levy-Solomon, Cont-Bouchaud, Solomon-Weisbuch, Lux-Marchesi, Donangelo Sneppen and Solomon-Levy-Huang. After an overview of simulation approaches in financial economics, we first give a summary of the Donangelo-Sneppen model of monetary exchange and compare it with related models in economics literature. Our selective review then outlines the main ingredients of some influential early models of multi-agent dynamics in financial markets (Kim-Markowitz, Levy-Levy-Solomon). As will be seen, these contributions draw their inspiration from the complex appearance of investors' interactions in real-life markets. Their main aim is to reproduce ( and, thereby, provide possible explanations) for the spectacular bubbles and crashes seen in certain historical episodes, but they lack (like almost all the work before 1998 or so) a perspective in terms of the universal statistical features of financial time series. In fact, awareness of a set of such regularities (power-law tails of the distribution of returns, temporal scaling of volatility) only gradually appeared over the nineties. With the more precise description of the formerly relatively vague characteristics (e. g. moving from the notion of fat tails to the more concrete one of a power law with index around three), it became clear that financial market dynamics give rise to some kind of universal scaling law. Showing similarities with scaling laws for other systems with many interacting sub-units, an exploration of financial markets as multi-agent systems appeared to be a natural consequence. This topic has been pursued by quite a number of contributions appearing in both the physics and economics literature since the late nineties. From the wealth of different flavours of multi-agent models that have appeared up to now, we discuss the Cont-Bouchaud, Solomon-Levy-Huang and Lux-Marchesi models. Open research questions are discussed in our concluding section.

AB This paper presents experimental results of our model-driven approach to agent based simulation. According to this, the development process for agent based simulation should focus on modeling rather than implementation (i.e., programming on some concrete agent simulation platform). This requires the use of transformation tools from simulation models to implementation code. Describing social phenomena with a visual, high-level modeling language and implementing the simulation in this way should facilitate the use of toolkits by experts in social sciences without a deep knowledge of programming concerns. This simulation approach is supported here by the INGENIAS Development Kit (IDK), which provides a model editor for multi-agent systems, and code generation support. To validate the transformation mechanism, we have modeled a concrete social system with the INGENIAS agent-oriented modeling language, and generated two independent implementations for two different platforms (Repast and Mason simulation toolkits). This experimentation shows the feasibility of the model driven implementation approach and has enabled the study of facilities provided by simulation toolkits that can have impact on the transformation process, in particular, the scheduling techniques. Also, comparing the simulation results of the case study with the original work and between implementations has led us to discover biases introduced by simulation mechanisms that can be found in most simulation platforms.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS; CONSENSUS; NETWORKS
AB The objective of containment control in multi-agent systems is to design control algorithms for the followers to converge to the convex hull spanned by the leaders. Sampled-data based containment control algorithms are suitable for the cases where the power supply and sensing capacity are limited, due to their low-cost and energy-saving features resulting from discrete sensing and interactions. In addition, sampled-data control has advantages in performance, price and generality. On the other hand, when the agents have double-integrator dynamics and the leaders are dynamic with nonzero inputs, the existing algorithms are not directly applicable in a sampled-data setting. To this end, this paper proposes a sampled-data based containment control algorithm for a group of double-integrator agents with dynamic leaders with nonzero inputs under directed communication networks. By applying the proposed control algorithm, the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the dynamic leaders with bounded position and velocity containment control errors, and the ultimate bound of the overall containment error is proportional to the sampling period. A numerical simulation is presented to illustrate the proposed algorithm. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Voluntary sustainability standards, aimed at improving the environmental, social and economic aspects of agricultural production and trade, are becoming increasingly common. The coffee sector is a prime example, where sustainability certification could improve livelihoods for poor smallholders. However, as individual production volumes are low, smallholder farmers need to cooperate in certification as a group, which makes impact assessment more complicated. Previous empirical studies, reporting premia of up to 30%, have neglected the costs associated with group certification. We explore the issue using an agent-based simulation of coffee producer organisations in Uganda, including the certification-related costs for farmers. Our results suggest that certification can have a small positive impact on participating households. But the added value of certification is substantially lower than the price premium, because of certification costs. Increasing both the membership of the producer groups and their deliveries of certified coffee are necessary to improve the rewards of certification.

AB Stagnation of the negotiation-based cloud market refers to a condition of having negligible or no successful (good) deals. Cloud market stagnation should be reduced as it has a detrimental effect on the market outcomes. One of the effective steps towards overcoming market stagnation is by focusing on temporary replacing the pricing mechanism with the more effective ones. To do this, we propose a new agent-based hybrid marketplace in which the elements of the negotiation market are combined with the elements of auction as another well-known market-driven pricing mechanism. That is, negotiation market is considered as the main basis of the proposed hybrid market where each resource provider can make decisions about holding ad-hoc auction(s) when experiencing high market pressure to exit the market stagnation and create dynamism in the market. Thus, in this paper, issues and challenges related to when and how an auction should be held are answered. Extensive amounts of simulation were carried out to evaluate the performance of dealer agents who deal in the proposed hybrid market in comparison with MBDNAs known as (Market-and-Behavior-Driven Negotiation Agents) in terms of average utility, success rate, and the time needed to reach an agreement. The results show that our designed dealer agents outperform MBDNAs.

AB This paper proposes a consensus secure control scheme in the presence of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks based on an event-trigger mechanism. In contrast to a scenario in which attacks are the same and simultaneously paralyze all channels, the DoS attack addressed in this paper occurs aperiodically and results in the independent interruption of multiple transmission channels. A sufficient condition for the attack duration is designed and a distributed event-triggered control scheme is proposed, where the updated instants are triggered aperiodically to reduce the required communication resources. It is shown that the overall system is stable with the proposed scheme according to the Lyapunov stability theory and that Zeno behavior is excluded. Finally, a numerical example is presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB This article proposes a multi-agent approach to modelling the genesis of alluvial sediments. The aim is to generate a set of sedimentary structures such as channels, point-bars and oxbow lakes by means of sedimentary process simulations. These structures will later be used to study groundwater flow. The major deposition-erosion processes are represented in an approximate and stochastic manner. The behaviour of sedimentary entities is defined by empirical rules derived from the local geometry of the flume. The emphasis of this paper is on the capacity of the model to reproduce stream evolution. The model was tested on the West Fork white River (Indiana), and shows the main tl end in the evolution of a meandering system despite the simplicity of imposed rules. Expected future developments of this approach are outlined. ((C) Academie des Sciences/Elsevier, Paris.).

AB Social animals commonly form aggregates that exhibit emergent collective behaviour, with group dynamics that are distinct from the behaviour of individuals. Simple models can qualitatively reproduce such behaviour, but only with large numbers of individuals. But how rapidly do the collective properties of animal aggregations in nature emerge with group size? Here, we study swarms of Chironomus riparius midges and measure how their statistical properties change as a function of the number of participating individuals. Once the swarms contain order 10 individuals, we find that all statistics saturate and the swarms enter an asymptotic regime. The influence of environmental cues on the swarm morphology decays on a similar scale. Our results provide a strong constraint on how rapidly swarm models must produce collective states. But our findings support the feasibility of using swarms as a design template for multi-agent systems, because self-organized states are possible even with few agents.

AB Observations of primate groups have shown that social learning can lead to the development of temporal stable traditions or even proto-culture. The social structure of primate groups is highly diverse and it has been proposed that differences in the group structure shall influence the patterns of social information transmission. While empirical studies have mainly focused on the psychological mechanisms of social learning in individuals, the phenomenon of information propagation within the group has received relatively little attention. This might be due to the fact that formal theories that allow actual testing have not been formulated, or were kept too simple, ignoring the social dynamics of multi-agent societies. We want to propose a network approach to social information transmission that (1) preserves the complexity of the social structure of primate groups and (2) allows direct application to empirical data. Results from simulation experiments with artificial group structures confirm that association patterns of group-members influence the expected speed of information transmission during the propagation process. Introducing a forgetting rate shows that under certain conditions the proportion of informed individuals will reach a stable rate in some systems while it will drop to zero in others. This suggests that the likelihood to observe temporal stable traditions shall differ between social systems with different structure. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a group consensus problem is investigated for the heterogeneous agents that are governed by the Euler-Lagrange system and the double-integrator system, respectively, and the parameters of the Euler-Lagrange system are uncertain. To achieve group consensus, a novel group consensus protocol and a time-varying estimator of the uncertain parameters are proposed. By combining algebraic graph theory with the Barbalat lemma, several effective sufficient conditions are obtained. It is found that the time-delay group consensus can be achieved provided that the inner coupling matrices are equal in the different sub-networks. Besides, the switching topologies between homogeneous agents are also considered, with the help of the Barbalat-like lemma, and some relevant results are also obtained. Finally, these theoretical results are demonstrated by the numerical simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years the concept of emergence has gained much attention as ICT systems have started exhibiting properties usually associated with complex systems. Although emergence creates many problems for engineering complex ICT systems by introducing undesired behaviour, it also offers many possibilities for advance in the area of adaptive self-organizing systems. However, at the moment the inability to predict and control emergent phenomena prevents us from exploring its full potential or avoiding problems in existing complex systems. Towards this end, this paper proposes a framework for empirical study of complex systems exhibiting emergence. The framework relies on agent-oriented modelling and simulation as a tool for examination of specific manifestations of emergence. The main idea is to use ail iterative simulation process in order to build a coarse taxonomy of causal relationships between the micro- and macro layers. In addition to the detailed description of the framework, the paper also discusses the corresponding verification and validation processes as important factor for the success of such a study.

AB Sociograms can represent the social relations between students. Some kinds of sociograms are more suitable than others for achieving a high academic performance of students. However, for now, at the beginning of an educative period, it is not possible to know for sure how the sociogram of a group of students will be or evolve during a semester or an academic year. In this context, the current approach presents an Agent-Based Simulator (ABS) that predicts the sociogram of a group of students taking into consideration their psychological profiles, by evolving an initial sociogram through time. This simulator is referred to as ABS-SOCI (ABS for SOCIograms). For instance, this can be useful for organizing class groups for some subjects of engineering grades, anticipating additional learning assistance or testing some teaching strategies. As experimentation, ABS-SOCI has been executed 100 times for each one of four real scenarios. The results show that ABS-SOCI produces sociograms similar to the real ones considering certain sociometrics. This similarity has been corroborated by statistical binomial tests that check whether there are significant differences between the simulations and the real cases. This experimentation also includes cross-validation and an analysis of sensitivity. ABS-SOCI is free and open-source to (1) ensure the reproducibility of the experiments; (2) to allow practitioners to run simulations; and (3) to allow developers to adapt the simulator for different environments.

AB The paper considers the detection of multiple targets by a group of mobile robots that perform under uncertainty. The agents are equipped with sensors with positive and non-negligible probabilities of detecting the targets at different distances. The goal is to define the trajectories of the agents that can lead to the detection of the targets in minimal time. The suggested solution follows the classical Koopman's approach applied to an occupancy grid, while the decision-making and control schemes are conducted based on information-theoretic criteria. Sensor fusion in each agent and over the agents is implemented using a general Bayesian scheme. The presented procedures follow the expected information gain approach utilizing the "center of view" and the "center of gravity" algorithms. These methods are compared with a simulated learning method. The activity of the procedures is analyzed using numerical simulations.

AB This paper presents the novel theory for performing multi-agent activity recognition without requiring large training corpora. The reduced need for data means that robust probabilistic recognition can be performed within domains where annotated datasets are traditionally unavailable. Complex human activities are composed from sequences of underlying primitive activities. We do not assume that the exact temporal ordering of primitives is necessary, so can represent complex activity using an unordered bag. Our three-tier architecture comprises low-level video tracking, event analysis and high-level inference. High-level inference is performed using a new, cascading extension of the Rao-Blackwellised Particle Filter. Simulated annealing is used to identify pairs of agents involved in multi-agent activity. We validate our framework using the benchmarked PETS 2006 video surveillance dataset and our own sequences, and achieve a mean recognition F-Score of 0.82. Our approach achieves a mean improvement of 17% over a Hidden Markov Model baseline. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB UAV swarm is a typical application of multi-agent system and consists of a certain number of single- or multi-function UAVs. This paper mainly focuses on the motion consensus and formation control of UAV swarm. A novel formation control algorithm suitable for both leaders and followers is designed, in which leaders are implicitly integrated into the swarm and can be influenced by navigational feedback from their flockmates. Theoretical analysis shows that the system is asymptotically stable and can converge to the desired formation without collision among vehicles. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the theoretical results and verify the velocity and trajectory tracking abilities of the algorithm. Results reveal that the proposed algorithm guarantees a swarm of UAVs to fly with predefined formation and track scheduled trajectory. Furthermore, the novel algorithm can reduce the communication consumption and enhance the adaptability and scalability of the system. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we have proposed a realization of the mobiligence by constructing a pursuit game. The pursuit game has been used as a benchmark problem of a multi-agent system by many researchers. A "purpose-oriented Q-nets" is used for constructing the intelligence for mobile agents in this study. In the Q-nets, one evaluation function is to capture the prey and the other is to evaluate how the agents go back to the nest to charge energy. This configuration is designed to realize the self sufficiency of the hunter agents. The numerical experiments using Khepera Simulator well verifies that our proposed system shows some emergent behaviors of "mobiligence".

AB In all existed researches on flocking control for multi-agent systems, each agent is modelled as a single point or covered by an circle, ellipse or rectangle; however, in case of limited space traffic systems, many complex vehicles cannot be fitted in these agent shapes. This paper proposes a distributed control law for two-dimensional multiple agents considered as arbitrarily polygonal shapes under limited communication ranges. The proposed control laws guarantee all flocking properties: each agent stays close to its nearby neighbours, no collision occurs in group of agents and velocity of each agent converges to a common vector. The designed control law based on a new anti-collision condition and potential function approach aims at dealing with the issue of collisions between agents. Further, the control signals are bounded and differentiable despite of agent's limited communication ranges and non-smooth boundary in agent shapes. Numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate the performance of proposed control law for multiple agents with the same and different shapes.

ID STOCHASTIC-MODEL; DEFINITION
AB It is our belief that modelling the behaviour of stem cells in the adult human body as an agent-based system is the most appropriate way of understanding the process of self-organisation. We have undertaken several case studies where formal and/or computational models of stem cell systems, have been re-developed using an agent-based approach. This paper presents details of one of these case studies where we have used an agent-based approach as opposed to a cellular automata approach. A formalisation of the non-agent and agent-based approach is given, and from the results of this investigation, we aim to demonstrate the advantages of the agent-based approach for developing biologically plausible models with emergent self-organising dynamics. The aim of this paper first to discuss the importance of modelling and simulating stem cells, because of certain experimental limitations, but also to demonstrate that the multi-agent approach to modelling is the most appropriate.

AB Protocols govern the interactions between agents, both in the information society and in the society at large. Protocols based on mutually beneficial cooperation are especially interesting because they improve the societal welfare and no central authority is needed to enforce them (which eliminates a single point of failure and possible bottlenecks). In order to guide the design of such protocols, we introduce co-utility as a framework for cooperation between rational agents such that the best strategy for each agent is to help another agent achieve her best outcome. Specifically, in this work we study and characterize self-enforcing protocols in game-theoretic terms. Then, we use this characterization to develop the concept of co-utile protocol and study under which circumstances co-utility arises. Furthermore, we give a detailed study of co-utile protocol design in the case of anonymous query submission to a web search engine. The theoretical analysis is complemented with empirical results obtained from an implementation in a simulated multi-agent environment, which illustrates how co-utility can make cooperation self-enforcing and improve the agents' welfare.

AB How to understand and control the individual choices and cooperative conflicts in multiagent systems is a cross-over study which edges into multiple disciplines. An interdisciplinary mathematical tool to theoretically study the issue of cooperative dilemma is evolutionary game theory. The assumption of graphs that maps social interactions provides a useful approach for studying the dynamics in gaming systems, where its theoretical analysis is drop behind simulations. Here we perform analysis on game dynamics in a spatially distributed system situating on multiple-community networks. In the context of the three paradigmatic game prototypes (dominating games, coexistence games, and the coordination games), the stability of the equilibrium state emerging from this is provided. Further investigation on multicommunity system reveals that the community structure plays a key role in the stability of the strategy evolution. Besides, our explorations toward the multiple strategies adopted by the population whose interactions include n communities, certify that the payoff is crucial for individuals' dominating superiority over others in the system. The results are expected to provide effective perspective to control the individual choice in large systems, and lend itself to multiple applications in control engineering perspective.

AB Conurbations around the globe are encountering the challenges of traffic congestion. Miscellaneous smart systems have been developed to help control and improve traffic flow in a cost-effective and measurable way. Yet, the existing systems solve the traffic congestion problem with cost-intensive traffic lights and mostly handle emergency cases poorly. In this article, to minimize the traffic congestion problems for any kind of vehicles without using traffic lights, we propose three deadlock-free algorithms namely: (i) Mutual exclusion algorithm based on single instruction (MEASIR), (ii) Mutual exclusion algorithm based on priority (MEAPRI), and (iii) Mutual exclusion algorithm based on multi-agent systems (MEAMAS). Communication inside a group is accomplished via a queue structure, while an external element (e.g., a router) is used for internal communications. Besides the depiction of experimental and simulation results, a complete statistical analysis has been performed to compare the performance of MEASIR, MEAPRI, and MEAMAS with their alternatives. Our proposed deadlock-free algorithms are not only efficient but also functional with a computational cost of O(n) to enter the critical section, where n represents the number of all vehicles in a particular intersection.

AB The paper presents an adaptive iterative distributed scheduling algorithm that operates in a market-based production control system. The manufacturing system is agentified, thus, every machine and job is associated with its own software agent. Each agent learns how to select presumably good schedules, by this way the size of the search space can be reduced. In order to get adaptive behavior and search space reduction, a triple-level learning mechanism is proposed. The top level of learning incorporates a simulated annealing algorithm, the middle (and the most important) level contains a reinforcement learning system, while the bottom level is done by a numerical function approximator, such as an artificial neural network. The paper suggests a cooperation technique for the agents, as well. It also analyzes the time and space complexity of the solution and presents some experimental results. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a distributed approach to belief revision is presented. It is conceived as a collective activity of a group of interacting agents, in which each component contributes with its own local beliefs. The integration of the different opinions is performed not by an external supervisor, but by the entire group through an election mechanism. Each agent exchanges information with the other components and uses a local belief revision mechanism to maintain its cognitive state consistent. We propose a model for local belief revision/integration based on what we called: "Principle of Recoverability." Computationally, our way to belief revision consists of three steps acting on the symbolic part of the information, so as to deal with consistency and derivation, and two other steps working with the numerical weight of the information, so as to deal with uncertainty. In order to evaluate and compare the characteristics and performance of the centralized and of the distributed approaches, we made five different experiments simulating a simple society in which each agent is characterized by a degree of competence, communicates with some others, and revise its cognitive state. The results of these experiments are presented in the paper.

TI Multi-agent methodology for distributed and cooperative supervisory

SO IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID FAULT-DETECTION; DESIGN
AB In this work, a novel multi-agent framework for cooperative supervisory estimation of linear time-invariant systems is proposed. This framework is developed based on the notion of subobservers and a discrete-event system (DES) supervisory control and is applicable to large-scale systems. We introduce a group of subobservers where each subobserver is estimating certain states that are conditioned on a given input, output and state information. The cooperation among the subobservers is managed by a DES supervisor. The supervisor makes decisions regarding the selection and configuration of a set of subobservers to successfully estimate all the system states, while the feasibility of the overall integrated cooperative subobservers is verified. When certain anomalies (faults) are present in the system, or the sensors and subobservers become unreliable, the supervisor reconfigures the set of selected subobservers so that the impacts of anomalies on the estimation performance are minimised to the extent that is possible. The application and capabilities of our proposed methodology in a practical industrial process is demonstrated through numerical simulations.

AB Increasing globalization has had a major impact on manufacturing and service industries as well as on coalition operations conducted by the military. What is common to both the commercial and military sectors is the recent surge in interest in cross-cultural decision making (CCDM) training. Existing CCDM training approaches tend to employ either some form of multi-agent simulation or some variant of classical game theory. Despite their manifest benefits, these approaches have specific limitations that need to be overcome to create an effective cross-cultural training system. Multi-agent simulations typically lack theoretical underpinnings while classical game theory-based approaches take a limited view of strategic decision making. Specifically, by adopting a Western view of rationality, game-theoretic approaches fail to accommodate considerations such as fairness, altruism and reciprocity. Empirical research in strategic economic games has shown that humans respond to more than merely monetary incentives. In particular, research has shown that cultural norms play a central role in human decision making behavior, especially in non-Western cultures. This paper presents an innovative approach to game-based simulation that combines findings from behavioral game theory with classical game theory and multi-agent simulation to exploit the strengths of each approach while making learning enjoyable, memorable, and fun. An illustrative game-based simulation for CCDM training is also presented. The simulation framework is equally applicable to teaching other soft skills as well as skills that are too hazardous or too expensive to teach in the realworld through live exercises.

AB The loss of situational awareness by pilots is one of the harshest risk factors leading to catastrophic accidents. In this paper a situational awareness analysis model based on multiple agents is presented to simulate the human-computer interaction process in the aircraft cockpit. From the perspective of human-in-loop, the integrated model consists of modularized pilot agent model, technical system agent model and environment agent model. Following the structured levels of situational awareness, the pilot's cognitive behaviors are modelled based on Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) theory and Bayesian network, with the triggering inputs from the visual and auditory sensory channels. Considering the effects of overlapping information from different channels, the formation and evolution mechanism of the pilot's situational awareness is analyzed in a probabilistic inference manner. The tests of input-output characteristics prove that the model can well reflect the distribution and resist the uncertain fluctuation of different cognitive elements. The safety issues based on two simplified real risk scenarios, under the background of the incidents/accidents related with Boeing 737-8 (MAX), were analyzed. The mechanism of accident evolution along with the possible preventive measures were discussed. It is concluded that an early control priority transmission from the technical system to the pilots and the display of direct prompt messages could make a difference in avoiding the serious risk.

ID PUBLIC-OPINION; ATTITUDE; NODES
AB Influence diffusion modelling, analysis and applications in the preference-aware context draw tremendous attention to both researchers and practitioners. Most contemporary studies typically model the influence-diffusion pheromone from a centralized perspective. In this paper, we model the bi-directional influence propagation in directed weighted networks in a distributed manner with the consideration of user preference by facilitating Agent-Based Modelling. In the proposed model, each individual's personalized features and the social context are modelled based on the underlying social theories, i.e. social influence and the homophily effect. In addition, the model is capable of not only producing a certain range of dynamical behaviours based on different parameter constellation but also analyzing the evolutionary trends of a social network and capturing the dynamics in the environment. Another attractive feature is the training capability of agents, which enables them to adapt the personalized features. Comparing with traditional approaches, the proposed model is more suitable for handling the complex nature of influence diffusion, and demonstrates the advantages in simulating the real-world influence diffusion. Furthermore, we propose a novel seeding algorithm for influence maximization, named Enhanced Evolution-Based Backward selection. The algorithm utilizes the advantages offered by the proposed agent-based model. The experimental results reveal that the algorithm is superior to those state-of-the-art algorithms for influence maximization.

AB In this study, based on behavioral and neurophysiological facts, a new hierarchical multi-agent architecture is proposed to model the human motor control system. Performance of the proposed structure is investigated by simulating the control of sit to stand movement. To develop the model, concepts of mixture of experts, modular structure, and some aspects of equilibrium point hypothesis were brought together. We have called this architecture MODularized Experts Model (MODEM). Human motor system is modeled at the joint torque level and the role of the muscles has been embedded in the function of the joint compliance characteristics. The input to the motor system, i.e., the central command, is the reciprocal command. At the lower level, there are several experts to generate the central command to control the task according to the details of the movement. The number of experts depends on the task to be performed. At the higher level, a "gate selector" block selects the suitable subordinate expert considering the context of the task. Each expert consists of a main controller and a predictor as well as several auxiliary modules. The main controller of an expert learns to control the performance of a given task by generating appropriate central commands under given conditions and/or constraints. The auxiliary modules of this expert learn to scrutinize the generated central command by the main controller. Auxiliary modules increase their intervention to correct the central command if the movement error is increased due to an external disturbance. Each auxiliary module acts autonomously and can be interpreted as an agent. Each agent is responsible for one joint and, therefore, the number of the agents of each expert is equal to the number of joints. Our results indicate that this architecture is robust against external disturbances, signal-dependent noise in sensory information, and changes in the environment. We also discuss the neurophysiological and behavioral basis of the proposed model (MODEM).

AB In this paper, the leader-follower Cucker-Smale flocking system with bounded missing data and random communication radius is studied. The communication network is determined by the stochastic distance radii between agents. The process by which data are lost in the communication network is independent and identically distributed. The goal of this paper is to determine a lower bound on the probability that the agents asymptotically achieve a flocking behaviour, i.e. the relative velocities between the leader agent and other agents asymptotically vanish and the relative positions converge. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to illustrate the obtained results.

AB Aims: Biological incidents jeopardising public health require decision-making that consists of one dominant feature: complexity. Therefore, public health decision-makers necessitate appropriate support.
   Methods: Based on the analogy with business intelligence (BI) principles, the contextual analysis of the environment and available data resources, and conceptual modelling within systems and knowledge engineering, this paper proposes a general framework for computer-based decision support in the case of a biological incident. At the outset, the analysis of potential inputs to the framework is conducted and several resources such as demographic information, strategic documents, environmental characteristics, agent descriptors and surveillance systems are considered.
   Results: Consequently, three prototypes were developed, tested and evaluated by a group of experts. Their selection was based on the overall framework scheme. Subsequently, an ontology prototype linked with an inference engine, multi-agent-based model focusing on the simulation of an environment, and expert-system prototypes were created.
   Conclusions: All prototypes proved to be utilisable support tools for decision-making in the field of public health. Nevertheless, the research revealed further issues and challenges that might be investigated by both public health focused researchers and practitioners.

AB The process of designing integrated biological systems across scales is difficult, with challenges arising from the modeling, understanding, and search of complex system design spaces. This paper explores these challenges through consideration of how stochastic nanoscale phenomenon relate to higher level systems functioning across many scales. A domain-independent methodology is introduced which uses multi-agent simulations to predict emergent system behavior and structure-behavior-function (SBF) representations to facilitate design space navigation. The methodology is validated through a nanoscale design application of synthetic myosin motor systems. In the multi-agent simulation, myosins are independent computational agents with varied structural inputs that enable differently tuned mechanochemical behaviors. Four synthetic myosins were designed and replicated as agent populations, and their simulated behavior was consistent with empirical studies of individual myosins and the macroscopic performance of myosin-powered muscle contractions. However, in order to configure high performance technologies, designers must effectively reason about simulation inputs and outputs; we find that counter-intuitive relations arise when linking system performance to individual myosin structures. For instance, one myosin population had a lower system force even though more myosins contributed to system-level force. This relationship is elucidated with SBF by considering the distribution of structural states and behaviors in agent populations. For the lower system force population, it is found that although more myosins are producing force, a greater percentage of the population produces negative force. The success of employing SBF for understanding system interactions demonstrates how the methodology may aid designers in complex systems embodiment. The methodology's domain-independence promotes its extendibility to similar complex systems, and in the myosin test case the approach enabled the reduction of a complex physical phenomenon to a design space consisting of only a few critical parameters. The methodology is particularly suited for complex systems with many parts operating stochastically across scales, and should prove invaluable for engineers facing the challenges of biological nanoscale design, where designs with unique properties require novel approaches or useful configurations in nature await discovery.

Our model consists of abstracting institutional characteristics of actual Local Master Plan procedures in France. A multi-agent simulator, is developed to investigate new models of land use and land cover changes and to validate/invalidate economic assumptions. Land-uses are implemented through a cellular automaton embedded within utilitarian agents whose preferences are included through environmental quality perception. A new statistic-based computational method, the spectral analysis method, allows generating and summarizing many agent interactions, actions and behaviors. The whole system is considered as a virtual laboratory.

AB Cooperation between autonomous robot vehicles holds several promising advantages like robustness, adaptability, configurability, and scalability. Coordination between the different robots and the individual relative motion represent both the main challenges especially when dealing with formation control and maintenance. Cluster space control provides a simple concept for controlling multi-agent formation. In the classical approach, formation control is the unique task for the multi-agent system. In this paper, the development and application of a novel Behavioral Adaptive Fuzzy-based Cluster Space Control (BAFC) to non-holonomic robots is presented. By applying a fuzzy priority control approach, BAFC deals with two conflicting tasks: formation maintenance and target following. Using priority rules, the fuzzy approach is used to adapt the controller and therefore the behavior of the system, taking into accounts the errors in the formation states and the target following states. The control approach is easy to implement and has been implemented in this paper using SIMULINK real-time platform. The communication between the different agents and the controller is established through Wi-Fi link. Both simulation and experimental results demonstrate the behavioral response where the robot performs the higher priority tasks first. This new approach shows a great performance with a lower control signal when benchmarked with previously known results in the literature. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The movement of cooperative robots in a densely cluttered environment may be impossible if the formation type is invariant. Hence, we investigate a novel method of switching time-invariant formation control for a group of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles, which may include Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). We have extended a Negative Imaginary (NI) consensus control approach to switch the formation shape of the robots whilst only using the relative distances between agents, in combination with those between agents and obstacles. All agents can automatically create a new safe formation to overcome obstacles, then restore the prototype formation once the obstacles are cleared. We address the oscillation and local minima problems, generated by existing algorithms, using a newly developed circle fitting approach. We also highlight the advantages of our proposed algorithms over the kinematic controller and the conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) controller from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. Simulation and experimental results are then analyzed to validate the feasibility of our proposed approach.

DE multi-agent simulation; subsistence; agent cognitive systems
AB This is an interim report on a set of ongoing agent-based simulation experiments. The main goal of the experiments is to evaluate the impact of varying memory capacities on the ability of agents to adapt to given subsistence environments and resource landscapes. The results so far suggest that-increasing the number of events which an agent can use in decision making does not directly lead to an increase in the agent's ability to adapt to an environment. Variable memory capacity, however, does lead to diversification of agent behaviour patterns in a given environment. The results also suggest that more permissive environments allow agents with greater memory to show a greater diversity of behaviour than similar agents in more restrictive environments. These early results are providing the starting hypotheses which are at the core of a larger set of experiments presently being carried out. The simulation engine and source code are available from the author.

AB Messy systems have no clear boundaries; they are composed of so many natural and/or artificial entities with patterns of interaction so dense that they cannot be understood by inspection and system behaviour cannot be predicted by statistical or qualitative analysis. Obvious examples are real social systems and the Internet. Analysing and designing software to exploit such systems requires a different approach to software engineering and mechanism design. The issue addressed in the MABS-2000 workshop and in this volume is the development of a methodology and technology to identify which techniques hold promise and which cannot possibly lead to useful applications for messy software or social systems.

AB An agent-based biological immune system (BIS) approach for adaptive health evaluation and control to a distributed manufacturing monitoring system is proposed. The presented approach establishes an immune monitoring model of a manufacturing system by exhibiting desirable immune characteristics, such as adaptation, immune recognition, immune memory and self-organization. In the BIS-based structural model, a group of autonomous agents mimic immune cells (such as B-cells) in BIS, have local interactions with monitoring environment and deal with emerging problems by simulating immune responses. Simulating the biological immune mechanism is able to monitor, diagnose and learn the faults. The methods of recognition and evaluation of fault antigens are proposed which can be used to coordinate and control the manufacturing system. The physical simulation platform for biological immune-inspired monitoring system has been developed. The experimental results show the feasibility of using this approach for real-time health monitoring and coordination control of manufacturing system.

DE Data streams; Density-based clustering; Bio-inspired flocking model
AB Existing density-based data stream clustering algorithms use a two-phase scheme approach consisting of an online phase, in which raw data is processed to gather summary statistics, and an offline phase that generates the clusters by using the summary data. In this article we propose a data stream clustering method based on a multi-agent system that uses a decentralized bottom-up self-organizing strategy to group similar data points. Data points are associated with agents and deployed onto a 2D space, to work simultaneously by applying a heuristic strategy based on a bio-inspired model, known as flocking model. Agents move onto the space for a fixed time and, when they encounter other agents into a predefined visibility range, they can decide to form a flock if they are similar. Flocks can join to form swarms of similar groups. This strategy allows to merge the two phases of density-based approaches and thus to avoid the computing demanding offline cluster computation, since a swarm represents a cluster. Experimental results show that the bio-inspired approach can obtain very good results on real and synthetic data sets.

AB Context Recent conceptual developments in ecosystem services research have revealed the need to elucidate the complex and unintended relationships between humans and the environment if we are to better understand and manage ecosystem services in practice.
   Objectives This study aimed to develop a model that spatially represents a complex human-environment (H-E) system consisting of heterogeneous social-ecological components and feedback mechanisms at multiple scales, in order to assess multi-dimensional (spatial, temporal, and social) trade-offs in ecosystem services.
   Methods We constructed an agent-based model and empirically calibrated it for a semi-arid region in Northeast China, and examined ecosystem service trade-offs derived from the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP), which is based on payment for ecosystem services. This paper describes our model, named Inner Mongolia Land Use Dynamic Simulator (IM-LUDAS), using the overview, design concepts, and details + decision (ODD + D) protocol and demonstrates the capabilities of IM-LUDAS through simulations.
   Results IM-LUDAS represented typical characteristics of complex H-E systems, such as secondary and cross-scale feedback loops, time lags, and threshold change, revealing the following results: tree plantations expanded by the SLCP facilitated vegetation and soil restoration and household change toward off-farm livelihoods, as expected by the government; conversely, the program caused further land degradation outside the implementation plots; moreover, the livelihood changes were not large enough to compensate for income deterioration by policy-induced reduction in cropland.
   Conclusions IM-LUDAS proved itself to be an advanced empirical model that can recreate essential features of complex H-E systems and assess multi-dimensional trade-offs in ecosystem services.

AB In this work, we study a discrete-time consensus protocol for a group of agents which communicate over a class of stochastically switching networks inspired by fish schooling. The network model incorporates the phenomenon of numerosity, that plays a prominent role in the collective behavior of animal groups, by defining the individuals' perception of numbers. The agents comprise leaders, which share a common state, and followers, which update their states based on information exchange among neighboring agents. We establish a closed form expression for the asymptotic convergence factor of the protocol, that measures the decay rate of disagreement among the followers' and the leaders' states. Handleable forms of this expression are derived for the physically relevant cases of large networks whose agents are composed of primarily leaders or followers. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate analytical results and illustrate the consensus dynamics as a function of the number of leaders in the group, the agents' persuasibility, and the agents' numerosity. We find that the maximum speed of convergence for a given population can be enhanced by increasing the proportion of leaders in the group or the agents' numerosity. On the other hand, we find that increasing the numerosity has also a negative effect as it reduces the range of agents' persuasibility for which consensus is possible. Finally, we compare the main features of this leader-follower consensus protocol with its leaderless counterpart to elucidate the benefits and drawbacks of leadership in numerosity-constrained random networks.

TI Resilience as an emergent property of human-infrastructure dynamics: A
   multi- agent simulation model for characterizing regime shifts and
   tipping point behaviors in infrastructure systems
SO PLOS ONE

ID CLIMATE-CHANGE; MANAGEMENT; WATER
AB The objective of this study is to establish a framework for analyzing infrastructure dynamics affecting the long-term steady state, and hence resilience in civil infrastructure systems. To this end, a multi-agent simulation model was created to capture important phenomena affecting the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems and model the long-term performance regimes of infrastructure. The proposed framework captures the following three factors that shape the dynamics of coupled human-infrastructure systems: (i) engineered physical infrastructure; (ii) human actors; and (iii) chronic and acute stressors. A complex system approach was adopted to examine the long-term resilience of infrastructure based on the understanding of performance regimes, as well as tipping points at which shifts in the performance regime of infrastructure occur under the impact of external stressors and/or change in internal dynamics. The application of the proposed framework is demonstrated in a case of urban water distribution infrastructure using the data from a numerical case study network. The developed multi-agent simulation model was then used in examining the system resilience over a 100-year horizon under stressors such as population change and funding constraints. The results identified the effects of internal dynamics and external stressors on the resilience landscape of infrastructure systems. Furthermore, the results also showed the capability of the framework in capturing and simulating the underlying mechanisms affecting human-infrastructure dynamics, as well as long-term regime shifts and tipping point behaviors. Therefore, the integrated framework proposed in this paper enables building complex system-based theories for a more advanced understanding of civil infrastructure resilience.

AB This paper addresses an adaptive event-triggered consensus control problem for a class of second-order nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) in an undirected communication topology. A novel adaptive distributed event-triggered consensus control scheme is presented for the MAS with unknown functions based on the definition of an auxiliary state, and the coefficient of the triggered function can be regulated adaptively with dependence on the auxiliary state error to ensure not only the control performance but also the efficiency of the network interactions. Furthermore, two self-triggered algorithms are developed for two cases, known functions and unknown ones, by the current state and information at the previous event time instant instead of the requirement for continuous monitoring auxiliary state errors. In theory, the stability of the resulting closed-loop system is rigorously investigated, and it is proven that all signals in the closed-loop system are bounded and the Zeno behavior is ruled out. Finally, two simulation examples, both real-time and numerical ones, are provided to verify the theoretical claims.

AB We present a new software platform called eVolutus for simulating evolution of living organisms. We choose Foraminifera as model organisms that represent a group of single-cellular, mainly marine, organisms that construct well fossilisable protective shells. They have lived on Earth for more than 540 million years and have left an extraordinary fossil record that is excellent for testing palaeoecological and evolutionary hypotheses. We use the AgE platform, which is a lightweight agent-oriented platform supporting distributed computation. The paper presents the general architecture of this modelling environment as well as more detailed descriptions of the implemented rules and applied solutions. The utility of this software is demonstrated by presenting the configuration and results of sample experiments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID HOMO-ECONOMICUS; GROUNDWATER; COMMONS
AB Many water tables are currently overexploited throughout the world. This situation raises the question of their management. Integrated management of such systems, established in both supply and demand areas, calls for thorough knowledge of the functioning of both the water table and its users, so models are usually required. This study is based on the case of the Kairouan water table, located in Tunisia, which has been continuously and globally decreasing for more than 20 years, due to overexploitation by private irrigators. The field study led to the hypothesis that the dynamics of the system is heavily influenced by local interaction between the resource and its users, and by direct, non-economic interaction between the farmers. The literature shows that several kinds of model have already been used to represent interaction between a water table and its users but none of them are able to take this kind of social behaviour into account. The simulator of a water table and user interaction (SINUSE) based upon multiagent systems enabled us to overcome these limitations. This model proved to be very useful for representing a complex and distributed system such as the Kairouan water table. It enabled us to explore the interaction between the physical and socio-economic components of the system and to conclude that local and non-economic behaviour do have a major impact on the global dynamics of the system and must therefore be taken into account. The management interventions simulated with the SINUSE model have raised interesting questions, leading to the conclusion that this model could provide a useful tool for negotiating the integrated management of the water table system. Though this model is rather specific, the approach developed could be transferred to other water table systems, to improve the knowledge of their functioning and examine the possible impacts of different management tools.

AB Suppose you have the possibility to choose to adopt one of a number of different behaviors or to choose to buy one of a number of different products, and suppose your choice is influenced by your individual perception of the average choices made by others. Economists Brock and Durlauf (in Am. Econ. Rev. 92(2):298, 2002; The Economy as an Evolving Complex System III. Oxford University Press, New York, 2006) have derived seminal theoretical results for the equilibrium behavior of the multinomial discrete choice model with social interactions, assuming homogeneous decision-makers, global interactions and laws of large of numbers. The research presented in this paper extends Brock and Durlauf's model to allow for unobserved preference heterogeneity between choice alternatives by studying the nested logit model. Next, by drawing on the computational possibilities permitted through social simulation of multi-agent systems (MAS), this paper relaxes the assumption of global interactions and considers instead local interactions within several hypothesized social and spatial network structures. Additional heterogeneity is thus hereby induced by the influence on a given decision-maker's choice by the particular network connections he or she has and the particular perceived percentages, for example, of the agent's neighbors or socio-economic peers making each choice. Discrete choice estimation results controlling these heterogeneous individual preferences are embedded in a multi-agent based simulation model in order to observe the evolution of choice behavior over time with socio-dynamic feedback due to the network effects. The MAS approach also gives us an additional advantage in the possibility to test size effects, and thus relax the assumption of large numbers, as well as test the effect of different initial conditions. Finally an extra benefit is gained via the MAS approach in that we are not confined to study only the equilibrium behavior, and have the possibility here to observe the time-varying trajectories of the choice behavior. This is important since smaller network sizes are revealed to be associated with higher volatility of the choice behavior in this model, and consequently stochastic cycling between equilibria. Averaged over time, the emergent behavior in such case yields a quite different picture than the theoretical results predicted by Brock and Durlauf. Furthermore being able to observe the emergent behavior allows us to see the subtle role of the unobserved heterogeneity in the nested logit model in breaking the symmetry of the multinomial logit model. We can see the temporal patterns by which theoretically predicted dominant equilibria emerge or not according to different social and spatial network scenarios. With an eye towards application in the context of transportation mode choice, we conclude highlighting limitations of our present study and recommendations for future work.

ID AUCTIONS
AB Intermediaries refer to agents that facilitate the resource allocation under certain constrain conditions. In a distribution market, buyers and sellers often interact via intermediaries and pay commissions to them. Due to the inadequacy of information spreading, a commodity can only be allocated to some agent who is close to the seller, which not only decreases the economic efficiency but also limits the seller's revenue. To tackle these two problems simultaneously, which is commonly a difficult objective in multi-agent systems, we use mechanism design theory and graph algorithms to develop a new auction protocol called Multi-Level Diffusion Mechanism (MLDM). Even when there are costs for assisting in others' trades, this mechanism can encourage every intermediary to help spread the selling information, either or not she has personal preference of the commodity. We show MLDM performs better than the second price auction both in theory and in numerical simulation no matter how agents' valuations and commissions are distributed.

AB Cellular automata (CA) have been increasingly used to simulate complex geographical phenomena. These models may have limitations on reflecting individuals' behaviors which should be considered in urban simulation. Agent-based modeling can solve some of the problems in addressing individuals' influences in urban systems. However, there is a general lack of methodology on how to define agents' properties. This paper uses multicriteria evaluation techniques to determine some of the parameters for the agent-based model. Empirical data from GIS are used to define agent's properties. Sensitivity analysis is also carried out to assess the influences of parameters on simulation outcomes. This model has been applied to the simulation of the residential development in a fast growing city, Guangzhou, in south China. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Adaptation is an essential requirement for self-organizing multi-agent systems functioning in unknown dynamic environments. Adaptation allows agents to change their actions in response to environmental changes or actions of other agents in order to improve overall system performance, and remain robust even while a sizeable fraction of agents fails. In this paper we present and study a simple model of adaptation for task allocation problem in a multi-robot system. In our model robots have to choose between two types of task, and the goal is to achieve desired task division without any explicit communication between robots. Robots estimate the state of the environment from repeated local observations and decide what task to choose based on these observations. We model robots and observations as stochastic processes and study the dynamics of individual robots and the collective behavior. We validate our analysis with numerical simulations.

A number of central nodes with specific properties (e.g. nodes with highest degree, betweenness or vulnerability values) are taken as leaders whose opinions are kept unchanged, that is, not influenced by other agents. The leaders try to coordinate the opinions of other agents where the connection structure is considered to be preferential attachment scale-free, Watts-Strogatz small-world or Erds-Renyi random networks. Numerical simulations show that scale-free networks provide faster consensus compared with other networks. We also study the effects of social power on the consensus time. The social power of a node is considered to be a function of its centrality. Having leaders in the network, we show that the consensus time could be significantly decreased by introducing social power. For scale-free networks, there is an optimal degree of social power in which the consensus time is minimal. These results show the appropriateness of scale-free topology in hierarchal organizations where leaders posit influence on peripheral agents.

AB The paper aims to discuss statistical properties of the multi-agent based model of competitive growth. Each of the agents is described by the growth (or decay) rule of its virtual "mass", with the rate affected by the interaction wit h other agents. The interaction depends on the strategy vector and Mutual distance between agents, and both are subjected to the agent's individual optimization process. Steady-state Simulations yield phase diagrams with the high and low competition phases (HCP and LCP, respectively) separated by critical point. Particular focus has been made on the indicators of the power-law behavior of the mass distributions with respect to the critical regime. In this regime, the study has revealed a remarkable anomaly in the optimization efficiency. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on the development of an agent-based cruising-for-parking simulation using the cellular automaton (CA) approach. The software was tested on a small-scale scenario, and a first verification step was performed for a real-world scenario for the town center of Zurich. Approaches to integrating the simulation into MATSim, a multi-agent transport simulation program, are discussed. The software is open source and can be downloaded from a free software repository. Empirical data that may be valuable for future model calibration are currently being surveyed in a global positioning system (GPS) study at the authors' institute.

AB In the military field, multi-agent simulation (MAS) plays an important role in studying wars statistically. For a military simulation system, which involves large-scale entities and generates a very large number of interactions during the runtime, the issue of how to improve the running efficiency is of great concern for researchers. Current solutions mainly use hybrid simulation to gain fewer updates and synchronizations, where some important continuous models are maintained implicitly to keep the system dynamics, and partial resynchronization (PR) is chosen as the preferable state update mechanism. However, problems, such as resynchronization interval selection and cyclic dependency, remain unsolved in PR, which easily lead to low update efficiency and infinite looping of the state update process. To address these problems, this paper proposes a lookahead behavior model (LBM) to implement a PR-based hybrid simulation. In LBM, a minimal safe time window is used to predict the interactions between implicit models, upon which the resynchronization interval can be efficiently determined. Moreover, the LBM gives an estimated state value in the lookahead process so as to break the state-dependent cycle. The simulation results show that, compared with traditional mechanisms, LBM requires fewer updates and synchronizations.

DE multi-agent based simulations; social activity; agent mechanisms
AB We started the setup of a virtual laboratory for the study of power struggles where autonomous agents embody different capabilities. The scenario is a caricature of hierarchical production societies which are driven to be structured into different organizational forms. Under the assumption of limited rationality, we look at diverse mechanisms able to drive the agent choice of action and to act. In our simple setup, an agent will look to shift to a new leader when placed in a poor individual situation. On the other hand, if the agent is comfortable, it might lower the pression imposed to its subordinates. Our agent models are yet too naive to distinguish motivation from will: the decision procedures aren't sophisticated enough to enable the consideration of reasoning processes running at each deliberation step. Thus we can't identify reasons (or motives) driving action selection. However, there is a causal relation from agent's state and its choosing process (but not its action). Along the present paper, special care is given to the validation of conjectures, where the data collected from the simulations is subject of statistical analysis towards their infirmation/refutation. Our present research around power will try to highlight new points of view over the architecture of an agent and the inner spot of potency, without loosing rigour on experimentation. Our initial experiments point out that, in these organisations, 1) Life Expectation and Individual Productive Capacity are related with the Hierarchical Rank and 2) If, under certain critical circumstances, agents can change to new leaders - or eventually become ones - Global Productive Capacity reach higher numbers but Life Expectation is lower.

AB Most existing analytical car-following models can simulate traffic flow realistically from some aspects, such as stop-and-go, congestion, and nonlinear characteristics, but cannot predict the driving behavior and psychological process as a driver is interacting with preceding vehicles. The reason for that is the difficulty that is generated by the impact of human factor. In this paper, a completely artificial intelligence car-following model, which has no analytical model incorporated, is developed to accurately imitate a human driver. This model comprises the classic stimulus-response framework, an extensive five-layer structure, Perception-Anticipation-Inference-Strategy-Action, and a fuzzy logic-based inference mechanism. A genetic algorithm is employed to calibrate the parameters of this model. The results of experiments, which were conducted by using Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset to validate the proposed model, indicate that the vehicle trajectories simulated by this model coincide with the actual vehicle trajectories in terms of mean value and deviation. In addition, they show that the proposed model has very good stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most existing studies on EV charging infrastructure planning take a central planner's perspective, by assuming that investment decision on charging facilities can be controlled by a single decision entity. In this paper, we establish modeling and computational methods to support business-driven EV charging infrastructure investment planning problem, where the infrastructure system is shaped by collective actions of multiple decision entities who do not necessarily coordinate with each other. A network-based multi agent optimization modeling framework is developed to simultaneously capture the selfish behaviors of individual investors and travelers and their interactions over a network structure. To overcome computational difficulty imposed by non-convexity of the problem, we rely on recent theoretical development on variational convergence of bivariate functions to design a solution algorithm with analysis on its convergence properties. Numerical experiments are implemented to study the performance of proposed method and draw practical insights. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In recent years, several approaches for modelling pedestrian dynamics have been proposed. However, so far not much attention has been paid to their quantitative validation. Instead the focus has been on the reproduction of empirically observed collective phenomena like the dynamical formation of lanes. Although this gives an indication of the realism of the model, for practical applications as in safety analysis, reliable quantitative predictions are required. We discuss the experimental situation focusing on the fundamental diagram that is essential for calibration. Furthermore, we present a cellular automaton, the floor field model, which forms the basis for various multi-agent simulations. Apart from the properties of its fundamental diagram, we discuss the role of conflicts and friction effects and their influence on evacuation times.

AB The price evolutions of goods exchange in multi-agent market are investigated by employing the kinetic theory. Assume that a closed market consists of two groups (A and B) of agents, who have the same preferences for goods. The constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function which contains Cobb-Douglas utility function and Leontief utility function, is used to describe the agent's preferences. A system of linear Boltzmann type equation is given to describe the probability distributions of goods for agents of the two groups, in which the agents are allowed to adopt certain trading strategies to maximize their utility and improve their wealth conditions. We assume that agents in group A put all their goods into the market for maximum utility, while agents in group B aim to acquire maximal utility from goods exchange by suitably selecting the percentage of goods which are exchanged. The effects of different trading strategies on commodity price and wealth distribution are discussed. The results show that the trading strategies of agents in group B have effectively improved their wealth status under certain assumptions. Also, a general system of nonlinear Boltzmann equation for the probability distributions of goods is given to describe the pricing issues of goods exchange for agents. The numerical experiments of nonlinear Boltzmann equations demonstrate how the trading strategies and preferences of agents modify the price of goods. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We propose a model for equity trading in a population of agents where each agent acts to achieve his or her target stock-to-bond ratio, and, as a feedback mechanism, follows a market adaptive strategy. In this model only a fraction of agents participates in buying and selling stock during a trading period, while the rest of the group accepts the newly set price.
   Using numerical simulations we show that the stochastic process settles on a stationary regime for the returns. The mean return can be greater or less than the return on the bond and it is determined by the parameters of the adaptive mechanism. When the number of interacting agents is fixed, the distribution of the returns follows the log-normal density. In this case, we give an analytic formula for the mean rate of return in terms of the rate of change of agents' risk levels and confirm the formula by numerical simulations. However, when the number of interacting agents per period is random, the distribution of returns can significantly deviate from the log-normal, especially as the variance of the distribution for the number of interacting agents increases.

AB The design of distributed observers is a hot topic in the research of multi-agent system. It can estimate the whole states of the plant with only portion of output information and the information communicated in the network. This paper introduces the high-gain matrix into the classical distributed observers to improve its convergence speed. In this scene, the performance of distributed observers-based control law can be improved. Since high-gain matrix change the structure of classical distributed observers, a group of sufficient conditions for the stability of the distributed high-gain observers are proved. Moreover, we prove the distributed high-gain observers-based control law satisfies certainty equivalency principle and the designed observer has performance recovery capability. A numerical simulation demonstrates the correction and superior property of our method.

AB This article describes Decentralised Emergence Detection (DETect), a novel distributed algorithm that enables agents to collaboratively detect emergent events in Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS). Non-deterministic interactions between agents in CAS can give rise to emergent behaviour or properties at the system level. The nature, timing, and consequence of emergence is unpredictable and may be harmful to the system or individual agents. DETect relies on the feedback that occurs from the system level (macro) to the agent level (micro) when emergence occurs. This feedback constrains agents at the micro level and results in changes occurring in the relationship between an agent and its environment. DETect uses statistical methods to automatically select the properties of the agent and environment to monitor and tracks the relationship between these properties over time. When a significant change is detected, the algorithm uses distributed consensus to determine if a sufficient number of agents have simultaneously experienced a similar change. On agreement of emergence, DETect raises an event, which its agent or other interested observers can use to act appropriately. The approach is evaluated using a multi-agent case study.

AB We introduce and discuss a new kinetic system for a financial market composed by agents that may belong to two different trader populations, whose behavior determines the price dynamic of a certain stock. Our mesoscopic description is based on the microscopic Lux Marchesi model [16, 17] and share analogies with the recent kinetic model by Maldarella and Pareschi [18], from which it differs in various points. In particular, it takes into account price acceleration, as well as a microscopic binary interaction for the exchange between the two populations of agents. Various numerical simulations show that the model can describe realistic situations, like regimes of boom and crashes, as well as the invariance of the large-time behavior with respect to the number of agents of the market.

AB In this paper, we propose a distributed dynamic correlation matrix based multi-Q (D-DCM-Multi-Q) learning method for multi-robot systems. First, a dynamic correlation matrix is proposed for multi-agent reinforcement learning, which not only considers each individual robot's Q-value, but also the correlated Q-values of neighboring robots. Then, the theoretical analysis of the system convergence for this D-DCM-Multi-Q method is provided. Various simulations for multi-robot foraging as well as a proof-of-concept experiment with a physical multi-robot system have been conducted to evaluate the proposed D-DCM-Multi-Q method. The extensive simulation/experimental results show the effectiveness, robustness, and stability of the proposed method.

AB We present a novel cognitive agent architecture and demonstrate its effectiveness in the Sense and Respond Logistics (SRL) domain. SRL transforms the static, hierarchical architectures of traditional military models into re-configurable networks designed to encourage coordination among small peer units. Multi-agent systems are ideal for SRL because they can provide valuable automation and decision support from low-level control to high-level information synchronization. In particular, agents can be aware of and adapt to changes in the environment that may affect control and decision making. Our architecture, the Engine for Composable Logical Agents with Intuitive Reorganization (ECLAIR) is a framework for enabling rapid development of coherent agent systems that adapt to their environment once deployed. ECLAIR is based on cognitive theories for motivation and adaptation, including Piaget's Assimilation and Accommodation [21] and Damasio's Somatic Marker Hypothesis [6]. To demonstrate our preliminary work, we implemented a simple simulation environment where our agents handle the ordering and delivery of supplies among operational and supply units in several scenarios requiring adaptation of default behavior.

AB Opinion dynamics models usually center on explaining how macro-level regularities in public opinion (uniformity, polarization or clusterization) emerge as the effect of local interactions of a population with an initial random distribution of opinions. However, with only a few exceptions, the understanding of patterns of public opinion change has generally been dismissed in this literature. To address this theoretical gap in our understanding of opinion dynamics, we built a multi-agent simulation model that could help to identify some mechanisms underlying changes in public opinion. Our goal was to build a model whose behavior could show different types of endogenously (not induced by the researcher) triggered transitions (rapid or slow, radical or soft). The paper formalizes a situation where agents embedded in different types of networks (random, small world and scale free networks) interact with their neighbors and express an opinion that is the result of different mechanisms: a coherence mechanism, in which agents try to stick to their previously expressed opinions; an assessment mechanism, in which agents consider available external information on the topic; and a social influence mechanism, in which agents tend to approach their neighbor's opinions. According to our findings, only scale-free networks show fluctuations in public opinion. Public opinion changes in this model appear as a diffusion process of individual opinion shifts that is triggered by an opinion change of a highly connected agent. The frequency, rapidity and radicalness of the diffusion, and hence of public opinion fluctuations, positively depends on how influential external information is in individual opinions and negatively depends on how homophilic social interactions are.

AB The rapid development of e-commerce has expedited knowledge growth in the e-commerce social community. Knowledge sharing among online users has exhibited a nonlinear dynamic evolution. This paper examines the evolutionary process of knowledge sharing among users of the social commerce; builds an evolutionary game model to depict knowledge sharing phenomenon in the virtual community; and develops a mixed learning algorithm based on individual user's historical game strategy, neighborhood user's strategy, and information noise. We design a computational model based on multi-agent theory and social network, and implement computational experimental system using NetLogo 5.0. We find that the proposed computational-experimental model can help decision makers simulate evolutionary process under various scenarios. The evolutionary game rule and social network structure significantly influence the degree of cooperation and knowledge sharing among users. The greater noise the network information has the less stable the users' behavior will be. One can thus identify an optimal initial cooperation rate to facilitate the system to reach equilibrium state quickly. Our study on the dynamic evolution of knowledge sharing behavior in the social commerce contributes to the theoretical development of literature and provides valuable decision-making support to managers.

AB Social and computational archaeology focuses largely on the study of past societies and the evolution of human behaviour. At the same time, agent-based models (ABMs) allow the efficient modeling of human agency, and the quantitative representation and exploration of specific properties and patterns in archaeological information. In this work we put forward a novel agent-based trading model, for simulating the exchange and distribution of resources across settlements in past societies. The model is part of a broader ABM populated with autonomous, utility-seeking agents corresponding to households; with the ability to employ any spatial interaction model of choice. As such, it allows the study of the settlements' trading ability and power, given their geo-location and their position within the trading network, and the structural properties of the network itself. As a case study we use the Minoan society during the Bronze Age, in the wider area of "Knossos" on the island of Crete, Greece. We instantiate two well-known spatial interaction sub-models, XTENT and Gravity, and conduct a systematic evaluation of the dynamic trading network that is formed overtime. Our simulations assess the sustainability of the artificial Minoan society in terms of population size, number and distribution of agent communities, with respect to the available archaeological data and spatial interaction model employed; and, further, evaluate the resulting trading network's structure (centrality, clustering, etc.) and how it affects inter-settlement organization, providing in the process insights and support for archaeological hypotheses on the settlement organization in place at the time. Our results show that when the trading network is modeled using Gravity, which focuses on the settlements' "importance" rather than proximity to each other, settlement numbers' evolution patterns emerge that are similar to the ones that exist in the archaeological record. It can also be inferred by our simulations that a rather dense trading network, without a strict settlement hierarchy, could have emerged during the Late Minoan period, after the Theran volcanic eruption, a well documented historic catastrophic event. Moreover, it appears that the trading network's structure and interaction patterns are reversed after the Theran eruption, when compared to those in effect in earlier periods.

AB This paper considers the collective dynamics of a group of mobile autonomous agents moving in Euclidean space with a virtual leader. We introduce a set of coordination control laws that enable the group to generate the desired stable flocking motion. The control laws are a combination of attractive/repulsive and alignment forces, and the control law acting on each agent relies on the state information of its flockmates and the external reference signal (or "virtual leader"). Using the control laws, all agent velocities asymptotically approach the desired velocity, collisions can be avoided between the agents, and the final tight formation minimizes all agent global potentials. Moreover, we show that the velocity of the center of mass either is equal to the desired velocity or exponentially converges to it. Furthermore, when the velocity damping is taken into account, we can appropriately modify the control laws to generate the same stable flocking motion. Subsequently, for the case where not all agents know the desired common velocity, we show that the desired flocking motion can still be guaranteed. Numerical simulations are worked out to illustrate our theoretical results. Additionally, we consider the effect of white noise on the collective dynamics of the group, and demonstrate numerically that the desired flocking motion can be kept for weak noise and, as the noise intensity increases, the flocking motion can be destroyed.

AB Fuel has been the main source of energy for cars for many years, but the non-renewable resources are limited in the planet. In this context, electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly replacing the previous kind of cars. However, as the number of EVs increases, some challenges arise such as the reduction of waiting times in the queues of fast charging stations. The current work addresses this challenge by means of social coordination mechanisms. In particular, this work presents an agent-based simulation framework for simulating the effects of different coordination policies in the route planning of EV drivers for charging their vehicles on their trips. In this manner, researchers and professionals can test different coordination mechanisms for this purpose. This framework has been experienced by simulating an adaptive strategy based on the implicit communication through booking systems in the charging stations. This strategy was compared with another common strategy, which was used as the control mechanism. This comparison was done by simulating several scenarios in two Spanish cities (i.e. Madrid and Zaragoza). The experimental results show that the current approach was useful to propose a route planning strategy that had statistically significant improvements in the reduction of waiting times in charging stations and also in the global trip times. In addition, the evolutions of pathfinding execution times and the numbers of interchanged messages did not show any overloading pattern over the time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on experimental observations in Daphnia, we introduce an agent-based model for the motion of single and swarms of animals. Each agent is described by a stochastic equation that also considers the conditions for active biological motion. An environmental potential further reflects local conditions for Daphnia, such as attraction to light sources. This model is sufficient to describe the observed cycling behavior of single Daphnia. To simulate vortex swarming of many Daphnia, i.e. the collective rotation of the swarm in one direction, we extend the model by considering avoidance of collisions. Two different ansatzes to model such a behavior are developed and compared. By means of computer simulations of a multi-agent system we show that local avoidance-as a special form of asymmetric repulsion between animals-leads to the emergence of a vortex swarm. The transition from uncorrelated rotation of single agents to the vortex swarming as a function of the swarm size is investigated. Eventually, some evidence of avoidance behavior in Daphnia is provided by comparing experimental and simulation results for two animals.

AB The purpose of this study is to construct a pedestrian simulation model of natural movement by applying rules that influence pedestrian route selection from previous experimental studies. Based on wall vector field, the multi agent-based simulation model which evolves through the relationship between vision-driven agents and configuration of environment was programmed by NetLogo. It considered visual field angle, visual distance, visual noise (looking around), moving speed, attractive factor, and other agents. The results of the simulation in several environments including a real architectural space such as the Tate Gallery produced better movement patterns than a previous model (Turner's EVA model) both locally and globally. Since the simulation model included variables related to visual factors which affect natural movement, it could help towards understanding the relationship between visibility and movement, its effects on spatial usage, and the affordance of configuration in a built environment for natural movement.

AB The Pharaoh's ant (Monontorium pharaonis), a significant pest in many human environments, is phenomenally successful at locating and exploiting available food resources. Several pheromones are utilized in the self-organized foraging of this ant but most aspects of the overall system are poorly characterised. Agent-based modelling of ants as individual complex X-machines facilitates study of the mechanisms underlying the emergence of trails and aids understanding of the process. Conducting simultaneous modelling, and simulation, alongside empirical biological studies is shown to drive the research by formulating hypotheses that must be tested before the model can be verified and extended. Integration of newly characterised behavioural processes into the overall model will enable testing of general theories giving insight into division of labour within insect societies. This study aims to establish a new paradigm in computational modelling applicable to all types of multi-agent biological systems, from tissues to animal societies, as a powerful tool to accelerate basic research.

AB This paper focuses on modeling power exchanges in a multi-agent interacting framework with reduced behavioral assumptions. A model of the day ahead market session of OMEL (the Spanish Power Exchange) is proposed using real demand data with simulated seller strategies. The number of sellers is defined at the first stage and the quantity of goods is distributed over the population of agents according to several initial distributions. A Clearing-house mechanism matches the cumulative demand and supply curves in order to determine the market-clearing price. The resulting price time-series are statistically tested to verify the validity of the model. Results show the main properties of real market and assess the validity of the proposed model.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Robots are expected to handle increasingly complex tasks. Such tasks often include interaction with objects or collaboration with other agents. One of the key challenges for reasoning in such situations is the lack of accurate models that hinders the effectiveness of planners. We present a system for online model adaptation that continuously validates and improves models while solving tasks with a belief space planner. We employ the well known online belief planner POMCP. Particles are used to represent hypotheses about the current state and about models of the world. They are sufficient to configure a simulator to provide transition and observation models. We propose an enhanced particle reinvigoration process that leverages prior experiences encoded in a recurrent neural network (RNN). The network is trained through interaction with a large variety of object and agent parametrizations. The RNN is combined with a mixture density network (MDN) to process the current history of observations in order to propose suitable particles and models parametrizations. The proposed method also ensures that newly generated particles are consistent with the current history. These enhancements to the particle reinvigoration process help alleviate problems arising from poor sampling quality in large state spaces and enable handling of dynamics with discontinuities. The proposed approach can be applied to a variety of domains depending on what uncertainty the decision maker needs to reason about. We evaluate the approach with experiments in several domains and compare against other state-of-the-art methods. Experiments are done in a collaborative multi-agent and a single agent object manipulation domain. The experiments are performed both in simulation and on a real robot. The framework handles reasoning with uncertain agent behaviors and with unknown object and environment parametrizations well. The results show good performance and indicate that the proposed approach can improve existing state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smart communication protocols are becoming a key mechanism for improving communication performance in networks such as wireless sensor networks. However, the literature lacks mechanisms for simulating smart communication protocols in precision agriculture for decreasing production costs. In this context, the current work presents an agent-based simulator of smart communication protocols for efficiently managing pesticides. The simulator considers the needs of electric power, crop health, percentage of alive bugs and pesticide consumption. The current approach is illustrated with three different communication protocols respectively called (a) broadcast, (b) neighbor and (c) low-cost neighbor. The low-cost neighbor protocol obtained a statistically-significant reduction in the need of electric power over the neighbor protocol, with a very large difference according to the common interpretations about the Cohen's d effect size. The presented simulator is called ABS-SmartComAgri and is freely distributed as open-source from a public research data repository. It ensures the reproducibility of experiments and allows other researchers to extend the current approach.

ID DYNAMICS
AB The study will apply Lyapunov principle to construct a dynamic model for tuberculosis ( TB). The Lyapunov principle is commonly used to examine and determine the stability of a dynamic system. To simulate the transmissions of vector-borne diseases and discuss the related health policies effects on vector-borne diseases, the authors combine the multi-agent-based system, social network and compartmental model to develop an epidemic simulation model. In the identity level, the authors use the multi-agent-based system and the mirror identity concept to describe identities with social network features such as daily visits, long-distance movement, high degree of clustering, low degree of separation and local clustering. The research will analyse the complex dynamic mathematic model of TB epidemic and determine its stability property by using the popular Matlab/Simulink software and relative software packages. Facing the current TB epidemic situation, the development of TB and its developing trend through constructing a dynamic bio-mathematical system model of TB is investigated. After simulating the development of epidemic situation with the solution of the SMIR epidemic model, the authors will come up with a good scheme to control epidemic situation to analyse the parameter values of a model that influence epidemic situation evolved. The authors will try to find the quarantining parameters that are the most important factors to control epidemic situation. The SMIR epidemic model and the results via numerical analysis may offer effective prevention with reference to controlling epidemic situation of TB.

AB The complex configuration and behavior of multisource hybrid energy systems (HESs) present challenges to their energy management. For a balanced solution, it is especially important to represent and take advantage of the characteristics of each device and the interactive relationship among them. In this paper, multiagent modeling and a game theory-based control strategy are proposed and combined for the energy management of an example engine-generator/battery/ultracapacitor (UC) HES. The three devices such as engine-generator unit, battery and UC packs are modeled and controlled as independent but related agents, through which the performance and requirements of the individual devices are fully respected. The energy management problem is then formulated as a noncooperative current control (NCC) game. The Nash equilibrium is analytically derived as a balanced solution that compromises the different preferences of the independent devices. The following simulation and experimental results validate the game theory-based control and its real-time implementation. The proposed approach could be further extended to become a general solution for the energy management and control of networked energy systems, in which again fully representing and balancing the different preferences of the components are important.

AB Very often in the history of mankind, social changes took place because a minority was successful in persuading the dominant majority of a new idea. Social psychology provides empirically well-founded theories of social influence that can explain the power of minorities at individual level. In this contribution, we present an agent-based computer simulation of one such theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). After introducing the theoretical background and our agent model, we present three simulation experiments that confirm past laboratory research but also go beyond its findings by adopting the method of computer simulation. First, we found that even a minority with low argument quality can be successful as long as it has positive peripheral cues. Second, our results suggest that a higher personal relevance of a topic for the majority led it to be more receptive to minority influence only when the minority showed neutral peripheral cues and very good arguments. Third, we found evidence that a neutral or only slightly biased majority is influenced more easily than a strongly biased one. To sum up, we consider these results to illustrate the notion that a well-presented, comprehensible and valid computer simulation provides a useful tool for theory development and application in an exploratory manner as long as it is well founded in terms of the model and theory.

TI Automated assistants for analyzing team behaviors
SO AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE teamwork; analysis; multiagent systems
AB Multi-agent teamwork is critical in a large number of agent applications, including training, education, virtual enterprises and collective robotics. The complex interactions of agents in a team as well as with other agents make it extremely difficult for human developers to understand and analyze agent-teambehavior. It has thus become increasingly important to develop tools that can help humans analyze, evaluate, and understand team behaviors. However, the problem of automated team analysis is largely unaddressed in previous work. In this article, we identify several key constraints faced by team analysts. Most fundamentally, multiple types of models of team behavior are necessary to analyze different granularities of team events, including agent actions, interactions, and global performance. In addition, effective ways of presenting the analysis to humans is critical and the presentation techniques depend on the model being presented. Finally, analysis should be independent of underlying team architecture and implementation.
   We also demonstrate an approach to addressing these constraints by building an automated team analyst called ISAAC for post-hoc, off-line agent-team analysis. ISAAC acquires multiple, heterogeneous team models via machine learning over teams' external behavior traces, where the specific learning techniques are tailored to the particular model learned. Additionally, ISAAC employs multiple presentation techniques that can aid human understanding of the analyses. ISAAC also provides feedback on team improvement in two novel ways: (i) It supports principled "what-if'' reasoning about possible agent improvements; (ii) It allows the user to compare different teams based on their patterns of interactions. This paper presents ISAAC's general conceptual framework, motivating its design, as well as its concrete application in two domains: ( i) RoboCup Soccer; ( ii) software agent teams participating in a simulated evacuation scenario. In the RoboCup domain, ISAAC was used prior to and during the RoboCup '99 tournament, and was awarded the RoboCup Scientific Challenge Award. In the evacuation domain, ISAAC was used to analyze patterns of message exchanges among software agents, illustrating the generality of ISAAC's techniques. We present detailed algorithms and experimental results from ISAAC's application.

AB Understanding the processes of individual adaptation to the consequences of climate change and of the public reaction to adaptation strategies defined in policy is a challenging field of research. We address this issue using the case of the Northern Hesse region located in the centre of Germany by developing a spatially explicit, multi-agent simulation model. Agents are grouped according to their social stratification by lifestyle and initialised by large scale, spatially explicit socio-empirical data. One important adaptation requirement will be volunteering activities that provide local neighbourhood support to supplement public health care during heat waves. We present modelling results on this topic and demonstrate how simulations may support the formation of health policies. As a result, we identify (areas with) populations with low potential for self-organised neighbourhood assistance and those with potentially efficient neighbourhood support. Furthermore, we investigate two different intervention scenarios that aim to mobilise passive subpopulations. The results of the presented scenario assessment may be used to inform policy makers and stakeholders on possible targets of information campaigns and will provide insights into the interplay of barriers and incentives regarding the individual actions regarding adaption to climate change and their trajectories.

AB We propose distributed control laws for a group of anonymous mobile agents to form desired circle formations when the agents move in the one-dimensional space of a circle. The agents are modeled by kinematic points. They share the common knowledge of the orientation of the circle, but are oblivious and anonymous. Moreover, each agent can only sense the relative positions of its neighboring two agents that are immediately in front of or behind itself. Distributed control strategies are designed for the agents using only the information of the relative positions of their two neighbors and also the given desired distances to its neighboring two agents. To make the control strategies more practical, we discuss the corresponding sampled-data control laws, and utilizing the technique of adopting time-varying gains, we obtain control laws that are able to guide the agents to form the desired circle formation within any given finite time. One feature of the proposed control laws is that they guarantee that the spatial ordering of the agents are preserved throughout the system's evolution, and thus no collision may take place during the process of forming circle formations. Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed formation control strategies.

AB Accidents happen in nature, from simple incidents like bumping into obstacles, to erroneously arriving at the wrong location, to mating with an unintended partner. Whether accidents are problematic for an animal depends on their context, frequency, and severity. In this article, we investigate the question of how accidents affect the task performance of agents in an agent-based simulation model for a wide class of tasks called "multi-agent territory exploration" tasks (MATE). In MATE tasks, agents have to visit particular locations of varying quality in partially observable environments within a fixed time window. As such, agents have to balance the quality of the location with how much energy they are willing to expend reaching it. Arriving at the wrong location by accident typically reduces task performance. We model agents based on two location selection strategies that are hypothesized to be widely used in nature: best-of-n and min-threshold. Our results show that the two strategies lead to different accident rates and thus overall different levels of performance based on the degree of competition among agents, as well as the quality, density, visibility, and distribution of target locations in the environment. We also show that in some cases, individual accidents can be advantageous for both the individual and the whole group.

AB In this paper, a twisting-based consensus algorithm is put forward to deal with the event-triggered finite-time consensus for networked Lagrangian systems with directed graphs. First, a fully distributed event-triggered finite-time protocol is considered, for which we can show that each agent can achieve the consensus after a settling time. In order to remove the requirement of continuous monitoring, a pull-based triggering mechanism is employed. Simultaneously, the Zeno-behavior can be excluded under a finite-time dynamic condition. Then, due to the advantages of non-chattering behaviors and finite-time convergence, a twisting-based consensus algorithm based on homogeneous techniques is developed to drive the Euler-Lagrange systems to the consensus value in a settling time. By means of Polya's theorem and Sum of Squares tools, a polynomial Lyapunov function is constructed to verify our criteria. At last, we give a numerical example for 2-DOF prototype manipulators to verify the validity of the theoretical results.

AB Over the past few years, automatic target recognition (ATR) has emerged as an essential image analysis toot to identify objects from temporally and spatially disjoint possibly noisy image data. For many current applications, ATR is performed by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that fly within a reconnaissance area to collect image data through sensors and upload the data to a central ground control station for analyzing and identifying potential targets. The centralized approach to ATR introduces several problems, including scalability with the number of UAVs' network delays in communicating with the central location, and the susceptibility of the system to malicious attacks on the central location. These challenges can be addressed by using a distributed system for performing ATR. In this paper, we describe a multiagent-based prototype system that uses swarming techniques inspired from insect colonies to perform ATR using UAVs in a distributed manner within simulated scenarios. We assume that UAVs are constrained in the resources available onboard and in their capabilities for performing ATR due to payload limitations. Our focus in this paper is on the coordination aspects between UAVs to efficiently decide how they are to act by using a swarming mechanism. We describe algorithms for the different operations performed by the UAVs in the system and for different swarming strategies, which are embedded within software agents located on the UAVs. We provide empirical simulations of our system within a simulated area of interest to determine its behavior in different scenarios with varying operational constraints. Our experimental results indicate that swarming strategies for distributed ATR perform favorably compared with centralized ATR strategies.

AB Opinion dynamics on social networks describe the time evolution of the opinions within the leader-follower coopetitive (cooperative-competitive) interactions. When does opinion formation result in opinion separation with the single leader? This paper investigates a continuous-time model of such opinion separation problems with signed networks. Our model combines the positive/negative weighting rule of Degroot to describe the impact of their neighbors and the reflected leader-follower mechanism of Jadbabaie to describe trust/distrust relationships from followers to the leader. When the leader is stationary, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition, which ensure all opinions finally converge to bipartite consensus as long as the network topology is structurally balanced. When the leader is dynamic, a sufficient condition is proposed to ensure the opinions of followers move with the opinion of leader or the opposite value in the same velocity. Subsequently, we introduce Laplacian schemes, the framework of signed networks and matrix analysis to develop the stability of networked systems. Numerical simulation examples are given to illustrate the performance of the proposed leader-follower coopetitive systems.

AB By utilizing dynamic event-triggered control strategy, this paper deals with consensus problem of a class of heterogeneous leader-following multi-agent systems(MASs) consisting of a high-dimensional leader system but low-dimensional following systems. A kind of observer-based consensus controllers is put forward with a dynamic event-triggered function consisting of the measurement error and a threshold based on the neighbors discrete states to reduce unnecessary utilization of limited communication and computation resources. Meanwhile, a dynamic variable is used to generate the event-triggered law using Input-to-State Stability(ISS) criteria. Based on this criteria, the proposed control strategy ensures stability of MASs, which fully reflects of the relationship between the external control inputs of the following systems and the internal states of the leader system and fully considered the influence of disturbances or noises on the MASs. Furthermore, the Zeno behavior for triggering time sequence is excluded. At last, a numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB A transportation system is spatially and functionally distributed; its subsystems have a high degree of autonomy and are in constant interaction with each other and with the surrounding geographic environment. Modeling and simulating such systems in large-scale geographic spaces is a complex process. In this paper we address the domain of railway systems, and more particularly the problem of detecting risky areas along railroads. This requires that we consider a variety of static and dynamic variables, including train characteristics, hazardous events (e.g. rock-falls), and the properties of the large-scale geographic environment, as well as weather conditions. This simulation enables us to recommend speed limits in risky areas while taking into account all of the aforementioned factors. Since statistical and analytical models are not appropriate to represent such a complex process in which spatial constraints are of high importance, we adopted a multi-agent geo-simulation (MAGS) approach that facilitates the simulation of complex systems in large-scale geo-referenced environments. In this paper, we present Train-MAGS, an agent-based geo-simulation tool that simulates train behaviors in risky areas in large-scale virtual geographic environments. We also demonstrate how risky areas can be detected in real time using an agent-based approach. This work also illustrates how the application of artificial intelligence techniques, such as the MAGS approach, provides interesting perspectives of realistic and plausible simulations aimed at improving the functioning, the efficiency, and the safety of the transportation systems.

   function; Unmanned aerial vehicles
AB A novel approach to address swarm coordination of a multi-agent system consisting of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using Robust Control Lyapunov Function (RCLF) is proposed in this paper. The approach addresses swarm coordination by commanding each agent to reach a desired separation distance with its neighbors and achieving heading consensus. The swarming is modeled as a decentralized scheme using behavioral approach and the inter-agent interaction is described with sigmoid artificial potential field. For this engineering swarm to mimic the natural flocking of birds, the local interaction is also modeled with Voronoi partitions method such that each agent only interacts with their immediate neighbors. Mid-air collision can be avoided by specifying a suitable desired separation distance.
   The simulation results show that the approach yields less intense artificial potential field, and is able to achieve the three main criteria of Reynolds' boids model (cohesion, separation, and alignment) effectively. Agents are able to satisfy the behavioral criteria in following an unknown informed agent (leader) in the presence of disturbances. Experimental results using quadrotor test-beds are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the decentralized behavioral scheme.

ID STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; DYNAMICS
AB Correlations and other collective phenomena are considered in a schematic model of pairwise interacting, competing and collaborating agents facing a binary choice and situated at the nodes of the complete graph and a 2-dimensional regular lattice, respectively. The agents may be subjected to an idiosyncratic or common external influence and also some random noise. The system's stochastic dynamics is studied by numerical simulations. It displays the characteristics of punctuated, multiple equilibria, sensitivity to small details, and path dependence. The dynamics is so slow that one can meaningfully speak of quasi-equilibrium states. Performing measurements of correlations between the agents choices we find that they are random both as to their sign and absolute value, but their distribution is very broad when the interaction dominates both the noise and the external field. This means that random but strong correlations appear with large probability. In the two dimensional model this also implies that the correlations on average fall off with distance very slowly: the system is essentially non-local, small changes at one end may have a strong impact at the other. The strong, random correlations tend to organize a large fraction of the agents into strongly correlated clusters that act together. If we think of this model as a metaphor of social or economic agents or bank networks, the systemic risk implications of this tendency are clear: any impact on even a single strongly correlated agent will not be confined to a small set but will spread, in an unforeseeable manner, to the whole system via the strong random correlations.

AB Voting is an essential mechanism that allows multiple agents to reach a joint decision. The joint decision, representing a function over the preferences of all agents, is the winner among all possible (candidate) decisions. To compute the winning candidate, previous work has typically assumed that voters send their complete set of preferences for computation, and in fact this has been shown to be required in the worst case. However, in practice, it may be infeasible for all agents to send a complete set of preferences due to communication limitations and willingness to keep as much information private as possible. The goal of this paper is to empirically evaluate algorithms to reduce communication on various sets of experiments. Accordingly, we propose an iterative algorithm that allows the agents to send only part of their preferences, incrementally. Experiments with simulated and real-world data show that this algorithm results in an average of 35% savings in communications, while guaranteeing that the actual winning candidate is revealed. A second algorithm applies a greedy heuristic to save up to 90% of communications. While this heuristic algorithm cannot guarantee that a true winning candidate is found, we show that in practice, close approximations are obtained.

AB This paper describes how a work group and a newcomer mutually adapt. We study two types of simulated groups that need an extra worker, one group because a former employee had left the group and one group because of its workload. For both groups, we test three conditions, newcomers being specialists, newcomers being generalists, and a control condition with no newcomer. We hypothesise that the group that needs an extra worker because of its workload will perform the best with a newcomer being a generalist. The group that needs an extra worker because a former employee had left the group, will perform better with a specialist newcomer. We study the development of task allocation and performance, with expertise and motivation as process variables. We use two performance indicators, the performance time of the slowest agent that indicates the speed of the group and the sum of performance of all agents to indicate labour costs. Both are indicative for the potential benefit of the newcomer. Strictly spoken the results support our hypotheses although the differences between the groups with generalists and specialists are negligible. What really mattered was the possibility for a newcomer to fit in.

AB Multi-agent simulations can provide useful insights into the movement of pedestrians in arbitrary environments for predictive planning and analysis. The fidelity of such agents is important for the validity of the associated analyses. Current methods tend to employ agent models that are largely homogeneous in both physical abilities and behaviours. However, actual pedestrians exhibit a wide range of locomotion abilities and behaviours. In this work, we take a first step towards identifying and modellingdistractedbehaviours, such as walking and texting on a cell phone. Our models relate reported changes to the locomotion patterns and sensory abilities of distracted pedestrians to the corresponding parameters of a commonly used crowd simulation steering approach. We demonstrate experimentally that accounting for even a few of these behaviours significantly alters the flow patterns of the simulated agents. This impact affects overall crowd behaviour and is reflected in several crowd statistics including flow rate, effort, and kinetic energy.

AB Pricing strategy is important to a platform not only for branding but also for capturing the willingness-to-pay of customers. With keen competition, few platforms survive to reach the growth and maturity stages. This study examines offensive pricing strategies in a pure duopoly where two platforms have products with high dependency. We also examine how the effectiveness of message dissemination, simulated by WOM marketing, affects offensive pricing strategies in the platform business. We developed a multi-agent model to simulate pricing strategies and message dissemination.

AB This paper studies the operation of multi-agent networks engaged in multi-task decision problems under the paradigm of simultaneous learning and adaptation. Two scenarios are considered:one in which a decision must be taken among multiple states of nature that are known but can vary over time and space, and another in which there exists a known "normal" state of nature and the task is to detect unpredictable and unknown deviations from it. In both cases the network learns from the past and adapts to changes in real time in a multi-task scenario with different clusters of agents addressing different decision problems. The system design takes care of challenging situations with clusters of complicated structure, and the performance assessment is conducted by computer simulations. A theoretical analysis is developed to obtain a statistical characterization of the agents' status at steady-state, under the simplifying assumption that clustering is made without errors. This provides approximate bounds for the steady-state decision performance of the agents. Insights are provided for deriving accurate performance prediction by exploiting the derived theoretical results.

AB For agents to collaborate in open multi-agent systems, each agent must trust in the other agents' ability to complete tasks and willingness to cooperate. Agents need to decide between cooperative and opportunistic behavior based on their assessment of another agents' trustworthiness. In particular, an agent can have two beliefs about a potential partner that tend to indicate trustworthiness: that the partner is competent and that the partner expects to engage in future interactions. This paper explores an approach that models competence as an agent's probability of successfully performing an action, and models belief in future interactions as a discount factor. We evaluate the underlying decision framework's performance given accurate knowledge of the model's parameters in an evolutionary game setting. We then introduce a game-theoretic framework in which an agent can learn a model of another agent online, using the Harsanyi transformation. The learning agents evaluate a set of competing hypotheses about another agent during the simulated play of an indefinitely repeated game. The Harsanyi strategy is shown to demonstrate robust and successful online play against a variety of static, classic, and learning strategies in a variable-payoff Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma setting.

AB This paper investigates the problem of finite time consensus for a group of uncertain nonlinear mechanical systems under single-way directed communication topology and actuation failures. Due to the existence of the unknown inherent nonlinear dynamics and the undetectable actuation faults, the resultant control gain of the system becomes unknown and time-varying, making the control impact on the system uncertain and the finite time control synthesis nontrivial. The underlying problem becomes further complex as the communication among the agents is not only local but also one-way directed. In this work, three major steps are employed to circumvent the aforementioned difficulties, leading to a robust adaptive fault-tolerant finite time consensus solution. Firstly, by deriving a useful property on the newly constructed Laplacian matrix, the technical difficulty in finite time control design and stability analysis is circumvented; Secondly, to deal with the time-varying and uncertain control gain, the concept of virtual parameter estimation error is introduced and incorporated into a skillfully chosen Lyapunov function; Thirdly, to facilitate the global stability analysis of the proposed adaptive fault-tolerant finite time consensus scheme for multiple nonlinear systems, an important lemma (Lemma 7) containing a useful inequality is derived. In addition, the finite convergence time for each agent to reach the required consensus configuration is explicitly established and recipes for control parameter selection to make the residual errors as small as desired are provided. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is confirmed by numerical simulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we study the decentralized coverage control problem for an environment using a group of autonomous mobile robots with nonholonomic kinematic and dynamic constraints. In comparison with standard coverage control procedures, we develop a combined controller for Voronoi-based coverage approach in which kinematic and dynamic constraints of the actual mobile sensing robots are incorporated into the controller design. Furthermore, a collision avoidance component is added in the kinematic controller in order to guarantee a collision free coverage of the area. The convergence of the network to the optimal sensing configuration is proven with a Lyapunov-type analysis. Numerical simulations are provided approving the effectiveness of the proposed method through several experimental scenarios.

AB The rapid growth in urban population poses significant challenges to moving city dwellers in a fast and convenient manner. This paper contributes to solving the challenges from the viewpoint of passengers by improving their on-vehicle experience. Specifically, we focus on the problem: Given an urban public transit network and a number of passengers, with some of them controllable and the rest uncontrollable, how can we plan for the controllable passengers to improve their experience in terms of their service preference? We formalize this problem as a multi-agent path planning (MAPP) problem with soft collisions, where multiple controllable passengers are allowed to share on-vehicle service resources with one another under certain constraints. We then propose a customized version of the SC-M* algorithm to efficiently solve the MAPP task for bus transit system in complex urban environments, where we have a large passenger size and multiple types of passengers requesting various types of service resources. We demonstrate the use of SC-M* in a case study of the bus transit system in Porto, Portugal. In the case study, we implement a data-driven on-vehicle experience simulator for the bus transit system, which simulates the passenger behaviors and on-vehicle resource dynamics, and evaluate the SC-M* on it. The experimental results show the advantages of the SC-M* in terms of path cost, collision-free constraint, and the scalability in run time and success rate.

AB This study examines the performance of MAIS (Multi-Agent Intelligent Simulator) equipped with various learning capabilities. In addition to the learning capabilities, the proposed MAIS incorporates collaboration among agents. The proposed MAIS is applied to estimate a dynamic change of wholesale electricity price in PJM (Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Mainland) and an artificial data set generated by a mean reverting model. Using such different types of data sets, the methodological validity of MAIS is confirmed by comparing it with other well-known alternatives in computer science. This study finds that the MAIS needs to incorporate both the mean reverting model and the collaboration behavior among agents in order to enhance its estimation capability. The MAIS discussed in this study will provide research on energy economics with a new numerical capability that can investigate a dynamic change of not only wholesale electricity price but also speculation and learning process of traders.

AB A multi-population genetic algorithm (MPGA) is introduced to search for as many as possible of the local optima of a complex function in a noisy environment. By considering a multi-agent system consisting of sub-populations of agents that evolve simultaneously as a group of chromosomes in a genetic algorithm, we perform a spatial allocation of resources by the partitioning of the search space into many subspaces. A migration operator is used to control the exchange of chromosomes between different sub-populations. This spatial allocation of computational resources has the advantage of exhaustive search which avoids duplicate effort, and combines it with the parallel nature of the search for the solution in disjoint subspaces by genetic algorithms. The division of the solution space is performed intelligently using loci statistics of the chromosomes in past generations. The benchmark function used is a 2-D function with the x-y coordinates represented by a binary coded chromosome. Unlike traditional GAs, the exact differential df is used as the fitness for the chromosomes. For noisy environment, the derivatives used in calculating exact differentials are obtained through second order polynomial fitting. Two measurements are employed to evaluate the performance of this algorithm: precision (Pr), which is the average fitness of all the local optima at the end of the evolution, and cover degree (CD), which is the percentage of the local optima obtained at the end of evolution, among the total number of optima. The variance of the noise affects both CD and Pr, while the quality of the local optima decreases with increasing noise, the degree of coverage (CD) is rather insensitive to noise. The effects of the parameters of MPGA on performance are discussed, and applications to the mapping of complex landscape suggested.

AB Computer simulation for pedestrian dynamics is at the same time an application area in which research has completed its cycle and an active and lively research context in which contributions from different disciplines still produce advancements on the state of the art. The study of effects of the presence of groups in the simulated population is object of growing interest in the community. While previous results have started to investigate the phenomenon, implying conflicting tendencies for pedestrians, mechanisms for the flexible management of cohesion among group members are still investigated both in continuous and discrete modelling efforts. The present effort is aimed at extending previous modelling efforts, preserving and improving the capability to generate overall plausible aggregated dynamics, while at the same time improving the precision in the microscopic group dynamics, with particular attention to the shape of dyads. The paper presents validated results based on empirical data from a controlled experiment, also discussing qualitative results in different common situations (bends and bottlenecks).

AB Understanding how to design agents that sustain cooperation in multi-agent systems has been a long-lasting goal in distributed artificial intelligence. Proposed solutions rely on identifying free-riders and avoiding cooperating or interacting with them. These mechanisms of social control are traditionally studied in games with linear and deterministic payoffs, such as the prisoner's dilemma or the public goods game. In reality, however, agents often face dilemmas in which payoffs are uncertain and non-linear, as collective success requires a minimum number of cooperators. The collective risk dilemma (CRD) is one of these games, and it is unclear whether the known mechanisms of cooperation remain effective in this case. Here we study the emergence of cooperation in CRD through partner-based selection. First, we discuss an experiment in which groups of humans and robots play a CRD. This experiment suggests that people only prefer cooperative partners when they lose a previous game (i.e., when collective success was not previously achieved). Secondly, we develop an evolutionary game theoretical model pointing out the evolutionary advantages of preferring cooperative partners only when a previous game was lost. We show that this strategy constitutes a favorable balance between strictness (only interact with cooperators) and softness (cooperate and interact with everyone), thus suggesting a new way of designing agents that promote cooperation in CRD. We confirm these theoretical results through computer simulations considering a more complex strategy space. Third, resorting to online human-agent experiments, we observe that participants are more likely to accept playing in a group with one defector when they won in a previous CRD, when compared to participants that lost the game. These empirical results provide additional support to the human predisposition to use outcome-based partner selection strategies in human-agent interactions.

AB Stock market is a complex system composed from heterogeneous traders with highly non-linear interactions from which emerge a phenomenon of speculative bubble. To understand the role of heterogeneous behaviors of traders and interactions between them in the emergence of bubbles, we propose an agent-based model of double auction market, with asynchronous time management, where traders act asynchronously and take different times to make decisions. The market is populated by heterogeneous traders. In addition to fundamentalist, noise, and technical (chartist) traders, we propose a hybrid trader, which can switch between technical (chartist) and fundamentalist strategies integrating panicking behavior. We find that when market is populated by a majority of hybrid traders, we observe quite realistic bubble formation characterized by a boom phase when hybrid traders switch to technical behavior, followed by a relatively shorter burst phase when hybrid traders return to fundamentalist strategy and change to panicked state. The aim is to design agents which act asynchronously, with simple behaviors, but complex enough to produce realistic price dynamics, which provide a basis for developing agents with sophisticated decision-making processes.

AB This paper proposes distributed control laws for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to make and maintain a circular formation around a maneuvering target. The work considers usage of heterogeneous communication networks to achieve the desired formation. Two different scenarios are considered on velocity information. In both scenarios, it is assumed that each UAV has its own position and velocity measurements available to itself. However, the team is unable to exchange velocity information among themselves. In the first scenario, each agent uses its own position and velocity information in the consensus algorithm. In the second scenario, agents need only position information for the consensus algorithm. For both the approaches, each agent calculates a virtual estimate of target's velocity from the received information and exchanges the estimate with its neighbors. The control algorithms are developed using heterogeneous communication networks to satisfy a communication bandwidth constraint. Three different communication networks are used to circulate position information, virtual estimates, and its time derivatives. The graphs representing communication networks are undirected and connected. Further, it is considered that there is at least one UAV (agent) receiving position, velocity, and acceleration information of the target. The agent receiving target's position need not be the same agent which receives velocity and/or acceleration information of the maneuvering target. However, the target does not receive any information from any agent. Using Barbalat's lemma, the stability of the target-centric formation of a group of UAVs is analyzed. The performance of the proposed laws are illustrated through numerical simulations.

AB A appropriate bottom-up rule system can support the sustainability of common-pool resources such as forests and fisheries. The process that leads to the developments of such institutional settings requires the considerations of multiple social, physical, and institutional factors over long time horizons. In this paper, we present the SONICOM model as a general exploratory model of CPR systems. The model can be configured to represent different CPR systems in order to explore what kind of institutional settings result in stable systems, i. e. situations where the resource and the appropriators are in a state of wellbeing. We use a large-N-dataset of CPR management institutions to validate the model. The results show numerous correlations between various parameters of the system such as rule compliance, social influence and resource growth rate which help explaining the process of institutional emergence as well as unveiling the conditions under which systems are stable.

AB In this paper, we present a novel receding horizon control scheme for solving the formation problem of leader-follower configurations. The algorithm is based on set-theoretic ideas and is tuned for agents described by linear time-invariant (LTI) systems subject to input and state constraints. The novelty of the proposed framework relies on the capability to jointly use sequences of one-step controllable sets and polyhedral piecewise state-space partitions in order to online apply the better' control action in a distributed receding horizon fashion. Moreover, we prove that the design of both robust positively invariant sets and one-step-ahead controllable regions is achieved in a distributed sense. Simulations and numerical comparisons with respect to centralised and local-based strategies are finally performed on a group of mobile robots to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

AB Objective: To use the detection of clinically relevant inconsistencies to support the reasoning capabilities of intelligent agents acting as physicians and tutors in the realm of clinical medicine.
   Methods: We are developing a cognitive architecture, OntoAgent, that supports the creation and deployment of intelligent agents capable of simulating human-like abilities. The agents, which have a simulated mind and, if applicable, a simulated body, are intended to operate as members of multi-agent teams featuring both artificial and human agents. The agent architecture and its underlying knowledge resources and processors are being developed in a sufficiently generic way to support a variety of applications.
   Results: We show how several types of inconsistency can be detected and leveraged by intelligent agents in the setting of clinical medicine. The types of inconsistencies discussed include: test results not supporting the doctor's hypothesis; the results of a treatment trial not supporting a clinical diagnosis; and information reported by the patient not being consistent with observations. We show the opportunities afforded by detecting each inconsistency, such as rethinking a hypothesis, reevaluating evidence, and motivating or teaching a patient.
   Conclusions: Inconsistency is not always the absence of the goal of consistency; rather, it can be a valuable trigger for further exploration in the realm of clinical medicine. The OntoAgent cognitive architecture, along with its extensive suite of knowledge resources an processors, is sufficient to support sophisticated agent functioning such as detecting clinically relevant inconsistencies and using them to benefit patient-centered medical training and practice.

AB This article describes simulation research based on the Hamiltonian theory of gene-based altruism. It investigates the origin of semipermanent breeding bonds during hominin evolution. The research framework is based on a biologically detailed, ecologically situated, multi-agent microsimulation of emergent sociality. The research question tested is whether semipermanent breeding bonds (an emergent homoplastic social construct) might emerge among primate-like agents as the consequence of a mutation capable of supporting involuntary prosocial behavior. The research protocol compared several, single independent-variable longitudinal studies wherein hundreds of generations of autonomous, initially promiscuous, biologically detailed, hominin-like artificial life software agents were born, allowed to forage, reproduce, and die during experimental intervals lasting several simulated millennia. The temporal setting of the experiment was roughly contemporaneous with, or slightly after the time of, the Pan-Homo split. The simulation investigated what would happen if, within a population, a single gene for prosocial behavior (the independent variable in the experiment) was either switched on or switched-off. The null hypothesis predicted that, if the gene was switched off, then semipermanent breeding bonds (the dependent variable) would nonetheless emerge within the population. The results of the simulation rejected this null hypothesis, by showing that semipermanent breeding bonds would reliably emerge among the experimental populations but not among the control groups. Moreover, it was found that, across all experimental settings having constrained population numbers, the portion of each population having no prosocial trait would die out early, whereas the portion with the prosocial trait would survive. Large control populations had no discernible loss. The results of this research imply that, during the early stages of hominin evolution, there might have been a set of initially gene-based, altruistic excess forage sharing social traits that contributed to the onset of morphological and additional complex social changes characteristic of this group. This work also demonstrates that modern computational technologies can extend our ability to test 'what it' hypotheses appropriate to the study of early hominin evolution. (C) 2017 The Author.

AB Enabled by recent neuroscience and especially electroencephalogram (EEG) studies, this paper describes a conceptually novel modeling approach, based on quantum theory, to basic human mind states as systems of coherent oscillation. The aim is to bridge the gap between fundamental theory, experimental observation and the simulation of agents' mind states. The proposed approach, i.e., an oscillating agent model (OAM), reveals possibilities of employing wave functions and quantum operators for a stylized description of basic mind states and the transitions between them. In the OAM the basic mind states are defined using experimentally observed EEG spectra, i.e., brainwaves (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma), which reveal an oscillatory nature of agents' mind states. Such an approach provides an opportunity to model the dynamics of basic mind states by employing stylized oscillation-based representations of the characteristic EEG power spectral density (PSD) distributions of brainwaves observed in experiments. In other words, the proposed OAM describes a probabilistic mechanism for transitions between basic mind states characterized by unique sets of brainwaves. The instantiated theoretical framework is pertinent not only for the simulation of the individual cognitive and behavioral patterns observed in experiments, but also for the prospective development of OAM-based multi-agent systems.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the affordances of participatory simulations by comparing students' models of engagement and science learning outcomes in a multi-team participatory simulated game (MPSG) and a single-team participatory simulated game (SPSG). Two versions of a mobile-based game about marine fishery management were created. Participants were 105 seventh-grade students in Taiwan. Research instruments included a Science Game Engagement questionnaire and a Marine Ecosystem and Sustainability Test. Students' interviews and classroom videos were also collected. Students' models of engagement were analyzed by using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling, and comparisons of subscales of engagement and learning outcomes were made by Analysis of Covariance statistics. The results showed that the students in the MPSG group had a higher level of behavioral engagement and better learning achievement than the students in the SPSG group did. Also, in exploring the interrelationships among the subscales of students' engagement, we found that, in the SPSG group, students' behavioral engagement was positively predicted by their emotional engagement, while in the MPSG group, it was positively predicted by their social engagement. In both groups, behavioral engagement predicted cognitive engagement. This finding was supported by the video data in that more interactions among the group members were observed in the MPSG group. This indicated that the multi-agent, dynamic modeling in the MPSG may have shifted the quality of the learners' social interactions. The affordances of participatory simulated games are discussed, and future research directions are provided.
   Practitioner notes
   What is already known about this topic
   Participatory simulations allow users to participate in simulations by controlling one of the roles in the system which models real-life settings. Dynamic modeling is an essential feature of participatory simulations that allows the learners to see the exact impact of their participation on changes in the system.
   Students who learned with the participatory simulations showed significantly better reasoning in concept building and fewer misconceptions than with conventional simulations.
   However learners can overly emphasize racing to win in multi-agent participatory simulations and tasks in participatory simulations can be too challenging for some learners.
   What this paper adds
   We compared students' engagement models in two versions of a participatory game-a multi-team participatory simulated game (MPSG) and a single-team participatory simulated game (SPSG). We found that in the MPSG social engagement predicted behavioral engagement while in the SPSG students' emotional engagement played an important role.
   Students who participated in the MPSG had better performance in system thinking than the students in the SPSG.
   Implications for practice and/or policy
   Dynamic modeling is not only authentic for simulating certain scientific phenomena but also it offers the affordances of improving the quality of learners' social interactions. This should be taken into account in the future design of educational simulations.
   A multi-team design of participatory simulation taking advantage of competition among teams and collaboration within teams can help students to learn complex phenomena.

The 2D P colonies have been shown to be suitable for the simulations of various (not only) multi-agent systems, and natural phenomena, like flash floods. The Grey wolf algorithm is the optimization-based algorithm inspired by social dynamics found in packs of grey wolves and by their ability to create hierarchies, in which every member has a clearly defined role, dynamically. In our previous papers, we extended the 2D P colony by the universal communication device, the blackboard. The blackboard allows for the agents to share various information, e.g., their position or the information about their surroundings. In this paper, we follow our previous research on the numerical 2D P colony with the blackboard. We present the computer simulator of the numerical 2D P colony with the blackboard and the results of the computer simulation, and we compare these results with the original algorithm.

AB Recently, the study of opinion dynamics on complex networks has attracted a great deal of attention. In this brief, we take an interest in how an opinion forms in a social network with stochastic noises. We investigate a stochastic opinion dynamics model, in which individuals obtain information from their neighbors in a social network. We model the social network as a strongly connected graph. Each individual has an initial opinion and iteratively exchanges her opinion based on a stubborn opinion, her neighbors' opinions and small stochastic noises continually. We first construct a general stochastic opinion evolution problem with multiplicative noises as a stochastic differential equation and then investigate the stochastic stability of this equation. We consider whether an opinion may form as a result of stochastic disturbance and local interactions. We also establish two sufficient conditions which ensure that the average opinion and the error vector system for all individuals are stochastic stable, respectively. Numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

SO ADAPTIVE BEHAVIOR

DT Article; Early Access
DE Commitment; Evolutionary Game Theory; coordination; technology adoption
AB Upon starting a collective endeavour, it is important to understand your partners' preferences and how strongly they commit to a common goal. Establishing a prior commitment or agreement in terms of posterior benefits and consequences from those engaging in it provides an important mechanism for securing cooperation. Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT), here we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for enhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff structure, in both pairwise and multi-party interactions. Arguably, coordination is more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several desirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual cooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas). Our analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that whether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing coordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the collective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how asymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multi-party interactions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group diversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for different selection intensities. Overall, our analysis provides new insights into the complexity and beauty of behavioural evolution driven by humans' capacity for commitment, as well as for the design of self-organised and distributed multi-agent systems for ensuring coordination among autonomous agents.

AB This review discusses agent-based social simulation (ABSS(1))in relation to the study of social dilemmas such as the Prisoner's Dilemma and Tragedy of the Commons. Its aims are to explore the place of ABSS in relation to other research methods such as mathematical analysis, to familiarise artificial intelligence researchers (particularly those working on multi-agent systems) with a body of relevant multidisciplinary work, and to suggest directions for future ABSS research on social dilemmas.
   ABSS research can contribute greatly to the understanding of social phenomena, but needs to be based on a clear appreciation of the current `state of play' in the areas where it is used. With regard to `thin' (simple, general) simulation models, this primarily means attending to what has been or could be discovered by mathematical analysis, to work using other forms of simulation, and to the relevant theoretical disputes; with regard to `thick' (specific, detailed) models (about which the paper has less to say), linking to the relevant `thin' models and to the empirical evidence. The bulk of ABSS work on social dilemmas has been concentrated in quite a narrow - though certainly significant - area (reciprocal altruism in the Prisoner's Dilemma), and has sometimes been seriously flawed by over-ambitious claims, and insufficient attention to analytical approaches - although this same work has been very fertile in terms of inspiring further work, both analytical and simulation-based.

AB Central Place Theory has been proposed for a long time, but it is rarely applied in empirical research or planning practices on retail center systems in the real world primarily attributable to the complexities that are too difficult for the theory to capture and replicate in efficient ways. This paper proposes an agent-based simulation system which can derive spatial distributions of multilevel retail centers by simulating the interactions between retail centers and consumers. In the simulation, the retail centers can grow, recess, and adjust locations according to the revenues; the consumers generate different levels of shopping demands and choose retail centers according to spatial distance. By recursively simulating the interactions, equilibrium is reached with the distribution of emerging retail centers. The system is validated by examining the simulated retail center systems under five hypothetical but typical scenarios of consumer spatial distribution. It is also applied in modeling the retail center system of Shanghai in the 2000s. The results show a face validity of the simulation system as a potential tool for real-world planning practices.

AB In this article a model of the regulator system of the lower urinary tract is presented discussing, in particular, the dysfunctions associated with the neurogenic bladder. The design and implementation of the model has been carried out using distributed artificial intelligence, more specifically a multi-agent system. Each agent is modelled so that its behaviour is similar to that of a neuronal centre. By means of this design, the behaviour of the neuronal regulator of the lower urinary tract is simulated using a model with a similar structure to the organisation of the biological system, conferring on it emergent properties. We compare the results obtained using the model in situations with several neurological dysfunctions with experimental results obtained from patients suffering from the analysed dysfunctions. The data, obtained using the model, are consistent with the existing real clinic studies in medicine related to the same dysfunctions.

AB With a principled methodology for systematic design of human-robot decision-making teams as a motivating goal, we seek an analytic, model-based description of the influence of team and network design parameters on decision-making performance. Given that there are few reliably predictive models of human decision making, we consider the relatively well-understood two-alternative choice tasks from cognitive psychology, where individuals make sequential decisions with limited information, and we study a stochastic decision-making model, which has been successfully fitted to human behavioral and neural data for a range of such tasks. We use an extension of the model, fitted to experimental data from groups of humans performing the same task simultaneously and receiving feedback on the choices of others in the group. First, we show how the task and model can be regarded as a Markov process. Then, we derive analytically the steady-state probability distributions for decisions and performance as a function of model and design parameters such as the strength and path of the social feedback. Finally, we discuss application to human-robot team and network design and next steps with a multirobot testbed.

AB During interactions, system actors may face up misunderstandings when their local states contain inconsistent data about the same fact. Misunderstandings in interactions are likely to reduce interactivity performances (deviation or deadlock) or even affect overall system behavior. In this paper, we characterize misunderstandings in interactions between system actors (that may be human users or system agents) in interactive adaptive systems. To deal with such misunderstandings and ensure state consistency, we present an agent-based architecture and a scenario structuring approach. The system includes several agents devoted to scenario unfolding, plot adaptation and consistency management. Scenario structuring is based on the notion of a situation that is an elementary building block dividing the interactions between systems' actors into contextual scenes. This pattern supports not only scenario execution but consistency management as well. In order to organize and control interactions, the situation contextualizes interactions and activity of the system's actors. It also includes prevention and tolerance agent-based mechanisms to deal with the misunderstandings and their causes. We validate our consistency management mechanisms using Uppaal simulation and provide some experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach on an online distance learning case study.

ID BEHAVIOR; FRAMEWORK
AB Traffic evacuation is a critical task in disaster management. Planning its evacuation in advance requires taking many factors into consideration such as the destination shelter locations and numbers, the number of vehicles to clear, the traffic congestions as well as traffic road configurations. A traffic evacuation simulation tool can provide the emergency managers with the flexibility of exploring various scenarios for identifying more accurate model to plan their evacuation. This paper presents a traffic evacuation simulation system based on integrated multi-level driving-decision models which generate agents' behavior in a unified framework. In this framework, each agent undergoes a Strategic, Cognitive, Tactical and Operational (SCTO) decision process, in order to make a driving decision. An agent's actions are determined by a combination, on each process level, of various existing behavior models widely used in different driving simulation models. A wide spectrum of variability in each agent's decision and driving behaviors, such as in pre-evacuation activities, in choice of route, and in the following or overtaking the car ahead, are represented in the SCTO decision process models to simulate various scenarios. We present the formal model for the agent and the multi-level decision models. A prototype simulation system that reflects the multi-level driving-decision process modeling is developed and implemented. Our SCTO framework is validated by comparing with MATSim tool, and the experimental results of evacuation simulation models are compared with the existing evacuation plan for densely populated Beijing, China in terms of various performance metrics. Our simulation system shows promising results to support emergency managers in designing and evaluating more realistic traffic evacuation plans with multi-level agent's decision models that reflect different levels of individual variability of handling stress situations. The flexible combination of existing behavior and decision models can help generating the best evacuation plan to manage each crisis with unique characteristics, rather than resorting to a fixed evacuation plan.

AB In this paper, a neural network (NN)-based distributed cooperative identification strategy with event-triggered communication is studied for a group of coupled identical nonlinear systems. We develop a distributed cooperative learning law in the context of event-triggered communication, where an agent will transmit its NN weights to its neighbors only when its weight trigger error norm exceeds an exponentially decreasing threshold. It is proven that the estimated weights of all radial basis function NNs converge to a small neighborhood of their optimal values. Therefore, the unknown nonlinear function is approximated along the union of all the system trajectories. It is further proven that there exists a positive minimum interevent interval and Zeno behavior can be avoided. Finally, we give a simulation example to demonstrate these features.

AB Norovirus infection, a highly prevalent condition associated with a high rate of morbidity, comprises a significant health issue. Although norovirus transmission mainly occurs via the fecal-oral and vomit-oral routes, airborne transmission has been proposed in recent decades. This paper re-examines a previously described norovirus outbreak in a hotel restaurant wherein airborne transmission was originally inferred. Specifically, the original evidence that suggested airborne transmission was re-analyzed by exploring an alternative hypothesis: could this outbreak instead have occurred via fomite transmission? This re-analysis was based on whether fomite transmission could have yielded similar attack rate distribution patterns. Seven representative serving pathways used by waiters were considered, and the infection risk distributions of the alternative fomite transmission routes were predicted using a multi-agent model. These distributions were compared to the reported attack rate distribution in the original study using a least square methods approach. The results show that with some reasonable assumptions of human behavior patterns and parameter values, the attack rate distribution corresponded well with that of the infection risk via the fomite route. This finding offers an alternative interpretation of the transmission routes that underlay this particular norovirus outbreak and an important consideration in the development of infection control guidelines and the investigation of similar norovirus outbreaks in future.

AB In individual-centered simulations, the variety and consistency of agents' behaviors reinforce the realism and validity of the simulation. Variety increases the diversity of behaviors that users meet during the simulation. Consistency ensures that these behaviors improve the users' feeling of immersion. In this work, we address the issue of the simultaneous influence of these two elements. We propose a formalization of the construction of populations for agent-based simulations, which provides the basis for a generic and non-intrusive tool allowing an out-of-the-agent design. First, the model uses behavioral patterns to describe standards of behaviors for the agents. They provide a behavioral archetype during agents' creation, and are also a compliance reference, that allows to detect deviant behaviors and address them. Then, a specific process instantiates the agents by using the specification provided by the patterns. Finally, inference enables to automate behavioral patterns configuration from real or simulated data. This formalization allows for the easy introduction of variety in agents' behaviors, while controlling the conformity to specifications. We applied the model to traffic simulation, in order to introduce driving styles specified using behavioral patterns (e.g. cautious or aggressive drivers). The behavioral realism of the traffic was therefore improved, and the experimentations we conducted show how the model contributes to increase the variety and the representativeness of the behaviors.

AB In this paper, we investigate the interactions among oligarchs, political parties, and voters using an agent-based modeling approach. We introduce the OLIGO model, which is based on the spatial model of democracy, where voters have positions in a policy space and vote for the party that appears closest to them, and parties move in policy space to seek more votes. We extend the existing literature on agent-based models of political economy in the following manner: (1) by introducing a new class of agents - oligarchs - that represent leaders of firms in a common industry who lobby for beneficial subsidies through campaign donations; and (2) by investigating the effects of ideological preferences of the oligarchs on legislative action. We test hypotheses from the literature in political economics on the behavior of oligarchs and political parties as they interact, under conditions of imperfect information and bounded rationality. Our key results indicate that (1) oligarchs tend to donate less to political campaigns when the parties are more resistant to changing their policies, or when voters are more informed; and (2) if Oligarchs donate to parties based on a combination of ideological and profit motivations, Oligarchs will tend to donate at a lower equilibrium level, due to the influence of lost profits. We validate these outcomes via comparisons to real world polling data on changes in party support over time.

AB The effect of an outage caused by a disaster is serious to a society, because power distribution lines are a common basic infrastructure for life support. Time estimation of the emergency restoration of power distribution lines after a disaster is an emerging problem for the safety and security of the society. But time estimation is a difficult problem and the only practical method in use is a simple approximation method, which does not take account of the geographical characteristics of the target area. Thus we have developed a method which can take account of the how the geographical features of the target area affect the estimation of emergency restoration time. In this paper we describe an experimental analysis using the method. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Electr Eng Jpn, 187(1): 33-41, 2014; Published online in Wiley Online Library ().

AB We introduce a simple model for simulating financial markets, based on an order book, in which several agents trade one asset at a virtual exchange continuously. For a stationary market the structure of the model, the order flow rates of the different kinds of order types and the used price time priority matching algorithm produce only a diffusive price behavior. We show that a market trend, i.e. an asymmetric order flow of any type, leads to a non-trivial Hurst exponent for the price development, but not to "fat-tailed" return distributions. When one additionally couples the order entry depth to the prevailing trend, also the stylized empirical fact of "fat tails" can be reproduced by our Order Book Model.

AB This paper addresses the leader follower flocking problem with a moving leader for networked Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainties under a proximity graph. Here a group of followers move cohesively with the moving leader to maintain connectivity and avoid collisions for all time and also eventually achieve velocity matching. In the proximity graph, the neighbor relationship is defined according to the relative distance between each pair of agents. Each follower is able to obtain information from only the neighbors in its proximity, involving only local interaction. We consider two cases: (i) the leader moves with a constant velocity, and (ii) the leader moves with a varying velocity. In the first case, a distributed continuous adaptive control algorithm accounting for unknown parameters is proposed in combination with a distributed continuous estimator for each follower. In the second case, a distributed discontinuous adaptive control algorithm and estimator are proposed. Then the algorithm is extended to be fully distributed with the introduction of gain adaptation laws. In all proposed algorithms, only one hop neighbors' information (e.g., the relative position and velocity measurements between the neighbors and the absolute position and velocity measurements) is required, and flocking is achieved as long as the connectivity and collision avoidance are ensured at the initial time and the control gains are designed properly. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study the circle formation problem for a group of anonymous mobile agents in a plane, in which the agents are required to converge onto a circle with a preset target as the center, as well as to maintain the desired relative positions when rotating around the target at the same speed. Each agent is modeled as a kinematic point and can merely perceive the relative positions of the target and its limited neighbors. In order to solve the circle formation problem, a limit-cycle-based decoupled-design approach is delivered. We divide the overall control objective into two subobjectives, where the first is target circling that all agents converge onto the circle around the target, and the second is spacing adjustment that each agent maintains the desired distance from its neighbors. Then, we propose to use a controller comprised of converging part and layout part to deal with these two subobjectives, respectively. The former part is based on a limit-cycle oscillator using only the relative position from the target, and the latter is designed by also perceiving the relative position from the agent's neighbors. An important feature of the controller is that it guarantees that no collision between agents ever takes place throughout the system's evolution. Another feature is that some of the parameters in the proposed controller have explicit physical meanings related to the agents' rotating motion around the target, so that they can be set more reasonable and easily in real applications. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed circle formation controller.

AB Psychological research practices are often prone to individualistic biases, emphasizing individual-level mechanisms of attitudes, behaviour, and persuasion, while neglecting the dynamics of communication in social networks. We illustrate with our InnoMind simulation model how agent-based modeling as a research method can account for the multi-level interactions between information processing in individual brains and flows of information in societies. InnoMind is based on theories of emotional cognition from cognitive science, theories of attitudes and persuasion from social psychology, and theories of social networks from sociology. In a case study, we show how the model can be used to address practical research questions in environmental psychology: We describe computer simulations with InnoMind that can serve as ex-ante evaluations of suitable campaign strategies for the promotion of carsharing as an innovative means of sustainable urban transportation. We discuss how empirical/experimental versus computational/theoretical research strategies in environmental psychology can and should be regarded as mutually informative. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper addresses the learning control problem for a group of robot manipulators with homogeneous nonlinear uncertain dynamics, where all the robots have an identical system structure but the reference signals to be tracked differ. The control objective is twofold: to track on reference trajectories and to learn/identify uncertain dynamics. For this purpose, deterministic learning theory is combined with consensus theory to find a common neural network (NN) approximation of the nonlinear uncertain dynamics for a multi-robot system. Specifically, we first present a control scheme called cooperative deterministic learning using adaptive NNs to enable the robotic agents to track their respective reference trajectories on one hand and to exchange their estimated NN weights online through networked communication on the other. As a result, a consensus about one common NN approximation for the nonlinear uncertain dynamics is achieved for all the agents. Thus, the trained distributed NNs have a better generalization capability than those obtained by existing techniques. By virtue of the convergence of partial NN weights to their ideal values under the proposed scheme, the cooperatively learned knowledge can be stored/represented by NNs with constant/converged weights, so that it can be used to improve the tracking control performance without re-adaptation. Numerical simulations of a team of two-degree-of-freedom robot manipulators were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB The rapid expansion of enterprises makes product collaborative design (PCD) a critical issue under the distributed heterogeneous environment, but as the collaborative task of large-scale network becomes more complicated, neither unified task decomposition and allocation methodology nor Agent-based network management platform can satisfy the increasing demands. In this paper, to meet requirements of PCD for distributed product development, a collaborative design mechanism based on the thought of modularity and the Agent technology is presented. First, the top-down 4-tier process model based on task-oriented modular and Agent is constructed for PCD after analyzing the mapping relationships between requirements and functions in the collaborative design. Second, on basis of sub-task decomposition for PCD based on a mixed method, the mathematic model of task-oriented modular based on multi-objective optimization is established to maximize the module cohesion degree and minimize the module coupling degree, while considering the module executable degree as a restriction. The mathematic model is optimized and simulated by the modified PSO, and the decomposed modules are obtained. Finally, the Agent structure model for collaborative design is put forward, and the optimism matching Agents are selected by using similarity algorithm to implement different task-modules by the integrated reasoning and decision-making mechanism with the behavioral model of collaborative design Agents. With the results of experimental studies for automobile collaborative design, the feasibility and efficiency of this methodology of task-oriented modular and Agent-based collaborative design in the distributed heterogeneous environment are verified. On this basis, an integrative automobile collaborative R&D platform is developed. This research provides an effective platform for automobile manufacturing enterprises to achieve PCD, and helps to promote product numeralization collaborative R&D and management development.

AB When managing a global supply chain, one critical challenge encountered by multinational enterprises (MNEs) is the extension of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices to suppliers in emerging countries. In this study, we use a multi-method approach to explore 1) the nature of suppliers' CSR heterogeneity based on the various components of CSR in emerging countries, and 2) the choices of MNEs for extending CSR to different types of suppliers in dynamic environments. We begin with a survey of Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) servicing MNEs to examine how these suppliers vary in CSR implementation based on cluster analysis results. To understand the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR to their OEM suppliers, we conduct an agent-based simulation study considering the dynamics of a system with multiple agents (i.e., MNE buyers, OEM suppliers, and the government). The cluster analysis results show that CSR practices implemented by Chinese OEMs differ significantly from one another and can be classified into three clusters (i.e., Leader, Follower, and Laggard). The simulation results provide insights into how the adaption costs (e.g., upgrade cost and cost saved by downgrading) and punitive (inspection with possible penalties) and supportive (subsidies) tactics adopted by the government affect the choices made by MNE buyers for extending CSR practices to suppliers in emerging countries. Moreover, we demonstrate when supportive tactics are more effective than punitive tactics under varying conditions and extend the model to investigate the consequences of switching between these two types of tactics in a sequential simulation.

AB Seasonal climate outlooks provide one tool to help decision-makers allocate resources in anticipation of poor, fair or good seasons. The aim of the 'Climate Outlooks and Agent-Based Simulation of Adaptation in South Africa' project has been to investigate whether individuals, who adapt gradually to annual climate variability, are better equipped to respond to longer-term climate variability and change in a sustainable manner. Seasonal climate outlooks provide information on expected annual rainfall and thus can be used to adjust seasonal agricultural strategies to respond to expected climate conditions. A case study of smallholder farmers in a village in Vhembe district, Limpopo Province, South Africa has been used to examine how such climate outlooks might influence agricultural strategies and how this climate information can be improved to be more useful to farmers. Empirical field data has been collected using surveys, participatory approaches and computer-based knowledge elicitation tools to investigate the drivers of decision-making with a focus on the role of climate, market and livelihood needs. This data is used in an agent-based social simulation which incorporates household agents with varying adaptation options which result in differing impacts on crop yields and thus food security, as a result of using or ignoring the seasonal outlook. Key variables are the skill of the forecast, the social communication of the forecast and the range of available household and community-based risk coping strategies. This research provides a novel approach for exploring adaptation within the context of climate change.

AB The current state in research of economic systems is characterised by two prevailing issues. Firstly, study of economic systems is traditionally based on analytical and econometric tools, which have been the main arbiters of the veracity or plausibility of assumptions and hypotheses in economics. This approach has been proved to be highly suitable for theory development. Secondly, practical issues and necessity to support decision-making led to development of various modelling and simulation techniques or tools. However; majority of these approaches usually fail when coping with complexity. Furthermore, several main areas of interest can be identified in the business and economics modelling. Nevertheless, these areas are mostly independent due to their problem-based focusing on particular issues and their solutions. Depicted gaps might be bridged with the help of new modelling paradigms that have been established only recently. Application of agent-based modelling in the realm of economic systems is labelled as Agent-based Computational Economics (ACE). In particular sections of this paper results of experiments run on the novel model are described. The model is based on agents, which are described as a vector of several observed parameters, and four types of agents are used, namely consumer agent, factory agent, mining agent, and transportation agent. In addition, a colony is added as the fifth type of meta-agent. Scalability and configuration options of the model enable for various configuration and thus for conducting specific experiments. The presented system is already implemented as a prototype version in the NetLogo environment. The paper depicts two example scenarios, resource production and resource proximity, and offers interpretation of achieved results. Since most of the work done so far was focused on individual agents, group perspective as an important extension of ACE modelling is suggested as the further research and development direction.

ID MODEL; SIMULATION
AB Background: Biological environment is uncertain and its dynamic is similar to the multiagent environment, thus the research results of the multiagent system area can provide valuable insights to the understanding of biology and are of great significance for the study of biology. Learning in a multiagent environment is highly dynamic since the environment is not stationary anymore and each agent's behavior changes adaptively in response to other coexisting learners, and vice versa. The dynamics becomes more unpredictable when we move from fixed-agent interaction environments to multiagent social learning framework. Analytical understanding of the underlying dynamics is important and challenging.
   Results: In this work, we present a social learning framework with homogeneous learners (e.g., Policy Hill Climbing (PHC) learners), and model the behavior of players in the social learning framework as a hybrid dynamical system. By analyzing the dynamical system, we obtain some conditions about convergence or non-convergence. We experimentally verify the predictive power of our model using a number of representative games. Experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis.
   Conclusion: Under multiagent social learning framework, we modeled the behavior of agent in biologic environment, and theoretically analyzed the dynamics of the model. We present some sufficient conditions about convergence or non-convergence and prove them theoretically. It can be used to predict the convergence of the system.

AB A central-local dual governance system is the basic system of environmental governance in China. Co-governance between the central environmental protection department (CEPD) and local environmental protection departments (LEPDs) is an important means to effectively promote China's carbon emission reduction strategy. Accordingly, this paper discusses their interactive decision-making and investigates how to optimize the strategic relationships between the CEPD, LEPDs, and carbon emission enterprises (CEEs) under the dual governance system by constructing a trilateral evolutionary game model and analyzing evolutionary stability strategies, achieving a numerical experiment simulation of evolution processes and determining the impacts of various factors using MATLAB, leading to several countermeasures and suggestions. The results indicate that the CEPD should rationally use the incentive mechanism for LEPDs, improve the carbon tax system, and further penalize the nepotistic relationship of LEPDs and CEEs. Furthermore, it is essential to reform the current LEPD performance evaluation system and reduce the cost of LEPD positive regulation through subsidies and financial transfer payments. Additionally, the CEE strategy is affected by carbon reduction tax rates, penalties, subsides, and emission reduction costs and revenues. This study reveals the consequences of interactions between CEPD, LEPDs, and CEEs and presents options for the redesign of incentive and regulatory mechanisms to improve carbon emission reduction performance in China.

AB We analyze income tax evasion dynamics in a standard model of statistical mechanics, the Ising model of ferromagnetism. However, in contrast to previous research, we use an inhomogeneous multi-dimensional Ising model where the local degrees of freedom (agents) are subject to a specific social temperature and coupled to external fields which govern their social behavior. This new modeling frame allows for analyzing large societies of four different and interacting agent types. As a second novelty, our model may reproduce results from agent-based models that incorporate standard Allingham and Sandrno tax evasion features as well as results from existing two-dimensional Ising based tax evasion models. In this way, such kind of models may become more relevant and useful in economics as well as social psychology. We finally use our model for analyzing income tax evasion dynamics under different enforcement scenarios and point to some policy implications that may also be of interest for psychological research on tax compliance.

AB Emerging efficient and intelligent behaviors from co-operative activities of many autonomous agents comprise unexpected events that often take place inside animal social organizations. This type of evidence induced artificial intelligence researchers to re-design the artificial computing system architectures, from monolithic and hierarchical structures toward networked and component distributed environments. In this work the co-operative capacity of three different software agents is experimented to front the management problem, emerging during fires emergencies, relative to fire-proof resources optimization and dangerous products evacuation inside large oil storage and production plants. The three software components include, respectively, a repository or memory of past solutions (managed by case-based reasoning methods), the capacity to discovery new solutions (using evolutionary algorithms), and the capacity to verify solutions (using numerical simulation models). The main result of the work was that, from the co-operative activities of these three software components, together with the human agent, the capacity to learn and adapt solutions for the current problem arises as a proper and additional feature of such hybrid system. The general problem of anti-fire resources optimization and evacuation of risk products, during fire emergencies, inside a petrol-chemical plant, is firstly described. Then, the models and the software algorithms, implemented in the three mentioned components, are illustrated in the central part of the work. Finally, a set of test cases are reported, for different scenarios in the physical domain, experimented and analyzed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Questions about the changes of biological systems in response to hostile environmental factors are important but not easy to answer. Often, the traditional description with differential equations is difficult due to the overwhelming complexity of the living systems. Another way to describe complex systems is by simulating them with phenomenological models such as the well-known evolutionary agent-based model (EABM). Here we developed an EABM to simulate cell colonies as a multi-agent system that adapts to hyper-gravity in starvation conditions. In the model, the cell's heritable characteristics are generated and transferred randomly to offspring cells. After a qualitative validation of the model at normal gravity, we simulate cellular growth in hyper-gravity conditions. The obtained data are consistent with previously confirmed theoretical and experimental findings for bacterial behavior in environmental changes, including the experimental data from the microgravity Atlantis and the Hypergravity 3000 experiments. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to utilize an EABM with realistic qualitative description to examine the effects of hypergravity and starvation on complex cellular entities.

DE web crawling; focused crawling; multi-agent system; semantic web
AB Web crawling has become an important aspect of web search, as the WWW keeps getting bigger and search engines strive to index the most important and up to date content. Many experimental approaches exist, but few actually try to model the current behaviour of search engines, which is to crawl and refresh the sites they deem as important, much more frequently than others. BioCrawler mirrors this behaviour on the semantic web, by applying the learning strategies adopted in previous work on ecosystem simulation, called BioTope. BioCrawler employs the principles of BioTope's intelligent agents on the semantic web, learns which sites are rich in semantic content and which sites link to them and adjusts its crawling habits accordingly. In the end, it learns to behave much like the state of the art search engine crawlers do. However, BioCrawler reaches that behavior solely by exploiting on-page factors, rather than off-page factors, such as the currently used link popularity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper addresses a novel approach for multi-agent control systems including Unmanned Vehicles (UV). As UV technology advances, one or a group of UVs can be used in a wide range of industrial or military applications. Centralized monitoring has limitations on various resources (e.g. communication bandwidth, propagation delay, and computational power), but can lead to an optimal solution to the movement of the swarm. The artificial potential field (APF) method is well-known for modeling decentralized behavior, but most APF research only focuses on naive actions such as collision avoidance, flocking, or path planning. In our proposed design Versatile Multi-Vehicle Control System (VMCS), we defined high-level conditions as APF and let UVs perform swarm intelligence in various mission environments. Furthermore, we devised a novel algorithm that controls the UVs' APF topology which can significantly enhance the mission efficiency. We simulated the VMCS in 3D space and showed our scheme can control the dynamic mission scenarios for multi-UV systems.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze and access the extent that emotion contagion (EC) affects the passenger aggressive behavior, and then reveal key factors triggering the passenger mass violence event (MVE) under an irregular flight situation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the group behaviors simulation framework based on multi-agent. The EC model is put forward to explore the EC effect among passengers, integrating the influence of intervention measures, power difference and intimacy. Moreover, the authors propose the aggressive behavior decision-making model tailed to the passenger MVE by combining the improved social force model and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system.
   Findings - The experiment results show that the method proposed in this paper can simulate the realistic evolution process of passenger MVE. The EC effect among passengers is the catalyst for the quick spreading of MVE. The intervention measures, such as providing food and endorsing service, can effectively prevent from the MVE situation deterioration.
   Originality/value - The research of this paper has important practical significance for the evolution analysis of passenger MVE and provides the basis for airport safety management.

AB Humans are unusual in having stable male-female breeding bonds within multi-level societies. Such societies are not found in other apes, but have evolved independently in other primates, including several African papionins: hamadryas and Guinea baboons and gelada monkeys. Stable breeding bonds have been proposed to evolve either (1) because males can monopolize females when food distribution forces females to forage in small groups or (2) because females exchange exclusive mating for male services, such as protection from infanticide. Comparative studies are needed to test these hypotheses. In the meantime, we used an agent-based computer model to test the plausibility of these hypotheses. We simulated primates living in social groups within a larger population using a model we call BEGET (Behavior, Ecology, Genetics, Evolution, and Tradeoffs), which employed decision vectors, experimental evolution, realistic trade-offs, and phenotypic plasticity. We employed experimental evolution to generate male genotypes that varied in their competitive ability and in their long-term mating strategy. "Rover" males searched for and mated with any sexually receptive females whereas "Loyalist" males formed stable associations with particular groups of females. Much like living primates, the virtual primates exhibited tradeoffs between contest and scramble competition for access to females: Loyalists evolved larger body size than Rovers. We tested the effect of female foraging group size and the presence of infanticide and infant protection on the relative success of these strategies. We found that Loyalists achieved greater reproductive success than Rovers only when females were in groups smaller than four. Both Rovers and Loyalists sometimes evolved infanticidal behavior, but the presence of infanticide benefited Rovers rather than Loyalists, suggesting that the evolution of stable breeding bonds depends on the spatial distribution of females, rather than the risk of infanticide.

ID EVOLUTION
AB The puzzle of origins and future of government and social complexity in human and social dynamics, arguably a characteristic feature of the emergence and long-term evolution of hierarchy and power in the history of civilizations, is an enduring topic that has challenged political scientists, anthropological archaeologists, and other social scientists and historians. This paper proposes a new computational theory for the emergence of social complexity that accounts for the earliest formation of systems of government ( pristine polities) in prehistory and early antiquity, as well as present and future political development. This general social theory is based on a "fast process'' of crisis and opportunistic decision-making through collective action, which feeds a "slow'' process of political development or decay. The "fast'' core iterative process is "canonical'' in the sense that it undergoes variations on a recurring theme of signal detection, information-processing, problem-solving, successful adaptation and occasional failure. When a group is successful in managing or overcoming serious situational changes ( stresses or opportunities, endogenous or exogenous, social or physical) a probabilistic phase transition may occur, under a specified set of conditions, yielding a long-term ( slow) probabilistic accrual process of emergent sociopolitical complexity and development. A reverse process may account for decay. The canonical theory is being formally implemented through the "PoliGen'' agent-based model ( ABM), based on the new Multi-Agent Simulator of Networks and Neighborhoods ( MASON). Empirically, the theory is testable with the datasets on polities developed by the Long-Range Analysis of War (LORANOW) Project. This paper focuses on the concepts, mechanisms, and basic formal structure that constitute the canonical theory and inform the subsequent simulation model.

AB Empirical findings point out that the scaling and multiscaling properties can be found in many dealer markets. But how do these properties emerge from these financial markets? What are the dynamical causes for these nonlinear properties? Are they the results of random perturbations, or of the intrinsic characteristics of the markets? To answer these questions, first of all, I proposed a minimally structured agent-based model of a dealer market, and then conducted many experiments under several scenarios. This artificial financial market is occupied with heterogeneous agents characterized with bounded rationality and heterogeneity, and a dealer who is responsible for market liquidity and supply-demand balance. By means of simulations based on different scenarios, trading time series (prices, volumes, volatilities, etc) are generated and then are analyzed by Multi-Fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). Interestingly, the generated price series display scaling and multiscaling features, which is consistent with empirical findings in the real markets. Furthermore, the plausible explanation for these properties is nonlinear temporal correlation instead of probability distribution after the series are shuffled and phase randomized. All of the results imply that these properties of nonlinearity may derive from market participants' heterogeneity and mutual interactions; thereby, they may be the underlying characteristics of dealer markets.

AB Electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles are becoming promising for on-demand air transportation in urban air mobility (UAM). However, successfully bringing such vehicles and airspace operations to fruition will require introducing orders of magnitude more aircraft to a given airspace volume. Although there are existing solutions for communication technology, onboard computing capability, and sensor technology, the computation guidance algorithm to enable safe, efficient, and scalable flight operations for dense self-organizing air traffic still remains an open question. In this paper, a message-based decentralized computational guidance algorithm is proposed and analyzed for multiple cooperative aircraft by formulating this problem using multi-agent Markov decision process and solving it by Monte Carlo tree search algorithm. A novel coordination strategy is introduced by using the logit level-kmodel in behavioral game theory. To achieve higher scalability, the airspace sector concept is introduced into the UAM environment by dividing the airspace into sectors, so that each aircraft only needs to coordinate with aircraft in the same sector. At each decision step, all of the aircraft will run the proposed computational guidance algorithm onboard, which can guide all the aircraft to their respective destinations while avoiding potential conflicts among them. For validation and demonstration, a free-flight airspace simulator that incorporates environment uncertainty is built in an OpenAI Gym environment. Numerical experiment results over several case studies, including the roundabout test problem, show that the proposed computational guidance algorithm has promising performance even with the high-density air traffic case.

AB Designing and evaluating energy policies is a difficult challenge because the energy sector is a complex system that cannot be adequately understood without using models merging economic, social and individual perspectives. Appropriate models allow policy makers to assess the impact of policy measures, satisfy strategic objectives and develop sustainable policies. Often the implementation of a policy cannot be directly enforced by governments, but falls back to many stakeholders, such as private citizens and enterprises. We propose to integrate two basic cornerstones to devise realistic models: the self-reported behaviour, derived from surveys, and the observed behaviour, from historical data. The self-reported behaviour enables the identification of drivers and barriers pushing or limiting people in their decision making process, while the observed behaviour is used to tune these drivers/barriers in a model. We test our methodology on a case-study: the adoption of photovoltaic panels among private citizens in the Emilia-Romagna region, Italy. We propose an agent-based model devised using self-reported data and then empirically tuned using historical data. The results reveal that our model can predict with great accuracy the photovoltaic (PV) adoption rate and thus support the energy policy-making process.

AB Understanding the nature of consciousness is one of the grand outstanding scientific challenges. The fundamental methodological problem is how phenomenal first person experience can be accounted for in a third person verifiable form, while the conceptual challenge is to both define its function and physical realization. The distributed adaptive control theory of consciousness (DACtoc) proposes answers to these three challenges. The methodological challenge is answered relative to the hard problem and DACtoc proposes that it can be addressed using a convergent synthetic methodology using the analysis of synthetic biologically grounded agents, or quale parsing. DACtoc hypothesizes that consciousness in both its primary and secondary forms serves the ability to deal with the hidden states of the world and emerged during the Cambrian period, affording stable multi-agent environments to emerge. The process of consciousness is an autonomous virtualization memory, which serializes and unifies the parallel and subconscious simulations of the hidden states of the world that are largely due to other agents and the self with the objective to extract norms. These norms are in turn projected as value onto the parallel simulation and control systems that are driving action. This functional hypothesis is mapped onto the brainstem, midbrain and the thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical systems and analysed with respect to our understanding of deficits of consciousness. Subsequently, some of the implications and predictions of DACtoc are outlined, in particular, the prediction that normative bootstrapping of conscious agents is predicated on an intentionality prior. In the view advanced here, human consciousness constitutes the ultimate evolutionary transition by allowing agents to become autonomous with respect to their evolutionary priors leading to a post-biological Anthropocene.
   This article is part of the themed issue 'The major synthetic evolutionary transitions'.

AB Various different types of collective motions have attracted attention from physicists; this is a fascinating phenomenon, resulting from the very simple interactions between individuals (particles/cells). Our aim is to contribute to elucidating the motion of collective behavior of a non-equilibrium multi-agent system. In this context, the topic of this manuscript is to study the effect of the zone of orientation on the collective motion in two-dimensional space. In this investigation, we extend the model suggested by Viscek et al. for only a single interaction radius. In our proposed model, the particles corresponding to agents locally interacting with their neighbors according to simple rules depending on the particular condition. At each time step the velocity of an agent depends on their direction and is perturbed by an external noise.. Particularly, we show that with a specific fixed parameter a phase transition can be achieved, from disordered motion of particles to ordered motion, by varying the radius of orientation R-2 and the value of the density. Furthermore, the value of R-2 at which the transition emerges depends strongly on the size of repulsion zone R-1. The study is performed over different situations via a numerical simulation technique. Implications of these findings are discussed in the section of simulation results.

AB Against the background of the distributed innovation network, collaborative innovation among new energy technology firms is the most crucial network link. The process of collaborative R&D involves significant data exchange and knowledge management across firm boundaries. Moreover, the context(refers to the strategic context,the cultural context, the institutional context and the network context) of new energy technology firms in the network and the R&D among these firms massively impact overall knowledge emergence in the network. In order to explore the optimal knowledge growth process among new energy technology firms in the distributed network, the influence of collaborative context and collaborative behavior vis-a-vis knowledge growth was discussed in this study based on the features of multi-agent technology from the perspective of collaborative R&D among the firms. On the basis of a theoretical deduction and empirical test, the model of behavioral interaction among multiple agents was built and the simulation applied to the model via the Netlogo platform. The results show that, in a single cycle, the collaborative context exerts a positive impact on knowledge growth among new energy technology firms. However, certain differences exist. Such as the fact that the promotional effect of knowledge sharing visa-vis collaborative behavior on knowledge growth decreases as the difference in knowledge potential among firms in the network decreases,until it disappears. Moreover, when the new energy technology firms with a high knowledge potential cease diffusing knowledge, knowledge growth in the whole network stagnates. If there is no information sharing among new energy technology firms in the network, then the collaboration between them may collapse. Specific asset investment plays a positive role in the promotion of knowledge spillover and knowledge diffusion among the firms, while also facilitating knowledge growth among new energy technology firms and improving collaborative efficiency.

AB In this paper, we report on the construction of a new framework for simulating mixed traffic consisting of cars, trams, and pedestrians that can be used to support discussions about road management, signal control, and public transit. Specifically, a layered road structure that was designed for car traffic simulations was extended to interact with an existing one-dimensional (1D) car-following model and a two-dimensional (2D) discrete choice model for pedestrians. The car model, pedestrian model, and interaction rules implemented in the proposed framework were verified through simulations involving simple road environments. The resulting simulated values were in near agreement with the empirical data. We then used the proposed framework to assess the impact of a tramway extension plan for a real city. The simulation results showed that the impact of the proposed tramway on existing car traffic would not be serious, and by extension, implied that the proposed framework could help stakeholders decide on expansion scenarios that are satisfactory to both tram users and private car owners.

AB The recent advances in technology sectors often clash with traditional organizational paradigms which can limit or make difficult an efficient implementation in the real world. In this paper we show how it is possible to exploit the advantages of innovative technologies in manufacturing when these are supported by new and efficient methods for production management. More in details, we face a flow shop scheduling problem in a shoe manufacturing system in which overtaking of jobs is allowed thanks to an innovative transportation system. Overtaking means that a job can be put in waiting state and another job can surpass it, allowing the change of the scheduling sequence. Preemption is not allowed. The objective function of the problem is the minimization of the maximum lateness. We propose a decentralized model, based on multi-agent system theory, to represent the production cells of the plant and to include the potentiality offered by overtaking of jobs at decisional level. The adoption of a decentralized approach increases the system flexibility since each machine is able to solve its local scheduling problem. Adding or removing machines to the plant will not imply a change in the scheduling algorithms. The outcomes of this work are reached firstly through a formulation of the problem with three flow shop scheduling models, secondly through a comparison of the models with respect to different performance indicators. The results highlight as the decentralized approach is able to reach comparable performances with the centralized one for a relevant number of instances. Moreover sensitivity analysis shows as in the decentralized model the computational time required to solve bigger instances increases less quickly than in the case of centralized ones. Finally, simulations of the decentralized approach clarify as the correlation of the local solution procedure is effected by the number of machines of the flow shop and the coordination mechanism is effected by the number of the jobs to be scheduled.

AB Logistics are a key factor for manufacturing companies in developed countries to better exploit their competitive advantages of proximity to market and flexibility. In order to improve the management of a logistics/distribution center, this paper proposes the use of control methods based on Multi-Agent Systems enhanced with Radio-Frequency Identification. However, the best way to demonstrate the benefits of using these solutions, is to apply them to a real company; but, naturally, this is impractical. In this paper, an experimental platform composed of a 3D simulation combined with a physical miniature model is used to illustrate the proposed control methods. The set-up described here has been assembled in the AUTOLOG laboratory at the University of Castilla-La Mancha in Spain. The design of the platform is somewhat generic, allowing adaptation to different distribution problems, but has been inspired on a real local facility. The objective of this system is to provide a test-bench to experiment with multidisciplinary theories, techniques, and algorithms that can be grouped into four areas: automation and robotics, instrumentation and control, production planning, and logistics and distribution.

AB Agents interaction about reputation has to deal with semantic interoperability issues, which can be handled by different approaches using different levels of expressiveness. Previous experiments have already been conducted in order to investigate the effects of a more expressive communication language on agents' reputation evaluation accuracy, but their analyses disregard the possible correlations among reputation models' attributes. Here, we propose the use of a multivariate statistical approach in order to take into account such correlations and to encourage the social simulation community to analyze its experimental outputs using formal mathematical approaches. We also applied the presented approach to the experimental results previously analyzed using a univariate statistical approach. Our analysis corroborate with the latter showing that, in most cases, there is benefit in using a more expressive communication language.

AB Assessment of future socio-ecological consequences of land-use policies is useful for supporting decisions about what and where to invest for the best overall environmental and developmental outcomes However, the task faces a great challenge due to the inherent complexity of coupled human-landscape systems and the long-term perspective required for sustainability assessment. Multi-agent system models have been recognized to be well suited to express the co-evolutions of the human and landscape systems in response to policy interventions. This paper applies the Land Use Dynamics Simulator (LUDAS) framework presented by Le et al [Ecological Informatics 3 (2008) 135] a mountain watershed in central Vietnam for supporting the design of land-use policies that enhance environmental and socio-economical benefits in long term With an exploratory modelling strategy for complex integrated systems, our purpose is to assess relative impacts of policy interventions by measuring the long-term landscape and community divergences (compared with a baseline) driven from the widest plausible range of options for a given policy Model's tests include empirical verification and validation of sub-models, rational evaluation of coupled model's structure, and behaviour tests using sensitivity/uncertainty analyses. We design experiments of replicated simulations for relevant policy factors in the study region that include (i) forest protection zoning, (ii) agricultural extension and (iii) agrochemical subsidies As expected, the stronger human-environment interactions the performance indicators involve, the more uncertain the indicators are. Similar to the findings globally summarised by Liu et al [Science 317 (2007) 1513], time lags between the implementation of land-use policies and the appearance of socio-ecological consequences are observed in our case. Long-term legacies are found in the responses of the total cropping area, farm size and income distribution to changes in forest protection zoning, implying that impact assessment of nature conservation policies on rural livelihoods must be considered in multiple decades Our comparative assessment of alternative future socio-ecological scenarios shows that it is challenging to attain better either household income or forest conservation by straightforward expanding the current agricultural extensions and subsidy schemes without improving the qualities of the services The results also suggest that the policy intervention that strengthens the enforcement of forest protection in the critical areas of the watershed and simultaneously create incentives and opportunities for agricultural production in the less critical areas will likely promote forest restoration and community income in long run We also discuss limitations of the simulation model and recommend future directions for model development.

DE personality; reorganizing process; attitude fluctuation; computer
   simulation; operational organization orientation
AB According to the hypothesis of bounded rationality, there is no best approach for a reorganizing process due to the cognitive limit of organizational members. However, the reorganizing process can be successfully described in our model employing their attitude changes, in that the attitude change of personalistic agent causes a change of organizational behavioral pattern due to the attitude fluctuation.
   A multi-agent model based on a personalistic agent is developed to describe the reorganizing process in an organization with respect to an organizational performance and its environmental adaptation. A computer simulation is to employ to describe the reorganizing process, because the process must be difficult to deal with an empirical method due to the complexity. We also propose the approach as an operational organizational oriented approach, and discuss a methodological possibility of our approach.
   The attitude fluctuations in the reorganizing process are formulated in the model employing a concept of achievement motivation theory in psychology and of a differential engine proposed by Minsky. The personalistic agent consists of a task stickness, an emotion of interpersonal attractiveness, and of a conservativeness as variables.
   In conclusion, we may provide a mechanism of reorganizing and organizational rigidity as a mechanism of a positive and negative feedback loop mediated by the personality and the attitude fluctuations of organizational members.

AB We consider the problem of how two heterogeneous robots can arrange to meet in an unknown environment from unknown starting locations: that is, the problem of arranging a robot rendezvous. We are interested, in particular, in allowing two robots to rendezvous so that they can collaboratively explore an unknown environment. Specifically, we address the problem of how a pair of exploring agents that cannot communicate with one another over long distances can meet if they start exploring at different unknown locations in an unknown environment.
   We propose several alternative algorithms that robots could use in attempting to rendezvous quickly while continuing to explore. These algorithms exemplify different classes of strategy whose relative suitability depends on characteristics of the problem definition. We consider the performance of our proposed algorithms analytically with respect to both expected- and worst-case behavior. We then examine their behavior under a wider set of conditions using both numerical analysis and also a simulation of multi-agent exploration and rendezvous. We examine the exploration speed, and show that a multi-robot system can explore an unknown environment faster than a single-agent system, even with the constraint of performing rendezvous to allow communication.
   We conclude with a demonstration of rendezvous implemented on a pair of actual robots.

AB Our everyday lives and specially our commercial transactions involve complex negotiations that incorporate decision-making in a multi-issue setting under utility constraints. Negotiation and a key stage in all commercial transactions has been proliferated by applying decision support facilities that AI techniques provide. Recently, Distributed Artificial Intelligence techniques have been evolved towards multi-agent systems, (MASs) where each agent is,in intelligent system that solves a specific problem. Incorporating MAS into e-commerce negotiation and bargaining has brought even more potential improvement. in efficiency and effectiveness of business systems by automating several of the most time consuming and repetitive stages of the buying process. In bargaining, participants with opposing interests communicate and try to find mutually beneficial agreements by exchanging compromising proposals. However. recent studies on commercial bargaining and negotiation in MASs lack a personality model. Indeed, adding personality to intelligent agents makes them more human-like and increases their flexibility.
   We investigate the role of personality behaviors of participants in multi-criteria bilateral bargaining in a single-good e-marketplace, where both parties are OCEAN agents based oil the five-factor (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion. Agreeableness. and Negative emotions) model of personality. We do not aim to determine strategies that humans should use in negotiation. but to present a more human-like model to enhance the realism of rational bargaining behavior in MASs. First, this study presents a computational approach based oil a heuristic bargaining protocol and a personality model, and second, considers the issue of what personality traits and behaviors should be investigated in relation to automated negotiations. We show the results obtained via the simulation on artificial stereotypes. The results suggest and model compound personality style behaviors appropriate to gain the best overall utility in the role of buyer and seller agents and with regard to social welfare and market activeness. This personality-based approach can be used as a predictive or descriptive model of human behavior to adopt in appropriate situations in many areas involving negotiation and bargaining (e.g.. commerce, business. politics. military, etc.) for conflict prevention and resolution. This model can be applied as a testbed for comparing personality models against each other based oil human data in different negotiation domains. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We study a simple market model of heterogeneous interacting agents. There are two types of agents, consumers and firms, who are boundedly rational in the sense that they only have partial information. The consumers have a given amount of income at each time period. They determine from which firm to purchase goods, and then spend all the income to purchase as much as they can. The amount of goods they can obtain depends not only on the price offered by the firm but also the amount produced by the firm and the number of customers of the firm. We employ a statistical description of consumers' behavior. The Bolzmann distribution is used to represent firms' share distribution of consumers, which is characterized by a parameter (called "temperature" in physical systems) describing how greedily the consumers pursue higher utility. The firm does not know the shape of demand function it faces, so it revises production and price so as to raise its profit with the aid of a simple reinforcement learning rule which is applied to the "one-armed bandit" problem. Numerical simulations show that there is an optimal greediness, which maximize the time average of consumers' utility. In the vicinity of the optimal greediness, oligopoly emerges although its membership changes frequently. In an oligopolistic market, the market share distribution of firms follows Zipf's law.

AB The literature on the impact of risk aversion on supply chains (SCs) is relatively limited and, in particular, there is a dearth of theory and a lack of empirical evidence concerning: (1) the impact of individual risk aversion on the generation and dynamics of the order policy (e.g. order patterns and inventory holding costs); (2) the impact of several combinations of risk-averse members in each stage of a multi-echelon SC. We explore these gaps through a multi-method approach (i.e. human experiments and agent-based simulation), thus using both empirical and simulated data. Specifically, based on results from a human experiment, we develop the conjecture that risk aversion is positively correlated to the desired stock level and consequently to the safety stock factor of inventory order policies. Building on this finding, we perform a simulation study to infer the impact of individual risk aversion in a multi-echelon SC. Results show that alternative compositions of the SC in terms of risk aversion levels of the echelons significantly influence inventory holdings and SC dynamics. The study implies that a company facing problems of high inventory days-on-hand should favour low-risk aversion managers, as instrumental to lowering stock and improving net working capital.

AB At best, computational models that study organizations incorporate only one perspective of how organizations are known to act within their environments. Such single-perspective models are limited in their generalizability and applicability to the real world and allow for researcher bias. This work develops a multi-agent simulation using eight different well-known organizational perspectives: Strategic choice, contingency theory, behavioral decision theory, enactment, resource dependence, institutional theory, population ecology, and transaction cost economics. A literature review of each field is applied to the construction of algorithms which, when combined with techniques derived from a literature review of computational modeling of organizations, was applied to the construction of a series of algorithms describing a multi-perspective computational model. Computer code was written based on the algorithms and run across different types of environments. Results were statistically analyzed to both validate the model and to generate contingency-oriented hypotheses. Conclusions were made with regard to the expected behavior of organizations and the model's applicability toward further research.

AB In this paper, an adaptive attractive/repulsive (A/R) swarming model is proposed to explore the role of self-organized formation in swarming systems. By defining the adjustable A/R range gamma i, which is affected by the localized steady state of agents, the standard collective crystal-like swarming formations are straightforwardly unfolded in different scale. Meanwhile, with numerical simulations and analyses, the results show that the adaptive A/R swarming model provides an effective solution to the current existing dilemma of the collective liquid-like formation with unexpected neighbor distances and the split crystal-like formation. The actual neighbor distance of the adaptive A/R model could converge to the expected neighbor distance as planned, based on the different settings of the expected neighbor distance and the A/R range. Moreover, such adjustable A/R swarming formations may find their potential applications such as the formation of self-organized multi-robots and unmanned aerial vehicles, the automatic networking of sensors, etc.

ID MODEL
AB Perception is presented as a predominant concern in the functioning of a driving system, where it is necessary to understand how the information, events, and actions of each influence the state of the environment and the objectives of the driver, immediately and in the near future. In this context, we present in this paper a driving model composed of five layers which ensure the autonomy and road safety of a driver agent, in particular, we are interested in this article in the concept of perception which is translated by the first three layers of our driving model, which are: visual perception, comprehension and projection, where the execution of these three layers is based on the driving behavior adopted by the driver agent, which is in our case the car-following driving behavior. Furthermore, we present in this paper two simulation scenarios, the first one is realized based on urban area conditions, and the second one is conducted by using Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) dataset of a highway in Los Angeles, California. In this context, the experimental results present the effectiveness of our driving model based on the imitation of human behavior and according to reducing the duration of perception.

AB Recently financial markets have shown significant risks and levels of volatility. Understanding the sources of these risks require simulation models capable of representing adequately the real mechanisms of markets. In this paper, we compared data of the high-frequency-trader market-making (HFT-MM) strategy from both the real financial market and our simulation. Regarding the former, we extracted trader clusters and identified one cluster whose statistical indexes indicated HFT-MM features. We then analyzed the difference between these traders' orders and the market price. In our simulation, we built an artificial market model with a continuous double auction system, stylized trader agents, and HFT-MM trader agents based on prior research. As an experiment, we compared the distribution of the order placements of HFT-MM traders in the real and simulated financial data. We found that the order placement distribution near the market or best price in both the real data and the simulations were similar. However, the orders far from the market or best price differed significantly when the real data exhibited a wider range of orders. This indicates that in order to build more realistic simulation of financial markets, integrating fine-grained data is essential.

AB This study focuses on the design of several social agents that are intended to collect the self-reflections of learners while learners are immersed in simulation activities for knowledge building. The design of the agents follows 5W principles and seeks to encourage learners to expend mental effort upon multi-faceted learning and self-reflection. Using semantic networks, we developed dialogue lines for reflection-prompting agents. We analyzed the participants' answers using natural language processing technology to classify the sentences into positive and negative rankings. A preliminary field study with 117 high school students was conducted over three weeks to test the effects of agent-prompted self-reflection. The results demonstrated that 96% and 62% of participants separately completed the first and the second simulation activities (including the agent-prompted self-reflections respectively). Those who did not finish the activities were generally limited by time restrictions rather than a lack of motivation, as the participants typically considered the interactions with the agents to be interesting. The self-reflections elicited through the agent interviews were consistent with the reflections obtained from paper-pencil questionnaires and appeared to be stable over time. Future study, including investigations using a randomized experimental design with a control group, is needed to fully assess the effects of agent-prompted self-reflection.

AB The purpose of this paper is the study of the universality of the critical exponents beta = 0.45 and delta = 0.35, detected in the Viscek model, under the effect of three zones (repulsion zone, orientation zone and attraction zone). Our aims are to understand more the behavior of non-equilibrium multi-agent system by extending the simple model proposed by Viscek et al. earlier for one zone. In our study, the particles corresponding to agents interact with their neighbors, by choosing at each time step a velocity v(a) depending on their direction and perturbed by an external noise eta. We demonstrate, by fixing the radius R-1, R-3 and by varying the radius R-2 a phase transition can be obtained from disordered movement of individuals to highly align collective motion. The varied zone of orientation will be important for this research. Our findings confirm that the exponents beta and delta depend on the size of orientation strongly indicate the non-universality of these critical exponents.

AB Several empirical and theoretical studies have shown how the exploitation of food sources, the choice of resting sites or other types of collective decision-making in heterogeneous environments are facilitated and modulated by social interactions between conspecifics. It is well known that many pelagic fishes live in schools and that this form of gregarious behavior provides advantages in terms of food intake and predator avoidance efficiency. However, the influence of social behavior in the formation of aggregations by tuna under floating objects (FOBs) is poorly understood. In this work, we investigated the collective patterns generated by different theoretical models, which either include or exclude social interactions between conspecifics, in the presence of two aggregation sites. The resulting temporal dynamics and distributions of populations were compared to in situ observations of tuna behavior. Our work suggests that social interactions should be incorporated in aggregative behavior to reproduce the temporal patterns observed in the field at both the individual and the group level, challenging the common vision of tuna aggregations around FOBs. Our study argues for additional data to further demonstrate the role of social behavior in the dynamics of these fish aggregations. Understanding the interplay between environmental and social factors in the associative behavior of fish with FOBs is necessary to assess the consequences of the widespread deployment of artificial FOBs by fishermen.

AB This study addresses an event-triggered distributed H-infinity control method by extending traditional zero-sum differential games for physically interconnected non-holonomic mobile mechanical multi-agent systems with external disturbance and slipping, skidding and dead-zone disturbances. Initially, a problem of physically interconnected kinematic and dynamic control is transformed into an equivalent problem of event-triggered distributed H-infinity control. Subsequently, the traditional two-player zero-sum differential game is extended to a three-player zero-sum differential game, where a new player is included to approximate the worst dead-zone disturbance. To find player policies, an event-triggering condition and an event-triggered control law are proposed via neural networks (NNs). Although an NN weight-tuning law is designed on the basis of adaptive dynamic programming techniques, it can relax identification procedures for unknown drift dynamics and persistent excitation conditions. It also guarantees that the closed system is stable and the cost function converges to the bounded L-2-gain optimal value, while the Zeno behaviour is excluded. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by an application to a dead-zone torque multi-mobile robot system through numerical simulations.

AB A multi-agent spin model for changes of prices in the stock market based on the Ising-like cellular automaton with interactions between traders randomly varying in time is investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The structure of interactions has topology of a small-world network obtained from regular two-dimensional square lattices with various coordination numbers by randomly cutting and rewiring edges. Simulations of the model on regular lattices do not yield time series of logarithmic price returns with statistical properties comparable wit h the empirical ones. In contrast, in the c as e of networks wit h a certain degree of randomness for a wide range of parameters the time series of the logarithmic price returns exhibit intermittent bursting typical of volatility clustering. Also the tails of distributions of returns obey a power scaling law wit h exponents comparable to those obtained fro m the empirical data.

In order to save the computation and communication resources, the above optimisation problem is addressed by designing two zero-gradient-sum algorithms with state-based dynamic event-triggered mechanism, where the information communication only occurs at some discrete triggering time instants. The Zeno behaviour of the above event-triggered control scheme is excluded by the existence of the positive minimum inter-event time (MIET). The convergence is proved based on the Lyapunov method. Finally, we illustrate and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered algorithms through numerical experiments on simulated.

DE Voter model; opinion dynamics; social network
AB There exist scaling correlations between the edge weights and the nodes' degrees in weighted social networks. Based on the empirical findings, we study a multi-state voter model on weighted social networks where the weight is given by the product of agents' degrees raised to a power theta and there exist persistent individuals whose opinions are independent of those of their friends. We find that the fraction of each opinion will converge to a value which only relates to the degrees of initial committed agents and the scaling exponent theta. The analytical predictions are verified by numerical simulations. The model indicates that agents' degrees and scaling exponent can significantly influence the final coexistence or consensus state of opinions. We also study the influence of degree mixing characteristics on the dynamics model by numerical simulations and discuss the relation between the model and the other related opinion dynamics models on social networks with different topological structures and initial configurations.

AB Complex global behavior patterns can emerge from very simple local interactions between many agents. However, no local interaction rules have been identified that generate some patterns observed in nature, for example the rotating balls, rotating tornadoes and the full-core rotating mills observed in fish collectives. Here we show that locally interacting agents modeled with a minimal cognitive system can produce these collective patterns. We obtained this result by using recent advances in reinforcement learning to systematically solve the inverse modeling problem: given an observed collective behavior, we automatically find a policy generating it. Our agents are modeled as processing the information from neighbor agents to choose actions with a neural network and move in an environment of simulated physics. Even though every agent is equipped with its own neural network, all agents have the same network architecture and parameter values, ensuring in this way that a single policy is responsible for the emergence of a given pattern. We find the final policies by tuning the neural network weights until the produced collective behavior approaches the desired one. By using modular neural networks with modules using a small number of inputs and outputs, we built an interpretable model of collective motion. This enabled us to analyse the policies obtained. We found a similar general structure for the four different collective patterns, not dissimilar to the one we have previously inferred from experimental zebrafish trajectories; but we also found consistent differences between policies generating the different collective pattern, for example repulsion in the vertical direction for the more three-dimensional structures of the sphere and tornado. Our results illustrate how new advances in artificial intelligence, and specifically in reinforcement learning, allow new approaches to analysis and modeling of collective behavior.

DE learning communities; cooperative/collaborative learning; distributed
   learning environments
AB Web-based (or online) learning provides an unprecedented flexibility and convenience to both learners and instructors. However, large online classes relying on instructor-centered presentations could tend to isolate many learners. The size of these classes and the wide dispersion of the learners make it challenging for instructors to interact with individual learners or to facilitate learner collaborations. Since extensive literature has confirmed that the substantial impact of learner interaction on learning outcomes, it is pedagogically critical to help distributed learners engage in community-based collaborative learning and to help individual learners improve their self-regulation. The E-learning lab of Shanghai Jiaotong University created an artificial intelligence system to help guide learners with similar interests into reasonably sized learning communities. The system uses a multi-agent mechanism to organize and reorganize supportive communities based on learners' learning interests, experiences, and behaviors. Through effective award and exchange algorithms, learners with similar interests and experiences will form a community to support each others' learning. Simulated experimental results indicate that these algorithms can improve the speed and efficiency in identifying and grouping homogeneous learners. Here, we will describe this system in detail and present its mechanism for organizing learning communities. We will conduct human experimentations in the near future to further perfect the system.

AB This paper presents a multi-agent model describing the main mechanisms of money creation and money circulation in a credit economy. Our special attention is paid to the role of debt in the two processes. With the agent-based modeling approach, macro phenomena are well founded in micro-based causalities. A hypothetical economy composed of a banking system and multiple traders is proposed. Instead of being a pure financial intermediary, the banking system is viewed as the center of money creation and an accelerator of money circulation. Agents finance their expenditures not only by their own savings but also through bank loans. Through mathematical calculations and numerical simulation, we identify the determinants of money multiplier and those of velocity of money. In contrast to the traditional money creation model, the money multiplier is determined not only by the behavior of borrowing but also by the behavior of repayment as well. The velocity of money is found to be influenced by both money-related factors such as the expenditure habits of agents with respect to their income and wealth and debt-related factors such as borrowing and repayment behaviors of debtors and the reserve requirements faced by banks.

A necessary and sufficient condition of equilibria is obtained and the linearized system around an equilibrium is derived. As the considered smooth curved surface is an ellipsoid, some dynamical properties including limit behavior and instability are obtained. Based on those results, almost global synchronization is achieved for the high-dimensional Kuramoto model limited on ellipsoids with complete or tree graphs. Moreover, numerical simulations are given to validate the obtained theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The formation control problem for multi-agent systems has been explored in recent years. However, controlling a formation of multiple aerial vehicles in the presence of disturbances has been a challenge for control researchers. To deal with this issue, a robust adaptive formation control algorithm for a group of multiple quadcopters is proposed. A nonlinear model of the dynamics of the formation error is obtained based on a leader-follower scheme. This model considers both the relative position in the x-y plane and the relative heading angle between vehicles in the presence of uncertainties. In addition, by means of a model reference control approach, a robust adaptive formation controller is used to steer the vehicles into a formation pattern and have them maintain the formation shape. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.

AB Experimenting with multi-channel operations in reality is both costly and risky, because it can severely affect a firm's revenues, profitability, customer churn, and other customer metrics. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based simulation approach as a means for exploring and analyzing the impact of (combinations of) multi-channel activities on customer channel choices before having implemented them in practice. The simulation takes into account the heterogeneity of customers, social dynamics in their behavior, and the various phases of the purchasing process. To this end, customers are represented by agents whose phase-specific channel perceptions determine their channel choices. These perceptions may be altered by communication with other agents, first-hand experience of the channel, and/or marketing activities. The approach is illustrated through a sample application for which data from an international multi-channel retailer as well as from an empirical study among Austrian customers have been used.

By virtue of concepts and methods in statistical physics, we investigate the time correlations and spatial structure of financial markets based on empirical high-frequency data. We discover that the Chinese stock market shares common basic properties with the western stock markets, such as the fat-tail probability distribution of price returns, the long-range auto-correlation of volatilities, and the persistence probability of volatilities, while it exhibits very different higher-order time correlations of price returns and volatilities, spatial correlations of individual stock prices, and large-fluctuation dynamic behaviors. Furthermore, multi-agent-based models are developed to simulate the microscopic interaction and dynamic evolution of the stock markets.

AB Computational simulations of flocks and crowds have typically been processed by a set of logic or syntactic rules. In recent decades, a new generation of systems has emerged from dynamicist approaches in which the agents and the environment are treated as a pair of dynamical systems coupled informationally and mechanically. Their spontaneous interactions allow them to achieve the desired behavior. The main proposition assumes that the agent does not need a full model or to make inferences before taking actions; rather, the information necessary for any action can be derived from the environment with simple computations and very little internal state. In this paper, we present a simulation framework in which the agents are endowed with a sensing device, an oscillator network as controller and actuators to interact with the environment. The perception device is designed as an optic array emulating the principles of the animal retina, which assimilates stimuli resembling optic flow to be captured from the environment. The controller modulates informational variables to action variables in a sensory-motor flow. Our approach is based on the Kuramoto model that describes mathematically a network of coupled phase oscillators and the use of evolutionary algorithms, which is proved to be capable of synthesizing minimal synchronization strategies based on the dynamical coupling between agents and environment. We carry out a comparative analysis with classical implementations taking into account several criteria. It is concluded that we should consider replacing the metaphor of symbolic information processing by that of sensory-motor coordination in problems of multi-agent organizations.

AB In the context of complex networks research, underlying network structure is considered to play a crucial role in spreading processes such as virus propagation in social and computer networks. There are some assumptions that are often considered while utilizing a network structure in the immunization process, mainly the lack of global topological information and access to the partial information of underlying network structure. However, without global information about the whole network the immunization process becoms much more difficult. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it develops an efficient approach called "One Node at One Step Discovery Process" to identify chains of high degree connections for immunization purpose in scale-free networks, and second, it investigates the performance of previous approaches such as acquaintance immunization strategy (AIS), common acquaintance immunization strategy (CATS) and Intentional Random Walk with respect to their parameters. We performed the experiments on both synthetic and real data sets and conducted a multi-agent-based simulation to verify our proposed algorithm. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in targeting high degree nodes. The results also show that some existing algorithms found in prior literature are more robust than others with respect to parameter configuration and improper selection of the parameter can produce significantly different results.

AB The aim of this paper is to study and discuss the effect of three zones (repulsion zone, orientation zone and attraction zone) on the phase transition in 2D-collective moving particles. Our main motivation is to better understand the complex behavior of nonequilibrium multi-agent system by extending the earlier and original model proposed by Viscek et al. [T. Viscek et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 75 (1995) 1226] for one zone. The analysis is performed over different situations by using a numerical simulation method. It is found that the radius R-2 of orientation zone plays an important role in the system. In effect, by varying the parameter R-2 a phase transition can be achieved from disordered moving of individuals to a group to highly aligned collective motion. The results also show that, the critical value of R-2 at which the transition emerges depends strongly on the size of the repulsion zone but not on the size of attraction one.

ID EMPIRICAL VALIDATION
AB This paper discusses the validation of an agent-based model for simulating a multi-actor spatial planning process. After a general discussion about the pitfalls of validating agent-based models that simulate complex spatial systems, we briefly present a validation method based on role playing. The method is designed to generate insights that can improve our understanding of the behaviour of socio-spatial systems in a planning context. The method was tested by carrying out an experimental role play to validate individual agent tasks, focusing on the ability of agents to generate beliefs and preferences about their environment. We conclude that using role play as a validation technique can provide valuable information about the performance of the model. The insights gained aid identification and understanding of those parts of a multi-actor spatial planning system that are currently poorly understood and poorly represented by the agents.

AB In this paper we present an agent-based model of a human population, designed to illustrate the potential synergies between demography and agent-based social simulation. In the modelling process, we take advantage of the perspectives of both disciplines: demography being more focused on matching statistical models to empirical data, and social simulation on explanations of social mechanisms underlying the observed phenomena. This work is based on earlier attempts to introduce agent-based modelling to demography, but extends them into a multi-level and multi-state framework. We illustrate our approach with a proof-of-concept model of partnership formation and changing health status over the life course. In addition to the agent-based component, the model includes empirical elements based on demographic data for the United Kingdom. As such, the model allows analysis of the demographic dynamics at a variety of levels, from the individual, through the household, to the whole population. We bolster this analysis further by using statistical emulation techniques, which allow for in-depth investigation of the interaction of model parameters and of the resulting output uncertainty. We argue that the approach although not fully predictive per se-has four important advantages. First, the model is capable of studying the linked lives of simulated individuals in a variety of scenarios. Second, the simulations can be readily embedded in the relevant social or physical spaces. Third, the approach allows for overcoming some data-related limitations, augmenting the available statistical information with assumptions on behavioural rules. Fourth, statistical emulators enable exploration of the parameter space of the underlying agent-based models.

ID CONTROLLABILITY
AB In this paper, the weighted couple-group consensus of continuous-time heterogeneous multiagent systems with input and communication time delay is investigated. A novel weighted couple-group consensus protocol based on cooperation and competition interaction is designed, which can relax the in-degree balance condition. By using graph theory, general Nyquist criterion and Gerschgorin disc theorem, the time delay upper limit that the system may allow is obtained. The conclusions indicate that there is no relationship between weighted couple-group consensus and communication time delay. When the agents input time delay, the coupling weight between the agents, and the systems control parameters are satisfied, the multiagent system can converge to any given weighted coupling group consistent state. The experimental simulation results verify the correctness of the conclusion.

AB We explore a mathematical framework of the vaccination game taking into account spatial structure, say, and degree distribution amid individuals. The framework presumes SIR/V dynamics in a season, which is followed by a strategy update process that estimates whether an individual will take a protecting measure, considering imperfect vaccination or defense against contagion. The numerical result based on multi-agent simulations (MAS) validates our theory, suggesting that a more heterogeneous spatial structure is vulnerable to an epidemic. This conclusion is consistent with the qualitative knowledge that a pandemic arises more easily in a scale-free network than in homogeneous networks because of the negative contribution of hub agents acting as super spreaders.
   Highlights
   - A new theoretical model is established for the vaccination game with a SIR/V model and either imperfect vaccination or intermediate measures.
   - The model considers degree distribution amid individuals, which significantly influences disease spreading.
   - The model is validated by simulation results.
   - The results prove that a more heterogeneous network is disadvantageous to prevent disease spreading.

AB Measuring the credibility of a simulation model has always been challenging due to its growing uncertainty and complexity. During the past decades, plenty of metrics and evaluation procedures have been developed for evaluating different sorts of simulation models. Most of the existing research focuses on the direct comparison of numerical results with a group of reference data. However, it is sometimes unsuitable for evolving dynamic models such as the multi-agent models. With the same condition, both the practical system and the simulation model perform highly dynamic actions. The credibility of the model with insufficient information, non-stationary states and changing environment is unable to acquire through a direct pair comparison. This paper presents a pattern-based validation method to complementarily extract hidden patterns that exist in both a simulation model and its reference data, and assess the model performance in a different aspect. Firstly, multi-dimensional perceptually important points strategy is modified to find the patterns exist in time-serial data. Afterward, a pattern organizing topology is applied to automatically depict required pattern from reference data and assess the performance of the corresponding simulation model. The extensive case study on three simulation models shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB With leadership as a major predictor of team performance in both face-to-face and virtual teams, research on differences in leadership emergence in these contexts seems warranted. We offer a multi-level model analyzing the roles of degree of team virtuality and density of social network ties as boundary conditions on leadership emergence, viewed as a fundamentally social-cognitive process. Using agent-based modeling and simulations, our results suggest that virtuality moderates the relationships between cognitive ability, extraversion, and self-efficacy (as independent variables) and leadership emergence (as dependent variable); and density of network ties serves as a moderator for the associations of cognitive ability and self-efficacy with leadership emergence. Subsequent quasi-experimental and experimental tests support the role of density of network ties as a moderator for the association of extraversion with leadership emergence. Implications of these findings and future paths for research bridging the fields of leadership, team virtuality and social networks are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Innovation of new generation entrepreneurs is crucial to the development of a country. Empirical research method can analyze the history and current situation, but it is difficult to reflect the dynamic process and evolution trend under different scenarios. In this paper, we adopt computational experiment method to model the decision-making process of new generation entrepreneurs. Multi-agent evolution model is constructed to simulate individual behavior of different types of new generation entrepreneurs under different scenarios. By the comparison of different results, it analyses the evolutionary rules of innovation behaviors and explores guidance policies to promote entrepreneurs' innovation behavior and achieve better innovation performance. The experimental results show that although internal elements such as individual's innovative spirit, innovative ability and cognition of social capital determine the innovation intention, the capital, technology and talent conditions are also very important for innovation implementation. New generation entrepreneurs with different risk preferences should objectively evaluate and treat innovation risks according to their own characteristics. This helps to reduce the negative impact of innovation risk on continuous innovation. Meanwhile, government should pay attention to establishing risk guarantee mechanism such as innovation insurance fund to promote the innovation of new generation entrepreneurs.

AB Modeling pedestrian decision making activities represents a serious challenge: different decisions are taken at distinct levels of abstraction, employing heterogeneous information and knowledge about the environment, from path planning to the regulation of distance from other pedestrians and obstacles present in the environment. Pedestrians, moreover, are not robots: although empirical observations show that they consider congestion when planning, there are also evidences that their decisions are not always optimal, even in normal situations. We present a model integrating and improving consolidated results mitigating the optimization effects of congestion aware path planning. In particular, we employ commonsense estimations of the effects of perceivable congestion instead of exact values, also embedding an imitation mechanism stimulating changes in planned decisions whenever another nearby pedestrian did the same. The model leads to improvements in quantitatively reproducing observed phenomena, both in a validation scenario as well as in a real-world situation: an interesting counterintuitive result, in which reducing available choices and exits actually reduces overall egress time, is also presented and discussed.

AB Structural design and optimization in engineering are increasingly addressing non-standard optimization problems (NSPs). These problems are characterized by a complex topology of the optimization space with respect to nonlinearity, multimodality, discontinuity, etc. By that, NSP can only be solved by means of computer simulations. In addition, the corresponding numerical approaches applied often tend to be noisy. Typical examples for NSP occur in robust optimization, where the solution has to be robust with respect to implementation errors, production tolerances or uncertain environmental conditions. However, a generally applicable strategy for solving such problem categories always equally efficiently is not yet available.
   To improve the situation, a distributed agent-based optimization approach for solving NSPs is introduced in this paper. The elaborated approach consists of a network of cooperating but also competing strategy agents that wrap various strategies, especially optimization methods (e.g. SQP, DE, ES, PSO, etc.) using different search characteristics. In particular, the strategy agents contain an expert system modeling their specific behavior in an optimization environment by means of rules and facts on a highly abstract level. Further, different common interaction patterns have been defined to describe the structure of a strategy network and its interactions.
   For managing the complexity of NSPs using multi-agent systems (MASS) efficiently, a simulation and experimentation platform has been developed. Serving as a computational steering tool, it applies MAS technology and accesses a network of various optimization strategies. As a consequence, an elegant interactive steering, a customized modeling and a powerful visualization of structural optimization processes are established. To demonstrate the far reaching applicability of the proposed approach, numerical examples are discussed, including nonlinear function and robust optimization problems. The results of the numerical experiments illustrate the potential of the agent-based strategy network approach for collaborative solving, where observed synergy effects lead to an effective and efficient solution finding.

AB As both sensors and communication technologies are becoming more powerful at decreasing costs, sensor networks are constantly growing in complexity, i.e. in the information they generate and in the need for coordinating network resources. In this paper we comparatively explore the performance of multi-level hierarchical networks and flat networks, i.e, arrays of sensor agents with specific competences but without predefined communication or control structures. We develop a model of the performance of these types of networks for analysing the throughput of sensing tasks depending on a variety of network and sensor parameters. This analytical model serves as the basis for numerical simulation runs, which reveal the specific advantages of the different network structures. Motivated by these results, we develop an adaptive control scheme, which enables the network to organise itself at runtime so as to achieve the highest result precision in minimum time with minimum communication overhead, maximum parallelism and maximum fault tolerance. This control scheme is a computer-operational version of the contract network, originally proposed for problem solving in distributed artificial intelligence, with agents teaming up dynamically after a negotiation phase following a task specification. The metaphor of contracting also holds the potential to integrate agents that control actuators, e.g. cooperating robots, by assigning appropriate competences to them. Hence the design of sensorimotor systems, whose behaviour is adaptively controlled in a situation-dependent way by a team of different sensors, is a straightforward extension. Moreover, it is also easy to extend the network by adding agents that do not have a sensing component and can only perform sensor data processing tasks. We introduce a complete software framework for implementing these kinds of networks. It consists of a formal specification of the requirements that the sensory component of an agent has to meet and a comprehensive library of C ++ objects encapsulating all of the negotiation protocol and communications routines. In the experimental section of the paper we show how several uncalibrated cameras are used to estimate the trajectory of a manipulator in order to guide the manipulator towards a target in real time. We also illustrate how agent-teams may easily reconfigure during task execution in the case of unexpected events. We then go on to show how complex vision tasks can be broken down into tasks that identical agents may work on in parallel. Finally we show how fusion for vision at a symbolic, i.e. object description level, may contribute to solve the hard problem of recognising occluded objects from different view points. We conclude the paper by summarising our results and sketching future research, in particular the automatic mutual reprogramming of agents using a specifically developed ontology.

AB Agent-based modeling (ABM), also termed `Individual-based modeling (IBM)', is a computational approach that simulates the interactions of autonomous entities (agents, or individual cells) with each other and their local environment to predict higher level emergent patterns. A literature-derived rule set governs the actions of each individual agent. While this technique has been widely used in the ecological and social sciences, it has only recently been applied in biomedical research. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction to ABM as it has been used to study complex multi-cell biological phenomena, underscore the importance of coupling models with experimental work, and outline future challenges for the ABM field and its application to biomedical research. We highlight a number of published examples of ABM, focusing on work that has combined experimental with ABM analyses and how this pairing produces new understanding. We conclude with suggestions for moving forward with this parallel approach.

AB Among alternative methodologies, an approach considering how distributed controllers can be employed in complex systems in a multiagent setting is developing widely. The hierarchical decomposition as a pervasive method to deal with undesirable computation allows for reduced computation, and provides solutions for larger and more complicated problems. However, there is a necessity for research efforts in the arrangement of local operational performance criteria to optimize the overall performance of a whole system. This paper uses the method described in our previous works on decision making based on simulated computed policy functions in a multiagent system. We propose that a multiagent system design for efficient control with hierarchical representation is closely related to agent modeling features. Considering the individual and social criteria while retaining the benefits of hierarchical coordination among agents, is the main challenge of this paper. An experimental study with a game model shows that systems, which is more sensitive in terms of computational resources, can take advantages of hierarchical control design, where individual and social criteria play significant role in the system design mechanism.

AB Diagnosis and management of bone and joint infections (BJI) is a challenging task. The high intra and inter patient's variability in terms of clinical presentation makes it impossible to rely on a systematic description or classical statistical analysis for its diagnosis. Advances can be achieved through a better understanding of the system behavior that results from the interactions between the components at a micro-scale level, which is difficult to mastered using traditional methods. Multiple studies from the literature report factors and interactions that affect the dynamics of the BJI system. The objectives of this study were (i) to perform a systematic review to identify relevant interactions between agents (cells, pathogens) and parameters values that characterize agents and interactions, and (ii) to develop a two dimensional computational model of the BJI system based on the results of the systematic review. The model would simulate the behavior resulting from the interactions on the cellular and molecular levels to explore the BJI dynamics, using an agent-based modeling approach. The BJI system's response to different microbial inoculum levels was simulated. The model succeeded in mimicking the dynamics of bacteria, the innate immune cells, and the bone mass during the first stage of infection and for different inoculum levels in a consistent manner. The simulation displayed the destruction in bone tissue as a result of the alteration in bone remodeling process during the infection. The model was used to generate different patterns of system behaviors that could be analyzed in further steps. Simulations results suggested evidence for the existence of latent infections. Finally, we presented a way to analyze and synthesize massive simulated data in a concise and comprehensive manner based on the semi-supervised identification of ordinary differential equations (ODE) systems. It allows to use the known framework for temporal and structural ODE analyses and therefore summarize the whole simulated system dynamical behavior. This first model is intended to be validated by in vivo or in vitro data and expected to generate hypotheses to be challenged by real data. Step by step, it can be modified and complexified based on the test/validation iteration cycles.

AB In response to the deteriorating environmental pollution, China has formulated a series of environmental regulation policies. However, political centralization and economic decentralization have subjected the local governments (LGs) to the dual constraints of environmental protection and economic development during the implementation of environmental regulation, which has resulted in the failure of conventional environmental regulation. To this end, the central government (CG) has established a central environmental protection inspection system (CEPIS). However, the existing literature has insufficiently studied the role and policy tools of the CG for inspecting the LGs and the polluting enterprises (PEs) to implement environmental regulation, and lacked systematic analysis of the strategic interactions and policy effects caused by CEPIS. Evolutionary game theory (EGT) provides a powerful tool with which to unpack the interactive strategies of Multi-Agent in China. By exploring the evolution of different participants' behavior and their evolutionary stable strategy (ESS), EGT enables a robust, quantitative analysis of this three-party game. Simultaneously, some numerical examples serve to verify the theoretical results and support four key insights. First, the selection of environmental strategies manifests in a dynamic process of constant adjustment and optimization. Second, the whole evolutionary game system can converge on an ideal state under certain conditions. Third, increasing the investments in the special transfer payments of environmental protection, expanding the scale of emissions trading market, and improving the emission reduction benefits can motivate the PEs to reduce their emissions and the LGs to perform their duties. Fourth, in some scenarios, simply increasing the political penalties for the LGs fails to motivate the LGs to perform their duties. This research can provide the evolutionary mechanism and broaden our understanding of relationship between environmental regulation and emission reduction strategies. Related implications are finally proposed, which can offer valuable guidance on reforming the environmental regulation and improve market outcomes in China.

AB Joint attention (JA) is important to many social, communicative activities, including language, and humans exhibit a considerably high level of JA compared with non-human primates. We propose a coevolutionary hypothesis to explain this degree-difference in JA: once JA started to aid linguistic comprehension, along with language evolution, communicative success (CS) during cultural transmission could enhance the levels of JA among language users. We illustrate this hypothesis via a multi-agent computational model, where JA boils down to a genetically transmitted ability to obtain non-linguistic cues aiding comprehension. The simulation results and statistical analysis show that: (i) the level of JA is correlated with the understandability of the emergent language; and (ii) CS can boost an initially low level of JA and 'ratchet' it up to a stable high level. This coevolutionary perspective helps explain the degree-difference in many language-related competences between humans and non-human primates, and reflects the importance of biological evolution, individual learning and cultural transmission to language evolution.

AB Research objectives: Nationally sponsored cancer-care quality-improvement efforts have been deployed in community health centers to increase breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer-screening rates among vulnerable populations. Despite several immediate and short-term gains, screening rates remain below national benchmark objectives. Overall improvement has been both difficult to sustain over time in some organizational settings and/or challenging to diffuse to other settings as repeatable best practices. Reasons for this include facility-level changes, which typically occur in dynamic organizational environments that are complex, adaptive, and unpredictable. This study seeks to understand the factors that shape community health center facility-level cancer-screening performance overtime. This study applies a computational-modeling approach, combining principles of health-services research, health informatics, network theory, and systems science. Methods: To investigate the roles of knowledge acquisition, retention, and sharing within the setting of the community health center and to examine their effects on the relationship between clinical decision support capabilities and improvement in cancer-screening rate improvement, we employed Construct-TM to create simulated community health centers using previously collected point-in-time survey data. Construct-TM is a multi-agent model of network evolution. Because social, knowledge, and belief networks co-evolve, groups and organizations are treated as complex systems to capture the variability of human and organizational factors. In Construct-TM, individuals and groups interact by communicating, learning, and making decisions in a continuous cycle. Data from the survey was used to differentiate high-performing simulated community health centers from low-performing ones based on computer-based decision support usage and self-reported cancer-screening improvement. Results: This virtual experiment revealed that patterns of overall network symmetry, agent cohesion, and connectedness varied by community health center performance level. Visual assessment of both the agent-to-agent knowledge sharing network and agent-to-resource knowledge use network diagrams demonstrated that community health centers labeled as high performers typically showed higher levels of collaboration and cohesiveness among agent classes, faster knowledge-absorption rates, and fewer agents that were unconnected to key knowledge resources. Conclusions and research implications: Using the point-in-time survey data outlining community health center cancer-screening practices, our computational model successfully distinguished between high and low performers. Results indicated that high-performance environments displayed distinctive network characteristics in patterns of interaction among agents, as well as in the access and utilization of key knowledge resources. Our study demonstrated how non-network-specific data obtained from a point-in-time survey can be employed to forecast community health center performance over time, thereby enhancing the sustainability of long-term strategic-improvement efforts. Our results revealed a strategic profile for community health center cancer-screening improvement via simulation over a projected 10-year period. The use of computational modeling allows additional inferential knowledge to be drawn from existing data when examining organizational performance in increasingly complex environments.

AB For honeybee colonies, it is crucial to collect nectar in an efficient way. Empiric experiments showed that the process of decision making, which allows the colony to select the optimal nectar source, is based on individual decisions. These decisions are made by returning nectar foragers, which alter their dancing behaviours based on the nectar source's quality and based on the experienced search time for a receiver bee. Nectar receivers, which represent a shared limited resource for foragers, can modulate the foraging decisions performed by the colony. We investigated the interplay between foragers and receivers by using a multi-agent simulation. Therefore, we implemented agents which are capable of a limited set of behaviours and which spend energy according to their behaviour. In simulation experiments, we tested colonies with various receiver-to-forager ratios and measured colony-level results like the emerging foraging patterns and the colony's net honey gain. We show that the number of receivers prominently regulates the foraging workforce. All tested environmental fluctuations are predicted to cause energetic costs for the colony. Task-partitioning additionally influences the colony's decision-making concerning the question whether or not the colony sticks to a nectar source after environmental fluctuations.

AB Thiswork revisits the problem of distributed adaptive filtering in multi-agent sensor networks. In contrast to classical approaches, the formulation relaxes the Gaussian assumption on the signal and noise to the generalized setting of a-stable distributions that do not possess second- and higher-order statistical moments. Most importantly, the considered scenario allows for different characteristic exponents throughout the network. Drawing upon ideas from correntropy-type local similarity measures and fractional-order calculus, a novel class of distributed fractional-order correntropy adaptive filters, that are robust against the jittery behavior of a-stable signals, is derived and their convergence criterion is established. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, as compared to existing distributed adaptive filtering techniques, is demonstrated via simulation examples.

Meanwhile, it is shown that Zeno behaviour of triggering time sequences is excluded for the proposed event-triggered rule. Finally, some numerical simulations on coupled Chua's circuits are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical algorithms.

AB We combine Minsky's financial fragility analysis, behavioural analysis of decision rules and the evolutionary economics of rule trajectories to provide an empirically grounded and computationally tractable theory of the complex evolutionary dynamics of speculative financial upswings. The behavioural dynamics of asset bubbles can be conceptualized as the joint consequence of the adoption and diffusion process of new investment decision rules coupled with the degradation of those rules as they pass from a few expert investors to larger population of amateurs. We illustrate this using data covering the recent Brisbane property market bubble (1999-2003) and show how it is consistent with the existence of such cascading decision rules. We then explain how multi-agent simulation methods can be used for modelling decision rule cascades. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The flocking of multiple intelligent agents, inspired by the swarm behavior of natural phenomena, has been widely used in the engineering fields such as in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and robots system. However, the performance of the system (such as response time, network throughput, and resource utilization) may be greatly affected while the intelligent agents are engaged in cooperative work. Therefore, it is concerned to accomplish the distributed cooperation while ensuring the optimal performance of the intelligent system. In this paper, we investigated the optimal control problem of distributed multiagent systems (MASs) with finite-time group flocking movement. Specifically, we propose two optimal group flocking algorithms of MASs with single-integrator model and double-integrator model. Then, we study the group consensus of distributed MASs by using modern control theory and finite-time convergence theory, where the proposed optimal control algorithms can drive MASs to achieve the group convergence in finite-time while minimizing the performance index of the intelligence system. Finally, experimental simulation shows that MASs can keep the minimum energy function under the effect of optimal control algorithm, while the intelligent agents can follow the optimal trajectory to achieve group flocking in finite time.

AB We study the emergence of the mono-cluster flocking due to the interplay between the unit-speed constraint and time-delayed interactions in the evolution of the Cucker-Smale ensemble. Several flocking models with unit-speed constraint have been extensively used in the flocking modeling of self-propelled multi-agent systems in the control theory community. Time-delayed interactions can be caused by the finite propagation speed constraint in communications. In the previous literature, these two physical mechanisms have been studied separately. In this paper, we investigate these combined physical effects in a common framework and study how the interplay between these mechanisms affects asymptotic flocking dynamics. For this, we provide a sufficient framework for a mono-cluster flocking in terms of system parameters (e.g., time-delay, coupling strength, particle numbers) and initial data. We also provide several numerical simulations and compare them with analytical results. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB A mechanism is presented that allows agents in multiagent systems with private knowledge about resource endowments to establish negotiation groups with commonly known negotiation spaces. This is done by exchanging information. Specific agents that are provided by the system mediate the communication and take over some very complex calculations. The negotiating agents reveal only information to the mediators that they consider relevant for their own objectives or for the current negotiation. A broadcast of all the agents' private knowledge is not required. We label this interactive mechanism social formation of negotiation spaces and groups. Furthermore we drop the often-made assumption of isolated negotiations. Our agents remember other agents that have contributed to reach a beneficial agreement. These agents are assumed to have credits. In later negotiations our agents will be more generous towards agents with credits. The applied credit mechanism does not require that all agents participate nor does it require that other agents are aware of this mechanism. We conclude this report with hypotheses that will be evaluated by simulations.

AB This paper investigates the issues associated with choosing appropriate models of choice for demographic agent-based models. In particular, we discuss the importance of context, time preference, and dealing with uncertainty in decision modelling, as well as the heterogeneity between agents in their decision-making strategies. The paper concludes by advocating empirically driven, modular, and multi-model approaches to designing simulations of human decision-making, given the lack of an agreed strategy for dealing with any of these issues. Furthermore, we suggest that an iterative process of data collection and simulation experiments, with the latter informing future empirical data collection, should form the basis of such an endeavour. The discussion is illustrated with reference to selected demographic agent-based models, with a focus on migration.

AB Evacuation simulation plays an indispensable role when planning for emergencies and evaluating the consequences of disasters related to airborne toxics. Various attempts have been made to improve simulation of evacuation in toxic environments and to account for the varying concentration levels and the dynamic exposure. However, most studies neglect the reverse effect, how the exposure and dosage levels affect the physical and psychological state of an evacuee and consequently the evacuation path and process. In this work, a fully coupled exposure-response-evacuation and agent based algorithm is proposed, focusing on the H2S airborne toxic. Accordingly, the dynamically estimated exposure of the evacuee affects, non-linearly, the evacuation speed and thus the overall evacuation. This coupling is challenging and thus it depends on the available epidemiological and toxicological data. Nevertheless, the diversity and advantages of the algorithm is successfully demonstrated over three case studies including single- and multi-agent in straight-path and building evacuation scenarios. For example, the building evacuation time increased by more than 50% by inclusion of the aforementioned coupling. In conclusion, herein, a gap on the evacuation modelling is addressed by a fully coupled methodology that could be easily adapted by safety engineers and further improved by researchers as more data become available.

AB The Immune System is a complex adaptive system containing many details and many exceptions to established rules. Exceptions such as the suppression effect that causes T-cells to develop reversible aggressive and tolerant behaviors create difficulties for the study of immunology but also give hints to how artificial immune systems may be designed.
   Presented in this paper is the General Suppression Framework, which models the suppression hypothesis of the immune discrimination theory. A distributed control system based on the proposed framework is designed to control a modular robot configured into a planar manipulator arm. The modules can generate emergent group behaviors by exhibiting aggressive or tolerant behavior based on the environment change. A MATLAB simulation program is developed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the suppression mechanism and a mechanical arm is constructed to verify the control actions of the mechanism. The ultimate ambition of this work is to understand how the suppression mechanism affects the discrimination system and in turn affect other integral parts of the artificial immune system.

ID NEIGHBORHOOD ALGORITHM; GEOPHYSICAL INVERSION
AB This paper introduces a new stochastic approach for assisted history matching based on a continuous ant colony optimization algorithm. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a multi-agent optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of real ants. ACO is able to solve difficult optimization problems in both discrete and continuous variables. In the ACO algorithm, each artificial ant in the colony searches for good models in different regions of parameter space and shares information about the quality of the models with other agents. This gradually guides the colony towards models that match the desired behavior in our case the production history of the reservoir. The use of ACO for history matching has been illustrated on two reservoir simulation cases. The first case is Teal South model which is a real reservoir with a simple structure and a single producing well. History matching of this model is a low dimensional problem with eight parameters. The second case study is PUNQ-53 reservoir which has a more complex geological structure than Teal South model. This problem entails solving a high dimensional optimization problem.

AB Driver's guidance compliance behavior, which is a crucial link in Intelligent Traffic Guidance Systems (ITGS), has a direct impact on guidance effect. Based on State, Operator, and Result (SOAR), which was a cognitive architecture, the traffic compliance agent was designed and elaborated in detail. In the paper, working memory (WM), long-term memory (LTM), operator selection, impasse solving, expected travel time determination, and chunking rule generation were described with the consideration of practical situations. Finally, two simulations with different information release modes were carried out under the same given condition, one was based on real-time flow statistics (M1), and the other was based on flow forecasting (M2). Through analyzing the changes of drivers' compliance rates and vehicles' lane-changing times under Variable Message Sign (VMS), M2 was proven to be more effective in alleviating traffic jam in the morning and evening peak periods and bring a higher compliance rate. This study laid a foundation for selecting the release modes of guidance information in both theory and practice. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID COMPLEX NETWORKS; IDENTIFICATION; ALGORITHM
AB Identifying communities in social networks has been receiving the increasing attentions recently. However, the overlapping concept has received little attentions in the literature, although it is observed in almost all social networks. In this study, we propose a framework based on the game theory and the structural equivalence concept to address the detection of overlapping communities in social networks. Specifically, we consider the underlying graph as a hypothetical social networking website and regard each vertex of this graph as an agent performing in this multiagent environment. Since each agent may belong to several communities simultaneously, we are able to find overlapping community structure of social networks. The rigorous proof of the existence of Nash equilibrium in this game is provided which shows that the method always reaches to the final solution. Experimental results on the benchmark and real world graphs show superiority of our approach over the other state-of-the-art methods.

AB In dynamic ubiquitous computing environments, system entities may be classified into two main categories that are, in principle, in conflict. These are the Service Resource Requestors (SRRs) wishing to use services and/or exploit resources offered by the other system entities and the Service Resource Providers (SRPs) that offer the services/resources requested. Seeking for the maximisation of their welfare, while achieving their own goals and aims, entities may misbehave (intentionally or unintentionally), thus, leading to a significant deterioration of system's performance. In this study, a reputation mechanism is proposed which helps estimating SRPs trustworthiness and predicting their future behaviour, taking into account their past performance in consistently satisfying SRRs' expectations. Thereafter, under the assumption that a number of SRPs may handle the SRRs requests, the SRRs may decide on the most appropriate SRP for the service/resource requested on the basis of a weighted combination of the evaluation of the quality of their offer (performance related factor) and of their reputation rating (reliability related factor). The proposed trust management framework is distributed, considers both first-hand information (acquired from the SRR's direct past experiences with the SRPs) and second-hand information (disseminated from other SRRs' past experiences with the SRPs), while it exhibits a robust behaviour against inaccurate reputation ratings. The designed mechanisms have been empirically evaluated simulating interactions among self-interested agents, exhibiting improved performance with respect to random SRP selection.

DT Article
DE Nonlinear modeling predictive control; Biologically inspired swarm
   trajectory generation
ID FLOCKS
AB This paper presents a trajectory generation logic for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles which uses topological distances instead of metric values. Biologically inspired, this method evades exploiting distance measurements in the absence of such capabilities, as it happens in swarming birds. This newly developed trajectory generation logic provides a stable swarming logic which resembles a large aggregation of birds. The hypothesis of this work is that without depth perception, swarming birds rely primarily on their perception of other birds to estimate proximity and adjust repulsive and attractive forces in real-time. From previous biological behavior studies, it is known that a homogeneous and orderly aggregation is exhibited by swarming birds locating themselves side by side rather than in front or behind each other. This behavior, which is based on the relative spatial proximity perception to their nearest neighbors in the flock, allows birds to converge into a highly cohesive and coordinated formation without explicit control of inter-agent distances. Inspired by this biological pattern, a trajectory generation logic is designed and tested in controlling a multi-agent unmanned aerial systems without the use of inter-distances. A six degrees of freedom nonlinear dynamic model for an unmanned aircraft is used for simulation purposes. Each vehicle is provided with a decentralized agent-based robust nonlinear model predictive controller and a set of nonlinear guidance laws for trajectory tracking. The formulation of the proposed trajectory generation, as well as the selected aircraft control, constitute a truly decentralized technique, that allows for an unlimited number of agents within the swarm, as no centralized computations are made.

AB BACKGROUND
   We extend the, Wedding Ring. agent-based model of marriage formation to include some empirical information on the natural population change for the United Kingdom together with behavioural explanations that drive the observed nuptiality trends.
   OBJECTIVE
   We propose a method to explore statistical properties of agent-based demographic models. By coupling rule-based explanations driving the agent-based model with observed data we wish to bring agent-based modelling and demographic analysis closer together.
   METHODS
   We present a Semi-Artificial Model of Population, which aims to bridge demographic micro-simulation and agent-based traditions. We then utilise a Gaussian process emulator - a statistical model of the base model - to analyse the impact of selected model parameters on two key model outputs: population size and share of married agents. A sensitivity analysis is attempted, aiming to assess the relative importance of different inputs.
   RESULTS
   The resulting multi-state model of population dynamics has enhanced predictive capacity as compared to the original specification of the Wedding Ring, but there are some trade-offs between the outputs considered. The sensitivity analysis allows identification of the most important parameters in the modelled marriage formation process.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The proposed methods allow for generating coherent, multi-level agent-based scenarios aligned with some aspects of empirical demographic reality. Emulators permit a statistical analysis of their properties and help select plausible parameter values.
   COMMENTS
   Given non-linearities in agent-based models such as the Wedding Ring, and the presence of feedback loops, the uncertainty in the model may not be directly computable by using traditional statistical methods. The use of statistical emulators offers a way forward.

AB While structured by social and institutional networks, disease outbreaks are modulated by physical, economical, technological, communication, health, and governmental infrastructures. To systematically reason about the nature of outbreaks, the potential outcomes of media, prophylaxis, and vaccination campaigns, and the relative value of various early warning devices, social context, and infrastructure, must be considered. Numerical models provide a cost-effective ethical system for reasoning about such events. BioWar, a scalable citywide multiagent network numerical model, is described in this paper. BioWar simulates individuals as agents who are embedded in social, health, and professional networks and tracks the incidence of background and maliciously introduced diseases. In addition to epidemiology, BioWar simulates health-care-seeking behaviors, absenteeism patterns, and pharmaceutical purchases, information useful for syndromic and behavioral surveillance algorithms.

AB This paper presents a real-time cooperative multi-target tracking system. The system consists of a group of Active Vision Agents (AVAs, in short) representing a logical model of a network-connected computer with an active camera. All AVAS track their target objects cooperatively by interacting dynamically with each other. As a result, the system as a whole can track multiple moving objects simultaneously under complicated dynamic Situations in the real world. To implement real-time cooperation among AVAs. we designed a three-layered interaction architecture. In each layer, parallel processes mutually exchange a variety of information for effective cooperation. We employed the dynamic memory architecture to achieve real-time information exchange. Experimental results demonstrated that AVAS track their target objects cooperatively in real-time while adaptively changing their roles. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Social styles; Agent-based models; Macaque societies; Macaca tonkeana
AB The covariation hypothesis (Thierry 2004) describes conflict management and variations in social structure observed in macaque societies and arranges these species in four dominance styles or grades ranging from egalitarian to despotic. Using an agent-based model (i.e., A-KinGDom), we obtained a set of measurements to quantitatively define the four social styles in captive or semi-free-ranging conditions. Results showed that intensity of aggression was an important parameter involved in the emergence of dominance styles and its level was critical to defining grade 2 (i.e., the second of the two despotic grades described in macaques). In our simulations, grade 2 only appeared using high-intensity aggression values that reflected the phylogenetic origin of despotic grades. Moreover, comparison between simulation results and the data obtained on a semi-free ranging group of Macaca tonkeana (classified as grade 4, or egalitarian) showed the presence of traits close to despotic societies (for example, an increase of gradient of hierarchy or a decrease of reconciliation behaviors). These results both support assigning grade 4 to this macaque species according to its phylogenetic origins and indicate the presence of intra-group variability in semi-free ranging groups of macaques, which in turn yields valuable information of their current social structure and facilitate the handling of these groups.Significance statementWe have developed an agent-based model that drives the emergence of social styles in macaque societies. The results of our simulations suggest that social style in macaques is an emergent behavior and that agent-based models are a good tool for exploring emergent behaviors in silico. Moreover, these models can be used to assess hypotheses on social structure in macaque in semi-free-ranging conditions and report useful knowledge about specific techniques for group handling.

AB Underwater Inspection, Maintenance, and Repair operations are nowadays performed using Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) deployed from dynamic-positioning vessels, having high daily operational costs. During the last twenty years, the research community has been making an effort to design new Intervention Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (I-AUV), which could, in the near future, replace the ROVs, significantly decreasing these costs. Until now, the experimental work using I-AUVs has been limited to a few single-vehicle interventions, including object search and recovery, valve turning, and hot stab operations. More complex scenarios usually require the cooperation of multiple agents, i.e., the transportation of large and heavy objects. Moreover, using small, autonomous vehicles requires consideration of their limited load capacity and limited manipulation force/torque capabilities. Following the idea of multi-agent systems, in this paper we propose a possible solution: using a group of cooperating I-AUVs, thus sharing the load and optimizing the stress exerted on the manipulators. Specifically, we tackle the problem of transporting a long pipe. The presented ideas are based on a decentralized Task-Priority kinematic control algorithm adapted for the highly limited communication bandwidth available underwater. The aforementioned pipe is transported following a sequence of poses. A path-following algorithm computes the desired velocities for the robots' end-effectors, and the on-board controllers ensure tracking of these setpoints, taking into account the geometry of the pipe and the vehicles' limitations. The utilized algorithms and their practical implementation are discussed in detail and validated through extensive simulations and experimental trials performed in a test tank using two 8 DOF I-AUVs.

AB The classical theory of computation does not represent an adequate model of reality for simulation in the social sciences. The aim of this paper is to construct a methodological perspective that is able to conciliate the formal and empirical logic of program verification in computer science, with the interpretative and multiparadigmatic logic of the social sciences. We attempt to evaluate whether social simulation implies an additional perspective about the way one can understand the concepts of program and computation. We demonstrate that the logic of social simulation implies at least two distinct types of program verifications that reflect an epistemological distinction in the kind of knowledge one can have about programs. Computer programs seem to possess a causal capability (Fetzer, 1999) and an intentional capability that scientific theories seem not to possess. This distinction is associated with two types of program verification, which we call empirical and intentional verification. We demonstrate, by this means, that computational phenomena are also intentional phenomena, and that such is particularly manifest in agent-based social simulation. Ascertaining the credibility of results in social simulation requires a focus on the identification of a new category of knowledge we can have about computer programs. This knowledge should be considered an outcome of an experimental exercise, albeit not empirical, acquired within a context of limited consensus. The perspective of intentional computation seems to be the only one possible to reflect the multiparadigmatic character of social science in terms of agent-based computational social science. We contribute, additionally, to the clarification of several questions that are found in the methodological perspectives of the discipline, such as the computational nature, the logic of program scalability, and the multi paradigmatic character of agent-based simulation in the social sciences.

AB Natural systems are inextricably affected by noise. Within recent decades, the manner in which noise affects the collective behavior of self-organized systems, specifically, has garnered considerable interest from researchers and developers in various fields. To describe the collective motion of multiple interacting particles, Vicsek et al. proposed a well-known self-propelled particle (SPP) system, which exhibits a second-order phase transition from disordered to ordered motion in simulation; due to its non-equilibrium, randomness, and strong coupling nonlinear dynamics, however, there has been no rigorous analysis of such a system to date. To decouple systems consisting of deterministic laws and randomness, we propose a general method which transfers the analysis of these systems to the design of cooperative control algorithms. In this study, we rigorously analyzed the original Vicsek model under both open and periodic boundary conditions for the first time, and developed extensions to heterogeneous SPP systems (including leader-follower models) using the proposed method. Theoretical results show that SPP systems switch an infinite number of times between ordered and disordered states for any noise intensity and population density, which implies that the phase transition indeed takes a nontraditional form. We also investigated the robust consensus and connectivity of these systems. Moreover, the findings presented in this paper suggest that our method can be used to predict possible configurations during the evolution of complex systems, including turn, vortex, bifurcation, and flock merger phenomena as they appear in SPP systems.

DT Article
ID GAS-SOLIDS FLOW; CHAOTIC BEHAVIOR; REACTORS; FLUCTUATIONS; PRESSURE
AB In this paper we explore the global dynamics of an agent-type model for bubbles in gas-fluidized beds and demonstrate that these features are consistent with experimentally observed behavior. The model accounts for the simultaneous interactions of thousands of individual bubbles and includes mass-transfer and first-order reactions between the gas and solids so that the impact of the dynamics is reflected in reactant conversion. We start with model parameters that have been demonstrated to produce time average behavior consistent with experimental reactor measurements. By observing the temporal variations of spatially averaged bubble properties, we are able to clearly distinguish the onset of global low-dimensional features that appear to be consistent with previous observations. The most prominent of these features is a large-scale oscillation that exhibits intermittency with power-law scaling in the vicinity of a critical gas flow. We show that the oscillation occurs as the result of a globally synchronized horizontal movement of the bubbles toward the center of the reactor. The oscillation appears to be consistent with the occurrence of the so-called "slugging" phenomenon, which is known to have large effects on fluidized bed reactor performance. Although this model can clearly be further improved, its success in replicating several of the key features of slugging indicates that this approach can serve as a useful tool for understanding and possibly controlling fluidized bed dynamics. We also conjecture that this model may be useful for more generally understanding the occurrence of global features in high-dimensional, multi-agent systems. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.

AB This paper presents an optimal control method for consensus of satellite cluster flight under a kind of energy matching condition. Firstly, the relation between energy matching and satellite periodically bounded relative motion is analyzed, and the satellite energy matching principle is applied to configure the initial conditions. Then, period-delayed errors are adopted as state variables to establish the period-delayed errors dynamics models of a single satellite and the cluster. Next a novel satellite cluster feedback control protocol with coupling gain is designed, so that the satellite cluster periodically bounded relative motion consensus problem (period-delayed errors state consensus problem) is transformed to the stability of a set of matrices with the same low dimension. Based on the consensus region theory in the research of multi-agent system consensus issues, the coupling gain can be obtained to satisfy the requirement of consensus region and decouple the satellite cluster information topology and the feedback control gain matrix, which can be determined by Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) optimal method. This method can realize the consensus of satellite cluster period-delayed errors, leading to the consistency of semi-major axes (SMA) and the energy-matching of satellite cluster. Then satellites can emerge the global coordinative cluster behavior. Finally the feasibility and effectiveness of the present energy-matching optimal consensus for satellite cluster flight is verified through numerical simulations. (C) 2017 COSPAR.

AB The primary hypothesis stated by this paper is that the use of social choice theory in Ambient Intelligence systems can improve significantly users' satisfaction when accessing shared resources. A research methodology based on agent based social simulations is employed to support this hypothesis and to evaluate these benefits. The result is a sixfold contribution summarized as follows. Firstly, several considerable differences between this application case and the most prominent social choice application, political elections, have been found and described. Secondly, given these differences, a number of metrics to evaluate different voting systems in this scope have been proposed and formalized. Thirdly, given the presented application and the metrics proposed, the performance of a number of well known electoral systems is compared. Fourthly, as a result of the performance study, a novel voting algorithm capable of obtaining the best balance between the metrics reviewed is introduced. Fifthly, to improve the social welfare in the experiments, the voting methods are combined with cluster analysis techniques. Finally, the article is complemented by a free and open-source tool, VoteSim, which ensures not only the reproducibility of the experimental results presented, but also allows the interested reader to adapt the case study presented to different environments.

AB "Statistical abstraction for multi-scale spatio-temporal systems" proposes a methodology that supports analysis of large-scaled spatio-temporal systems. These are represented via a set of agents whose behaviour depends on a perceived field. The proposed approach is based on a novel simulation strategy based on a statistical abstraction of the agents. The abstraction makes use of Gaussian Processes, a powerful class of nonparametric regression techniques from Bayesian Machine Learning, to estimate the agent's behaviour given the environmental input. The authors use two biological case studies to show how the proposed technique can be used to speed up simulations and provide further insights into model behaviour. This replicated computation results report focuses on the scripts used in the paper to perform such analysis. The required software was straightforward to install and use. All the experimental results from the paper have been reproduced.

AB The continuous development of the service economy and an aging society with fewer children is expected to lead to a shortage of workers in the near future. In addition, the growth of the service economy would require service providers to meet various service requirements. In this regard, self-service technology (SST) is a promising alternative to securing labor in both developed and emerging countries. SST is expected to coordinate the controllable productive properties in order to optimize resources and minimize consumer stress. As services are characterized by simultaneity and inseparability, a smoother operation in cooperation with the consumer is required to provide a certain level of service. This study focuses on passenger handling in an airport departure lobby with the objective of optimizing multiple service resources comprising interpersonal service staff and self-service kiosks. Our aim is to elucidate the passenger decision-making mechanism of choosing either interpersonal service or self-service as the check-in option, and to apply it to analyze several scenarios to determine the best practice. The experimental space is studied and an agent-based model is proposed to analyze the operational efficiency via a simulation. We expand on a previous SST adoption model, which is enhanced by introducing the concept of individual traits. We focus on the decision-making of individuals who are neutral toward the service option, by tracking the actual activity of passengers and mapping their behavior into the model. A new method of validation that follows a different approach is proposed to ensure that this model approximates real-world situations. A scenario analysis is then carried out with the aim of exploring the best operational practice to minimize the stress experienced by the air travelers and to meet the business needs of the airline managers at the airport. We collected actual data from the Departure Control System of an airline to map the real-world data to the proposed model. Passenger behavior was extracted by front-line service experts and clarified through consecutive on-site observations.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the activity of a methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (MDPB)-containing self-etching primer (Clearfil Protect Bond) against Streptococcus mutans and its ability to reduce biofilm formation on standardized experimental Class I restorations in vitro.
   Materials and Methods: Forty experimental Class I round restorations were prepared on enamel-dentin slabs using different adhesive strategies: group 1 = MDPB-containing adhesive system (Clearfil Protect Bond); group 2 = MDPB-free self-etching adhesive system (Clearfil SE Bond); group 3: MDPB-containing self-etching primer in combination with a fluoride-free bonding agent; group 4: MDPB-free self-etching primer in combination with a fluoride-containing bonding agent; group 5: a three-step etch-and-rinse adhesive system (Adper Scotchbond Multi Purpose). A Streptococcus mutans biofilm was grown for 48 h on the restoration surfaces and subsequently evaluated using scanning electron microscopy on three different areas: enamel, composite, and interface surfaces. Statistical analysis was performed by multiple ANOVA after data transformation.
   Results: Specimens in groups 2, 4 and 5 showed greater biofilm formation than those in groups 1 and 3 (p < 0.001) on all investigated substrates (enamel, composite, and interface areas).
   Conclusions: Specimens prepared with an MDPB-containing primer exhibited significant decreases in biofilm formation on Class I restorations in vitro. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to clarify the role of quaternary ammonium compounds in reducing bacterial biofilm formation on restoration surfaces.

AB In this study we examine the relationship between supply network's topology and its robustness in the presence of random failures and targeted attacks. The agent-based model developed in this paper uses the basic framework and parameters in the experimental game presented in Sterman [1989, Modeling managerial behavior: Misperceptions of feedback in a dynamic decision making context. Management Science, 35 (3), 321-339] for modelling adaptive managerial decision making in an inventory management context. The study extends the linear supply chain context to a complex supply network and undertakes a rigorous examination of robustness of these supply networks that are characterised by distinct network characteristics. We theorise that network characteristics such as average path length, clustering coefficient, size of the largest connected component in the network and the maximum distance between nodes in the largest connected component are related to the robustness of supply networks, and test the research hypotheses using data from several simulation runs. Simulations were carried out using 20 distinct network topologies where 10 of these topologies were generated using preferential attachment approach (based on the theory of scale-free networks) and the remaining 10 topologies were generated using random attachment approach (using random graph theory as a foundation). These 20 supply networks were subjected to random demand and their performances were evaluated by considering varying probabilities of random failures of nodes and targeted attacks on nodes. We also consider the severity of these disruptions by considering the downtime of the affected nodes. Using the data collected from a series of simulation experiments, we test the research hypotheses by means of binomial logistic regression analysis. The results point towards a significant association between network characteristics and supply network robustness assessed using multiple performance measures. We discuss the implications of the study and present directions for future research.

AB We propose a novel agent-based implementation of Festinger's social comparison theory (SCT). The social comparison model (SCM) consists of connectionist networks that simulate agent-level social comparison processes. Agent networks are combined into an adaptive network structure that is shaped by social comparisons between individual agents. Simulations show how the SCM produces behavior consistent with the empirical literature on group dynamics. In addition, experimental results are reported that show how the SCM can simulate how critical and conformist norms affect interpersonal processes and emergent attitudes. We conclude that the coupling of simulations and experiments, and the use of psychologically plausible agent models within adaptive network structures, can provide new impetus to the development of models of individual and social cognition. An integrated framework such as the SCM allows investigating key theoretical predictions around the origin and maintenance of socially shared information through social comparisons in fundamentally novel ways.

AB Ant-based algorithms simulate the cooperative behaviour of real ants in finding food resources. A significant number of studies have focused on the self-organised behaviour of ants in the natural environment to develop effective systems for dynamic problems. Ant-based systems have special properties such as scalability, adaptability, and dynamicity, which are the main requirements for solving vehicle traffic congestion problem. Thus, ant-based algorithms are now being adopted by vehicle traffic systems (VTSs) to guide vehicles to less congested paths. However, literature shows that comprehensive reviews are lacking in this field. The main contribution of this paper is the review and classification of the most relevant systems based on novel taxonomy. A survey that includes statistical analyses on ant-based VTS was conducted to identify the limitations and evaluation process of VTS. This paper concludes by proposing a general framework in applying ant colony optimisation to VTS.

DE computer-based social simulation; choice models; Axelrod's tribute
   model; experimental methodologies for self-motivated agents
AB We consider Robert Axelrod's tribute model at the light shed by the development of a choice framework called BVG (beliefs, values and goals). BVG agents use multi-varied, situated and individual rationality to perform adaptive choices in social environments. We then take the original experiment and carry it over using this choice scheme. By explicitly representing the agents preferences and the related decisional mechanisms, we are able to easily extend the experiment to tackle issues only implicitly addressed. The outcome of these new experiments is somewhat surprising, and seems to undermine the original conclusions. The experiments were carried out in a similar way to that of the original ones. However, we sustain that a more holistic attitude towards experimentation may be preferable. We conclude by arguing that the model of multiple values may help to principle the relation between experimenter and experiment, through the strengthening of bridges between the design of the experiment and the design of the agents involved in the simulation.

AB Evolutionary game theory (EGT) provides a powerful tool with which to unpack the interactive strategies of polluting enterprises (PEs), local government regulators (LG), and central government planners (CG) in China. Here, the prevailing institutional system of fiscal decentralization sees regulatory mandates set by the CG and enforced at the LG level. This delegation shapes managers' incentives when deciding the degree to which firms will incur costs to reduce pollution and comply with state directives. Manager's choice sets draw shape from decisions at the LG level, where regulators balance the pursuit of environmental quality with the economic payoffs of tacit collusion with industry. LG and PEs incentives reciprocally shape and draw shape from outcomes at the CG level, where policymakers decide the degree to which they will support and supervise the behavior of LGs. By exploring the evolution of different participants' behavior and their evolutionary stable strategy (ESS) in line with the duplication of dynamic equations, EGT enables a robust, quantitative analysis of this iterative, interactive, three-player game, A numerical example serves to verify the theoretical results and support four key insights. First, the selection of environmental strategies manifest in a dynamic process of constant adjustment and optimization. Second, LGs outperform by integrating decisions from both CG and PEs in weighing alternative environmental strategies. Third, reducing regulatory costs at the CG level cascades to strengthen penalties for local violations and improve mitigation incentives in ways that aid an evolutionary game to converge on an ideal decision state. Fourth, a stable equilibrium cannot persist to allow LGs to sustain behaviors towards a "race to the bottom", even in the total absence of central regulation or high levels of dominance of polluting firms of LG regulators. EGT thus not only outcomes shed light on the full variation set of game outcomes, it also reveals the consequences of variable levels of collusion between LGs and PEs and options for the redesign of incentive mechanisms to reform the regulatory regime and improve market outcomes in China.

AB Validating a computational model is important as it establishes that the model has met its intended purpose of representing the system under study. In this paper, we perform a validation study on Construct, a multiagent network model for the coevolution of agents and the sociocultural environments that they inhabit. In particular, we focus on validating agent interactions produced by the model against empirical communication networks collected in real-world organizations. Validation is performed using our novel calibrated grounding technique. Results show that Construct can produce valid agent interactions. The benefits and implications of the study are discussed.

DT Article
AB Group consensus seeking is investigated for a class of discrete-time heterogeneous multiagent systems composed of first-order and second-order agents with both communication and input time delays. Considering two types of system topologies, novel protocols based on the competitive and cooperative relationships among the agents are presented, respectively. By matrix theory and frequency domain analysis method, the sufficient conditions solving consensus problem are obtained. The results show that the achievement of group consensus is bound up with the input time delays, coupling weights between the agents and the system's control parameters, but it is irrelevant to the communication delays. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of the theoretical results.

AB Modelling spatio-temporal systems exhibiting multi-scale behaviour is a powerful tool in many branches of science, yet it still presents significant challenges. Here, we consider a general two-layer (agent-environment) modelling framework, where spatially distributed agents behave according to external inputs and internal computation; this behaviour may include influencing their immediate environment, creating a medium over which agent-agent interaction signals can be transmitted. We propose a novel simulation strategy based on a statistical abstraction of the agent layer, which is typically the most detailed component of the model and can incur significant computational cost in simulation. The abstraction makes use of Gaussian Processes, a powerful class of non-parametric regression techniques from Bayesian Machine Learning, to estimate the agent's behaviour given the environmental input. We show on two biological case studies how this technique can be used to speed up simulations and provide further insights into model behaviour.

AB In this paper, we deal with a double control task for a group of interacting agents that have second-order dynamics. Adopting the leader-follower paradigm, the given multiagent system is required to maintain a desired formation and to collectively track a velocity reference provided by an external source only to a single agent at time, called the "leader." We prove that it is possible to optimize the group performance by persistently selecting online the leader among the agents. To do this, we first define a suitable error metric that is able to capture the tracking performance of the multiagent group while maintaining a desired formation through a (even time-varying) communication-graph topology. Then, we show that this depends on the algebraic connectivity and on the maximum eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix of a special directed graph depending on the selected leader. By exploiting these theoretical results, we finally design a fully distributed adaptive procedure that is able to periodically select online the optimum leader among the neighbors of the current one. The effectiveness of the proposed solution against other possible strategies is confirmed by numerical simulations.

AB Rapid urban growth is becoming a serious problem in most developing countries. Tehran, the capital of Iran, stands out as a vibrant metropolitan area, facing uncontrolled urban expansion. Public authorities and decision makers require planning criteria regarding possible spatial developments. To monitor past developmental trends and to simulate emerging spatiotemporal patterns of urban growth, this research applies a geosimulation approach that couples agent-based modeling with multicriteria analysis (MCA) for the period between 1986 and 2006. To model the major determinants controlling urban development, three agent groups are defined, namely developer agents, government agents, and resident agents. The behaviors of each agent group are identified by qualitative surveys and are considered separately using multi-criteria analysis. The interactions of the agents are then combined through overlay functions within a Geographic Information System (GIS). This analysis results in the creation of a propensity surface of growth that is able to identify the most probable sites for urban development. Subsequently, a Markov Chain Model (MCM) and a concise statistical extrapolation are used to determine the amount of probable future expansion in Tehran. For validation purposes, the model is estimated using 2011 data and then validated based on actual urban expansion. Given the accurate predictions of the Markov Chain Model, further predictions were carried out for 2016 and 2026. This simulation provides strong evidence that during the next decade planning authorities will have to cope with continuous as well as heterogeneously distributed urban growth. Both the monitoring of growth and simulation revealed significant developments in the northwestern part of Tehran, continuing toward the south along the interchange networks.

AB Policy making for complex Social-Ecological Systems (SESs) is a multi-factorial and multi-stakeholder decision making process. Therefore, proper policy simulation in a SES should consider both the complex behavior of the system and the multi-stakeholders' interventions into the system, which requires integrated methodological approaches. In this study, we simulate impacts of policy options on a farming community facing water scarcity in Rafsanjan, Iran, using an integrated modeling methodology combining an Agent Based Model (ABM) with Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM). First, the behavioral rules of farmers and the causal relations among environmental variables are captured with FCMs that are developed with both qualitative and quantitative data, i.e. farmers' knowledge and empirical data from studies. Then, an ABM is developed to model decisions and actions of farmers and simulate their impacts on overall groundwater use and emigration of farmers in this case study. Finally, the impacts of different policy options are simulated and compared with a baseline scenario. The results suggest that a policy of facilitating farmers' participation in management and control of their groundwater use leads to the highest reduction of groundwater use and would help to secure farmers' activities in Rafsanjan. Our approach covers four main aspects that are crucial for policy simulation in SESs: 1) causal relationships, 2) feedback mechanisms, 3) social-spatial heterogeneity and 4) temporal dynamics. This approach is particularly useful for ex-ante policy options analysis.

AB In many social dilemmas, individuals tend to generate a situation with low payoffs instead of a system optimum ("tragedy of the commons"). Is the routing of traffic a similar problem? In order to address this question, we present experimental results on humans playing a route choice game in a computer laboratory, which allow one to study decision behavior in repeated games beyond the Prisoner's Dilemma. We will focus on whether individuals manage to find a cooperative and fair solution compatible with the system-optimal road usage. We find that individuals tend towards a user equilibrium with equal travel times in the beginning. However, after many iterations, they often establish a coherent oscillatory behavior, as taking turns performs better than applying pure or mixed strategies. The resulting behavior is fair and compatible with system-optimal road usage. In spite of the complex dynamics leading to coordinated oscillations, we have identified mathematical relationships quantifying the observed transition process. Our main experimental discoveries for 2- and 4-person games can be explained with a novel reinforcement learning model for an arbitrary number of persons, which is based on past experience and trial-and-error behavior. Gains in the average payoff seem to be an important driving force for the innovation of time-dependent response patterns, i.e. the evolution of more complex strategies. Our findings are relevant for decision support systems and routing in traffic or data networks.

AB In this paper, a virtual power market model is proposed to investigate the behavior of power market players from regulator's point of view. In this approach, strategic players are modeled in a multi-agent environment. These agents which are virtual representative of actual players forecast the prices and participate in the markets, exactly the same as real world situation. In addition, the role of ISO is encountered by using security constraint unit commitment (SCUC) and security constraint economic dispatch (SCED) solutions. Moreover, the interaction between market players is modeled using a heuristic dynamic game theory algorithm based on the supply function equilibria (SFE). In addition to the collusive behavior, using the proposed model, the short-term strategic behavior of players, which their effects will appear in long-term, can be simulated.
   The proposed model enables the market regulators to make decision before implementing new market rules with the confidence of their results. To represent the effectiveness of the proposed method, a case study including wind power plants is considered and the impact of various market rules on players' behavior is simulated and discussed. Numerical studies indicate that simulating the strategic and collusive behavior prior to any change in the market rules is necessary. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development issues in developing countries belong to complex situations where society and environment are intricate. However, such sites lack the necessary amount of reliable, checkable data and information, while these very constraining factors determine the populations' evolutions, such as villagers living in Sahelian environments. Beyond a game-theory model that leads to a premature selection of the relevant variables, we build an individual-centered, empirical, KIDS-oriented (Keep It Descriptive & Simple), and multidisciplinary agent-based model focusing on the villagers' differential accesses to economic and production activities according to social rules and norms, mainly driven by social criteria from which gender and rank within the family are the most important, as they were observed and registered during individual interviews. The purpose of the work is to build a valid and robust model that overcome this lack of data by building a individual specific system of behaviour rules conditioning these differential accesses showing the long-term catalytic effects of small changes of social rules. The model-building methodology is thereby crucial: the interviewing process provided the behaviour rules and criteria while the context, i.e. the economic, demographic and agro-ecological environment is described following published or unpublished literature. Thanks to a sensitivity analysis on several selected parameters, the model appears fairly robust and sensitive enough. The confidence building simulation outputs reasonably reproduces the dynamics of local situations and is consistent with three authors having investigated in our site. Thanks to its empirical approach and its balanced conception between sociology and agro-ecology at the relevant scale, i.e. the individual tied to social relations, limitations and obligations and connected with his/her biophysical and economic environment, the model can be considered as an efficient "trend provider" but not an absolute "figure provider" for simulating rural societies of the Nigrien Sahel and testing scenarios on the same context. Such ABMs can be a useful interface to analyze social stakes in development projects.

AB One of the most influencing elements in inhabitants' earthquake safety definition is represented by the interactions between people and post-event environment in urban scenarios. Understanding and simulating rules for pedestrians' motion in earthquake evacuation could be useful to inquire the risk assessment introducing the "human" factor influence: integrated "risk maps" could be realized by combining results of similar analyses with the traditional site hazard, buildings vulnerability and exposition indices. This work proposes an innovative approach based on the analysis of these interactions. Two experimentally-based activities are required: an analysis of human behaviors towards the post-earthquake environment; a relation for defining environmental modifications. Results firstly show a summary of man-environment interactions in earthquake evacuations. A possible criterion for path choice in evacuation is also numerically defined. A theoretical agent-based model is developed on these bases and summarizes phases, motion rules and man-environment interactions in earthquake pedestrians' evacuation in urban scenarios. Secondly, quick criteria for scenario modifications involving ruins formation are proposed and evaluated: for each building, the percentages of internal and external ruins area is a function of its vulnerability and the expected earthquake Richter magnitude. Moreover, the external ruins formation criterion is validated by comparing predicted and effective values of ruins area depth in real cases. The model could be proposed as a tool for evaluating probable pedestrians' choices in post-event scenarios, in order to reduce the interferences between the built environment and the evacuation process through interventions on buildings, urban fabric and strategies for emergency management.

AB In this paper, we present some of our ongoing experimental research towards investigating advantages of modeling other agents in multiagent environments. We attempt to quantify the value or utility of building models about other agents using no more than the observation of others' behavior. We are interested in empirically showing that a modeler agent can take advantage of building and updating its beliefs about other agents. This advantage can make it perform better than an agent without modeling capabilities. We have been conducting a simulataion-based study using a competitive game called Meeting Scheduling Game as a testbed. First, we briefly describe our multiagent simultaion testbed. Then, we describe in detail our experimental study. We explore a range of strategies from least- to most-informed, and present some of our preliminary results on the relative performance of these strategies. Decreasing the a priori knowledge about the others and increasing the modeling capabilities we are able to define a series of "modeler" agents. Finally, we present a method for using probabilistic models about the others in such a way that the expected utility is maximized.

Without the guidance of a global beacon or a global reference framework, the desired collective behavior occurs provided that the associated network of the multivehicle system is jointly connected. The effectiveness of the approach is verified through theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental results.

ID HEAVY TAILS; BURSTS; IMPACT
AB This paper studies the human behavior in the top-one social network system in China (Sina Microblog system). By analyzing real-life data at a large scale, we find that the message releasing interval (intermessage time) obeys power law distribution both at individual level and at group level. Statistical analysis also reveals that human behavior in social network is mainly driven by four basic elements: social pressure, social identity, social participation, and social relation between individuals. Empirical results present the four elements' impact on the human behavior and the relation between these elements. To further understand the mechanism of such dynamic phenomena, a hybrid human dynamic model which combines "interest" of individual and "interaction" among people is introduced, incorporating the four elements simultaneously. To provide a solid evaluation, we simulate both two-agent and multiagent interactions with real-life social network topology. We achieve the consistent results between empirical studies and the simulations. The model can provide a good understanding of human dynamics in social network.

AB The modeling and simulation (M&S) of large crowd has become increasingly important in the domain of public security, such as facility planning, disaster response, and anti-terrorism operations. The behavior of a large crowd is highly complex, and the M&S of a large crowd at the individual level therefore demands the support of a scalable and efficient computing technology. In this study, a method was proposed to formulate crowd behavior with the cell automata and multi-agent models, which were successfully mapped onto the MapReduce programming model. A simulation framework was developed upon Hadoop to simulate large crowd scenarios over a cluster. The simulation process was then transformed to a series of parallel operations on data streams. The simulation studies on a large-scale evacuation scenario had indicated that the simulation framework ensured the simulation process' logic correctness. Experimental results also showed that the Hadoop-based simulation framework could complete five times more tasks while consuming only 19 % CPU time in comparison with the conventional simulation technology.

AB This paper addresses the cooperative adaptive consensus tracking for a group of multiple nonholonomic mobile robots, where the nonholonomic robot model is assumed to be a canonical vehicle having two actuated wheels and one passive wheel. By integrating a kinematic controller and a torque controller for the nonholonomic robotic system, a cooperative adaptive consensus tracking strategy is developed for the uncertain dynamic models using Lyapunov-like analysis in combination with backstepping approach and sliding mode technique. A key feature of the developed adaptive consensus tracking algorithm is the introduction of a directed network topology into the control constraints based on algebraic graph theory to characterise the communication interaction among robots, which plays an important role in realising the cooperative consensus tracking with respect to a specific common reference trajectory. Furthermore, a novel framework is proposed for developing a unified methodology for the convergence analysis of the closed-loop control systems, which can fully ensure the desired adaptive consensus tracking for multiple nonholonomic mobile robots. Subsequently, illustrative examples and numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate and visualise the theoretical results.

ID ORGANIZATION
AB Large-scale multiagent teamwork has been popular in various domains. Similar to human society infrastructure, agents only coordinate with some of the others, with a peer-to-peer complex network structure. Their organization has been proven as a key factor to influence their performance. To expedite team performance, we have analyzed that there are three key factors. First, complex network effects may be able to promote team performance. Second, coordination interactions coming from their sources are always trying to be routed to capable agents. Although they could be transferred across the network via different paths, their sources and sinks depend on the intrinsic nature of the team which is irrelevant to the network connections. In addition, the agents involved in the same plan often form a subteam and communicate with each other more frequently. Therefore, if the interactions between agents can be statistically recorded, we are able to set up an integrated network adjustment algorithm by combining the three key factors. Based on our abstracted teamwork simulations and the coordination statistics, we implemented the adaptive reorganization algorithm. The experimental results briefly support our design that the reorganized network is more capable of coordinating heterogeneous agents.

TI Max-min fair allocation for resources with hybrid divisibilities
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

DE Max-min fair allocation; Indivisible resources; Divisible resources;
   Multi-agent systems
ID APPROXIMATION; ALGORITHM
AB Resource allocation is a classic problem in economics and computer science. The application scenarios of resource allocation include inheritance settlements, computation resource sharing and so on. This paper focuses on the max-min fair allocation of resources in which m resources need to be allocated to n agents while maximizing the minimum utility of any agent. When money transfer is not allowed, the existing work on max-min fair allocation only focuses on the fair allocation of indivisible resources. However, in real applications, the allocated resource set may simultaneously include indivisible resources and divisible resources, e.g., the allocated resources in distributed systems include the indivisible CPU resources, the divisible storage resource and the divisible bandwidth resource. The combination of indivisible resources and divisible resources creates a new challenge and requires us to consider how to coordinate the allocations of indivisible resources and divisible resources in the allocation process. Therefore, we investigate the combined max-min fair allocation problem in which the allocated resource set consists of both indivisible resources and divisible resources. We present a 6+2 root 10 + epsilon (epsilon > 0)-factor approximation algorithm for the restricted case where u(ij) is an element of {0, u(j)} (i.e., the utility of a resource j is either 0 or u(j) for each agent i) and the agent valuations for the divisible resources are in proximity to each other. Moreover, we propose an approximation algorithm for the general case based on the augmented flow idea. Experiments conducted on real data show that the average performance of the proposed approximation algorithm is better than 80% of the performance of the optimal algorithm, which requires exponential time in the worst case unless P = NP. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first approximation algorithm for the general case of the combined max-min fair allocation problem when money transfer is not allowed. The proposed algorithm can be adopted to design more efficient expert systems that apply to resource allocation in distributed systems, inheritance settlements and so on. The adoption of the proposed algorithm contributes to promoting the broader application of expert systems in the fair allocation of computation resources and social resources. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can perform well in real applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The tools and methods developed by different scientific communities to simulate the dynamics of land use have emphasised either processes or patterns of changes. Agent-based models (ABM) belong to the former category while many spatially explicit simulation models belong to the latter. These two different modelling approaches were jointly implemented at a study site in Vietnam to assess their respective strengths and weaknesses with respect to their capacity to support the formulation of land-use policy and to influence decision making by multiple groups of stakeholders. SAMBA is a people-centred approach combining an ABM, a role-playing game and a geographic information system. Participatory simulations help elicit the rules of the ABM and calibrate the model, while the model supports the participatory exploration of land-use change scenarios over longer time periods. CLUE-s is a spatial simulation model which explores changes in land-use patterns within user-specified rules of permissible change and rates of change. Driving factors that influence changes from one land-use type to another are defined by combining spatially explicit data on land use and supposed driving factors in a logistical regression analysis. Alternatively, the decision rules that were revealed during the participatory simulations - with the role plays and the multi-agent modelling of the SAMBA approach - were incorporated in the CLUE-s model to provide more realistic estimates for the varying influence of land-use drivers. We checked the respective validity of the two models by applying them at the same site and comparing their outputs. As a result, no single approach was obviously superior according to the validation statistics. The three approaches turned out to be complementary in simulating land-use patterns, while providing different types of information. Integration of the two models into a rule-based version of CLUE-s helped reconciling data-driven statistical models and process-driven agent-based models in LUCC research. This new model reinforced the overall framework by facilitating the partnership between researchers from different scientific communities and between researchers and multiple groups of stakeholders. it may also better respond to the expectations of land users at different levels of the decision-making hierarchy.

DE Collective behaviours; connectivity control; distributed control
AB Given a team composed of groups of robots with different abilities and different tasks, we propose a control solution that allows maintaining the connectivity between the agents whilst securing the execution of the different tasks assigned to the team. The specific notion of connectivity adopted here is that the different agents have to mutually remain in line-of-sight, and this condition is guaranteed in presence of obstacles. In the computation of the graph topology, based on Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), each agent takes into account the surrounding environment, its own task and the tasks of its neighbours. Our solution permits the execution of heterogeneous tasks and the task dynamic reallocation between the robots when required by the situation. The approach relies on a sound theoretical framework, which is discussed in this letter, while its practical feasibility is shown through simulations and experimental data using real robotic platforms.

AB A quantitative understanding of the potential influence of engineered and natural stabilizing agents on the transport behavior of engineered nanomaterials will be crucial to assessing their environmental fate. Column transport experiments conducted with CdSe/ZnS quantum dot nanocrystals (QD) stabilized with poly-(acrylic-acid)-octylamine (PAA-OA) yielded retention profiles that exhibited increased retention with distance from the inlet, a trend which could not be reproduced by existing nanoparticle transport models. To address this shortcoming, a new Multi-Constituent Site-Blocking (MCB) model was developed and implemented to simulate coupled transport and retention of nanoparticles and stabilizing agents. Mass balance equations for solution constituents are linked through a Langmuir-type blocking term that accounts for the surface area occupied by each constituent. The model successfully reproduced experimental observations of delayed QD breakthrough and retention profiles. These results support the hypothesis that stabilizing agents present in the nanoparticle suspension inhibit deposition, facilitating enhanced nanoparticle mobility in the columns. Inter-model comparisons and model sensitivity analyses examine the dependence of nanoparticle mobility on the relative concentration and adsorption properties of the stabilizing agents. Modeling results indicate that both synergistic and competitive interactions between nanomaterials and stabilizing agents should be accounted for in order to accurately predict nanoparticle transport behavior in subsurface environments.

AB An empirical and comparative evaluation of multiagent taxi dispatch with extended (E) runtime taxi availability is presented. A taxi in operation is said to be E-runtime available if it has a passenger alighting in delta x > 0 minutes' time or is empty, but has no new committed taxi request to service next. In a multiagent architecture, we consider a new operation policy wherein agents of E-runtime available taxis are allowed to negotiate in individual groups of size N for new taxi requests. The main objective is to present an evaluation of the multiagent system performance gains provided by different times-to-arrival of dx, under a discrete range of demand rates for several N-group sizes, as compared with the base case when delta x = 0. It is shown that the proposed policy can effectively reduce customer waiting time and empty taxi cruising time by up to about 60% and 96%, respectively, when the service demand is high for a 1000-strong taxi fleet. It is observed that the value selection for the policy parameter dx is an important aspect for improving the general performance of multiagent taxi dispatch.

DE Emergent behavior; complex system; multiagent system; simulation
AB Emergence becomes a distinguishing system feature as system complexity grows with the number of components, interactions, and connectivities. Examples of emergent behaviors include the flocking of birds, traffic jams, and hubs in social networks, among others. Despite significant research interest in recent years, there is a lack of formal methods to understand, identify, and predict emergent behavior in multiagent systems. Existing approaches either require detailed prior knowledge about emergent behavior or are computationally infeasible. This article introduces a grammar-based approach to formalize and identify the existence and extent of emergence without the need for prior knowledge of emergent properties. Our approach is based on weak (basic) emergence that is both generated and autonomous from the underlying agents. We employ formal grammars to capture agent interactions in the forms of words written on a common tape. Our formalism captures agents of diverse types and open systems. We propose an automated approach for the identification of emergent behavior and show its benefits through theoretical and experimental analysis. We also propose a significant reduction of state-space explosion through the use of our proposed degree of interaction metrics. Our experiments using the boids model show the feasibility of our approach but also highlight future avenues of improvement.

AB In complex biological systems, simple individual-level behavioral rules can give rise to emergent group-level behavior. While collective behavior has been well studied in cells and larger organisms, the mesoscopic scale is less understood, as it is unclear which sensory inputs and physical processes matter a priori. Here, we investigate collective feeding in the roundworm C. elegans at this intermediate scale, using quantitative phenotyping and agent-based modeling to identify behavioral rules underlying both aggregation and swarming-a dynamic phenotype only observed at longer timescales. Using fluorescence multi-worm tracking, we quantify aggregation in terms of individual dynamics and population-level statistics. Then we use agent-based simulations and approximate Bayesian inference to identify three key behavioral rules for aggregation: cluster-edge reversals, a density-dependent switch between crawling speeds, and taxis towards neighboring worms. Our simulations suggest that swarming is simply driven by local food depletion but otherwise employs the same behavioral mechanisms as the initial aggregation.

ID REINFORCEMENT
AB In this article, we present a learning mechanism that allows a multiagent system to cooperate to achieve a gathering task efficiently in unknown and changing environments. The multiagent system is a team of autonomous behavior-based agents with limited communication capabilities. Cooperation is based on the acquisition of signaling behaviors and on the specialization of She agents into different types. Every agent has the same collection of built-in reactive behaviors. Some of she built-in behaviors are fixed, whereas others can be modified through reinforcement learning. The reinforcement signal is delayed until a trial is completed and assesses the collective performance of the ream. Each agent uses this common signal to learn what individual behaviors are more suitable for the team. Simulation results, and the corresponding statistical analysis, show that the multiagent system always achieves near-optimal performances.

AB In complex financial systems, the sector structure and volatility clustering are respectively important features of the spatial and temporal correlations. However, the microscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure is not yet understood. Especially, how to produce these two features in one model remains challenging. We introduce a novel interaction mechanism, i.e., the multi-level herding, in constructing an agent-based model to investigate the sector structure combined with volatility clustering. According to the previous market performance, agents trade in groups, and their herding behavior comprises the herding at stock, sector and market levels. Further, we propose methods to determine the key model parameters from historical market data, rather than from statistical fitting of the results. From the simulation, we obtain the sector structure and volatility clustering, as well as the eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, for the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges. These properties are in agreement with the empirical ones. Our results quantitatively reveal that the multi-level herding is the microscopic generation mechanism of the sector structure, and provide new insight into the spatio-temporal interactions in financial systems at the microscopic level.

DE Population synthesis; multiple social relationships; tensor

ID MODEL
AB Social relationships have a strong influence on individual travel behavior and, consequently, on travel demand. However, most current literatures on population synthesis, which is the fundamental building block of disaggregated travel demand forecasting and agent-based traffic simulation, only considers the household impact. This paper makes two contributions in this regard. First, a methodological issue is identified: the existence of multiple social relationships (e.g., a dual set of constraints from social institutions or structures) makes it more difficult to generate a consistent synthetic population, meaning that this population satisfies constraints from more than one type of social organizations. A tensor decomposition method is then proposed to generate a consistent population with multi-social relationships. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this type of methodological issue has been addressed. Our sample-based method constitutes an improvement compared to existing approaches in that it can respect constraints from multiple social organizations without reducing accuracy. A numerical test concerning individual, household, and enterprise, using Chinese national population and economic census data, indicates that the new method can lead to stable and relatively small errors in total.

AB Information spreading analysis is an important problem in the scientific community and is widely studied today using different techniques, from the data analysis to the agent-based modelling. For some extreme situations, like fire or flood, there is little or no reliable information about users' activity available. That is why an efficient simulation of the urgent scenarios is very important, because analysis of the simulated data can help to provide fast and accurate reaction and save human lives. In this paper, we present a multi-layer agent-based network model for the information diffusion simulation in the urgent scenarios, which allows to investigate agents' behavior in a variety of situations in the absence of the real data. This model can be used for the urban scenarios simulation in the integration with other agent-based human interaction models.
   Experimental: results demonstrate good results in comparison with existing works in this area and give a number of insights regarding the further model development. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Implementing agent teams in dynamic multiagent environments
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
AB Teamwork is becoming increasingly critical in multiagent environments ranging from virtual environments for training and education, to information integration of the internet, to potential multirobotic space missions. Teamwork in such complex, dynamic environments is more than a simple union of simultaneous individual activity, even if supplemented with preplanned coordination. Indeed, in these dynamic environments, unanticipated events can easily cause a breakdown in such preplanned coordination. The central hypothesis in this article is that for effective teamwork, agents should be provided explicit representation of team goals and plans, as well as an explicit representation of a model of teamwork to support the execution of team plans. In our work, this model of teamwork takes thr form of a set of domain independent rules that clearly outline an agent's commitments and responsibilities as a participant in team activities, and thus guide the agent's social activities while executing team plans. This article describes two implementations of agent-teams based on the above principles, one for a real-world helicopter combat simulation, and one for the RoboCup soccer simulation. The article also provides a preliminary comparison of the two agent-teams to illustrate some of the strengths and weaknesses of RoboCup as a common test bed for multiagent systems.

AB The objective of this paper is to describe the development of a specific theory of interactions and learning among multiple robots performing certain tasks. One of the primary objectives of the research was to study the feasibility of a robot colony in achieving global objectives, when each individual robot is provided only with local goals and local information. In order to achieve this objective the paper introduces a novel cognitive architecture for the individual behavior of robots in a colony. Experimental investigation of the properties of the colony demonstrates its ability to achieve global goals, such as the gathering of objects, and to improve its performance as a result of learning, without explicit instructions for cooperation. Since this architecture is based on representation of the ''likes'' and ''dislikes'' of the robots, it is called the Tropism System Cognitive Architecture. This paper addresses learning in the framework of the cognitive architecture, specifically, phylogenetic and ontogenetic learning by the robots. The results show that learning is indeed possible with the Tropism Architecture, that the ability of a simulated robot colony to perform a gathering task improves with practice and that it can further improve with evolution over successive generations. Experimental results also show that the variability of the results decreases over successive generations.

AB Cooperative navigation (CN) enables a group of cooperative robots to reduce their individual navigation errors. For a general multi-robot (MR) measurement model that involves both inertial navigation data and other onboard sensor readings, taken at different time instances, the various sources of information become correlated. Thus, this correlation should be solved for in the process of information fusion to obtain consistent state estimation. The common approach for obtaining the correlation terms is to maintain an augmented covariance matrix. This method would work for relative pose measurements, but is impractical for a general MR measurement model, because the identities of the robots involved in generating the measurements, as well as the measurement time instances, are unknown a priori. In the current work, a new consistent information fusion method for a general MR measurement model is developed. The proposed approach relies on graph theory. It enables explicit on-demand calculation of the required correlation terms. The graph is locally maintained by every robot in the group, representing all of the MR measurement updates. The developed method calculates the correlation terms in the most general scenarios of MR measurements while properly handling the involved process and measurement noise. A theoretical example and a statistical study are provided, demonstrating the performance of the method for vision-aided navigation based on a three-view measurement model. The method is compared, in a simulated environment, with a fixed-lag centralized smoothing approach. The method is also validated in an experiment that involved real imagery and navigation data. Computational complexity estimates show that the newly developed method is computationally efficient.

AB This paper is focused on the dynamics of residential location decisions based on the microeconomic theory of urban land use, in which we assume that each property is assigned to the agent with the highest bid. The agents' behavior includes expectations of their future based on the life cycle or social influence processes, which are anticipated or solved using a hypothesis of imitation of the behavior of other households currently living in those situations. Relocation decisions are then modeled, incorporating expected utilities by means of transition probabilities among households. An imitation multi-objective bid function is postulated for each alternative location depending on the expected income per unit of time, the current household value of amenities and the expected value obtained by the imitated agent in this location. A multinomial logit model is assumed to calculate the location equilibrium, where willingness to pay is determined by dwelling characteristics and spatial socioeconomic segregation (location externalities). Numerical examples and simulations are presented using linear bid functions to explain the proposed modeling approach and the impact of imitation on the dynamics of residential segregation.

AB In this article, we present a framework of use in electronic marketplaces that allows buying agents to model the trustworthiness of selling agents in an effective way, making use of seller ratings provided by other buying agents known as advisors. The trustworthiness of the advisors is also modeled, using an approach that combines both personal and public knowledge and allows the relative weighting to be adjusted over time. Through a series of experiments that simulate e-marketplaces, including ones where sellers may vary their behavior over time, we are able to demonstrate that our proposed framework delivers effective seller recommendations to buyers, resulting in important buyer profit. We also propose limiting seller bids as a method for promoting seller honesty, thus facilitating successful selection of sellers by buyers, and demonstrate the value of this approach through experimental results. Overall, this research is focused on the technological aspects of electronic commerce and specifically on technology that would be used to manage trust.

   algorithms; mobile agents; multiagent systems
ID ALGORITHMS
AB The goal of this paper is to propose an extension of the popular leader-follower framework for multiagent collective tracking and formation maintenance in the presence of a time-varying leader. In particular, the leader is persistently selected online in order to optimize the tracking performance of an exogenous collective velocity command while also maintaining a desired formation via a (possibly time-varying) communication-graph topology. The effects of a change in the leader identity are theoretically analyzed and exploited for defining a suitable error metric that is able to capture the tracking performance of the multiagent group. Both the group performance and the metric design are found to depend upon the spectral properties of a special directed graph induced by the identity of the chosen leader. By exploiting these results, as well as distributed estimation techniques, we are then able to detail a fully decentralized adaptive strategy that is able to periodically select online the best leader among the neighbors of the current leader. Numerical simulations show that the application of the proposed technique results in an improvement of the overall performance of the group behavior with regard to other possible strategies.

AB The agent-based modelling (ABM) can illuminate how multi-dimensional process of public participation emerges from simple behavior rules. It can model the participation process which is too complicated using congenital approaches. In the present research, the social structure of human participation in managing livestock drinking water of arid rangelands in Yazd Province, Iran, was designed using the four steps of ABM. This study provides a true understanding of interactions of four agents including government, livestock beneficiaries, natural resources organization and NGOs with each other and with the natural environment. In order to achieve conceptual proof, the Delphi technique was applied for stepwise identification of agents and their real behaviors. Additionally, quantification of decision elements and decision-making hypotheses was examined using the Analytical Network Process (ANP). By confirming the conceptual validity of decision-making hypotheses through network analysis, the conceptual model was confirmed. The analysis demonstrates that "low income of livestock beneficiaries", "successive droughts and low rainfall" and "weakness of NGOs", with normal weights of 0.31, 0.15, and 0.09, respectively are three major drivers for problem of weak participation among local communities in the study area. This research is an example of incorporating the ABM approach in settling problems encountered with social system.

TI Capturing multi-stage fuzzy uncertainties in hybrid system dynamics and
   agent-based models for enhancing policy implementation in health systems

AB Background
   In practical research, it was found that most people made health-related decisions not based on numerical data but on perceptions. Examples include the perceptions and their corresponding linguistic values of health risks such as, smoking, syringe sharing, eating energy-dense food, drinking sugar-sweetened beverages etc. For the sake of understanding the mechanisms that affect the implementations of health-related interventions, we employ fuzzy variables to quantify linguistic variable in healthcare modeling where we employ an integrated system dynamics and agent-based model.
   Methodology
   In a nonlinear causal-driven simulation environment driven by feedback loops, we mathematically demonstrate how interventions at an aggregate level affect the dynamics of linguistic variables that are captured by fuzzy agents and how interactions among fuzzy agents, at the same time, affect the formation of different clusters(groups) that are targeted by specific interventions.
   Results
   In this paper, we provide an innovative framework to capture multi-stage fuzzy uncertainties manifested among interacting heterogeneous agents (individuals) and intervention decisions that affect homogeneous agents (groups of individuals) in a hybrid model that combines an agent-based simulation model (ABM) and a system dynamics models (SDM). Having built the platform to incorporate high-dimension data in a hybrid ABM/SDM model, this paper demonstrates how one can obtain the state variable behaviors in the SDM and the corresponding values of linguistic variables in the ABM.
   Conclusions
   This research provides a way to incorporate high-dimension data in a hybrid ABM/SDM model. This research not only enriches the application of fuzzy set theory by capturing the dynamics of variables associated with interacting fuzzy agents that lead to aggregate behaviors but also informs implementation research by enabling the incorporation of linguistic variables at both individual and institutional levels, which makes unstructured linguistic data meaningful and quantifiable in a simulation environment. This research can help practitioners and decision makers to gain better understanding on the dynamics and complexities of precision intervention in healthcare. It can aid the improvement of the optimal allocation of resources for targeted group (s) and the achievement of maximum utility. As this technology becomes more mature, one can design policy flight simulators by which policy/intervention designers can test a variety of assumptions when they evaluate different alternatives interventions.

Here, we describe its applicability to integrative tumor biology research by introducing a multi-scale tumor modeling platform that understands brain cancer as a complex dynamic biosystem. We summarize significant findings of this work, and discuss both challenges and future directions for ABM in the field of cancer research.

AB Social synchrony (SS) is an emergent phenomenon in human society. People often mimic others which, over time, can result in large groups behaving similarly. Drawing from prior empirical studies of SS in online communities, here we propose a discrete network model of SS based on four attributes: 1) depth of action; 2) breadth of impact, i.e., a large number of actions are performed with a large group of people involved; 3) heterogeneity of role, i.e., people of higher degree play more important roles; and 4) lastly, emergence of phenomenon, i.e., it is far from random. We analyze our model both analytically and with simulations, and find good agreement between the two. We find this model can well explain the four characters of SS, and thus hope it can help researchers better understand human collective behavior.

ID NEGOTIATION; MARKETS; POWER
AB In cross-cultural business negotiation, culture is known to influence negotiation processes. As a lens to study this effect we deployed the Lemon Car Game, an online negotiation game developed for this purpose (Hofstede et al. in: Proceedings of 39th international simulation and gaming association conference (ISAGA). Technologia, Kaunas, pp 39-46, 2009a; Hofstede et al. in: David, Sichman (eds) Multi-agent-based simulation IX, international workshop, MABS 2008, revised selectedpapers, LNAI 5269. Springer, Berlin, pp 1-16, 2009b). In this article we report the results from the game, obtained from over 800 players from more than 70 countries. We employ several complementary analyses in a mixed-methods approach. Our findings show that to make sense of the players' actions during negotiation, economic rationality falls short. A pan-cultural individual-level analysis of actions and stated intentions also fails to yield a coherent picture. Within countries, however, actions and intentions do cohere, as shown by an ecological country-level factor analysis, from which three factors emerge for the sellers at country level: trustworthiness, opportunism, and fairness. We conclude from these findings that, in this game, players are driven by what we call relational rationality: they are rational from the perspective of the social world in which they live, with interpersonal relationships weighing heavily. Relational rationality changes players' perspective of economic rationality, and thus their observed behaviour in negotiation. Based on this evidence, we extrapolate that relational rationality significantly influences negotiation processes in all cultures.

AB A major objective of vehicular networking is to improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion. The experience of individual vehicles on traffic conditions and travel situations can be shared with other vehicles for improving their route planning and driving decisions. Nevertheless, the frequent occurrence of adversary vehicles in the network may affect the overall network performance and safety. These vehicles may behave intelligently to avoid detection. To effectively control and monitor such security threats, an efficient Trust Management system should be employed to identify the trustworthiness of individual vehicles and detect malicious drivers which is the major focus of this work. We propose a hybrid solution, which integrates Edge Computing and Multi-agent modeling in a Trust Management system for vehicular networks. The proposed solution also aims to overcome the limitations of the two commonly utilized approaches in this context: cloud computing and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking. Our framework has a set of features that make it an efficient platform to address the major security challenges in vehicular networks including latency, scalability, uncertainty, data accessibility, and malicious behavior detection. Performance of the approach is evaluated by simulating a realistic environment. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms similar approaches from literature for various performance indicators.

DE gift exchange; multiagent systems; habitus-field theory; social
   simulation
AB In this paper, the implications of applying the idea of gift exchange mechanism, inspired from Pierre Bourdieu's sociological theories, into a market-based multiagent system are explored. Our work is directed in the continuation of investigations by Knabe (2002), who addressed the formation of different organizations structures between providers in a profit-oriented market. We nevertheless scrutinize various hypotheses centered to gift exchange in which an agent sacrifices its profit for a long-term binding relationship. The idea is to aim a larger profit through alliances that are formed as an effect of gift exchange. Our suggestion is that a multiagent system (MAS) based on the social mechanism of gift exchange performs a high level of robustness and durability. The market in our case comprises of customers and providers agents. The former calls for proposals for the tasks they introduce in the market, while the latter proceed with the execution of tasks based on their abilities and other circumstances. In well defined cases, the providers are able to delegate tasks to other providers. This allows them to give presents to other providers so that the gift exchange mechanism becomes possible. The agents are either profit-oriented or the ones who prefer exchanging gifts and are in pursuit of others who also practice this mechanism. A number of interesting scenarios are examined that include preservation of a hierarchical structure in the market, situations resulting in the forming of an alliance between two providers, and split of profit-oriented and gift-giving agents.

DE Multi-robot systems; formation control; collision avoidance;
   decentralized control; Lyapunov stability theory
AB Formation control analyses the convergence of a group of mobile agents to predefined geometric patterns. In traditional approaches, it is assumed that each agent knows the exact position of certain members of the group with respect to a reference frame and the associated control laws are designed according to inter-robot relative positions. Designing a more decentralized scheme, this paper proposes a formation scheme, using Lyapunov techniques, considering that the local controllers of the agents can be equipped with distance and orientation sensors. The main result of the paper applies to certain distance-based potential functions with inter-robot collision avoidance and an arbitrary undirected formation graph. Also, the control law includes an integral-type control that eliminates the effects of the dead-zone of actuators in order to avoid the standard techniques of normalization. The control approach is analyzed for omnidirectional robots with numerical simulations and extended for unicycle-type robots with real-time experiments.

AB This paper presents a completely autonomous solution to participate in the Indoor Challenge of the 2013 International Micro Air Vehicle Competition (IMAV 2013). Our proposal is a multi-robot system with no centralized coordination whose robotic agents share their position estimates. The capability of each agent to navigate avoiding collisions is a consequence of the resulting emergent behavior. Each agent consists of a ground station running an instance of the proposed architecture that communicates over WiFi with an AR Drone 2.0 quadrotor. Visual markers are employed to sense and map obstacles and to improve the pose estimation based on Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and ground optical flow data. Based on our architecture, each robotic agent can navigate avoiding obstacles and other members of the multi-robot system. The solution is demonstrated and the achieved navigation performance is evaluated by means of experimental flights. This work also analyzes the capabilities of the presented solution in simulated flights of the IMAV 2013 Indoor Challenge. The performance of the CVG UPM team was awarded with the First Prize in the Indoor Autonomy Challenge of the IMAV 2013 competition.

AB The recent success of single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) in Internet of Things (IoT) systems motivates the study of multiagent RL (MARL), which is more challenging but more useful in large-scale IoT. In this article, we consider a voting-based MARL problem, in which the agents vote to make group decisions and the goal is to maximize the globally averaged returns. To this end, we formulate the MARL problem based on the linear programming form of the policy optimization problem and propose a primal-dual algorithm to obtain the optimal solution. We also propose a voting mechanism through which the distributed learning achieves the same sublinear convergence rate as centralized learning. In other words, the distributed decision making does not slow down the process of achieving global consensus on optimality. Finally, we verify the convergence of our proposed algorithm with numerical simulations and conduct case studies in practical multiagent IoT systems.

AB Pre-emptive vaccination is regarded as one of the most protective measures to control influenza outbreak. There are mainly two types of influenza viruses-influenza A and B with several subtypes-that are commonly found to circulate among humans. The traditional trivalent (TIV) flu vaccine targets two strains of influenza A and one strain of influenza B. The quadrivalent (QIV) vaccine targets one extra B virus strain that ensures better protection against influenza; however, the use of QIV vaccine can be costly, hence impose an extra financial burden to society. This scenario might create a dilemma in choosing vaccine types at the individual level. This article endeavours to explain such a dilemma through the framework of a vaccination game, where individuals can opt for one of the three options: choose either of QIV or TIV vaccine or none. Our approach presumes a mean-field framework of a vaccination game in an infinite and well-mixed population, entangling the disease spreading process of influenza with the coevolution of two types of vaccination decision-making processes taking place before an epidemic season. We conduct a series of numerical simulations as an attempt to illustrate different scenarios. The framework has been validated by the so-called multi-agent simulation (MAS) approach.

TI Continual planning and acting in dynamic multiagent environments
SO AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE Multiagent planning; Continual planning
ID COMPLEXITY; SEARCH
AB In order to behave intelligently, artificial agents must be able to deliberatively plan their future actions. Unfortunately, realistic agent environments are usually highly dynamic and only partially observable, which makes planning computationally hard. For most practical purposes this rules out planning techniques that account for all possible contingencies in the planning process. However, many agent environments permit an alternative approach, namely continual planning, i.e. the interleaving of planning with acting and sensing. This paper presents a new principled approach to continual planning that describes why and when an agent should switch between planning and acting. The resulting continual planning algorithm enables agents to deliberately postpone parts of their planning process and instead actively gather missing information that is relevant for the later refinement of the plan. To this end, the algorithm explictly reasons about the knowledge (or lack thereof) of an agent and its sensory capabilities. These concepts are modelled in the planning language (MAPL). Since in many environments the major reason for dynamism is the behaviour of other agents, MAPL can also model multiagent environments, common knowledge among agents, and communicative actions between them. For Continual Planning, MAPL introduces the concept of of assertions, abstract actions that substitute yet unformed subplans. To evaluate our continual planning approach empirically we have developed MAPSIM, a simulation environment that automatically builds multiagent simulations from formal MAPL domains. Thus, agents can not only plan, but also execute their plans, perceive their environment, and interact with each other. Our experiments show that, using continual planning techniques, deliberate action planning can be used efficiently even in complex multiagent environments.

AB Large birds always choose orderly flight formations for migration. The energy-saving hypothesis and visual communication hypothesis have provided explanations for the formation mechanisms of flight formations of large birds. However, the experimental data differ greatly from the theoretical results of the energy-saving hypothesis, and the visual communication hypothesis lacks sufficient supporting evidence. Moreover, neither of these two hypothesises can explain the differences between flight formations of large and small birds. In this article, the authors investigated the formation mechanism of bird flocks from a new perspective, i.e., the weight of repulsive force between individuals, and provided explanations for the differences between flight formations of large and small birds. The authors believe that the weight of repulsive force between large birds is greater than that between small birds, which makes them better at preventing collisions between individuals. The simulation results show that as the weight of repulsive force between individuals is gradually increased, the flight formation of the flock converts from a cluster formation (corresponding to the flight formation of small birds) to a single-row formation (corresponding to the flight formation of large birds). And the migration speed of the single-row flight formation is larger than that of the cluster formation. In addition, the authors also studied the effects of population and density of individuals on flight formations: the entire flock will lose the ability to migrate when the number or density of individuals is large enough. The findings of this article may provide theoretical guidance for the autonomous control for unmanned aerial vehicle swarms. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB E-commerce is increasingly competitive and there is a constant need for new approaches and technology to facilitate exchange. Emerging techniques include the use of artificial intelligence (AI). One AI tool that has sparked interest in e-commerce is the automated negotiation agent (negotiation-agent). This study examines such agents, and proposes an offer strategy model of integrative negotiation for a negotiation-agent with a focus on negotiation agent-to-human interaction. More specifically, a new offer strategy was developed based on the integrative bargaining model, which emphasizes the importance of exchanging information among negotiators and multi-issue negotiation that includes package offers to achieve an integrative (win-win) outcome. This study incorporated an argumentation-based negotiation and the negotiation tactic of multiple equivalent simultaneous offers, which was programmed into the negotiation-agent. An experiment was conducted performing 49 negotiation-agent-to-human negotiations over three issues in online purchase tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results indicated that the proposed offer strategy with agent negotiation can enhance the persuasiveness of an offer and the performance of negotiation outcome (human counterpart's perception toward negotiation process, opponent-agent and desire for future negotiation). The findings confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrated an innovative approach to e-commerce transactions.

AB Multiagent-based simulation is an approach, to realize stochastic simulation where both the behavior of the modeled multiagent system and dynamic aspects of its environment are implemented with autonomous agents. Such simulation provides an ideal environment for intelligent agents to learn to perform their tasks before being deployed in a real-world environment. The presented research investigates theoretical and practical aspects of learning by autonomous agents within stochastic agent-based simulation. The theoretical work is based on the Inferential Theory of Learning, which describes learning processes from the perspective of a learner's goal as a search through knowledge space. The theory is extended for approximate and probabilistic learning to account for the situations encountered when learning in stochastic environments. Practical aspects are exemplified by two use cases in autonomous logistics: learning predictive models for environment conditions in the future, and learning in the context of evolutionary plan optimization.

ID IMPACT
AB Attempts to quantify the numbers of migrants generated by changes in climate have commonly been calculated by projecting physical climate changes on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change.

DE agent simulation; social attitudes; social behaviour; social simulation;

AB This article presents a multiagent simulation environment for studying agents' socio-political attitudes. It departs from a previously proposed concept of agents with socio-political attitudes, a high-level theoretical and conceptual model proposed by Petric et al. (2002) that was intended for conversational agents. In contrast, our work pursues a bottom-up simulation philosophy where attitudes are grounded in sensory-motor behaviour of spatially distributed autonomous agents, modelled in Webots simulation software. The original model was extended by defining an agent's socio-political type by means of weighting the three components found in the Petric et al. (2002) model (neo-liberal, alternative and fundamentalist), thus allowing the creation of mixed sociopolitical types. Also, in the simulations performed, issues were modelled as agents with variable levels of importance. Moreover, we introduced inter-agent communication capable of causing changes in socio-political types. Results are presented and discussed with respect to the initial research questions. According to our experimental results the following parameters did not have any significant impact on the simulation outcomes: initial physical position and orientation of the agents, positions of the issues, the issues' dynamics, and inter-agent communication. Experiments with different initial agent types showed that agents with indeterminate socio-political types tended to change to neo-liberal, alternative or fundamentalist agents. We conclude by proposing future extensions of the model. Our work is related to a trend in the Artificial Intelligence community which is not primarily task or problem-solving oriented, but rather focuses on the study of the embodied and situated nature of social behaviour in humans.

AB This paper studies the flocking problem for a multiagent system, where each agent is a vehicle with nonholonomic dynamics. In particular, we consider the case where the agents are subjected to an arbitrarily large communication delay. A distributed low gain control law is derived based on the gradient of an artificial potential function. We demonstrate using the Lyapunov functional approach that the proposed control law drives the multiagent system into the stable flocking behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed control law is verified in numerical simulation.

ID EMERGENCE
AB Agent-based models in social psychology have been developed to study interpersonal/ group phenomena including social influence processes and social exchanges. These previous models have successfully delineated social mechanisms whereby group polarization and segregation emerge, and also identified scope conditions where altruistic behaviors become rational in groups. After discussing these developments, this paper reviewed some of the recent research, using agent-based models, on evolvability of social learning strategies under uncertainty, and adaptive values of the majority rule in group decision-making. We argue that agent-based evolutionary computer simulations help us derive theoretical hypotheses about various social psychological phenomena systematically, and promote the interaction among different disciplines such as biology and economics.

AB Multiagent software systems are known to exhibit a system-level behavior that rarely can be predicted from the description of individual agents but must be observed in simulation or real-life. On the other hand there are indications that agent technology is superior in situations that are non-deterministic or so ill-structured as to appear non-deterministic. This paper examines whether one can give a more precise characterization of those situations where multiagent systems hold great promise, and to test the corresponding hypothesis by simulating a real-world production scenario. After refining the hypothesis the paper examines whether one can guarantee the reliability of the agents in the presence of disturbances, because otherwise the flexibility of the multiagent system could become uncontrollable. After examining various transactional approaches that all pose major challenges the paper concludes that to go beyond an illusion still requires intensive research.

AB Swarm intelligence is widely recognized as a powerful paradigm of self-organized optimization, with numerous examples of successful applications in distributed artificial intelligence. However, the role of physical interactions in the organization of traffic flows in ants under crowded conditions has only been studied very recently. The related results suggest new ways of congestion control and simple algorithms for optimal resource usage based on local interactions and, therefore, decentralized control concepts. Here, we present a mathematical analysis of such concepts for an experiment with two alternative ways with limited capacities between a food source and the nest of an ant colony. Moreover, we carry out microscopic computer simulations for generalized setups, in which ants have more alternatives or the alternative ways are of different lengths. In this way and by variation of interaction parameters, we can get a better idea of how powerful congestion control based on local repulsive interactions may be. Finally, we discuss potential applications of this design principle to routing in traffic or data networks and machine usage in supply systems.

AB Cognitive radio-enabled vehicular nodes as unlicensed users can competitively and opportunistically access the radio spectrum provided by a licensed provider and simultaneously use a dedicated channel for vehicular communications. In such cognitive vehicular networks, channel access optimization plays a key role in making the most of the spectrum resources. In this paper, we present the competition among self-interest-driven vehicular nodes as an evolutionary game and study fundamental properties of the Nash equilibrium and the evolutionary stability. To deal with the inefficiency of the Nash equilibrium, we design a delayed pricing mechanism and propose a discretized replicator dynamics with this pricing mechanism. The strategy adaptation and the channel pricing can be performed in an asynchronous manner, such that vehicular users can obtain the knowledge of the channel prices prior to actually making access decisions. We prove that the Nash equilibrium of the proposed evolutionary dynamics is evolutionary stable and coincides with the social optimum. Besides, performance comparison is also carried out in different environments to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method over the distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning scheme in current literature in terms of the system convergence, stability and adaptability.

ID PLANS
AB Research on resource-bounded agents has established. that rational agents. need to be able to revise their commitments in light of new opportunities. In the context of collaborative activities, rational agents must be able to reconcile their intentions to do team-related actions with other, conflicting intentions. The SPIRE experimental system allows the process of intention reconciliation in team contexts to be simulated and studied. Initial work with SPIRE examined the impact of environmental factors and agent utility functions on individual and group outcomes in the context of one set of social norms governing collaboration. This paper extends those results by further studying the effect of environmental factors and the agents' level of social consciousness and by comparing the impact of two different types of social norms on agent behavior and outcomes. The results show that the choice of social norms influences the accuracy of the agents' responses to varying environmental factors, as well as the effectiveness of social consciousness and other aspects of agents' utility functions. In experiments using heterogeneous groups of agents, both sets of norms were susceptible to the free-rider effect. However, the gains of the less responsible agents were minimal, suggesting that agent designers would have little incentive to design agents that deviate from the standard level of responsibility to the group.

AB In public transport disruptions, a key relation between the services of operating company and passengers' satisfaction is the disseminated information. This paper proposes rigorous mathematical descriptions to describe the effects of information availability to passengers, including the user equilibrium and non-equilibrium solutions. The information availability in disruption is summarised in a who-when-where-what four-dimensional framework. Based on different information, passengers' behaviours are assumed and simulated to evaluate the benefits of information availability in public transport disruption. An agent-based micro-simulation model (MATSim) is applied for the city of Zurich, Switzerland, for the benefit of activity-based simulation in a multi-modal network. We use an existing day-to-day replanning method, and extend the study with a within-day replanning approach in MATSim, to study agents' route choices responding to public transport disruption in one single iteration. The disruption is assumed as a rail track blockage between Zurich HB and Zurich Oerlikon via both Zurich Wipkingen and ZUrich Hardbrucke. One benchmark of agents behaviours without disruption and other three scenarios based on different information are simulated. Statistic results are analysed for all the agents who may be involved in the defined disruption. Agents flow in related transit routes and transport modes shows their adaptations to the corresponding information availability. Agents delays and scores reveal that information significantly impacts agents satisfaction in public transport disruption.

AB This paper investigates the consensus of fractional-order multiagent systems via sampled-data event- triggered control. Firstly, an event-triggered algorithm is defined using sampled states. Thus, Zeno behaviors can be naturally avoided. Then, a distributed control protocol is proposed to ensure the consensus of fractional-order multiagent systems, where each agent updates its current state based on its neighbors' states at event-triggered instants. Furthermore, the pinning control technology is taken into account to ensure all agents in multiagent systems reach the specified reference state. With the aid of linear matrix inequalities (LMI), some sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the consensus of fractional-order multiagent system. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the theoretical analysis. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Different human societies shape landscapes differently. Anthroecology theory explains this long-term differential shaping of landscapes as the product of sociocultural niche construction (SNC): an evolutionary theory coupling social change with ecosystem engineering. The evolutionary mechanisms underpinning this theory cannot be tested without experimental approaches capable of reproducing emergent selection processes acting on the combined suite of cultural, material, and ecological inheritances that determine the adaptive fitness of human individuals, groups, and societies. Agent-based modeling, as a ` generative social science' tool, appears ideal for this. Here we propose an agentbased virtual laboratory (ABVL) approach to generating and testing basic hypotheses on SNC as a general mechanism capable of producing the broadly varied anthroecological forms and dynamics of human landscapes from prehistory to present. While major challenges must still be overcome, a prospective modeling framework specification, guiding questions, and illustrative examples demonstrate clear potential for an ABVL to test predictions of anthroecology theory through generative social simulation.

ID CONSENSUS; AGENTS
AB This study considers the problem of formation control for second-order multiagent systems. We propose a distributed nonlinear formation controller where the control input of each follower can be expressed as a product of a nonlinear term that relies on the distance errors under the leader-follower structure. In the leader-follower structure, a small number of agents are assumed to be the leaders, and they are responsible for steering a group of agents to the specific destination, while the rest of the agents are called followers. The stability of the proposed control laws is demonstrated by utilizing the Lyapunov function candidate. To solve the obstacle avoidance problem, the artificial potential approach is employed, and the agents can avoid each possible obstacle successfully without getting stuck in any local minimum point. The control problem of multiagent systems in the presence of unknown constant disturbances is also considered. To attenuate such disturbances, the integral term is introduced, and the static error is eliminated through the proposed PI controller, which makes the system stable; the adaptive controller is designed to reduce the effect of time-varying disturbances. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to support the obtained theoretical results.

AB This paper presents a framework that aids contractors and safety managers in planning labor evacuation for construction sites using Building Information Modelling (BIM) and computer simulation by modeling the appropriate construction method alternatives. The proposed framework estimates the execution time, total cost, and evacuation time for construction projects, taking safety into consideration. Agent-based simulation is utilized to model the behavior of laborers in evacuation situations. A MassMotion simulation platform is utilized to implement agent-based simulation and to imitate labor behavior during emergency evacuation under various conditions. Ranking and Selection (R&S) statistical procedures are used to determine the best simulated model configuration among the considered four alternatives. Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is applied to help in selecting the suitable construction method alternative. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method is used to identify the best construction method alternative taking into consideration three main criteria which are: construction total cost, execution time, and evacuation time of the labor. The proposed framework is examined within the context of a case study that considers evacuation of labor during the construction of a building in an Egyptian social housing national project.

Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition for the emergence of asymptotic consensus in the same group and separation for different groups.

AB In order to reconstruct large-scale gene regulatory networks (GRNs) with high accuracy, a robust evolutionary algorithm, a dynamic multiagent genetic algorithm (dMAGA), is proposed to reconstruct GRNs from time-series expression profiles based on fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) in this paper. The algorithm is labeled as dMAGA(FCM)-GRN. In dMAGA(FCM)-GRN, agents and their behaviors are designed with the intrinsic properties of GRN reconstruction problems in mind. All agents live in a lattice-like environment, and the neighbors of each agent are changed dynamically according to their energy in each generation. dMAGA(FCM)-GRN can learn continuous states directly for FCMs from data. In the experiments, the performance of dMAGA(FCM)-GRN is validated on both large-scale synthetic data and the benchmark DREAM3 and DREAM4. The experimental results show that dMAGA(FCM)-GRN is able to effectively learn FCMs with 200 nodes; that is, 40 000 weights need to be optimized. The systematic comparison with five existing algorithms shows that dMAGA(FCM)-GRN outperforms all other algorithms and can approximate the time series with high accuracy.

AB Interactions of expansive clay soils with transportation facilities have caused billions of dollars of damage. In the process of determining agents and methodologies to overcome expansive clay behavior, multiple injections of chemical agents into the subgrade to modify clay behavior are most promising. A study was conducted to optimize a potassium-rich solution of four parts. The modifying solution has been injected into expansive clay subgrades with success since the early 1970s. A laboratory methodology was developed to inject specimens multiple times and to conduct swell tests. Screening tests were conducted to evaluate linear effects that each of the four constituents had on swell response through interpretation of a factorial design. Analysis of replicated tests, randomly arranged in blocks, revealed that one constituent had no effect on swell behavior. A central composite experimental design then was used to optimize the remaining constituents. The resulting response surface equation led to an optimal combination for swell abatement, confirmed during short- and long-term verification testing. The optimal blend of constituents was determined to reduce swell from 7.2 percent to 0.84 percent under injection situations simulating the field, and it was found to improve the reduction in swell by 2.6 percent compared with the original blend. In addition, XRD confirmed that modification of clay occurred. This study was unique in its use of laboratory simulation of multiple field injections and in its use of statistical analysis to minimize the number of tests needed to ensure confidence in the optimization sought.

AB Background: With the advent of personalized medicine, the field of health economic modeling is being challenged and the use of patient-level dynamic modeling techniques might be required. Objectives: To illustrate the usability of two such techniques, timed automata (TA) and discrete event simulation (DES), for modeling personalized treatment decisions. Methods: An early health technology assessment on the use of circulating tumor cells, compared with prostate-specific antigen and bone scintigraphy, to inform treatment decisions in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer was performed. Both modeling techniques were assessed quantitatively, in terms of intermediate outcomes (e.g., overtreatment) and health economic outcomes (e.g., net monetary benefit). Qualitatively, among others, model structure, agent interactions, data management (i.e., importing and exporting data), and model transparency were assessed. Results: Both models yielded realistic and similar intermediate and health economic outcomes. Overtreatment was reduced by 6.99 and 7.02 weeks by applying circulating tumor cell as a response marker at a net monetary benefit of -(sic)1033 and -(sic)1104 for the TA model and the DES model, respectively. Software-specific differences were observed regarding data management features and the support for statistical distributions, which were considered better for the DES software. Regarding method-specific differences, interactions were modeled more straightforward using TA, benefiting from its compositional model structure. Conclusions: Both techniques prove suitable for modeling personalized treatment decisions, although DES would be preferred given the current software-specific limitations of TA. When these limitations are resolved, TA would be an interesting modeling alternative if interactions are key or its compositional structure is useful to manage multi-agent complex problems.

AB This paper analyzes optimization-based approaches for a social security simulation model under demographic and economic uncertainties. The model is a compromise between a purely actuarial model and an overlapping generations general equilibrium model. It deals with production and consumption processes coevolving with "birth-and-death" processes of involved agents, e.g., region-specific households subdivided into single-year age groups, firms, governments, financial intermediaries, including pension systems and insurance. The production function of the model allows to track incomes expenditures, savings and dissavings of agents, as well as intergenerational and interregional transfers of wealth. The proposed approach combines the actuarial and the economic growth simulation models in a single stochastic optimization model which explicitly and realistically treats the underlying uncertainties with the goal to satisfy reasonable and secure consumption of agents. The design of optimal robust strategies is achieved by an adaptive simulation-based optimization procedure defined by non-smooth risk functions. Numerical solution is discussed.

TI Emergence of cooperation via intention recognition, commitment and

ID MECHANISM DESIGN; AGREEMENTS; MODEL
AB The mechanisms of emergence and evolution of cooperation in populations of abstract individuals, with diverse behavioral strategies in co-presence, have been undergoing mathematical study via evolutionary game theory, inspired in part on evolutionary psychology. Their systematic study resorts to simulation techniques, thus enabling the study of aforesaid mechanisms under a variety of conditions, parameters and alternative virtual games. The theoretical and experimental results have continually been surprising, rewarding and promising. In our recent work, we initiated the introduction, in such groups of individuals, of cognitive abilities inspired on techniques and theories of Artificial Intelligence, namely those pertaining to Intention Recognition, Commitment and Apology (separately and jointly), encompassing errors in decision-making and communication noise. As a result, both the emergence and stability of cooperation become reinforced comparatively to the absence of such cognitive abilities. This holds separately for Intention Recognition, for Commitment and for Apology, and even more so when they are jointly engaged.
   Our presentation aims to sensitize the reader to these evolutionary game theory based issues, results and prospects, which are accruing in importance for the modeling of minds with machines, with impact on our understanding of the evolution of mutual tolerance and cooperation. Recognition of someone's intentions, which may include imagining the recognition others have of our own intentions, and may comprise not just some error tolerance, but also a penalty for unfulfilled commitment though allowing for apology, can lead to evolutionary stable win/win equilibriums within groups of individuals, and perhaps amongst groups. The recognition and the manifestation of intentions, plus the assumption of commitment-even whilst paying a cost for putting it in place-and the acceptance of apology, are all facilitators in that respect, each of them singly and, above all, in collusion.

AB Multiagent systems (MAS) provide a useful tool for exploring the complex dynamics and behavior of financial markets and now MAS approach has been widely implemented and documented in the empirical literature. This paper introduces the implementation of an innovative multiscale mathematical model for a computational agent-based financial market. The paper develops a method to quantify the degree of self-organization which emerges in the system and shows that the capacity of self-organization is maximized when the agent behaviors are heterogeneous. Numerical results are presented and analyzed, showing how the global market behavior emerges from specific individual behavior interactions.

AB This study investigates how the attributes of online social platforms (e.g., open vs. closed, symmetric vs. asymmetric social networks) and user preferences regarding platform diversity (e.g., single-homing vs. multi-homing) moderate the influence of homophily on user behaviors across varied social segments. On the basis of panel data, we delve into the interplay among homophily, structural diversities across various online social networking services (SNSs), and users' homing preferences in such social platforms. The data feature of the SNS consumption behaviors of 10,172 individual users are obtained over a period of 134 days. An agent-based simulation model is developed to further validate and generalize the empirical findings. The simulation and empirical results consistently indicate that propensity toward homophily differs significantly across platform types and users' channel adoption behaviors. Online homophily is more pronounced in closed, private social networks than in open, public social networks. Users of asymmetric and symmetric SNSs exhibit weak and strong homophily, respectively. Moreover, whereas users who adopt a single SNS channel tend toward homophily, those who subscribe to multiple SNSs confirm the idea that "opposites attract." These findings suggest that users of online SNS channels manifest complex human interactions typified by the combination of homophily, heterophily, and asymmetric social preference, although homophily is the most prominent disposition. Our findings suggest that homophily should be considered a dynamically changing human characteristic rather than a static attribute, and stakeholders should exploit the complex nature of users' homophilous behaviors to address social problems in online SNSs and to enhance the effectiveness of social advertising.

AB As crowd simulation in micro-spatial environment is more widely applied in urban planning and management, the construction of an appropriate spatial data model that supports such applications becomes essential. To address the requirements necessary to building a model of crowd simulation and people-place relationship analysis in micro-spatial environments, the concept of the grid as a basic unit of people-place data association is presented in this article. Subsequently, a grid-based spatial data model is developed for modelling spatial data using Geographic Information System (GIS). The application of the model for crowd simulations in indoor and outdoor spatial environments is described. There are four advantages of this model: first, both the geometrical characteristics of geographic entities and behaviour characteristics of individuals within micro-spatial environments are involved; second, the object-oriented model and spatial topological relationships are fused; third, the integrated expression of indoor and outdoor environments can be realised; and fourth, crowd simulation models, such as Multi-agent System (MAS) and Cellular Automata (CA), can be further fused for intelligent simulation and the analysis of individual behaviours. Lastly, this article presents an experimental implementation of the data model, individual behaviours are simulated and analysed to illustrate the potential of the proposed model.

AB It is empirically verified that people with higher income are, on an average, more trustful than those with lower income. If this finding is unconditionally valid, a dismal society may emerge and lead to the rich becoming richer by trusting strangers and receiving higher payoffs. The purpose of this paper is to explore the conditions that facilitate or hinder the growth of a dismal society by developing an agent-based model. We examined the hypothesis that the attractiveness of the market facilitates the trusting behavior of the rich, which results in a wider gap of the accumulated payoffs between the rich and the poor. In the model, agents decide whether or not they should leave their assurance group in order to receive a higher payoff from a stranger in the market. If an agent's partner is trustworthy, the agent receives a higher payoff from the partner than from a member in his/her assurance group. However, if the partner is not trustworthy, the agent receives a lower payoff. After receiving payoffs, agents learn to modify their behavior. The result of the simulation reveals that the gap between the rich and the poor widens only in the case of a moderately attractive market.

AB Theoretical studies suggest that dispersion and repulsion are two important interactions that occur within non-polar particles. Enlightened by this, we propose a simple model for flocking of autonomous agents interacting by physicochemically inspired dispersion and repulsion interactions. This interdisciplinary effort provides a generic framework for design and analysis of distributed flocking by introducing virtual electrons (VEs). We innovatively utilize the functional theory to construct the energy functional with the distribution density of VEs as the basic variable and then solve the Lagrangian equation to derive the control law of multiagent flocking. Theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed protocol can ensure that autonomous agents asymptotically converge to an equilibrium configuration from chaotic movement and meanwhile all agents tend in time to a common velocity. Numerical simulations are presented to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results. We also give a comparison with the collective potential method and found that the proposed approach can realize the rapid transition of autonomous agents from disordered to ordered movement. This implies that the proposed framework can effectively avoid the limitation of constructing a complicated empirical field and thus may have broad application prospects.

AB This article investigates the event-triggered consensus strategy (ETCS) for uncertain topological fractional-order multiagent systems based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models. First, a novel distributed ETCS, in which the event generator only depends on the information from neighboring agents at event-triggering instants, is designed to reduce the frequency of information transmission among all agents and to ensure a positive lower bound on the interval between any two event-triggering instants for all agents. Then, by applying the fractional Lyapunov method and the designed ETCS, the consensus problem for fractional-order multiagent systems is handled with less waste of system resources compared to the previous related works. According to the proposed consensus criteria, the Zeno behavior is precluded for ETCS. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demon-strate the effectiveness of the designed event-triggered control algorithm. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is based on a study of blue duiker hunting in Djemiong, a forest village in eastern Cameroon. The aim of the study is to understand how the organization of the hunting activity between villagers constitutes a management system. The main species hunted is a small antelope, the blue duiker (Cephalophus monticola, Thunberg). Surveys were conducted to understand the inhabitants' hunting behaviour. Hunting takes place 6 months/year and is subject to a spatial shifting rule. Every year, each hunter changes the location of his traps. This behaviour is presented as a management rule that is implemented by the hunters. A spatially explicit individual-based model is used to compare different rules for trap locations in space and time. We propose a model based on the use of multiagent systems. Creating a multiagent system involves reproducing an artificial world that resembles the observed world - i.e. it is made up of different actors - for experimental purposes. Each agent is represented as an independent computerized entity capable of acting locally in response to stimuli or to communication with other agents. CORMAS (Common-pool resources and multiagent systems), a generic simulation environment based on SMALLTALK, makes it possible to build flexible spatially explicit individual-based models. Using this multiagent simulation software, a model was built based on the life history of the blue-duiker and on the inhabitants' hunting behaviour. The model incorporates data from a geographical information system (GIS) to create an artificial landscape that resembles the village landscape. The results highlight the importance of coordination between hunters, particularly the fact that trap networks are appropriated by family groups. The spatial location of traps seems to have a much more crucial influence on the model than global hunting pressure and the duration of the close season. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Even though the philosophy of simulation is intended as a comprehensive reflection about the practice of computer simulation in contemporary science, its output has been disproportionately shaped by research on equation-based simulation in the physical and climate sciences. Hence, the particularities of alternative practices of computer simulation in other scientific domains are not sufficiently accounted for in the current philosophy of simulation literature. This article centres on agent-based social simulation, a relatively established type of simulation in the social sciences, to exemplify this claim. The analysis advanced has a twofold goal. First, it shows that the philosophy of agent-based social simulation, mostly developed by practitioners themselves, is, on one hand, heavily influenced by the methodological features of agent-based modelling and by the loose and fragmented character of social theory and, on the other hand, distinctively shaped by contrasting views of what it implies to do social research with virtual or artificial societies. Second, it suggests ways in which cross-fertilisation could enrich the philosophical understanding of computer simulation both in agent-based social simulation and in the philosophy of simulation.

AB To meet the rapidly growing demand of localisation and tracking information of mobile agents in cyber-physical systems, in this paper, we propose a fully pipelined and parallel (FPP) hardware architecture of particle probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter for multi-target tracking on the multi-cores processor hardware platforms, where an improved resampling algorithm is designed. We formulate the demand of minimising the processing delay in this architecture as an optimisation problem, which can be efficiently solved by transforming it to a group of mixed non-linear integer programming problems. Delay analysis shows that the proposed FPP particle PHD filter achieves significant improvement of real-time performance, and simulation results demonstrate that tracking performance remains at the same level as traditional particle PHD filters.

AB Computational modeling has significantly impacted our ability to analyze vast (and exponentially increasing) quantities of experimental data for a variety of applications, such as drug discovery and disease forecasting. Single-scale, single-class models persist as the most common group of models, but biological complexity often demands more sophisticated approaches. This review surveys modeling approaches that are multi-class (incorporating multiple model types) and/or multi scale (accounting for multiple spatial or temporal scales) and describes how these models, and combinations thereof, should be used within the context of the problem statement. We end by highlighting agent-based models as an intuitive, modular, and flexible framework within which multi-scale and multi-class models can be implemented.

AB The existence of emotion and cognition as two interacting systems, both with important roles in decision-making, has been recently advocated by neurophysiological research (LeDoux, 1998, Damasio, 1994). Following that idea, this paper presents the ALEC agent architecture which has both emotive and cognitive learning, as well as emotive and cognitive decision-making capabilities to adapt to real-world environments. These two learning mechanisms embody very different properties which can be related to those of natural emotion and cognition systems.
   The reported experiments test ALEC within a simulated autonomous robot which learns to perform a multi-goal and multi-step survival task when faced with real world conditions, namely continuous time and space, noisy sensors and unreliable actuators. Experimental results show that both systems contribute positively to the learning performance of the agent.

AB In this paper we present a simulation prototype of the customers' shopping behavior in a mall using a knowledge-based multiagent geosimulation approach. The shopping behavior in a shopping mall is performed in a geographic environment (a shopping mall) and is influenced by several shopper's characteristics (internal factors) and factors which are related to the shopping mall (external or situational factors). After identifying these factors from a large literature review we grouped them in what we called "dimensions". Then we used these dimensions to design the knowledge-based agents' models for the shopping behavior simulation. These models are created from empirical data and implemented in the MAGS geosimulation platform. The empirical data have been collected from questionnaires in the Square One shopping mall in Toronto (Canada). After presenting the main characteristics of our prototype, we discuss how mall's managers of the Square One can use the Mall_MAGS prototype to make decisions about the mall spatial configuration by comparing different simulation scenarios. The simulation results are presented to mall's managers through a user-friendly tool that we developped to carry out data analysis.

Some new algebraic and graphical characterizations of the observability for the first-order MASs are established based on agreement protocols. Moreover, under the same leader-following framework with the predefined topology and leader assignment, the observability conditions for systems of double-integrator and high-integrator agents are also obtained. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by numerical examples and simulations.

AB In this paper, a novel decentralized adaptive control scheme for multiagent formation control is proposed based on an integration of artificial potential functions with robust control techniques. Fully actuated mobile agents with partially unknown models are considered, where an adaptive fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the unknown system dynamics. The robust performance criterion is used to attenuate the adaptive fuzzy approximation error and external disturbances to a prescribed level. The advantages of the proposed controller can be listed as robustness to input nonlinearity, external disturbances, and model uncertainties, and applicability on a large diversity of autonomous systems. A Lyapunov-function-based proof is given of robust stability, which shows the robustness of the controller with respect to disturbances and system uncertainties. Simulation results are demonstrated for a swarm formation problem of a group of six holonomic robots, illustrating the effective attenuation of approximation errors and external disturbances, even in the case of agent failure. Moreover, experimental results confirm the validity of the presented approach and are included to verify the applicability of the scheme for a swarm of six real holonomic robots.

   selectionism
AB This paper clarifies and develops some of the arguments put forward by W.G. Runciman in his 1998 Sociology article. 'The Selectionist Paradigm and Its Iimplications for Sociology'. It intends to support his basic claim that mechanisms analogous to (but not synonymous with) natural selection are an important way of understanding both continuity and change in social systems. Nonetheless, it questions the emphasis of his discussion and extends his analysis of two substantive points. The argument proceeds in two stages. The paper begins by examining the many objections that Runciman rebuts and showing that many of them do not need rebuttal but are simply irrelevant to the selectionist paradigm. By irrelevant, I mean that the objections are logically flawed or simply do not apply to the selectionist paradigm as Runciman defines it. The purpose of this part of the paper is to sharpen the debate, so that attention can subsequently be focused on a smaller number of relevant objections that remain. The remainder of the paper attempts to open that debate by discussing the two relevant objections that appear most forceful. It attempts to show that, on closer examination, both objections are mistaken. The first objection is that human deliberation makes any analogy with random mutation in biology untenable. The paper argues that in fact selection and deliberation are complementary. Selection will continue to act on social practices to the extent that our models of the world are imperfect and our practices have unintended consequences. The second objection is that while selection is interesting, it may be irrelevant to sociological practice. The last part of the paper provides a more detailed analysis of an example used by Runciman, the task of explaining differeing levels of male lethal violence across societies. This analysis suggests that while Runciman's 'discursive' selectionist analysis (like functionalism) can generate suggestive hypotheses appropriate techniques will be needed to transform those hypotheses into models which sociological research can ultimately test. It is urged that multi-agent computer simulation is a particularly suitable technique for representing evolutionary processes in social systems thus allowing selectionism to be put on the same sort of footing as other 'middle range' explanations like game theory and social network analysis.

AB Myxococcus xanthus cells self-organize into aligned groups, clusters, at various stages of their lifecycle. Formation of these clusters is crucial for the complex dynamic multi-cellular behavior of these bacteria. However, the mechanism underlying the cell alignment and clustering is not fully understood. Motivated by studies of clustering in self-propelled rods, we hypothesized that M. xanthus cells can align and form clusters through pure mechanical interactions among cells and between cells and substrate. We test this hypothesis using an agent-based simulation framework in which each agent is based on the biophysical model of an individual M. xanthus cell. We show that model agents, under realistic cell flexibility values, can align and form cell clusters but only when periodic reversals of cell directions are suppressed. However, by extending our model to introduce the observed ability of cells to deposit and follow slime trails, we show that effective trail-following leads to clusters in reversing cells. Furthermore, we conclude that mechanical cell alignment combined with slime-trail-following is sufficient to explain the distinct clustering behaviors observed for wild-type and non-reversing M. xanthus mutants in recent experiments. Our results are robust to variation in model parameters, match the experimentally observed trends and can be applied to understand surface motility patterns of other bacterial species.

AB This paper focuses on the general problem of coordinating multiple robots, in particular, addresses the problem of the distribution of heterogeneous multi-task in a robust and efficient manner. The main interest in these systems is to understand how from simple rules inspired by the division of labor in social insects, a group of robots can perform tasks in an organized and coordinated way. We take into account a specifically distributed or decentralized approach as we are particularly interested in experimenting with truly autonomous and decentralized techniques in which the robots themselves are responsible for choosing a particular task in an autonomous and individual way. Under this approach we can speak of multi-task selection instead of multi-task assignment, which means, that the agents or robots select the tasks instead of being assigned a task by a central controller. In this regard, we have established an experimental scenario to solve the corresponding multi-task distribution problem and we propose a solution using different approaches by applying the response threshold models inspired by division of labor in social insects, the application of the reinforcement learning algorithm based on learning automata theory and ant colony optimization-based deterministic algorithms. We have evaluated the robustness of the algorithms, perturbing the number of pending loads to simulate the robot's error in estimating the real number of pending tasks and also the dynamic generation of loads through time. The paper ends with a critical discussion of experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Researches on Physarum polycephalum show that methods inspired by the primitive unicellular organism can construct an efficient network and solve some complex problems in graph theory. Current models simulating the intelligent behavior of Physarum are mainly based on Hagen-Poiseuille Law and Kirchhoff Law, reaction-diffusion, Cellular Automaton and multi-agent approach. In this paper, based on an assumption that the plasmodium of Physarum forages for food along the gradient of chemo-attractants on a nutrient-poor substrate, a new model is proposed to imitate its intelligent foraging behavior. The key point of the model is that the growth of Physarum is determined by the simple particle concentration field relating the distance to food source and the shape of food source on a nutrient-poor substrate. To verify this model, numerical experiments are conducted according to Adamatzky's experiment. Results in spanning tree construction by this model are almost the same as those of Physarum and Oregonator model. The proposed model can also imitate Physarum to avoid repellents. Furthermore, the Euclidean Spanning tree built by this model is similar to its corresponding Minimal Euclidean Spanning tree. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Self-adjusting fuzzy cognitive map; Multi-agent systems
AB Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) are distributed computation systems used for qualitative modelling and behaviour simulation. Constructing an FCM is a time-consuming process and the quality of the resulting map is difficult to assess. In this paper we propose an extension to FCMs that self-adjusts the FCM based on real data from the modelled system. The self-adjusting FCM (SAFCM) changes the cause effect relationships and concept inferences for each system data point with the goal of reducing the error between real data and values produced by the map. In this way, the burden of map construction imposed on the map builder is reduced and the initially constructed map can be evaluated by examining the degree of change caused by the self-adjustment. We tested the SAFCM on two case studies where we measured the degree of change to the initial map structure set up by an expert. The experiments showed that the self-adjusted maps produced results that were closer to real data than the maps that were initially set up by the expert. We also compared the SAFCM to a basic FCM and to an FCM that used a standard learning algorithm. The results showed that our algorithm had higher accuracy.

AB A multi-agent model for the simulation of arable land management based on the complex adaptive system theory and a Swarm platform was constructed. An empirical application of the model was carried out to investigate the pollution of arable land in Jiangxi Province. Two sets of policies-a fertilizer tax and an ecological compensation scheme-were designed and simulated, and the analysis focused on the control of polluting inputs, mainly chemical fertilizers and pesticides. The environmental effects of each policy were evaluated by simulating farmers' self-adaptive behaviours in response to the policy in the artificial village of the model. The results showed the following: (1) Both the fertilizer tax policy and the ecological compensation policy somewhat alleviated the negative impact of input factors, such as fertilizers and pesticides, on arable land; (2) if the fertilizer tax policy is implemented, the medium tax rate scheme should be given priority-the effect does not necessarily improve as the tax rate increases, and a high-tax policy will threaten food security in the long term; and (3) if an ecological compensation policy is implemented, high-government-compensation scenarios are better than low-government-compensation scenarios, and the differential-government-compensation scenario is better than the equal-government-compensation scenario, and the differential-government-compensation scenario can lighten the burden on the government.

AB This paper addresses the relative position coordinated control problem for spacecraft formation flying under an undirected communication graph, whilst considering mass uncertainties, external disturbances, and limited communication resources. A new event-triggered information transmission mechanism is first presented, where each spacecraft only requires accessing to the states of neighbors intermittently. Subsequently, a novel event-based coordinated control scheme is proposed by combining a smooth adaptive projection rule that confines the parameter estimations to well-defined bounded convex hypercubes. Under the proposed control framework, the information exchange among spacecraft occurs only when the specified event is triggered, thereby significantly reducing the communication load and saving the onboard resources. Furthermore, a positive lower bound on interevent time intervals is guaranteed to exclude Zeno behavior. By virtue of Lyapunov stability analysis and graph theory, it is proved that the relative position tracking errors can converge to small invariant sets around the origin, and that all closed-loop signals are bounded, even in the presence of mass uncertainties and external disturbances. Finally, numerical simulations are given to evaluate the effectiveness and highlight the advantages of the developed control algorithm.

AB Computational agent-based simulation (ABS) is increasingly used to complement laboratory techniques in advancing our understanding of biological systems. Calibration, the identification of parameter values that align simulation with biological behaviours, becomes challenging as increasingly complex biological domains are simulated. Complex domains cannot be characterized by single metrics alone, rendering simulation calibration a fundamentally multi-metric optimization problem that typical calibration techniques cannot handle. Yet calibration is an essential activity in simulation-based science; the baseline calibration forms a control for subsequent experimentation and hence is fundamental in the interpretation of results. Here, we develop and showcase a method, built around multi-objective optimization, for calibrating ABSs against complex target behaviours requiring several metrics (termed objectives) to characterize. Multi-objective calibration (MOC) delivers those sets of parameter values representing optimal trade-offs in simulation performance against each metric, in the form of a Pareto front. We use MOC to calibrate a well-understood immunological simulation against both established a priori and previously unestablished target behaviours. Furthermore, we show that simulation-borne conclusions are broadly, but not entirely, robust to adopting baseline parameter values from different extremes of the Pareto front, highlighting the importance of MOC's identification of numerous calibration solutions. We devise a method for detecting overfitting in a multi-objective context, not previously possible, used to save computational effort by terminating MOC when no improved solutions will be found. MOC can significantly impact biological simulation, adding rigour to and speeding up an otherwise time-consuming calibration process and highlighting inappropriate biological capture by simulations that cannot be well calibrated. As such, it produces more accurate simulations that generate more informative biological predictions.

AB This paper presents a hybrid model for opinion formation in a large group of agents exposed to the persuasive action of a small number of strong opinion leaders. The model is defined by coupling a finite difference equation for the dynamics of leaders opinion with a continuous integro-differential equation for the dynamics of the others. Such a definition stems from the idea that the leaders are few and tend to retain original opinions, so that their dynamics occur on a longer time scale with respect to the one of the other agents. A general well-posedness result is established for the initial value problem linked to the model. The asymptotic behavior in time of the related solution is characterized for some general parameter settings, which mimic distinct social scenarios, where different emerging behaviors can be observed. Analytical results are illustrated and extended through numerical simulations.

AB Computational models are most impactful when they explain and characterize biological phenomena that are non-intuitive, unexpected, or difficult to study experimentally. Countless equation-based models have been built for these purposes, but we have yet to realize the extent to which rules-based models offer an intuitive framework that encourages computational and experimental collaboration. We develop ARCADE, a multi-scale agent-based model to interrogate emergent behavior of heterogeneous cell agents within dynamic microenvironments and demonstrate how complexity of intracellular metabolism and signaling modules impacts emergent dynamics. We performin silicocase studies on context, competition, and heterogeneity to demonstrate the utility of our model for gaining computational and experimental insight. Notably, there exist (i) differences in emergent behavior between colony and tissue contexts, (ii) linear, non-linear, and multimodal consequences of parameter variation on competition in simulated co-cultures, and (iii) variable impact of cell and population heterogeneity on emergent outcomes. Our extensible framework is easily modified to explore numerous biological systems, from tumor microenvironments to microbiomes.

AB We study opinion dynamics systems controlled by a leader. Following findings from experimental social psychology, the influence weights considered here have the peculiarity to be both state and time dependent. This allows for instance to model loss of patience or interest of individuals. The opinion of the leader is assumed to be controlled using a saturated control. The objective of the leader is to make all agents agree on a desired consensus value. First, all agents are gathered around the leader, which then steers all agents toward the target consensus value, where consensus is achieved. Trajectory tracking is also investigated. The time-dependent interactions have a significant impact on the control law. To achieve the control, the time-dependent term in the interactions is assumed to be persistent in time. Our results are illustrated by numerical simulation throughout the paper.

AB Two competing paradigms for firm-level inventory behavior are production smoothing and (S,s). Empirical evidence that aggregate production varies more than sales, and inventory investment is positively correlated with sales, appears to contradict the buffer-stock/production-smoothing motivation. Work by Blinder and Maccini suggests that an (S,s) model better explains these stylized facts. I simulate a multi-sector model with sequential interaction of heterogeneous agents (representing manufacturing, wholesale and retail agents) who use either smoothing or (S,s) inventory decision rules. The results demonstrate that the stylized facts can be explained by a model of this type.

AB In this paper, an artificial stock market characterized by heterogeneous and informed agents is presented. The heterogeneous agents are seen as nodes of sparsely connected graphs. The agents trade risky assets and are characterized by sentiments, amount of cash and stocks owned. Agents share information and sentiments by means of interactions determined by graphs. A central market maker (clearing house mechanism) determines the price processes for each stock at the intersection of the demand and supply curves. In this framework, the statistical properties of the univariate and multivariate process of prices and returns are studied. Importantly, concerning univariate price processes, the proposed model is able to reproduce unit root, volatility cluster and fat tails of returns. The multivariate price process exhibits both static and dynamic stylized facts, in particular the presence of static factors and common trends. Static factors are studied making reference to the cross-correlation between returns of different stocks, whereas the common trends are investigated considering the variance-covariance matrix of prices. The proposed approach allows to endogenously reproduce the multivariate stylized facts. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the leader-following consensus problem of multiagent systems using a distributed event-triggered impulsive control method. For each agent, the controller is updated only when some state-dependent errors exceed a tolerable hound. The control inputs will he carried out by actor only at event triggering impulsive instants. According to the Lyapunov stability theory and impulsive method, several sufficient criteria for leader-following consensus arc derived. Also, it is shown that continuous communication of neighboring agents can be avoided, and Zeno-behavior can be excluded in our schema. The results are illustrated through several numerical simulation examples.

AB This paper presents a set of guidelines, imported from the field of forecasting, that can help social simulation and, more specifically, agent-based modelling practitioners to improve the predictive performance and the robustness of their models. The presentation starts with a discussion on the current debate on prediction in social processes, followed by an overview of the recent experience and lessons learnt from the field of forecasting. This is the basis to define standard practices when developing agent-based models under the perspective of forecasting experimentation. In this context, the guidelines are structured in six categories that correspond to key issues that should be taken into account when building a predictor agent-based model: the modelling process, the data adequacy, the space of solutions, the expert involvement, the validation, and the dissemination and replication. The application of these guidelines is illustrated with an existing agent-based model. We conclude by tackling some intrinsic difficulties that agent-based modelling often faces when dealing with prediction models.

AB Despite years of study, it is still not clear how life emerged from inanimate matter and evolved into the complex forms that we observe today. One of the most recognized hypotheses for the origins of life, the RNA World hypothesis, assumes that life was sparked by prebiotic replicating RNA chains. In this paper, we address the problems caused by the interplay between hypothetical prebiotic RNA replicases and RNA parasitic species. We consider the coexistence of parasite RNAs and RNA replicases as well as the impact of parasites on the further evolution of replicases. For these purposes, we used multi-agent modeling techniques that allow for realistic assumptions regarding the movement and spatial interactions of modeled species. The general model used in this study is based on work by Takeuchi and Hogeweg. Our results confirm that the coexistence of parasite RNAs and replicases is possible in a spatially extended system, even if we take into consideration more realistic assumptions than Takeuchi and Hogeweg. However, we also showed that the presence of trade-off that takes into the account an RNA folding process could still pose a serious obstacle to the evolution of replication. We conclude that this might be a cause for one of the greatest transitions in life that took place early in evolution-the separation of the function between DNA templates and protein enzymes, with a central role for RNA species.

AB Biosecurity and biosafety are key concerns of modern society. Although nanomaterials are improving the capacities of point detectors, standoff detection still appears to be an open issue. Laser-induced fluorescence of biological agents (BAs) has proved to be one of the most promising optical techniques to achieve early standoff detection, but its strengths and weaknesses are still to be fully investigated. In particular, different BAs tend to have similar fluorescence spectra due to the ubiquity of biological endogenous fluorophores producing a signal in the UV range, making data analysis extremely challenging. The Universal Multi Event Locator (UMEL), a general method based on support vector regression, is commonly used to identify characteristic structures in arrays of data. In the first part of this work, we investigate fluorescence emission spectra of different simulants of BAs and apply UMEL for their automatic classification. In the second part of this work, we elaborate a strategy for the application of UMEL to the discrimination of different BAs' simulants spectra. Through this strategy, it has been possible to discriminate between these BAs' simulants despite the high similarity of their fluorescence spectra. These preliminary results support the use of SVR methods to classify BAs' spectral signatures. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB This paper is an attempt to design an interaction protocol for a multi-agent learning platform to assist a human community in their task of scientific discovery. Designing tools to assist Scientific Discovery offers a challenging problematic, since the problems studied by scientists are not yet solved, and valid models are not yet available. It is therefore impossible to create a problem solver to simulate a given phenomenon and explain or predict facts. We propose to assist scientists with learning machines considered as adaptive problem solvers, to build interactively a consistent model suited for reasoning, simulating, predicting, and explaining facts.
   The interaction protocol presented in this paper is based on Angluin's "Learning from Different Teachers" [1] and we extend the original protocol to make it operational to assist scientists solve open problems. The main problem we deal with is that this learning model supposes the existence of teachers having previously solved the problem. These teachers are able to answer the learner's queries whereas this is not the case in the context of Scientific Discovery in which it is only possible to refute a model by finding experimental processes revealing contradictions. Our first contribution is to directly use Angluin's interaction protocol to let a machine learn a program that approximates the theory of a scientist, and to help him improve this theory. Our second contribution is to attenuate Angluin's protocol to take into account a social cognition level during which multiple scientists interact with each other by the means of publications and refutations of rival theories. The program learned by the machine can be included in a publication to avoid false refutations coming from a wrong interpretation of the theory.

AB Navigation is an essential ability for mobile agents to be completely autonomous and able to perform complex actions. However, the problem of navigation for agents with limited (or no) perception of the world, or devoid of a fully defined motion model, has received little attention from research in AI and Robotics. One way to tackle this problem is to use guided navigation, in which other autonomous agents, endowed with perception, can combine their distinct viewpoints to infer the localization and the appropriate commands to guide a sensory deprived agent through a particular path. Due to the limited knowledge about the physical and perceptual characteristics of the guided agent, this task should be conducted on a level of abstraction allowing the use of a generic motion model, and high-level commands, that can be applied by any type of autonomous agents, including humans. The main task considered in this work is, given a group of autonomous agents perceiving their common environment with their independent, egocentric and local vision sensors, the development and evaluation of algorithms capable of producing a set of high-level commands (involving qualitative directions: e.g. move left, go straight ahead) capable of guiding a sensory deprived robot to a goal location. In order to accomplish this, the present paper assumes relations from the qualitative spatial reasoning formalism called StarVars, whose inference method is also used to build a model of the domain. This paper presents two qualitative-probabilistic algorithms for guided navigation using a particle filter and qualitative spatial relations. In the first algorithm, the particle filter is run upon a qualitative representation of the domain, whereas the second algorithm transforms the numerical output of a standard particle filter into qualitative relations to guide a sensory deprived robot. The proposed methods were evaluated with experiments carried out on a 2D humanoid robot simulator. A proof of concept executing the algorithms on a group of real humanoid robots is also presented. The results obtained demonstrate the success of the guided navigation models proposed in this work.

AB Cultural diversity is a complex and multi-faceted concept. Commonly used quantitative measures of the spatial distribution of culturally defined groups-such as segregation, isolation or concentration indexes-have been designed to capture just one feature of this distribution. The strengths and weaknesses of such measures under varying demographic, geographic and behavioral conditions can only be comprehensively assessed empirically. This has been rarely done in the case of multigroup cultural diversity. This paper aims to fill this gap and to provide evidence on the empirical properties of various segregation indexes by means of Monte Carlo replications of agent-based modelling simulations under widely varying assumptions. Schelling's classical segregation model is used as the theoretical engine to generate patterns of spatial clustering. The data inputs include the initial population, the assumed geography, the number and shares of various cultural groups, and their preferences with respect to co-location. Our Monte Carlo replications of agent-based modelling data generating process produces output maps that enable us to assess the sensitivity of the various measures of segregation to parameter assumptions by means of response surface analysis. We find that, as our simulated city becomes more diverse, stable residential location equilibria require the preference for co-location with one's own group to be not much more than the group share of the smallest demographic minority. When equilibria exist, the values of the various segregation measures are strongly dependent on the composition of the population across cultural groups, the assumed preferences and the assumed geography. Index values are generally non-decreasing in increasing preference for within-group co-location. More diverse populations yield-for given preferences and geography-a greater degree of spatial clustering. The sensitivity of segregation measures to underlying conditions suggests that meaningful analysis of the impact of segregation requires spatial panel data modelling.

ID TUTORIAL
AB Multiagent goal recognition is a tough yet important problem in many real time strategy games or simulation systems. Traditional modeling methods either are in great demand of detailed agents' domain knowledge and training dataset for policy estimation or lack clear definition of action duration. To solve the above problems, we propose a novel Dec-POMDM-T model, combining the classic Dec-POMDP, an observation model for recognizer, joint goal with its termination indicator, and time duration variables for actions with action termination variables. In this paper, a model-free algorithm named cooperative colearning based on Sarsa is used. Considering that Dec-POMDM-T usually encounters multiagent goal recognition problems with different sorts of noises, partially missing data, and unknown action durations, the paper exploits the SIS PF with resampling for inference under the dynamic Bayesian network structure of Dec-POMDM-T. In experiments, a modified predator-prey scenario is adopted to study multiagent joint goal recognition problem, which is the recognition of the joint target shared among cooperative predators. Experiment results show that (a) Dec-POMDM-T works effectively in multiagent goal recognition and adapts well to dynamic changing goals within agent group; (b) Dec-POMDM-T outperforms traditional Dec-MDP-based methods in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure.

AB This paper addresses the robust formation control problem of multiple rigid bodies whose kinematics and dynamics evolve on the Lie group SE(3). First, it is assumed that all followers have access to the state information of a virtual leader. Then, a novel adaptive super-twisting sliding mode control with an intrinsic proportional-integral-derivative sliding surface is proposed for the formation control problem of multiagent system using a virtual structure (VS) approach. The advantages of this control scheme are twofold: elimination of the chattering phenomenon without affecting the control performance and no requirement of prior knowledge about the upper bound of uncertainty/disturbance due to adaptive-tuning law. Since the VS method is suffering from the disadvantages of centralized control, in the second step, considering a network as an undirected connected graph, we assume that only a few agents have access to the state information of the leader. Afterward, using the gradient of modified error function, a distributed adaptive velocity-free consensus-based formation control law is proposed where reduced-order observers are introduced to remove the requirements of velocity measurements. Furthermore, to relax the requirement that all agents have access to the states of the leader, a distributed finite-time super-twisting sliding mode estimator is proposed to obtain an accurate estimation of the leader's states in a finite time for each agent. In both steps, the proposed control schemes are directly developed on the Lie group SE(3) to avoid singularity and ambiguities associated with the attitude representations. Numerical simulation results illustrated the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.

AB The second-order consensus of multiple interacting non-identical agents with non-linear protocols is studied in this article. Firstly, it is shown that all agents with different non-linear dynamics can achieve consensus without a leader. Secondly, an explicit expression of the consensus value is analytically developed for the group of all agents. Thirdly, for the consensus of multiple agents with a leader, it is proved that each agent can track the position and velocity of the leader, which are different from those of the follower agents. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB A recent study on the immunotherapy treatment of renal cell carcinoma reveals better outcomes in obese patients compared to lean subjects. This enigmatic contradiction has been explained, in the context of the debated obesity paradox, as the effect produced by the cell-cell interaction network on the tumor microenvironment during the immune response. To better understand this hypothesis, we provide a computational framework for the in silico study of the tumor behavior. The starting model of the tumor, based on the cell-cell interaction network, has been described as a multiagent system, whose simulation generates the hypothesized effects on the tumor microenvironment. The medical needs in the immunotherapy design meet the capabilities of a multiagent simulator to reproduce the dynamics of the cell-cell interaction network, meaning a reaction to environmental changes introduced through the experimental data.

AB Intelligent traffic signal control (TSC) is essential for transportation efficiency in modern road networks. There is an emerging trend of using deep reinforcement learning techniques to train TSC models in simulators for reducing trial-and-error in real-world scenarios, and recent studies have shown promising results. The target of TSC is to minimize the average travel time of a given area. However, it is impractical to directly optimize the target by setting the average travel time as the reward function due to its nature of feedback latency and difficulty on credit assignment. Existing methods often define the reward function in a heuristic way, which may cause a biased optimization on the real target as they only optimize the accumulative reward. In this work, we propose PlanLight, a novel planning-based TSC algorithm that learns from the demonstration of rollout algorithm, which obtains suboptimal control on the given target, through behavior cloning. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of the rollout algorithm in the multi-intersection control scenario. Moreover, we achieve further policy optimization by improving the base policy in the rollout procedure iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that PlanLight outperforms both conventional transportation approaches and existing learning-based methods in various sizes of traffic datasets. Furthermore, we empirically show the potential of PlanLight to be a general algorithm to obtain improvement on future state-of-the-art TSC methods.

AB To model agent relationships in agent-based models, it is often necessary to incorporate a social network whose topology is commonly assumed to be "small-world.'' This is potentially problematic, as the classification is broad and covers a wide-range of network statistics. Furthermore, real networks are often dynamic, in that edges and nodes can appear or disappear, and spatial, in that connections are influenced by an agent's position within a particular social space. These properties are difficult to achieve in current network formation tools. We have, therefore, developed a novel social network formation model, that creates and dynamically adjusts small-world networks using local spatial interactions, while maintaining tunable global network statistics from across the broad space of possible small-world networks. It is, therefore, a useful tool for multiagent simulations and diffusion processes, particularly those in which agents and edges die or are constrained in their movement within some social space. We also show, using a simple epidemiological diffusion model, that a range of networks can all satisfy the small-world criterion, but behave quite differently. This demonstrates that it is problematic to generalize results across the whole space of small-world networks. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Despite significant progress on stability analysis of conventional multiagent networked systems with weakly coupled state-network dynamics, most of the existing results have shortcomings in addressing multiagent systems with highly coupled state-network dynamics. Motivated by numerous applications of such dynamics, in our previous work [SIAM T. Control Optim., 57 (2019), pp. 1757-1782], we initiated a new direction for stability analysis of such systems that uses a sequential optimization framework. Building upon that, in this paper, we extend our results by providing another angle on multiagent network dynamics from a duality perspective, which allows us to view the network structure as dual variables of a constrained nonlinear program. Leveraging that idea, we show that the evolution of the coupled state-network multiagent dynamics can be viewed as iterates of a primal-dual algorithm for a static constrained optimization/saddle-point problem. This view bridges the Lyapunov stability of state-dependent network dynamics and frequently used optimization techniques such as block coordinated descent, mirror descent, the Newton method, and the subgradient method. As a result, we develop a systematic framework for analyzing the Lyapunov stability of state-dependent network dynamics using techniques from nonlinear optimization. Finally, we support our theoretical results through numerical simulations from social science.

AB Worldwide energy markets have been on a path toward deregulation for several decades. These markets have proven to be difficult to design and run because of their repetitive nature and the externalities provided by reliable grid operation. In a deregulated market environment, our experiments suggest that market participants will pursue their own profit-maximizing objective rather than use an objective that reflects social benefit. Multiagent simulation is useful for gaining insights into market participant behavior under various rules. In this way, market rules can be tested for efficacy and efficiency. In this paper, an agent based on a double-layer diffusion model developed elsewhere [1] is tested and its effectiveness reported.

AB Purpose Many modern firms strive to become sustainable. To this end, they are required to improve not only their own environmental and social performance but also the performance of their suppliers. Building on population ecology theory, we explore how buyers' exposure to supplier sustainability risk and their subsequent risk management strategies at the buyer-supplier dyad level can lead to adherence to sustainability by the supplier populations. Design/methodology/approach We rely on a bottom-up research design, in which the actions of buyers within buyer-supplier dyads lead to population-wide changes on the supplier side. Specifically, we use experimental data on managing sustainability risk to build an agent-based simulation model and assess the effect of evolutionary processes on the presence of sustainable/unsustainable business practices in the supplier population. Findings Our findings suggest that buyers' cumulative actions in managing sustainability risk do not necessarily result in effective population-wide improvements (i.e. at a high rate and to a high degree). For example, in high risk impact conditions, the buyer population is usually able to decrease the population level risk in a long run, but they would need both power and resources for quickly achieving such improved outcomes. Importantly, this positive change, in most cases, is due to the fact that the buyer population selects out the suppliers with high probability of misconduct (i.e. decreased supplier population density). Originality/value Drawing on the organizational population ecology theory, we explore when, to what degree and how quickly the buyers' cumulative efforts can lead to population-wide changes in the level of supplier sustainability risk, as well as the composition and density of supplier population.

AB This paper presents a prescriptive framework for the design and analysis of a class of deterministic extremum seeking controllers (ESCs) based on hybrid dynamic inclusions. This type of ESCs combines continuous and discrete-time dynamics during the seeking process, and its evolution in time is characterized by differential and difference inclusions rather than standard difference and differential equations. Examples of hybrid ESCs include, but are not limited to, purely continuous ESC with optimizers described by set-valued mappings, ESC with arbitrarily fast and slow switching modes, ESC with weakly jumping parameters, as well as distributed ESCs for multi-agent systems with time-varying graphs. Since solutions of systems described by set-valued mappings are usually not unique, we do not insist on this property, but rather we characterize the behavior of all possible solutions generated by the closed-loop system. Making use of recent results in singular perturbations, averaging, and Omega-limit sets of sets for hybrid dynamical systems, we establish a practical asymptotic stability result. Some examples of common classes of seeking dynamics described by hybrid systems are presented, as well as some numerical simulations illustrating their application in standard maximization problems and Nash seeking problems in game theoretical scenarios.

AB Research efforts have demonstrated the potentials of improving the performance of Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems by leveraging personalized thermal comfort preferences and profiles. However, there are remaining challenges for effective control in collective conditioning in multi-occupancy scenarios. In this study, we have investigated the impact of personal thermal comfort sensitivities - distinct individual reactions to temperature variations-on collective conditioning. To this end, we have explored whether taking the thermal comfort sensitivity into account influences the selection of temperature setpoints and the overall probability of achieving comfort. We have also examined the impact of different thermostat temperature resolutions (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 degrees C) on these factors with a hypothesis that finer resolutions could aid in achieving improved overall thermal comfort. In doing so, we have proposed an agent-based control mechanism to simulate the multi-occupancy space, controlled by an HVAC agent to provide air conditioning for multiple human agents using three operational strategies to compare conventional strategies with our proposed approach. The first strategy relies on majority thermal votes, the second one relies on the gap between thermal preferences (i.e., preferred temperature) and ambient temperature, and the third strategy uses thermal comfort sensitivity in addition to preferences. The investigations were conducted by using stochastically modeled comfort profiles (six actual comfort profiles and 15 mathematically synthesized profiles from actual data). These profiles were used to model the behavior of human agents in diverse multi-occupancy scenarios, modeling two to ten occupants in a space for different thermostat temperature resolutions. Our investigations demonstrated that thermal comfort sensitivity plays a statistically significant role in collective conditioning as it resulted in changes of temperature setpoint in 86% of cases and a higher probability of achieving collective comfort.

AB Construction workers' attitudes and behaviors are one of the most important factors of a construction project's performance. As the attention paid to the impact of social influences and norms on worker behavior grows, agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) emerges as a research tool for studying workers' group behavior. With ABMS, researchers can uncover the underlying process of group behavior emerging from individuals' interactions in an organization. However, validating agent-based simulation with real data is the greatest challenge in using ABMS for organizational behavior research. With this background in mind, the objective of this paper is to propose a methodology for creating an empirically supported agent-based model for studying workers' behavior influenced by social norms. The proposed methodology suggests that empirical data collected by a questionnaire can be used for ABMS in three steps: (1) testing the agent behavior rules used in an agent-based model (i. e., testing the modeling assumptions), (2) demonstrating the model behavior's qualitative agreement with real workers' behavior (i. e., testing the simulation results against real data in a qualitative manner), and (3) creating a specific agent-based model with the model parameters that correspond to a specific empirical case. A specific agent-based model created in this way can then be seen as a scenario generator that corresponds to a specific reality and can be used to answer what if questions. Therefore, the model can be used to develop policies/interventions to improve workers' behavior in a given situation. The proposed methodology is illustrated by a study on construction workers' absenteeism that was conducted by the authors. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge of workforce management in construction; the proposed methodology provides a means of simulating workers' group behavior and developing policies/interventions to improve worker behavior at the group level in construction.

AB We present an efficient approach to reactive robot motion planning and collision avoidance. Unlike the traditional methods, there is no centralized control; instead the links and the joints of the robot are autonomous agents. This is a completely new approach. A set of dynamic equations of motion for an arbitrary robot is derived Artificial forces are introduced to express and combine multiple, possibly conflicting objectives, such as avoiding obstacles while approaching a goal. The joint agents impose forces of constraint between the link agents, and these forces establish a flow of information among the agents. The emergent behavior of the multiagent system gives an impression of surprisingly intelligent overall control. The developed method is used in actual industrial applications to control welding robot installations for ship building with up to II degrees of freedom (DOF). Experimental results from the simulation of a 25-DOF snakelike robot operating in a complex three-dimensional structure are given. It is demonstrated that the time complexity is O(n(3)) for branched n-DOF robots, while for serial robots such as standard manipulators and the snake, it is O(n).

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the incentive mechanism design problem of manager under the assumption of bounded rationality in the theoretical framework of principal-agent relationship and provide some insights into the relationship between the economic agent's rationality and incentive mechanism.
   Design/methodology/approach - The framework of principal-agent relationship is based on the full rationality of the agents. However, the agents cannot make optimal decisions in the uncertain and imprecise environment. To capture the essence of incentive scheme, bounded rationality is introduced in the model and the gradient dynamics is applied in modelling bounded rational learning behavior. The corresponding single-task principal-agent problem is solved to obtain the second-best contracts and the effort levels. Furthermore, the results are generalized for the multi-task principal-agent problem.
   Findings - The second-best contract under the assumption of bounded rationality converges to the optimal contract under the assumption of full rationality over time.
   Research limitations/implications - Accessibility of data for empirical research is the main limitation which model will be applied.
   Practical implications - A useful reference for managerial decisions.
   Originality/value - The new approach of bounded rationality modeling and simulation. This paper is aimed at the owners, enterprisers, managers, and workers.

TI Inferring mechanisms of response prioritization on social media under

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Human decision-making is subject to the biological limits of cognition. The fluidity of information propagation over online social media often leads users to experience information overload. This in turn affects which information received by users are processed and gain a response to, imposing constraints on volumes of, and participation in, information cascades. In this study, we investigate properties contributing to the visibility of online social media notifications by highly active users experiencing information overload via cross-platform social influence. We analyze simulations of a coupled agent-based model of information overload and the multi-action cascade model of conversation with evolutionary model discovery. Evolutionary model discovery automates mechanistic inference on agent-based models by enabling random forest importance analysis on genetically programmed agent-based model rules. The mechanisms of information overload have shown to contribute to a multitude of global properties of online information cascades. We investigate nine characteristics of online messages that may contribute to the prioritization of messages for response. Our results indicate that recency had the largest contribution to message visibility, with individuals prioritizing more recent notifications. Global popularity of the conversation originator had the second highest contribution, and reduced message visibility. Messages that presented opportunity for novel user interaction, yet high reciprocity showed to have relatively moderate contribution to message visibility. Finally, insights from the evolutionary model discovery results helped inform response prioritization rules, which improved the robustness and accuracy of the model of information overload.

AB The unbundling of the electricity sector in several activities, some of them provided in a regulated way and some others under competition, poses a number of challenging problems namely because in several areas there are conflicting objectives associated to different stakeholders. These different views and objectives paved the way to the development of new multiobjective tools able to represent this new paradigm. In this scope, this paper presents a multiobjective (MO) formulation for the Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) problem using a new solution approach that combines concepts of evolutionary computation and multi agent population algorithms. The new proposed tool is termed as Multi-Population and Multiobjective Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization - MEPSO-II. The TEP problem is handled in a realistic way preserving the holistic view over the entire planning horizon and the true grid behavior because it considers the multi-stage nature of the problem and we use an AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) model to gain insight on the operation conditions of the network. The multi objective formulation considers the total system cost, on one side, and the Expected Power Not Supplied (EPNS), on the other. The total system cost comprises the investment cost in new equipment and the operation costs while the EPNS takes into account the uncertainties related to the non- ideal behavior of system components using a non-chronological Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical simulations are conducted using the IEEE 24 and the 118 Bus Test Systems in order to compare the proposed MO tool against other algorithms through performance evaluation indices. Although being a higher time-consuming tool, the MEPSO-II enables improving the Pareto-Front and therefore it gives more insight to transmission network planners when compared with other consolidated algorithms described in the literature.

AB We consider a model that demonstrates the crucial role of inertia and stickiness in multiagent systems, based on the minority game. The inertia of an agent is introduced into the game model by allowing agents to apply hypothesis testing when choosing their best strategies, thereby reducing their reactivity toward changes in the environment. We find by extensive numerical simulations that our game shows a remarkable improvement of global cooperation throughout the whole phase space. In other words, the maladaptation behavior due to over-reaction of agents is removed. These agents are also shown to be advantageous over the standard ones, which are sometimes too sensitive to attain a fair success rate. We also calculate analytically the minimum amount of inertia needed to achieve the above improvement. Our calculation is consistent with the numerical simulation results. Finally, we review some related works in the field that show similar behaviors and compare them to our work.

AB People change their beliefs randomly such that both the structure and the properties of the belief system vary with time under several conditions, which is difficult to describe mathematically due to the complexity of this randomness. A precise belief system dynamics can not only help us to identify which properties the belief system has and forecast how it moves, but it can also help the belief system to move in a rea-sonable direction. To find this dynamics, a generalized Friedkin model with time-varying parameters was constructed to analyze the following events: (1) inter-dependent issues, (2) heterogeneous systems of issue dependency constraints, and (3) inter-dependent issues under three types of systems. These systems are characterized with: (1) parameter variations and distributions being only assumed to be bounded, (2) zero mean random parameter variations and disturbances being, in general, a correlated process, and (3) the parameter process {Delta(k)} being a random walk. The dynamics is then obtained by invoking LMS algorithms due to the property of the time-varying parameter. Parameters of the dynamic statistical model produce large enough random matrices with random time-varying structure. The random average theorem was then introduced to transform these matrices to deterministic ones under four strict conditions such that the dynamics could be estimated accurately. The stability conditions corresponding to the belief system dynamics are then provided, in case the belief system is not complex. By contrast, if the belief system is more complex, a corresponding multi-agent computational model is constructed to explain how a more unstable belief system would move. The results show that, the parameter estimated via LMS is relatively deterministic if the issues are inter-independent and the parameter variation is smooth, and vice versa. It is thus possible to conclude that there exists a critical point of the parameter variation such that the analytic solution of the dynamics could be obtained if the complexity is simpler than the critical point. Otherwise, the belief system is unstable and uncontrollable. In the latter case, the dynamics just relies on the parameters statistical property if the beliefs or issues are inter-independent and the dynamics of belief system is more complex. Furthermore, there would exist a phase transition for the belief system such that the minority view would become the dominant view under certain conditions, if the beliefs or issues are inter-dependent. It is concluded that both the system structure and the belief configuration are important to the belief dynamics. The two most important findings of this work are: (1) the stochastic time-varying model matches the property of the belief system and can thus be used to discover more interesting results and (2) the estimation method of the LMS driven by the random average theorem can be generalized to almost all social systems, if the parameters changes are not too violent, while the multi-agent simulation can be used if the parameters change more strongly. These results reveal the law of the essence of economic and management complex adaptive systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB When several experimental treatments are available for testing, multi-arm trials provide gains in efficiency over separate trials. Including interim analyses allows the investigator to effectively use the data gathered during the trial. Bayesian adaptive randomization (AR) and multi-arm multi-stage (MAMS) designs are two distinct methods that use patient outcomes to improve the efficiency and ethics of the trial. AR allocates a greater proportion of future patients to treatments that have performed well; MAMS designs use pre-specified stopping boundaries to determine whether experimental treatments should be dropped. There is little consensus on which method is more suitable for clinical trials, and so in this paper, we compare the two under several simulation scenarios and in the context of a real multi-arm phase II breast cancer trial. We compare the methods in terms of their efficiency and ethical properties. We also consider the practical problem of a delay between recruitment of patients and assessment of their treatment response. Both methods are more efficient and ethical than a multi-arm trial without interim analyses. Delay between recruitment and response assessment attenuates this efficiency gain. We also consider futility stopping rules for response adaptive trials that add efficiency when all treatments are ineffective. Our comparisons show that AR is more efficient than MAMS designs when there is an effective experimental treatment, whereas if none of the experimental treatments is effective, then MAMS designs slightly outperform AR.

ID SAMPLING METHODS; MARKOV; COMPLEXITY
AB We consider an autonomous agent facing a stochastic, partially observable, multiagent environment. In order to compute an optimal plan, the agent must accurately predict the actions of the other agents, since they influence the state of the environment and ultimately the agent's utility. To do so, we propose a special case of interactive partially observable Markov decision process, in which the agent does not explicitly model the other agents' beliefs and preferences, and instead represents them as stochastic processes implemented by probabilistic deterministic finite state controllers (PDFCs). The agent maintains a probability distribution over the PDFC models of the other agents, and updates this belief using Bayesian inference. Since the number of nodes of these PDFCs is unknown and unbounded, the agent places a Bayesian nonparametric prior distribution over the infinitely dimensional set of PDFCs. This allows the size of the learned models to adapt to the complexity of the observed behavior. Deriving the posterior distribution is in this case too complex to be amenable to analytical computation; therefore, we provide a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that approximates the posterior beliefs over the other agents' PDFCs, given a sequence of (possibly imperfect) observations about their behavior. Experimental results show that the learned models converge behaviorally to the true ones. We consider two settings, one in which the agent first learns, then interacts with other agents, and one in which learning and planning are interleaved. We show that the agent's performance increases as a result of learning in both situations. Moreover, we analyze the dynamics that ensue when two agents are simultaneously learning about each other while interacting, showing in an example environment that coordination emerges naturally from our approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an agent can exploit the learned models to perform indirect inference over the state of the environment via the modeled agent's actions.

DE Social choice; Social networks; Multiagent systems
ID DIFFUSION; INFORMATION
AB We investigate the problem of binary opinion aggregation in a social network regarding an objective outcome. Agents receive independent noisy signals relating to the outcome, but may converse with their neighbors in the network before opinions are aggregated, resulting in incorrect opinions gaining prominence in the network. Recent work has shown that, in the general case, there is no procedure for inferring the correct outcome that incorporates information from the connections between agents (i.e. the structure of the social network). We develop a new approach for inferring the true outcome that can benefit from the additional information provided by the social network, under the simple assumption that agents will more readily convert to the true opinion than to a false one, generating a homophilic effect for voters with the correct opinion. Our proposed approach is computationally efficient, and provides significantly more accurate inference in many domains, which we demonstrate via both simulated and real-world datasets. We also theoretically characterize the properties that are necessary for our approach to perform well. Finally, we extend our approach to directed social networks, and cases with many alternatives, and outline areas for future research.

ID DECISION-ANALYSIS; FUZZY; SYSTEM
AB The learning and control space of real-world autonomous agents are often many-dimensional, growing, and unbounded in nature. Such agents exhibit adaptive, incremental, exploratory, and sometimes explosive learning behaviors, Learning in adaptive neurofuzzy control, however, is often referred to as global training with a large set of random examples and a very low learning rate. This type of controller is not reorganizable; it cannot explain exploratory learning behaviors as exhibited by human and animal species. A theory of coordinated computational intelligence (CCI) is proposed in this paper which leads to a reorganizable: multiagent cerebellar architecture for intelligent control, The architecture is based on the hypotheses that 1) a cerebellar system consists of a school of relatively simple and cognitively identifiable semiautonomous neurofuzzy agents; 2) autonomous control is the result of cerebellar agent fine-tuning and coordination rather than complicate computation; and 3) learning is accomplished via individual cerebellar agent learning and coordinated discovery in a leaning-tuning-brainstorming process. Agent-oriented decomposition and coordination algorithms are introduced; necessary and sufficient conditions are established for cerebellar agent discovery and common Sense cerebellar motion law discovery. Nesting, safety, layering, and autonomy-four principles are analytically formulated for the reorganization of neurofuzzy agents, The four Principles extend Saridis' principle of "increasing intelligence with decreasing precision" for hierarchical control to multiagent neurofuzzy control, and bridge a gap between neurofuzzy control and PID control, adaptive learning and exploratory learning, numerical learning and symbolic learning. Basic ideas are illustrated in legged locomotion and gymnastics. It is shown that, with agent-oriented decomposition, a single near-miss example can enable the cerebellar agents of a 3-link or 4-link uniped simulation to learn gymnastic jumps; a small number of fine-tuned agents can form a kernel community which can discover common sense cerebellar motion laws; and a kernel governed by the laws can grow with a geometrical learning rate. Implications of this work to human and animal locomotion control are discussed. Potential applications and extensions of the findings are outlined.

AB A protocol for distributed estimation of discrete distributions is proposed. Each agent begins with a single sample from the distribution, and the goal is to learn the empirical distribution of the samples. The protocol is based on a simple message-passing model motivated by communication in social networks. Agents sample a message randomly from their current estimates of the distribution, resulting in a protocol with quantized messages. Using tools from stochastic approximation, the algorithm is shown to converge almost surely. Examples illustrate three regimes with different consensus phenomena. Simulations demonstrate this convergence and give some insight into the effect of network topology.

ID MEAN-FIELD GAMES; DECISION-MAKING; ANIMAL GROUPS; LOGIT MODEL
AB Inspired by successful biological collective decision mechanisms such as honey bees searching for a new colony or the collective navigation of fish schools, we consider a scenario where a large number of agents engaged in a dynamic game have to make a choice among a finite set of different potential target destinations. Each individual both influences and is influenced by the group's decision, as represented by the mean trajectory of all agents. The model can be interpreted as a stylized version of opinion crystallization in an election for example. In the most general formulation, agents' biases are dictated by a combination of initial position, individual dynamics parameters, and a priori individual preference. Agents are assumed linear and coupled through amodified form of quadratic cost, whereby the terminal cost captures the discrete choice component of the problem. Following the mean field games methodology, we identify sufficient conditions under which allocations of destination choices over agents lead to self-replication of the overall mean trajectory under the best response by the agents. Importantly, we establish that when the number of agents increases sufficiently, 1) the best response strategies to the self-replicatingmean trajectories qualify as epsilon-Nash equilibria of the population game; and 2) these epsilon-Nash strategies can be computed solely based on the knowledge of the joint probability distribution of the initial conditions, dynamics parameters, and destination preferences, now viewed as random variables. Our results are illustrated through numerical simulations.

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of fixed-time consensus tracking control for a class of second-order multiagent systems under an undirected communication graph. A distributed output-feedback fixed-time consensus tracking control scheme is proposed to make the states of all individual agents simultaneously track a time-varying reference state even when the reference state is available only to a subset of the group members and only output measurements are available for feedback. Homogeneous Lyapunov function and homogeneity property are employed to show that the control scheme can guarantee the consensus tracking errors converging the origin in finite time which is bounded by a fixed constant independent of initial conditions. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.

AB The immune system is comprised of numerous components that interact with one another to give rise to phenotypic behaviors that are sometimes unexpected. Agent-based modeling (ABM) and cellular automata (CA) belong to a class of discrete mathematical approaches in which autonomous entities detect local information and act overtime according to logical rules. The power of this approach lies in the emergence of behavior that arises from interactions between agents, which would otherwise be impossible to know a priori. Recent work exploring the immune system with ABM and CA has revealed novel insights into immunological processes. Here, we summarize these applications to immunology and, particularly, how ABM can help formulate hypotheses that might drive further experimental investigations of disease mechanisms.

ID DESIGN
AB One of the main interdisciplinary challenges today is to understand and change the dominant social perceptions and values that support and perpetuate unsustainable practices. Social computational simulations have been conceived in recent years to understand emergent results from complex systems. These dynamic social models are of interest to sustainability researchers because they provide a means to implement hypotheses and explore scenarios that could help extend our understanding of the future role of change agency in society. Change agents are individuals who directly or indirectly enable sustainable behaviors or inhibit practices that damage the environment and large social groups. Evidence-based strategies, guidelines and methods are necessary in order to manage creative change agency more effectively. This paper presents work with computational simulations, known as cellular automata, in order to explore the role of timing in triggering social change through uncoordinated, autonomous individual action. The paper identifies a number of issues related to creative change agency and proposes associated guidelines for practitioners. As a means of early validation, these findings are portrayed against empirical studies in the literature.

TI ACD(3)GPSO: automatic clustering-based algorithm for multi-robot task

AB Purpose
   The multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem is a challenging issue in the robotics area with plentiful practical applications. Expanding the number of tasks and robots increases the size of the state space significantly and influences the performance of the MRTA. As this process requires high computational time, this paper aims to describe a technique that minimizes the size of the explored state space, by partitioning the tasks into clusters. In this paper, the authors address the problem of MRTA by putting forward a new automatic clustering algorithm of the robots' tasks based on a dynamic-distributed double-guided particle swarm optimization, namely, ACD(3)GPSO.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This approach is made out of two phases: phase I groups the tasks into clusters using the ACD(3)GPSO algorithm and phase II allocates the robots to the clusters. Four factors are introduced in ACD(3)GPSO for better results. First, ACD(3)GPSO uses the k-means algorithm as a means to improve the initial generation of particles. The second factor is the distribution using the multi-agent approach to reduce the run time. The third one is the diversification introduced by two local optimum detectors LODpBest and LODgBest. The last one is based on the concept of templates and guidance probability Pguid.
   Findings
   Computational experiments were carried out to prove the effectiveness of this approach. It is compared against two state-of-the-art solutions of the MRTA and against two evolutionary methods under five different numerical simulations. The simulation results confirm that the proposed method is highly competitive in terms of the clustering time, clustering cost and MRTA time.
   Originality/value
   In this methodology, owing to the ACD(3)GPSO algorithm, task allocation's run time has diminished. Therefore, the proposed method can be considered as a vital alternative in the field of MRTA with growing numbers of both robots and tasks. In PSO, stagnation and local optima issues are avoided by adding assorted variety to the population, without losing its fast convergence.

AB This paper presents an experimental investigation into the interfacial behavior of glass fiber-reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars embedded in concrete mixed with internal curing agents. Such an innovative concept to achieve high-performance concrete (HPC) structures has a number of advantages-for example, improved early-age cracking resistance and long-term sustainability. Of interest is the interaction between the noncorrosive GFRP and the internally cured concrete when mechanically loaded. Three types of presaturated internal curing agents-namely, microporous lightweight aggregate (LWA), crushed returned concrete aggregate (CCA), and superabsorbent polymer (SAP)-are employed to supply necessary moisture inside the concrete so that autogenous shrinkage is controlled, along with minimizing self-desiccation and expediting cement hydration. The effect of various replacement or addition ratios of the curing agents is examined in terms of concrete strength, surface friction, and interfacial stresses. A refined bondslip relationship is established in accordance with test observations and probability-based simulation. Simplified design equations are proposed to estimate the embedment length of GFRP bars for the application of internally cured concrete.

AB A consensus problem is investigated for a group of second-order agents with an active leader where the velocity of the leader cannot be measured, and the leader as well as all the agents is governed by the same non-linear intrinsic dynamics. To achieve consensus in the sense of both position and velocity, a neighbour-based estimator design approach and a pinning-controlled algorithm are proposed for each autonomous agent. It is found that all the agents in the group can follow the leader, and the velocity tracking errors of estimators converge to zero asymptotically, without assuming that the interaction topology is strongly connected or contains a directed spanning tree. In terms of the switching topologies between the leader and the followers, similar results are obtained. Finally, these theoretical results are demonstrated by the numerical simulations.

AB Embedding planning systems in real-world domains has led to the necessity of Distributed Continual Planning (DCP) systems where planning activities are distributed across multiple agents and plan generation may occur concurrently with plan execution. Akey challenge in DCP systems is how to coordinate activities for a group of planning agents. This problem is compounded when these agents are situated in a real-world dynamic domain where the agents often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. To date, DCP systems have only focused on cases where agents' behavior is designed to optimize a global plan. In contrast, this paper presents a temporal reasoning mechanism for self-interested planning agents. To do so, we model agents' behavior based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) theoretical model of cooperation, while modeling dynamic joint plans with group time constraints through creating hierarchical abstraction plans integrated with temporal constraints network. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (i) the BDI model specifies a behavior for self interested agents working in a group, permitting an individual agent to schedule its activities in an autonomous fashion, while taking into consideration temporal constraints of its group members; (ii) abstract plans allow the group to plan a joint action without explicitly describing all possible states in advance, making it possible to reduce the number of states which need to be considered in a BDI-based approach; and (iii) a temporal constraints network enables each agent to reason by itself about the best time for scheduling activities, making it possible to reduce coordination messages among a group. The mechanism ensures temporal consistency of a cooperative plan, enables the interleaving of planning and execution at both individual and group levels. We report on how the mechanism was implemented within a commercial training and simulation application, and present empirical evidence of its effectiveness in real-life scenarios and in reducing communication to coordinate group members' activities.

AB Global urbanization is exerting severe stress and having far-reaching impacts on the eco-environment, and yet there exists a complex non-linear coupling relationship between the two. Research on the interactive coupling effect between urbanization and the eco-environment will be a popular area of study and frontier in international earth system science and sustainability science in the next 10 years, while also being a high-priority research topic of particular interest to international organizations. This paper systematically collates and summarizes the international progress made in research on interactive coupling theory, coupling relationships, coupling mechanisms, coupling laws, coupling thresholds, coupling models and coupling optimization decision support systems. The research shows that urbanization and eco-environment interactive coupling theories include the Kuznets curve theory, telecoupling theory, planetary boundaries theory, footprint family theory and urban metabolism theory; most research on interactive coupling relationships is concerned with single-element coupling relationships, such as those between urbanization and water, land, atmosphere, climate change, ecosystems and biodiversity; the majority of research on interactive coupling mechanisms and laws focuses on five research paradigms, including coupled human and nature systems, complex social-ecological systems, urban ecosystems, social-economic-natural complex ecosystems, and urbanization development and eco-environment constraint ring; the majority of interactive coupling simulations use STIRPAT models, coupling degree models, multi-agent system models and big data urban computer models; and research has been carried out on urbanization and eco-environment coupling thresholds, coercing risk and optimal decision support systems. An objective evaluation of progress in international research on interactive coupling between urbanization and the eco-environment suggests that there are six main research focal points and six areas lacking research: a lot of research exists on macroscopic coupling effects, with little research on urban agglomeration and scale coupling effects; considerable research exists on single-dimension coupling effects, with little on multiple-dimension coupling effects; a great deal exists on "one-to-one" dual-element coupling effects, with little on "many-to-many" multiple-element coupling effects; a lot exists on positive feedback coupling effects, and little on negative feedback coupling effects; a great deal exists on empirical coupling effects, and little on theoretical coupling effects; a great deal exists on the use of simple quantitative methods, and little on using integrated simulation methods. Future studies should focus on coupling effects between urbanization in urban agglomerations and the eco-environment, spatial scale coupling effects, multi-dimensional coupling effects, telecoupling effects, "one-to-many" and "many-to-many" element coupling effects, and positive and negative feedback coupling effects. There is also a need to strengthen the development and application of dynamic models for multi-element, -scale, -scenario, -module and -agent integrated spatiotemporal coupling systems and further improve theoretical innovations in coupling effect research and integrate and form complete and diverse coupling theoretical systems.

ID AGENTS
AB We consider a problem of mediated group decision making where a number of agents provide a preference function over a set of alternatives. Then, using such information, a new agent provides its own preferences, and, after that, a mediation step is applied to aggregate the individual preferences in order to obtain a group-preference function. Finally, the most supported alternative is selected. Two key aspects are that the preference functions of the former agents may or may not have uncertainty, and that the mediation process rewards those agents that are open to other alternatives besides their most preferred ones. The question for the new agent is how to score its alternatives in such a way that its most preferred one gets the biggest group support. We propose to define such scoring or preference function as the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. The model also takes into account that imprecision could exist in the preference functions. Through extensive simulations (varying the number of agents, alternatives, etc.), we conclude that the proposal is feasible and effective. Additionally, the usefulness of the mediation process rewarding openness is empirically confirmed.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new agent-based simulation model of bilateral negotiation based on a synthesis of established theories and empirical studies of negotiation research. The central units of the model are negotiators who pursue goals, have attributes (trust, assertiveness, cooperativeness, creativity, time, etc.) and perform actions (proposing and accepting offers, exchanging information, creating value, etc). Design/methodology/approach Methodologically, the model follows the agent-based approach to modeling. This approach is chosen because negotiations can be described as complex, non-linear systems involving autonomous agents (i.e. the negotiators), who interact with each other, pursue goals and perform actions aimed at achieving their goals. Findings This paper illustrates how the model can simulate experiments involving variables such as negotiation strategy, creativity, reservation value or time in negotiation. An example simulation is presented which investigates the main and interaction effects of negotiators' reservation value and their time available for a negotiation. A software implementation of the model is freely accessible at .
   Originality/value The model presented in this paper synthesizes in a novel way a comprehensive range of concepts and theories of current negotiation research. It complements other computational models, in that it can simulate a more diverse range of negotiation strategies (distributive, integrative and compromise) and is applicable to a greater variety of negotiation scenarios.

AB Envy, the inclination to compare rewards, can be expected to unfold when inequalities in terms of pay-off differences are generated in competitive societies. It is shown that increasing levels of envy lead inevitably to a self-induced separation into a lower and an upper class. Class stratification is Nash stable and strict, with members of the same class receiving identical rewards. Upper-class agents play exclusively pure strategies, all lower-class agents the same mixed strategy. The fraction of upper-class agents decreases progressively with larger levels of envy, until a single upper-class agent is left. Numerical simulations and a complete analytic treatment of a basic reference model, the shopping trouble model, are presented. The properties of the class-stratified society are universal and only indirectly controllable through the underlying utility function, which implies that class-stratified societies are intrinsically resistant to political control. Implications for human societies are discussed. It is pointed out that the repercussions of envy are amplified when societies become increasingly competitive.

AB Visual navigation (vNavigation) is a key and fundamental technology for artificial agents' interaction with the environment to achieve advanced behaviors. Visual navigation for artificial agents with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a new research hotspot in artificial intelligence and robotics that incorporates the decision making of DRL into visual navigation. Visual navigation via DRL, an end-to-end method, directly receives the high-dimensional images and generates an optimal navigation policy. In this paper, we first present an overview on reinforcement learning (RL), deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Then, we systematically describe five main categories of visual DRL navigation: direct DRL vNavigation, hierarchical DRL vNavigation, multi-task DRL vNavigation, memory-inference DRL vNavigation and vision-language DRL vNavigation. These visual DRL navigation algorithms are reviewed in detail. Finally, we discuss the challenges and some possible opportunities to visual DRL navigation for artificial agents.

AB This study addresses the problem of formation control with collision avoidance for networked Lagrangian systems with uncertain parameters interacting on directed network communication topologies. Two adaptive formation control strategies with collision avoidance are proposed by making use of adaptive gain techniques for both cases of with and without a dynamic leader. The main objective of the proposed control strategies is to dispatch a group of agents to maintain a desired geometric pattern, while still guarantee collision avoidance at any time, and eventually to achieve velocity matching. A distinctive feature of the developed adaptive gain is to adapt itself duly based on both the network communication topology and collision avoidance constraints, so it is feasible to be implemented in practice. Some general criteria are derived to guarantee that the desired formation with collision avoidance for the networked Lagrangian systems can be achieved. Finally, numerical simulations are given to show the performance of the proposed control methodologies.

AB A circle forming problem for a group of mobile agents governed by first-order system is investigated, where each agent can only sense the relative angular positions of its neighboring two agents with time delay and move on the one-dimensional space of a given circle. To solve this problem, a novel decentralized sampled-data control law is proposed. By combining algebraic graph theory with control theory, some necessary and sufficient conditions are established to guarantee that all the mobile agents forma pregiven circle formation asymptotically. Moreover, the ranges of the sampling period and the coupling delay are determined, respectively. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated by numerical simulations.

AB We present Social Groups and Navigation (SGN), a method to simulate the walking behavior of small pedestrian groups in virtual environments. SGN is the first method to simulate group behavior on both global and local levels of an underlying planning hierarchy. We define quantitative metrics to measure the coherence and the sociality of a group based on existing empirical data of real crowds. SGN does not explicitly model coherent and social formations, but it lets such formations emerge from simple geometric rules. In addition to a previous version, SGN also handles group-splitting to smaller groups throughout navigation as well as social sub-group behavior whenever a group has to temporarily split up to re-establish its coherence. For groups of four, SGN generates between 13% and 53% more socially-friendly behavior than previous methods, measured over the lifetime of a group in the simulation. For groups of three, the gain is between 15% and 31%, and for groups of two, the gain is between 1% and 4%. SGN is designed in a flexible way, and it can be integrated into any crowd-simulation framework that handles global path planning and any path following as separate steps. Experiments show that SGN enables the simulation of thousands of agents in real time.

ID FAIRNESS; BEHAVIOR; MEDIA
AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence and computer science can be used by social scientists in their study of groups and teams. Here, we explain how developments in machine learning and simulations with artificially intelligent agents can help group and team scholars to overcome two major problems they face when studying group dynamics. First, because empirical research on groups relies on manual coding, it is hard to study groups in large numbers (the scaling problem). Second, conventional statistical methods in behavioral science often fail to capture the nonlinear interaction dynamics occurring in small groups (the dynamics problem). Machine learning helps to address the scaling problem, as massive computing power can be harnessed to multiply manual codings of group interactions. Computer simulations with artificially intelligent agents help to address the dynamics problem by implementing social psychological theory in data-generating algorithms that allow for sophisticated statements and tests of theory. We describe an ongoing research project aimed at computational analysis of virtual software development teams.

AB This paper investigates the flocking and the coordinative control problems of multiple mobile agents with the rules of avoiding collision. We propose a set of control laws using hysteresis in adding new links and applying new potential function to guarantee that the fragmentation of the network can be avoided, under which all agents approach a common velocity vector, and asymptotically converge to a fixed value of interagent distances and collisions between agents can be avoided throughout the motion. Furthermore, we extend the flocking algorithm to solve the flocking situation of the group with a virtual leader agent. The laws can make all agents asymptotically approach the virtual leader and collisions can be avoided between agents in the motion evolution. Finally, some numerical simulations are showed to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB This paper develops a multi-criteria methodology to simulate irrigation water markets at basin level. For this purpose it is assumed that irrigators try to optimise personal multi-attribute utility functions via their productive decision making process (crop mix), subject to a set of constraints based upon the structural features of their farms. In this sense, farmers with homogeneous behaviour regarding water use have been grouped, such groups being established as "types" to be considered in the whole water market simulation model. This model calculates the market equilibrium through a solution that maximises aggregate welfare, which is quantified as the sum of the multi-attribute utilities reached by each of the participating agents. This methodology has been empirically applied for the Duero Basin (Northern Spain), finding that the implementation of this economic institution would increase economic efficiency and agricultural labour demand, particularly during droughts.

AB Introduction
   In low-resource settings, empiric case management of febrile illness is routine as a result of limited access to laboratory diagnostics. The use of comprehensive fever syndromic surveillance, with enhanced clinical microbiology, advanced diagnostics and more robust epidemiologic investigation, could enable healthcare providers to offer a differential diagnosis of fever syndrome and more appropriate care and treatment.
   Methods
   We conducted a year-long exploratory study of fever syndrome among patients >= 1 year if age, presenting to clinical settings with an axillary temperature of >= 37.5 degrees C and symptomatic onset of <= 5 days. Blood and naso-pharyngeal/oral-pharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens were collected and analyzed, respectively, using AFI and respiratory TaqMan Array Cards (TAC) for multi-pathogen detection of 57 potential causative agents. Furthermore, we examined numerous epidemiologic correlates of febrile illness, and conducted demographic, clinical, and behavioral domain-specific multivariate regression to statistically establish associations with agent detection.
   Results
   From 15 September 2014-13 September 2015, 1007 febrile patients were enrolled, and 997 contributed an epidemiologic survey, including: 14% (n = 139) 1<5yrs, 19% (n = 186) 5-14yrs, and 67% (n = 672) >= 15yrs. AFI TAC and respiratory TAC were performed on 842 whole blood specimens and 385 NP/OP specimens, respectively. Of the 57 agents surveyed, Plasmodium was the most common agent detected. AFI TAC detected nucleic acid for one or more of seven microbial agents in 49% of AFI blood samples, including: Plasmodium (47%), Leptospira (3%), Bartonella (1%), Salmonella enterica (1%), Coxiella burnetii (1%), Rickettsia (1%), and West Nile virus (1%). Respiratory TAC detected nucleic acid for 24 different microbial agents, including 12 viruses and 12 bacteria. The most common agents detected among our surveyed population were: Haemophilus influenzae (67%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (55%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), Staphylococcus aureus (37%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%), Human Rhinovirus (25%), influenza A (24%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Enterovirus (15%) and group A Streptococcus (12%). Our epidemiologic investigation demonstrated both age and symptomatic presentation to be associated with a number of detected agents, including, but not limited to, influenza A and Plasmodium. Linear regression of fully-adjusted mean cycle threshold (Ct) values for Plasmodium also identified statistically significant lower mean Ct values for older children (20.8), patients presenting with severe fever (21.1) and headache (21.5), as well as patients admitted for in-patient care and treatment (22.4).
   Conclusions
   This study is the first to employ two syndromic TaqMan Array Cards for the simultaneous survey of 57 different organisms to better characterize the type and prevalence of detected agents among febrile patients. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the association between adjusted mean Ct values for Plasmodium and key clinical and demographic variables, which may further inform clinical decision-making based upon intensity of infection, as observed across endemic settings of sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Solid healing agents, such as thermoplastic particles, have been widely used in molecular healing of thermosetting polymers, including conventional thermosetting polymers such as epoxy and thermosetting shape memory polymers (SMPs) such as polystyrene. Despite extensive experimental developments in this field, there is an urgent need for healing theories with the ability to correlate molecular level healing events to the bulk scale recovered material properties. A multiscale healing constitutive theory is developed in this manuscript for self-crack-healing composites with embedded solid healing agents. It is assumed that the matrix is made of SMP; and the model accounts for several microscopic healing processes including; (a) rearrangement of free crack surfaces, (b) surface approaching due to shape memory effect, (c) wetting the free surfaces by the molten solid healing agent, (d) diffusion of the solid healing agent, which has been molten upon heating, into the crack surfaces, and (e) randomization. The Continuum Damage Healing Mechanics (CDHM) is utilized to bridge the microscopic and bulk scales. The healing parameters correlate the microscopic level descriptions of the healing to the recovery of bulk material properties. The model is then introduced into the ABAQUS, through user-defined coding, and it is shown that it correlates well with the experimental observations. The developed physically consistent multiscale theory provides material designers with the ability to optimize their self-healing systems via computer aided simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we propose nonlocal aggregative opinion interactions for a bounded-confidence opinion model to demonstrate the fluctuation mechanism, and then study this opinion fluctuation mechanism by both theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. In this proposed agent-based opinion model, there are stubborn agents and regular agents: while each stubborn agent never changes its opinion, a regular agent updates his/her opinion based on selected agents' opinion values and his/her confidence bound. At first, we show that the global fluctuation for opinions of regular agents occurs almost surely if and only if the confidence bound of regular agents is larger than a critical value. Next, we give an estimated probability bound of the local fluctuation for regular agent opinions when the confidence bound is sufficiently small. Finally, we provide upper and lower bounds on the fluctuation strength and the regular agent opinion mean in the case when the global fluctuation occurs almost surely.

AB We propose an agent-based model of group foraging, EPICURE, for patchily distributed resources. Each agent makes probabilistic movement decisions in a gridworld through a linear combination of current perceptual information and a reinforcement history. EPICURE captures the empirical results from several foraging conditions in previous works, and it leads to a reevaluation of findings from those papers. In particular, human foragers show contingent usage of information, initially using social information to discover resource pools before private sampling information has been established. We describe a series of simulations that test the sources of resource undermatching often found in group foraging experiments. After testing the effects of foragers' starting locations, travel costs, the number of foragers, and the size of uniform food distributions, we discuss a novel hypothesis for undermatching. Spatial constraints lead to inadequate individual and group information sampling and cause group undermatching. The foraging group size, food rate, spatial distribution of food, and resulting forager reinforcement histories interact to produce undermatching, and occasionally overmatching, to resources.

TI Private-Public Opinion Discrepancy

DT Article
ID ATTITUDES; DISSENT; SUCCESS; MODELS; POLICY
AB In many Western societies there are rising concerns about increasing polarization in public debate. However, statistics on private attitudes paint a different picture: the average attitudes in societies are more moderate and remain rather stable over time. The present paper presents an agent-based model of how such discrepancies between public opinion and private attitudes develop at the scale of micro-societies. Based on social psychological theorizing, the model distinguishes between two types of agents: a) those seeking to gain or maintain a good reputation and status, and b) those seeking to promote group harmony by reaching consensus. We characterized these different types of agents by different decision rules for either voicing their opinion or remaining silent, based on the behavior of their proximal network. Results of the model simulations show that even when the private attitudes of the agents are held constant, publicly expressed opinions can oscillate and (depending on the reputational concerns of individual actors) situations can occur in which minorities as well as majorities are silenced. We conclude that the macro-level consequences of micro-level decisions to either voice an opinion or remain silent provide a foundation for better understanding how public opinions are shaped. Moreover, we discuss the conditions under which public opinion could be considered a good representation of private attitudes in a society.

AB Our understanding of the fomite transmission route of diseases remains at an empirical level. There are no data on how surface contamination is propagated by human touching. We designed a novel and effective benchtop experiment to investigate the dynamic transmission of contaminants on multiple environmental surfaces due to touching. The benchtop experiment setting design was based on an inflight norovirus outbreak. Hundreds of representative environmental surfaces in the plane were scaled down, and fluorescent particles were used as surrogate indicators of virus-laden aerosols. The fluorescent particles were initially carried by six index "patients" and then transmitted to other surfaces through the touching behavior of one hundred and twenty-four "passengers." The distributions of fluorescent particles were photographed by cameras when exposed to UV light and the acquired photos were processed using fluorescence imaging techniques to quantify fluorescent particles on each surface. The temporal diffusion of contaminated surfaces was found to follow an S-shaped logistic curve. The aisle seats were found to be more contaminated, which was consistent with the reported higher attack rates in passengers seating along the aisle in the outbreak. This study confirmed the findings of the logistic growth from the multi-agent simulations, and provided a possible mechanism for the role played by environmental surfaces in the fomite route of diseases.

AB Many researchers and practitioners in recent years have become attracted to the idea of investigating the role of uncertainty in the supply chain management concept. In this paper, a multi-period stochastic supply chain with demand uncertainty and supplier disruption is modeled. In the model, two types of retailers including risk-sensitive and risk-neutral retailers with many capacitated suppliers are considered. Autonomous retailers have three choices to satisfy demands: ordering from primary suppliers, reserved suppliers, and spot market. The goal is to find the best behavior of the risk-sensitive retailer regarding the forward and option contracts during several contract periods based on the profit function. Hence, an agent-based simulation approach has been developed to simulate the supply chain and transactions between retailers and unreliable suppliers. In addition, a Q-learning approach (as a method of reinforcement learning) has been developed to optimize the simulation procedure. Furthermore, different configurations of the simulation procedure are analyzed. The R-netlogo package is used to implement the algorithm. In addition, a numerical example has been solved by the proposed simulation-optimization approach. Several sensitivity analyses are conducted regarding different parameters of the model. A comparison between the numerical results and a genetic algorithm shows the significant efficiency of the proposed Q-leaning approach. (C) 2019 Sharif University of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB The study simulated risk-taking and explored its relationship with aspects of personality (i.e., EPQ-R Psychoticism, IVE impulsivity and venturesomeness). The simulation used a multi-tasking board game task, which comprised a behavioural (experimental) measure rather than the more traditional questionnaire approach. This was investigated in 60 community based healthy male control participants and among 30 forensic in-patients (offenders). Among the forensic patients, risk-taking correlated negatively with social desirability and positively with impulsivity and venturesomeness. By contrast, correlations were not significant for the control participants other than risk-taking and impulsivity. The forensic patients exhibited lower rates of risk-taking on the risk simulation task than the healthy controls, and social desirability may be a protective factor against risk-taking among the forensic patients. The findings suggest that a restricted institutional environment influences patients' approach to risk-taking tasks that may not translate into the community. The study represents a pilot of an experimental procedure, which now requires a computer based application in order to improve its reliability and validity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we study the fixed-time event-triggered consensus problem of the uncertain nonlinear multiagent systems. Two fixed-time event-triggered consensus controllers are proposed. In contrast to finite-time results, the convergence time of fixed-time results is independent of initial conditions. Furthermore, continuous communications can be avoided both in the update of controllers and in the triggering condition monitoring. It is proved that there is no Zeno behavior under the fixed-time event-triggered consensus control strategies. The availability of the control algorithms is verified by numerical simulations.

AB There is a growing demand for "end-to-end" models, which are modeling tools used to analyze and understand the fundamental complexities of marine ecosystems and processes emerging from the interaction of individuals from different trophic groups with respect to the physical environment and, even, human activity. These models are valuable quantitative tools for ecosystem-based management. To explore potential answers to complex questions regarding ecosystems using these models, it is necessary to incorporate classical ontogenic changes through the life cycle of target individuals, in addition to inherited behavioral strategies, as an additional differentiating aspect, particularly when the behavior has a direct impact on the ecosystem phenomena under study. However, it is difficult to combine different fine scale time and spatial granularities to infer animal behavior and ontogenic development. This complexity has kept these two levels of analysis separated, because most current tools do not have the required computational resources and advanced software architecture. To address this issue, we propose an individual-based modeling framework that is capable of handling and unifying the two experimental categories with a comprehensive biological and behavioral model that strictly adheres to the physiological functions of ingestion, growth, and metabolism of organisms. In addition, this model incorporates the exchange and transfer of mass and energy through local interactions at all trophic levels (lower to higher), the physical environment, and anthropogenic activity. For the framework to model short time events, such as classical predator-prey interactions, while also generating long-term ecosystem emergent properties, a special interleaving scheduling engine and physical space computer model was devised, which optimizes memory and processing resources. The framework was tested through several experiments with a three-population ecosystem containing up to 40 thousand organisms evolving inside a 200,000 m(2) simulation environment during 12,000 model-hours; yet, requiring only a few hours of program execution on a regular personal computer. The model included various environmental physical elements, such as several hundred shelters, the number of which can be easily modified in each experiment to simulate substrate degradation and its impact on populations. With the aid of the quantitative and qualitative tools provided by the model, it was possible to observe a coupling between prey and predator population dynamics. In conclusion, we confirmed that the end-to-end model developed here could successfully generate detailed specific hypotheses about fish behavior and quantify impacts on population dynamics.

TI Expected utility or prospect theory: Which better fits agent-based
   modeling of markets?
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Multiagent systems; Agent-based modeling
AB Agent-based simulations may be a way to model human society behavior in decisions under risk. However, it is well known in economics that Expected Utility Theory (EUT) is flawed as a descriptive model. In fact, there are some models based on prospect theory (PT), that try to provide a better description. If people behave according to PT in finance environments, it is arguable that PT based agents may be a better choice for such environments. We investigate this idea in a specific risky environment, a financial market. We propose an architecture for PT-based agents. Due to some limitations of the original PT, we use an extension of PT called Smooth Prospect Theory (SPT). We simulate artificial markets with PT and traditional (TRA) agents using historical data of many different assets over a period of 20 years. The results showed that SPT-based agents provided behavior that is closer to real market data than TRA agents, and that the improvement when using SPT rather than TRA agents is statistically significant. It supports the idea that PT based agents may be a better pick to model the behaviour of agents in risky environments. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Opinion Expression Dynamics in Social Media Chat Groups: An Integrated
   Quasi-Experimental and Agent-Based Model Approach
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Review
AB Social media chat groups, such as WeChat and WhatsApp groups, are widely applied in online communication. This research has conducted two studies to examine the individual level and collective level's opinion dynamics in those groups. The opinion dynamic is driven by two variables, people's perceived peer support and willingness of opinion expression. The perceived peer support influences the willingness of opinion expression, and the willingness influences the dynamics of real opinion-expression. First, the quasi-experimental study recruited twenty-five participants as the observation group and found that decreasing perceived peer support would significantly increase individuals' expression willingness to protect his/her opinion. To generalize the individual level findings to a collective level, the second study treated the social media chat groups as an undirected fully-connected social network and simulated people's opinion expression dynamics with an agent-based model. The simulation indicated that (1) with the help of increased willingness of opinion expression, the minority opinion supporters as a collective did not fall silent but continue to express themselves and (2) increasing willingness of opinion expression would maintain the existence of minority opinion but could not help the minority reverse to the majority.

AB This brief is devoted to investigating the H-infinity relay tracking control problem of a group of agents in a monitoring region. In order to solve such a problem, we partition the monitoring region into several "tracking zones" based on a Voronoi diagram. Then, we propose a novel impulsive model to describe this relay tracking problem, and define the H-infinity performance for this model. A relay tracking control protocol, which can guarantee the desired H-infinity performance, is designed based on the solution of a set of matrix inequalities. The effectiveness of the proposed relay tracking control algorithm is illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB The foraging activity of many organisms reveal strategic movement patterns, showing efficient use of spatially distributed resources. The underlying mechanisms behind these movement patterns, such as the use of spatial memory, are topics of considerable debate. To augment existing evidence of spatial memory use in primates, we generated movement patterns from simulated primate agents with simple sensory and behavioral capabilities. We developed agents representing various hypotheses of memory use, and compared the movement patterns of simulated groups to those of an observed group of red colobus monkeys (Procolobus rufomitratus), testing for: the effects of memory type (Euclidian or landmark based), amount of memory retention, and the effects of social rules in making foraging choices at the scale of the group (independent or leader led). Our results indicate that red colobus movement patterns fit best with simulated groups that have landmark based memory and a follow the leader foraging strategy. Comparisons between simulated agents revealed that social rules had the greatest impact on a group's step length, whereas the type of memory had the highest impact on a group's path tortuosity and cohesion. Using simulation studies as experimental trials to test theories of spatial memory use allows the development of insight into the behavioral mechanisms behind animal movement, developing case-specific results, as well as general results informing how changes to perception and behavior influence movement patterns.

AB Predictive materials synthesis is the primary bottleneck in realizing functional and quantum materials. Strategies for synthesis of promising materials are currently identified by time-consuming trial and error and there are no known predictive schemes to design synthesis parameters for materials. We use offline reinforcement learning (RL) to predict optimal synthesis schedules, i.e., a time-sequence of reaction conditions like temperatures and concentrations, for the synthesis of semiconducting monolayer MoS2 using chemical vapor deposition. The RL agent, trained on 10,000 computational synthesis simulations, learned threshold temperatures and chemical potentials for onset of chemical reactions and predicted previously unknown synthesis schedules that produce well-sulfidized crystalline, phase-pure MoS2. The model can be extended to multi-task objectives such as predicting profiles for synthesis of complex structures including multi-phase heterostructures and can predict long-time behavior of reacting systems, far beyond the domain of molecular dynamics simulations, making these predictions directly relevant to experimental synthesis.

AB In this paper, we present a stochastic agent-based model and extend an artificial financial market by considering a stochastic process of market fundamentals. The model predicts that groups of noise traders are busy communicating when market uncertainty is high. In particular, we examine the effects of social interactions on price movements, based on parameter estimation of the group behavior. As traders' reactions to new information act much like an endogenous shock on return volatility, however, we cannot easily find an exact solution for the model with social interactions. Thus, simulation-based inference is used for the model validation; we investigate whether our artificial economy can match the empirical moments observed in five major foreign exchange data sets (as closely as possible). The results indicate that the return volatility under scrutiny can be robustly decomposed into news (45-55 %) and social interaction effects (45-55 %).

ID SIMULATION; IMPLEMENTATIONS; FRAMEWORK
AB Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a bottom-up modeling approach, where each entity of the system being modeled is uniquely represented as an independent decision-making agent. Large scale emergent behavior in ABMs is population sensitive. As such, the number of agents in a simulation should be able to reflect the reality of the system being modeled, which can be in the order of millions or billions of individuals in certain domains. A natural solution to reach acceptable scalability in commodity multi-core processors consists of decomposing models such that each component can be independently processed by a different thread in a concurrent manner. In this paper we present a multithreaded Java implementation of the PPHPC ABM, with two goals in mind: (1) compare the performance of this implementation with an existing NetLogo implementation; and, (2) study how different parallelization strategies impact simulation performance on a shared memory architecture. Results show that: (1) model parallelization can yield considerable performance gains; (2) distinct parallelization strategies offer specific trade-offs in terms of performance and simulation reproducibility; and, (3) PPHPC is a valid reference model for comparing distinct implementations or parallelization strategies, from both performance and statistical accuracy perspectives.

AB We think that Massively Multi-user Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) will soon evolve into Online Societies of political and economic interest. Studying them will require a methodology that balances observation, theory, and application. This paper outlines such a methodology. First we examine the nature of theory itself (meta-theory), including holism (a meta-theory about systematic interconnections between beliefs) and reflective equilibrium (a meta-theory on the recursive nature of theory and information). Next we determine starting points for our studies. We appeal to the production of "spontaneous orders," orders that are not designed but rather emerge from the behavior of agents in a simulation, and which proceed from simple, normative, non-teleological rules. Lastly we examine the character of those rules. We look to where morality and rational choice converge (Gauthier's minimax relative concession) and derive guidelines for designing rules.

AB The paper presents an agent-based model of an evolution of research interests in a scientific community. The research epistemic/funding landscape is divided into separate domains, which differ in impact on society and the perceived utility, which may determine the public willingness to fund. Scientific domains also differ in their potential for attention grabbing, crucial discoveries, which make them fashionable and also attract funding. The scientists may `follow' the availability of funds via a stylized grant based scheme. The model includes possible effects of the additional public relation and lobbying efforts, promoting certain disciplines at the cost of others. Results are based on two multi-parameter NetLogo models. The first uses an abstract, square lattice topology, and serves as a tool to understand the effects of the parameters describing the individual preferences. The second model, sharing the internal dynamics with the first one, is based on an actual research topics map and projects statistics, derived from the UK Research Council data for 2007-2016. Despite simplifications, results reproduce characteristics of the British research community surprisingly well.

AB The aim of this article is to show the advantages that the use of a multiagent model can provide in implementing vertical and lateral coordination among the components of a noncentralized distribution chain. This model has been implemented in Java language in order to allow for the development of a Web-based decision support system that can perform the coordination strategies, simulated in this article in a real logistics chain.
   This article, after introducing the main concepts related to the adoption of coordination mechanisms within a supply chain, the main issues of agent-oriented technology, and a brief review of the related literature, presents the structure of the proposed model and the static and dynamic behaviors of the decision-making agents. The design issues of specific coordination models, the negotiation mechanisms introduced, and their proper tuning are then discussed. The models have been applied to a real two-level distribution system of an electromechanical company, made up of a supplier and a geographically distributed network of retailers. Experimental results showed the benefits derived from the adoption of coordination-based models, above all in supply contexts, characterized by relevant information sharing among the main tiers of the chain.

AB Background: Molecular heterogeneity of tumors suggests the presence of multiple different subclones that may limit response to targeted therapies and contribute to acquisition of drug resistance, but its quantification has remained challenging.
   Results: We performed simulations to evaluate statistical measures that best capture the molecular diversity within a group of tumors for either continuous (gene expression) or discrete (mutations, copy number alterations) molecular data. Dispersion based metrics in the principal component space best captured the underlying heterogeneity. To demonstrate utility of these measures, we characterized the diversity in transcriptional and genomic profiles of different breast tumor subtypes, and showed that basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) are significantly more heterogeneous molecularly than other subtypes. Our analysis also suggests that transcriptional diversity is a global characteristic of the tumors observed across the majority of molecular pathways. Among basal-like tumors, those that were resistant to multi-agent chemotherapy showed greater transcriptional diversity compared to chemotherapy-sensitive tumors, suggesting that potentially multiple mechanisms may be contributing to chemotherapy resistance.
   Conclusions: We proposed and validated measures of transcriptional and genomic diversity that can quantify the molecular diversity of tumors. We applied the new measures to genomic data from breast tumors and demonstrated that basal-like breast cancers are significantly more diverse than other breast cancers. The observation that chemo-resistant tumors are significantly more diverse molecularly than chemosensitive tumors implies that multiple resistance mechanisms may be active, thus limiting the sensitivity and accuracy of predictive markers of chemotherapy response.

AB A characteristic aspect of risks in a complex, modern society is the nature and degree of the public response - sometimes significantly at variance with objective assessments of risk. A large part of the risk management task involves anticipating, explaining and reacting to this response. One of the main approaches we have for analysing the emergent public response, the social amplification of risk framework, has been the subject of little modelling. The purpose of this paper is to explore how social risk amplification can be represented and simulated. The importance of heterogeneity among risk perceivers, and the role of their social networks in shaping risk perceptions, makes it natural to take an agent-based approach. We look in particular at how to model some central aspects of many risk events: the way actors come to observe other actors more than external events in forming their risk perceptions; the way in which behaviour both follows risk perception and shapes it; and the way risk communications are fashioned in the light of responses to previous communications. We show how such aspects can be represented by availability cascades, but also how this creates further problems of how to represent the contrasting effects of informational and reputational elements, and the differentiation of private and public risk beliefs. Simulation of the resulting model shows how certain qualitative aspects of risk response time series found empirically- such as endogenously-produced peaks in risk concern- can be explained by this model.

AB The use of agent-based modelling approaches in ex-post and ex-ante evaluations of agricultural policies has been progressively increasing over the last few years. There are now a sufficient number of models that it is worth taking stock of the way these models have been developed. Here, we review 20 agricultural agent-based models (ABM) addressing heterogeneous decision-making processes in the context of European agriculture. The goals of this review were to i) develop a framework describing aspects of farmers' decision-making that are relevant from a farm-systems perspective, ii) reveal the current state-of-the-art in representing farmers' decision-making in the European agricultural sector, and iii) provide a critical reflection of underdeveloped research areas and on future opportunities in modelling decision-making. To compare different approaches in modelling farmers' behaviour, we focused on the European agricultural sector, which presents a specific character with its family farms, its single market and the common agricultural policy (CAP). We identified several key properties of farmers' decision-making: the multi-output nature of production; the importance of non-agricultural activities; heterogeneous household and family characteristics; and the need for concurrent short- and long-term decision-making. These properties were then used to define levels and types of decision-making mechanisms to structure a literature review. We find most models are sophisticated in the representation of farm exit and entry decisions, as well as the representation of long-term decisions and the consideration of farming styles or types using farm typologies. Considerably fewer attempts to model farmers' emotions, values, learning, risk and uncertainty or social interactions occur in the different case studies. We conclude that there is considerable scope to improve diversity in representation of decision-making and the integration of social interactions in agricultural agent-based modelling approaches by combining existing modelling approaches and promoting model inter-comparisons. Thus, this review provides a valuable entry point for agent-based modellers, agricultural systems modellers and data driven social scientists for the re-use and sharing of model components, code and data. An intensified dialogue could fertilize more coordinated and purposeful combinations and comparisons of ABM and other modelling approaches as well as better reconciliation of empirical data and theoretical foundations, which ultimately are key to developing improved models of agricultural systems.

AB Filter bubbles and echo chambers have both been linked recently by commentators to rapid societal changes such as Brexit and the polarization of the US American society in the course of Donald Trump's election campaign. We hypothesize that information filtering processes take place on the individual, the social, and the technological levels (triple-filter-bubble framework). We constructed an agent-based modelling (ABM) and analysed twelve different information filtering scenarios to answer the question under which circumstances social media and recommender algorithms contribute to fragmentation of modern society into distinct echo chambers. Simulations show that, even without any social or technological filters, echo chambers emerge as a consequence of cognitive mechanisms, such as confirmation bias, under conditions of central information propagation through channels reaching a large part of the population. When social and technological filtering mechanisms are added to the model, polarization of society into even more distinct and less interconnected echo chambers is observed. Merits and limits of the theoretical framework, and more generally of studying complex social phenomena using ABM, are discussed. Directions for future research such as ways of comparing our simulations with actual empirical data and possible measures against societal fragmentation on the three different levels are suggested.

AB The PartNET++ system is an experimental mull-agent-based simulation tool that uses a new model based on hyper-graphs for understanding partnership formation among heterogeneous agents. Based on a previous tool called PARTNET, by Conte and Pedone [2], the agents of the system have goals to achieve and actions that lead to these goals, which must be performed by other agents. When choosing preferred partners, the agents may have different strategies (utilitarians, subtantialists and misers). In PART-NET, partnerships were restricted to two agents, and the authors have shown that some social hypotheses were validated, i.e., that in heterogeneous societies, utilitarians should have the best net benefit, followed by substantialists, then my misers. By using the PartNet++ simulator in several new experiments, it is shown in this work that results that are valid for partnerships between two agents can be generalized for multiple agents.

AB This paper presents ACCESS, an agent-based model for exploring job accessibility inequalities among different social groups. ACCESS allows for investigation on the impact of public transport and land use policies on the residential location of the working population and their accessibility to job opportunities. ACCESS can be adapted to different realities, allowing to represent societies with diverse socioeconomic disparities. A utility function composed of job accessibility and neighborhood status is maximized by agents during the residential location choice process. The model outputs include Lorenz curves considering the accessibility dimension, as well as Gini metrics to support the analysis of interventions impacts on accessibility inequalities. An empirical case study is performed on the municipality of Sao Paulo, which is characterized by high levels of inequality. Five experiments were simulated considering three different socio-occupational groups. The first experiment includes (i) new public mass rail transport lines, and the other four experiments consider the new transport infrastructure from the first experiment and add (ii) new social housing location strategies; (iii) new job locations; (iv) new jobs and different social housing supplies and location strategies; and (v) provision of social housing based on a government housing program. The results show that ACCESS allowed the residential location of different social status groups to be depicted with a high correlation to the observed situation. Regarding the case study, the results indicate that only having interventions on transport system is insufficient to provide a significant change in terms of inequality. Better results that impact inequality are reached with public mass rail transport interventions associated with land use policies with different social housing and job location programs.

AB Modern video games come with highly realistic graphics enabling the players to interact with visually rich virtual worlds. Realistic (life-like) animation of nonplayer characters (NPCs) in such virtual worlds is particularly important to enhance the gaming experience. Multiagent systems are one effective approach to synthesize life-like behaviors and interactions by codifying simple rules into NPCs (each NPC as an autonomous agent). However, such behaviors generally come at the cost of increasing computational expense and complexity in terms of aspects such as number of rules and parameters. Therefore, the desire for high fidelity (highly realistic) behaviors is often in conflict with the drive for low complexity. Multiobjective evolutionary algorithms provide a sophisticated mechanism to optimize two or more conflicting objectives simultaneously. However, evolutionary computing techniques need an appropriate objective function to drive the exploration in the correct direction. Pairing of evolutionary techniques and multiagent systems is challenging in the classes of problems in which the fitness is evaluated based on human aesthetic judgment rather than on objective forms of measurements. In this study, we present a multiobjective evolutionary framework to evolve low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems by utilizing a machine learning system trained by bootstrapping human aesthetic judgment. We have gathered empirical data in three problem areas-simulation of conversational group dynamics, sheepdog herding behaviors, and traffic dynamics, and show the effectiveness of our approach in deriving low complexity and high fidelity multiagent systems. Further, we have identified common properties of the Pareto-optimal frontiers in the three problem areas that can ultimately lead to an understanding of a relationship between simulation model complexity and behavior fidelity. This understanding will be useful in deciding which level of behavioral fidelity is required for the characters in video games based on the distance to the camera, importance to the scene, and available computational resources.

AB This article investigates circular formation control problems for a group of anonymous mobile robots in the plane, where all robots can converge asymptotically to a predefined circular orbit around a fixed target point without collision, and maintain any desired relative distances from their neighbors. Given the limited resources for communication and computation of robots, a distributed event-triggered method is firstly designed to reduce dependence on resources in multi-robot systems, where the controller's action is determined by whether the norm of the event-trigger function exceeds zero through continuous sampling. And then, to further minimize communications costs, a self-triggered strategy is proposed, which only uses discrete states sampled and sent by neighboring robots at their event instants. Furthermore, for the two proposed control laws, a Lyapunov functional is constructed, which allows sufficient stability conditions to be obtained on the circular formation for multi-robot systems. And at the same time, the controllers are proved to exclude Zeno behavior. At last, numerical simulation of controlling uniform and non-uniform circular formations by two control methods are conducted. Simulation results show that the designed controller can control all mobile robots to form either a uniform circular formation or a non-uniform circular formation while maintaining any desired relative distances between robots and guaranteeing that there is no collision during the whole evolution. One of the essential features of the proposed control methods is that they reduce the update rates of controllers and the communication frequency between robots. And also, the spatial order of robots is also preserved throughout the evaluation of the system without collision.

AB Previous work on computational trust has delivered robust aggregation engines that proved competent in estimating the trustworthiness of agents. However, most of these approaches were evaluated through simulation using simple and static agents' populations that did not consider the social account of trust. In this paper, we show by experimental analysis that these approaches tend to perform poorly when the populations of agents form social structures that evolve with the situation and the relationship existing between partners. Moreover, we present an approach to social-aware computational trust based on Social Tuner, a new component that we developed that infers the benevolence of the trustee toward the truster from the available evidence. We show by experimental analysis that this approach outperforms the social-less aggregation engines in a relevant way. The experiments are run using a model of agents' behavior grounded on the literature of social trust and benevolence that we have developed and describe in detail in this paper.

ID PREDICTIVE CONTROL; DESIGN; AGENTS
AB An event-triggered-based external consensus control protocol with delay compensation for networked multiagent systems (NMASs) with nonlinear dynamics and network-induced delays is discussed in this paper. An RBF-ARX modelling method is adopted to approximate a nonlinear system. By utilizing the RBF-ARX model, the locally linearized time series model can be obtained to describe the behaviour of agents with nonlinear characteristics. An event-triggered control protocol with communication delay compensation is proposed to reduce the effects of network-induced delays and the times of the agent's control update and communication between others by applying the idea of a prediction strategy. The event-triggered mechanism for each agent only depends on the deviation between its own output and the delay-compensated output of neighboring agents. Then, a distributed event-triggered-based and delay-compensated external consensus control protocol is given. Under this proposed control protocol, both the consensus and stability of the system can be proved. Finally, a numerical simulation is performed to verify the availability of our results.

AB In this paper, a neighbour-based control algorithm of group consensus is designed for a class of hybrid-based heterogeneous multiagent systems with communication time delay. We consider the statics leaders and active leaders, respectively. The original systems are transformed into new error systems by transformation. On the basis of the systems, applying Lyapunov stability theory and adopting the linear matrix inequality method, sufficient conditions which guarantee the heterogeneous multiagent systems stability are obtained. To illustrate the validity of theoretical results, some numerical simulations are given at the end of the paper.

AB Previous studies examining the impact of the unethical behavior of a group of colleagues on an individuals unethical behavior have typically employed social learning theory as a theoretical foundation. In this research, we extend these rich yet defective examinations by addressing the largely ignored relationship perspective. Drawing on the social network perspective, we posit that the structure of relationships significantly influences the process of unethical behavior diffusion. Consistent with the theoretically derived hypotheses, our agent-based model simulation results provide general support for our theoretical model: colleagues unethical behaviors positively affect an individuals unethical behaviors, and this influence is positively moderated by group network density, group network closeness centrality and group size. This paper also discusses theoretical contributions, practical values, limitations and directions for future research.

AB We propose a model for the diffusion of several products competing in a common market based on the generalization of the Ising model of statistical mechanics (Potts model). Using an agent based implementation we analyze two problems: (i) a three options case, i.e. to adopt a product A, a product B, or non-adoption and (ii) a four option case, i.e. the adoption of product A, product B, both, or none. In the first case we analyze a launching strategy for one of the two products, which delays its launching with the objective of competing with improvements. Market shares reached by each product are then estimated at market saturation. Finally, simulations are carried out with varying degrees of social network topology, uncertainty, and population homogeneity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Empirical studies indicate that the transition to parenthood is influenced by an individual's peer group. To study the mechanisms creating interdependencies across individuals' transition to parenthood and its timing, we apply an agent-based simulation model. We build a one-sex model and provide agents with three different characteristics: age, intended education, and parity. Agents endogenously form their network based on social closeness. Network members may then influence the agents' transition to higher parity levels. Our numerical simulations indicate that accounting for social interactions can explain the shift of first-birth probabilities in Austria during the period 1984 to 2004. Moreover, we apply our model to forecast age-specific fertility rates up to 2016.

AB This paper proposes cooperative control protocols for a group of unmanned vehicles to make a stable formation around a maneuvering target. The control protocols are proposed on the basis of heterogeneous communication networks, which represents more challenging and generalized situations. Two different scenarios are considered. Separate control protocols are developed for each case. In both scenarios, agents do not have relative position, velocity, and acceleration measurements as feedback. In the first scenario, each agent uses its own position and velocity measurement in a consensus algorithm. In the second scenario, each agent needs only its own position information for the consensus algorithm. For both protocols, agents compute virtual estimates of a target's position and velocity and exchange these among the neighbors. Three different communication networks are used for exchanging two virtual estimates calculated by each agent and a time derivative of one virtual estimate. Each interagent communication network is represented by a fixed, undirected, and connected graph. Furthermore, it is considered that at least one agent receives the position, velocity, and acceleration information of the maneuvering target. It is not necessary that the agent receiving the target's position and the agent receiving the velocity and/or the acceleration information of the target be the same. However, the target does not receive any information about any agent. Stability of the formation is analyzed by using Barbalat's lemma. It is also shown that, despite the large difference in received information, the acceleration of the agents remains bounded for all time. The performance of the proposed formation control protocols is illustrated through numerical simulations.

AB The stochastic dynamics of the multi-state voter model is investigated on a class of complex networks made of non-overlapping cliques, each hosting a political candidate and interacting with the others via ErdAs-R,nyi links. Numerical simulations of the model are interpreted in terms of an ad-hoc mean field theory, specifically tuned to resolve the inter/intra-clique interactions. Under a proper definition of the thermodynamic limit (with the average degree of the agents kept fixed while increasing the network size), the model is found to display the empirical scaling discovered by Fortunato and Castellano (Phys Rev Lett 99(13):138701, 2007) , while the vote distribution resembles roughly that observed in Brazilian elections.

AB The management of recreational fishing requires resolving conflicting interests and is thus among the most controversial natural resource related issues. Decision making is difficult because of two main factors: first, there is lack of prediction tools that help managers and other stakeholders assess the potential impacts of management changes; second, decisions or management strategies affect multiple social and ecological outcomes and picking the best among sets of multiple outcomes is a complex task. Resource management and stakeholder dialogue can be greatly improved by addressing these problems. In this paper, we propose a decision support system (DSS) for assessing management strategies. The DSS incorporates an integrated agent-based simulation model for tackling the first obstacle and an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation approach to facilitate multi-criteria decision making.
   The agent-based simulation model incorporates recreational fishing behaviour within a reef ecosystem. Angler behaviour is driven by empirically estimated site choice models which link recreational choices to site attributes and angler characteristics. Coral reef ecosystem dynamics is modelled using a trophic-dynamic model describing the relationship among fish populations, fishing activities as well as algal and coral growth. The second component of the DSS, the AHP-fuzzy comprehensive evaluation part, allows one to combine resource managers' preferences with simulated economic and ecosystem outcomes in the assessment of alternative strategies. A fuzzy multi-criteria, multi-layer evaluation method is used to obtain final ranking.
   As a case study for this paper, we focus on the management of recreational fishing sites from the Ningaloo Marine Park, an iconic coral reef system in Western Australia. A set of management strategies, including a "business-as-usual" strategy and alternative site closure strategies are assessed using the proposed DSS. The site closure strategies evaluated vary in length and timing. Further, these evaluations are undertaken for two fishing pressure scenarios (high and low). We illustrate the usefulness of the DSS by evaluating these strategies. We also present some results from a sensitivity analysis focussing on changes in preferences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding the functioning of biological systems depends on tackling complexity spanning spatial scales from genome to organ to whole organism. The basic unit of life, the cell, acts to co-ordinate information received across these scales and processes the myriad of signals to produce an integrated cellular response. Cells interact with and respond to other cells through direct or indirect contact, resulting in emergent structure and function of tissues and organs. Systems biology has traditionally used either a 'top-down' or 'bottom-up' approach. However, neither approach takes account of heterogeneity or 'noise', which is an inherent feature of cellular behaviour and may have significant impact on system level behaviour. We review existing approaches to modelling that use cellular automata or agent-based methodologies, where individual cells are represented as equivalent virtual entities governed by simple rules. These paradigms allow a direct one-to-one mapping between real and virtual cells that can be exploited in terms of acquiring parameters from experimental systems, or for model validation. Such models are inherently extensible and can be integrated with other modelling modalities (e.g. partial or ordinary differential equations) to model multi-scale phenomena. Alternatively, hierarchical agent models may be used to explore the functions of biological systems across temporal and spatial scales. This review examines individual-based models and the application of the paradigm to explore multi-scale phenomena in biology. In so doing, it demonstrates how cellular-based models have begun to play an important role in the development of 'middle-out' models, but with considerable potential for future development.

AB This paper addresses the flocking motion problem for swarms of agents with two restrictions: limited communication/detection ranges and different input constraints. In this problem, the distance between pairs of agents determines if a communication/detection link exists among them, while each agent has a different control action bound. We use the notion of proximity graph to model communication/detection between agents and provide distributed controllers designed for leaderless and leader-followers flocking motion scenarios. Our proposed designs preserve the connectivity of the proximity graph while the control effort satisfies the bound of each particular agent. Unlike previous results, our protocols take advantage of the group's input heterogeneity to use agents with a greater capacity to compensate for neighbors that are less capable of meeting the group's requirements. Additionally, our designs are based only on local state errors and are robust to non-modeled edge failures. To illustrate the effectiveness of our proposal, we use numerical simulations of different flocking scenarios. (c) 2021 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this work is presented a hydrodynamic and mass transfer study using the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) for typical experimental measurements and theoretical calculations for pyrite (FeS2) dissolution in acid media using ozone as an oxidizing agent, which occurs in a laboratory glass reactor. The hydrodynamics for the reactor employed, was evaluated with the Navier-Stokes equations (k-epsilon) RNG turbulence model and the VOF multi-phase model. The results of the hydrodynamic simulation study show that the reactor can operate at a speed range of 1.2 to 4.4 m/s at a total pressure of 12.5 Pa; the Reynolds numerical profile indicates that the flow has a turbulent behavior inside the reactor. For the mass transfer simulation, the model of finite velocity-Eddy dissipation was used for solving the kinetic of the reaction, and was performed for 3 different particle fractions: -106 +75 mu m, -38 +25 mu m and -25 mu m. The simulation results present differences of 17%, 13% and 2% respectively, in comparison with experimental data for pyrite dissolved.

AB The advent of social media and technologies augmenting social communication has dramatically amplified the role of rumor spreading in shaping society, via means of misinformation and fact distortion. Existing research commonly utilize contagion mechanisms, statistical mechanics frameworks, or complex-network opinion dynamics models. In this paper, we incorporate information distortion and polarization effects into an opinion dynamics model based on information entropy, modeling imprecision in human memory and communication, and the consequent progressive drift of information toward subjective extremes. Simulation results predict a wide variety of possible system behavior, heavily dependent on the relative trust placed on individuals of differing social connectivity. Mass-polarization toward a positive or negative consensus occurs when a synergistic mechanism between preferential trust and polarization tendencies is sustained; a division of the population into segregated groups of different polarity is also possible under certain conditions. These results may aid in the analysis and prediction of opinion polarization phenomena on social platforms, and the presented agent-based modeling approach may aid in the simulation of complex-network information systems.

AB We present a multiagent model illustrating the emergence of two different quantum statistics, Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac, in a friendly population of individuals with the right-brain dominance and in a competitive population of individuals with the left-brain hemisphere dominance, correspondingly. Doing so, we adduce the arguments that Lefebvre's "algebra of conscience" can be used in a natural way to describe decision-making strategies of agents simulating people with different brain dominance. One can suggest that the emergence of the two principal statistical distributions is able to illustrate different types of society organization and also to be used in order to simulate market phenomena and psychic disorders, when a switching of hemisphere dominance is involved.

TI The paradox of productivity during quarantine: an agent-based simulation
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
LA English
DT Article
AB Economies across the globe were brought to their knees due to lockdowns and social restriction measures to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, despite the quick switch to remote working. This downfall may be partially explained by the "water cooler effect", which holds that higher levels of social interaction lead to higher productivity due to a boost in people's mood. Somewhat paradoxically, however, there are reports of increased productivity in the remote working scenario. Here we address quantitatively this issue using a variety of experimental findings of social psychology that address the interplay between mood, social interaction and productivity to set forth an agent-based model for a workplace composed of extrovert and introvert agent stereotypes that differ solely on their propensities to initiate a social interaction. We find that the effects of curtailing social interactions depend on the proportion of the stereotypes in the working group: while the social restriction measures always have a negative impact on the productivity of groups composed predominantly of introverts, they may actually improve the productivity of groups composed predominantly of extroverts. Our results offer a proof of concept that the paradox of productivity during quarantine can be explained by taking into account the distinct effects of the social distancing measures on extroverts and introverts.

AB Agent-based modeling is a long-standing but underused method that allows researchers to simulate artificial worlds for hypothesis testing and theory building. Agent-based models (ABMs) offer unprecedented control and statistical power by allowing researchers to precisely specify the behavior of any number of agents and observe their interactions over time. ABMs are especially useful when investigating group behavior or evolutionary processes and can uniquely reveal nonlinear dynamics and emergence-the process whereby local interactions aggregate into often-surprising collective phenomena such as spatial segregation and relational homophily. We review several illustrative ABMs, describe the strengths and limitations of this method, and address two misconceptions about ABMs: reductionism and "you get out what you put in." We also offer maxims for good and bad ABMs, give practical tips for beginner modelers, and include a list of resources and other models. We conclude with a seven-step guide to creating your own model.

AB A multi-layer agent-based model (ABM) of biomaterial scaffold vascularization is extended to consider the effects of scaffold degradation kinetics on blood vessel formation. A degradation model describing the bulk disintegration of porous hydrogels is incorporated into the ABM. The combined degradation-angiogenesis model is used to investigate growing blood vessel networks in the presence of a degradable scaffold structure. Simulation results indicate that higher porosity, larger mean pore size, and rapid degradation allow faster vascularization when not considering the structural support of the scaffold. However, premature loss of structural support results in failure for the material. A strategy using multi-layer scaffold with different degradation rates in each layer was investigated as a way to address this issue. Vascularization was improved with the multi-layered scaffold model compared to the single-layer model. The ABM developed provides insight into the characteristics that influence the selection of optimal geometric parameters and degradation behavior of scaffolds, and enables easy refinement of the model as new knowledge about the underlying biological phenomena becomes available.
   Statement of significance
   This paper proposes a multi-layer agent-based model (ABM) of biomaterial scaffold vascularization integrated with a structural-kinetic model describing bulk degradation of porous hydrogels to consider the effects of scaffold degradation kinetics on blood vessel formation. This enables the assessment of scaffold characteristics and in particular the disintegration characteristics of the scaffold on angiognesis. Simulation results indicate that higher porosity, larger mean pore size, and rapid degradation allow faster vascularization when not considering the structural support of the scaffold. However, premature loss of structural support by scaffold disintegration results in failure of the material and disruption of angiogenesis. A strategy using multi-layer scaffold with different degradation rates in each layer was investigated as away to address this issue. Vascularization was improved with the multi-layered scaffold model compared to the single-layer model.
   The ABM developed provides insight into the characteristics that influence the selection of optimal geometric and degradation characteristics of tissue engineering scaffolds. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are large networks of tiny sensor nodes that are usually randomly distributed over a geographical region. The network topology may vary in time in an unpredictable manner due to many different causes. For example, in order to reduce power consumption, battery operated sensors undergo cycles of sleeping-active periods; additionally, sensors may be located in hostile environments increasing their likelihood of failure; furthermore, data might also be collected from a range of sources at different times. For this reason multi-hop routing algorithms used to route messages from a sensor node to a sink should be rapidly adaptable to the changing topology. Swarm intelligence has been proposed for this purpose, since it allows the emergence of a single global behavior from the interaction of many simple local agents. Swarm intelligent routing has been traditionally studied by resorting to simulation. The present paper aims to show that the recently proposed modeling technique, known as Markovian Agent Model (MAM), is suited for implementing swarm intelligent algorithms for large networks of interacting sensors. Various experimental results and quantitative performance indices are evaluated to support this claim. The validity of this approach is given a further proof by comparing the results with those obtained by using a WSN discrete event simulator. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Air pollutants appear at various areas on the earth due to economic growth, and harm the health of the residents of those regions. Various countries around those areas are also polluted. Many kinds of air-polluting factors must be grasped, for example, the place of origin, kind of pollutant, its direction and speed. These factors are also grasped quickly over a wide area. Various kinds of chemical sensors have been investigated and developed to detect air pollutants. In this study, metal oxide odor sensors are installed at 12 points in an experimental residence and experimental simulations are carried out. Each sensor with a microprocessor has the ability of an agent, which can autonomously make many advanced decisions and estimations. This sensor system is named sensor agent. The sensor agents can derive pollution direction by cooperation and collaboration with other sensor agents. Derived directions are compared with daily resident behaviors and reliability is examined. Results show that polluting direction is estimated with good reliability and a clue to practical use is achieved. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

By specifying signs for the agents, they are divided into two groups and are enabled to reach agreement on a consensus value which is the same in modulus for both groups but not in sign. Using nearest-neighbour interaction rules, we propose the distributed protocols and address their exponential convergence problem. It is shown that the quasi-strong connectivity of fixed networks or joint quasi-strong connectivity of switching networks can provide a necessary and sufficient guarantee for all agents to achieve signed consensus exponentially fast. In particular, the signed consensus results can include as special cases those of bipartite consensus in signed networks with fixed and switching topologies. Numerical simulations are also provided to illustrate the exponential convergence performance of the proposed signed consensus protocols.

AB Purpose - Following a bacterial-based modeling approach, the authors want to model and analyze the impact of both decentralization and heterogeneity on group behavior and collective learning. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - Inspired by bacterial conjugation, the authors have defined an artificial society in which agents' strategies adapt to changes in resources location, allowing migration, and survival in a dynamic sugarscape-like scenario. To study the impact of these variables the authors have simulated a scenario in which resources are limited and localized. The authors also have defined three constraints in genetic information processing (inhibition of plasmid conjugation, inhibition of plasmid reproduction and inhibition of plasmid mutation).
   Findings - The results affirmed the hypothesis that efficiency of group adaptation to dynamic environments is better when societies are varied and distributed than when they are homogeneous and centralized.
   Originality/value - The authors have demonstrated that in a model based on free interactions among autonomous agents, optimal results emerge by incrementing heterogeneity levels and decentralization of communication structures, leading to a global adaptation of the system. This organic approach to model peer-to-peer dynamics in complex adaptive systems (CAS) is what the authors have named "bacterial-based algorithms" because agents exchange strategic information in the same way that bacteria use conjugation and share genome.

AB Many social phenomena do not result solely from intentional actions by isolated individuals, but rather emerge as the result of repeated interactions among multiple individuals over time. However, such phenomena are often poorly captured by traditional empirical techniques. Moreover, complex adaptive systems are insufficiently described by verbal models. In this paper, we discuss how organizational psychologists and group dynamics researchers may benefit from the adoption of formal modeling, particularly agent-based modeling, for developing and testing richer theories. Agent-based modeling is well suited to capture multilevel dynamic processes and offers superior precision to verbal models. As an example, we present a model of social identity dynamics used to test the predictions of Brewer's (1991) optimal distinctiveness theory, and discuss how the model extends the theory and produces novel research questions. We close with a general discussion on theory development using agent-based models.

AB The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it presents a new software system for empirical investigations of evolving agent societies in SugarScape like environments. Second, it introduces a conceptual framework for modeling cooperation in an artificial society. In this framework the environmental pressure to cooperate is controllable by a single parameter, thus allowing systematic investigations of system behavior under varying circumstances. Third, it reports upon results from experiments that implemented and tested environments based upon this new model of cooperation. The results show that the pressure to cooperate leads to the evolution of communication skills facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, higher levels of cooperation pressure lead to the emergence of increased communication.

AB In this paper, we introduce a framework fix modeling the trustworthiness of peers in the setting of online social networks. In these contexts, it may be important to he filtering the wealth of messages that have been sent, which form the ongoing communication within a large community of users. This is achieved by constructing an intelligent agent that reasons about the message and each peer rater of the message, learning over time to properly gage whether a message is good or had to show a user, based on message ratings, rater similarity, and rater credibility. Our approach employs a partially observable Markov decision process for trust modeling, moving beyond the more traditional adoption of probabilistic reasoning using beta reputation functions. In addition to outlining the technique in full, we present empirical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, both in simulations featuring head to head comparisons with competitors, and in the context of some existing online social networks where ground truth data are available.

AB In this paper, we consider the flocking control problem of multiple three-dimensional nonholonomic agents with proximity graphs. We first analyze the nonlinear property of the three-dimensional nonholonomic model of the agent. Based on the model analysis and the neighboring information, a distributed linear control protocol is designed only using relative attitude information. Using the tools from proximity graph theory and Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed distributed linear control protocol guarantees that the attitudes of all agents exponentially converge to synchronization, and simultaneously ensures connectivity preservation and collision avoidance of the whole group, if the initial proximity graph is connected. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2017 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The complexity of systems now under consideration (be they biological, physical, chemical, social, etc), together with the technicalities of experimentation in the real-world and the nonlinear nature of system dynamics, means that computational modelling is indispensible in the pursuit of furthering our understanding of complex systems. Agent-based modelling and simulation is rapidly increasing in its popularity, in part due to the increased appreciation of the paradigm by the non-computer science community, but also due to the increase in the usability, sophistication and number of modelling frameworks that use the approach. The Flexible Largescale Agent-based Modelling Environment (FLAME) is a relatively recent addition to the list. FLAME was designed and developed from the outset to deal with massive simulations, and to ensure that the simulation code is portable across different scales of computing and across different operating systems. In this study, we report our experiences when using FLAME to model the development and propagation of conflict within large multi-partner enterprise system implementations, which acts as an example of a complex dynamical social system. We believe FLAME is an excellent choice for experienced modellers, who will be able to fully harness the capabilities that it has to offer, and also be competent in diagnosing and solving any limitations that are encountered. Conversely, because FLAME requires considerable development of instrumentation tools, along with development of statistical analysis scripts, we believe that it is not suitable for the novice modeller, who may be better suited to using a graphical user interface driven framework until their experience with modelling and competence in programming increases.

AB The concept of heuristic decision making is adapted to dynamic influence processes in social networks. We report results of a set of simulations, in which we systematically varied: a) the agents' strategies for contacting fellow group members and integrating collected information, and (b) features of their social environment - the distribution of members' status, and the degree of clustering in their network. As major outcome variables, we measured the speed with which the process settled, the distributions of agents' final preferences, and the rate with which high-status members changed their initial preferences. The impact of the agents' decision strategies on the dynamics and outcomes of the influence process depended on features of their social environment. This held in particular true when agents contacted all of the neighbors with whom they were connected. When agents focused on high-status members and did not contact low-status neighbors, the process typically settled more quickly, yielded larger majority factions and fewer preference changes. A case study exemplifies the empirical application of the model.

AB Population growth and greater human well-being imply increased use of scarce resources, which makes innovative proposals for fair redistribution policies necessary. The utilisation of common-pool resources (CPRs) offers an economising solution to this problem; however, addressing the complex issue of harmonising the participants' interests is challenging. The use of CPRs has been theoretically discussed for decades and is addressed by theory of public goods (PGs) provision. Surprisingly, experimental tests of this theory have observed systematic deviations from the theoretical conclusions. Economists have applied agent-based methods to resolve this puzzle. We follow this approach and propose an agent-based model that innovatively employs voting on the punishment of free/cheap riders. The voting participants simultaneously determine the strictness of the punishment meted out to free/cheap riders and the cost burden of this punishment system. The proposed endogenous shared punishment model works within the threshold public goods game framework. Simulation results show that the presented method is more efficient than models with full or no punishment. Furthermore, the involvement of activists increases the likelihood of PGs provision. Introducing voting into PGs provision increases its efficiency and thus extends the set of available solutions to increase the efficiency of PGs provision.

AB Our beliefs and opinions are shaped by others, making our social networks crucial in determining what we believe to be true. Sometimes this is for the good because our peers help us form a more accurate opinion. Sometimes it is for the worse because we are led astray. In this context, we address via agent-based computer simulations the extent to which patterns of connectivity within our social networks affect the likelihood that initially undecided agents in a network converge on a true opinion following group deliberation. The model incorporates a fine-grained and realistic representation of belief (opinion) and trust, and it allows agents to consult outside information sources. We study a wide range of network structures and provide a detailed statistical analysis concerning the exact contribution of various network metrics to collective competence. Our results highlight and explain the collective risks involved in an overly networked or partitioned society. Specifically, we find that 96% of the variation in collective competence across networks can be attributed to differences in amount of connectivity (average degree) and clustering, which are negatively correlated with collective competence. A study of bandwagon or "group think" effects indicates that both connectivity and clustering increase the probability that the network, wholly or partly, locks into a false opinion. Our work is interestingly related to Gerhard Schurz's work on meta-induction and can be seen as broadly addressing a practical limitation of his approach.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the social dimension of travel, and how travel decisions are influenced not only by the global state of the transportation system, but also by joint decisions and interactions with social contacts. Empirical studies pointed out the relevance of certain types of social interactions to model travel behavior correctly: synchronization of household members has been identified as significantly influencing individual's travel decisions, and friendships were shown to influence the choice of leisure locations.
   Multiagent approaches, by representing decision making at the level of the individual, seem to be one of the most promising approaches to take into account such interactions when forecasting. The work presented here extends a state of the art multiagent simulation software, MATSim, with capabilities to capture joint decisions. It consists of a general framework to allow arbitrary joint behaviors to be represented, without constraints on the topology of the social network. An implementation of this framework for the important case of intrahousehold ride sharing is proposed, and demonstrated on a simple test scenario.
   The results show that the extended process is able to find the expected state, and is mature for validation against travel diary data.

AB Although social situations regularly involve multiple persons acting together, research on the mirror neuron system has focused on situations in which a single agent is observed. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to explore the role of the mirror mechanism in situations involving multiple agents. Specifically, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate whether mirror activation is modulated by the number of observed agents. Based on group contagion research, we hypothesized that multiple agents would provide a stronger trigger to the motor system and would therefore produce a stronger mirror response than a single agent. Participants observed movements performed by a single hand or by two hands while TMS was applied to the primary motor cortex. The results confirmed that activation in the motor system was stronger for two hands. This suggests that input to the motor system increases as the number of agents grows. Relating back to group contagion, our study suggests that groups may be more contagious simply because their actions resonate louder. Given that the mirror mechanism has been linked to a variety of social skills, our findings additionally have important implications for the understanding of social interaction at the group level.

TI Is the Person-Situation Debate Important for Agent-Based Modeling and
   Vice-Versa?
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; HISTORY; VALUES
AB Background: Agent-based models (ABM) are believed to be a very powerful tool in the social sciences, sometimes even treated as a substitute for social experiments. When building an ABM we have to define the agents and the rules governing the artificial society. Given the complexity and our limited understanding of the human nature, we face the problem of assuming that either personal traits, the situation or both have impact on the social behavior of agents. However, as the long-standing person-situation debate in psychology shows, there is no consensus as to the underlying psychological mechanism and the important question that arises is whether the modeling assumptions we make will have a substantial influence on the simulated behavior of the system as a whole or not.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Studying two variants of the same agent-based model of opinion formation, we show that the decision to choose either personal traits or the situation as the primary factor driving social interactions is of critical importance. Using Monte Carlo simulations (for Barabasi-Albert networks) and analytic calculations (for a complete graph) we provide evidence that assuming a person-specific response to social influence at the microscopic level generally leads to a completely different and less realistic aggregate or macroscopic behavior than an assumption of a situation-specific response; a result that has been reported by social psychologists for a range of experimental setups, but has been downplayed or ignored in the opinion dynamics literature.
   Significance: This sensitivity to modeling assumptions has far reaching consequences also beyond opinion dynamics, since agent-based models are becoming a popular tool among economists and policy makers and are often used as substitutes of real social experiments.

AB This paper considers a group decision-making mechanism for a group of social agents with ambiguous interactions. First, a fuzzy inference approach is introduced to describe bounded confidence based interaction rules among social agents for a certain object in a social network platform. Second, an influence graph is introduced to model the communication network topology associated with the group of agents. A fuzzy inference based opinion dynamics model is built when the defuzzified interaction weights among agents are used in the opinion update scheme for each agent. Third, the patterns of the collective final opinions are analyzed under the proposed fuzzy opinion dynamics model. The fuzziness of opinion gaps and interaction weights among agents are respectively investigated in the collective opinion evolution. Simulation results show the influence of fuzzy values of opinion gaps and interaction weights on the pattern of the collective final opinions and reveal the quantitative relationships of opinion gap and interaction weights between the original HK opinion dynamics model and the fuzzy HK opinion dynamics model.

AB The methodology for coastal management proposed in this study takes into account the physical processes of the coastal system and the stochastic nature of forcing agents. Simulation techniques are used to assess the uncertainty in the performance of a set of predefined management strategies based on different criteria representing the main concerns of interest groups. This statistical information as well as the distribution function that characterizes the uncertainty regarding the preferences of the decision makers is fed into a stochastic multi-criteria acceptability analysis that provides the probability of alternatives obtaining certain ranks and also calculates the preferences of a typical decision maker who supports an alternative. This methodology was applied as a management solution for Playa Granada in the Guadalfeo River Delta (Granada, Spain), where the construction of a dam in the river basin is causing severe erosion. The analysis of shoreline evolution took into account the coupled action of atmosphere, ocean, and land agents and their intrinsic stochastic character. This study considered five different management strategies. The criteria selected for the analysis were the economic benefits for three interest groups: (i) indirect beneficiaries of tourist activities; (ii) beach homeowners; and (iii) the administration. The strategies were ranked according to their effectiveness, and the relative importance given to each criterion was obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Land-use/cover change (LUCC) is a complex process that includes actors and factors at different social and spatial levels. A common approach to analyse and simulate LUCC as the result of individual decisions is agent-based modelling (ABM). However, ABM is often applied to simulate processes at local scales, while its application in regional studies is limited. This paper describes first a conceptual framework for ABM to analyse and explore regional LUCC processes. Second, the conceptual framework is represented by combining different concepts including agent typologies, farm trajectories and probabilistic decision-making processes. Finally, the framework is illustrated through a case study in the Netherlands, where processes of farm cessation, farm expansion and farm diversification are shaping the structure of the landscape. The framework is a generic, straightforward approach to analyse and explore regional LUCC with an explicit link to empirical approaches for parameterization of ABM.

AB In this paper, we explore the question of efficient allocation of energy, while buying the same from generation companies, to plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) by aggregator (electricity utility or load serving entities) through auction mechanisms. Recognizing the practical limitations of the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism, which would be natural to apply in this context, we investigate two practical mechanisms that can be viewed as extensions of second price auction mechanisms and have limited message (bid) complexity. In the first mechanism, the elastic-supply multi-level second price, each PEV agent submits a number of price bids, one for each of a given set of energy levels (energy quantities). In the second mechanism, the elastic-supply progressive second price, the PEV agents submit a 2-D bid indicating the price as well as the desired energy quantity. Taking into account differences across PEV-owners in terms of their willingness-to-pay values and charging time constraints, we analyze the social optimality and incentive compatibility properties of the two auction mechanisms. We also complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations.

AB Taking into account multiagent systems with general linear dynamics and directed topologies, the issue of achieving finite-time consensus in a distributed event-triggered fashion is discussed in this paper. A novel model-based triggering function, which depends only on local information, is adopted. To ensure the finite-time convergence of the disagreement vector and the triggering error, a dynamic threshold, which is guaranteed to converge to zero in finite time, is adopted in the proposed triggering function design. By employing a novel distributed event-triggered controller for each agent, finite-time consensus of multiagent systems can be achieved. In the proposed approach, no continuous communication is needed in either controller updates or triggering detection. Furthermore, the triggering number is significantly reduced and the high frequency triggering is restrained. In addition, the feasibility of the proposed approach is guaranteed by the comprehensive theoretical demonstration of the finite-time consensus stability and the analysis of the Zeno behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

TI Markov Chain Approach to Probabilistic Guidance for Swarms of Autonomous
   Agents
SO ASIAN JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
DE Swarm control; probabilistic methods; Markov chains
ID COORDINATION; AVOIDANCE
AB Motivated by biological swarms occurring in nature, there is recent interest in developing swarms comprised completely of engineered agents. The main challenge for developing swarm guidance laws compared to earlier formation flying and multi-vehicle coordination approaches is the sheer number of agents involved. While formation flying applications might involve up to 10 to 20 agents, swarms are desired to contain hundreds to many thousands of agents. In order to deal with the sheer size, the present paper makes a break with past deterministic methods, and considers the swarm as a statistical ensemble for which guidance can be performed from a probabilistic point of view. The probability-based approach takes advantage of the law of large numbers, and leads to computationally tractable and implementable swarm guidance laws. Agents following a probabilistic guidance algorithm make statistically independent probabilistic decisions based solely on their own state, which ultimately guides the swarm to the desired density distribution in the configuration space. Two different synthesis methods are introduced for designing probabilistic guidance laws. The first is based on the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm, and the second is based on using linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The M-H approach ensures convergent swarm behavior subject to enforced desired motion constraints, while the LMI approach additionally ensures exponential convergence with a prescribed decay rate, and allows minimization of a cost function that reflects fuel expenditure. In addition, both algorithms endow the swarm with the property of self-repair, and the capability to strictly enforce zero-probability keep-out regions. This last property requires a slight generalization of the Perron-Frobenius theory, and can be very useful in swarm applications that contain regions where no agents are allowed to go. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the methods and demonstrate desired properties of the guided swarm.

DT Article
DE Cliff-Edge problems; Human-agent interactions; Ultimatum game; Dynamic
   pricing; Reinforcement learning; Virtual learning
AB In this paper, we propose an efficient agent for competing in Cliff-Edge (CE) and simultaneous Cliff-Edge (SCE) situations. In CE interactions, which include common interactions such as sealed-bid auctions, dynamic pricing and the ultimatum game (UG), the probability of success decreases monotonically as the reward for success increases. This trade-off exists also in SCE interactions, which include simultaneous auctions and various multi-player ultimatum games, where the agent has to decide about more than one offer or bid simultaneously. Our agent competes repeatedly in one-shot interactions, each time against different human opponents. The agent learns the general pattern of the population's behavior, and its performance is evaluated based on all of the interactions in which it participates. We propose a generic approach which may help the agent compete against unknown opponents in different environments where CE and SCE interactions exist, where the agent has a relatively large number of alternatives and where its achievements in the first several dozen interactions are important. The underlying mechanism we propose for CE interactions is a new meta-algorithm, deviated virtual learning (DVL), which extends existing methods to efficiently cope with environments comprising a large number of alternative decisions at each decision point. Another competitive approach is the Bayesian approach, which learns the opponents' statistical distribution, given prior knowledge about the type of distribution. For the SCE, we propose the simultaneous deviated virtual reinforcement learning algorithm (SDVRL), the segmentation meta-algorithm as a method for extending different basic algorithms, and a heuristic called fixed success probabilities (FSP). Experiments comparing the performance of the proposed algorithms with algorithms taken from the literature, as well as other intuitive meta-algorithms, reveal superiority of the proposed algorithms in average payoff and stability as well as in accuracy in converging to the optimal action, both in CE and SCE problems.

AB Biological inspirations have lead us to develop a switching strategy for a group of robotic sensing agents searching for a local minimum of an unknown noisy scalar field. Starting with individual exploration, the agents switch to cooperative exploration only when they are not able to converge to a local minimum at a satisfying rate. We derive a cooperative H-infinity filter that provides estimates of field values and field gradients during cooperative exploration and give sufficient conditions for the convergence and feasibility of the filter. The switched behavior from individual exploration to cooperative exploration results in faster convergence, which is rigorously justified by the Razumikhin theorem, to a local minimum. We propose that the switching condition from cooperative exploration to individual exploration is triggered by a significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) during cooperative exploration. In addition to theoretical and simulation studies, we develop a multiagent testbed and implement the switching strategy in a lab environment. We have observed consistency of theoretical predictions and experimental results, which are robust to unknown noises and communication delays.

AB We present an introduction to a novel way of simulating individual and group opinion dynamics, taking into account how various sources of information are filtered due to cognitive biases. The agent-based model presented here falls into the 'complex agent' category, in which the agents are described in considerably greater detail than in the simplest 'spinson' model. To describe agents' information processing, we introduced mechanisms of updating individual belief distributions, relying on information processing. The open nature of this proposed model allows us to study the effects of various static and time-dependent biases and information filters. In particular, the paper compares the effects of two important psychological mechanisms: confirmation bias and politically motivated reasoning. This comparison has been prompted by recent experimental psychology work by Dan Kahan. Depending on the effectiveness of information filtering (agent bias), agents confronted with an objective information source can either reach a consensus based on truth, or remain divided despite the evidence. In general, this model might provide understanding into increasingly polarized modern societies, especially as it allows us to mix different types of filters: e.g., psychological, social, and algorithmic.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS
AB This paper continues our previous consensus scheme with only group information when neither absolute states nor inter-agent relative states are available, by considering two special nonlinear cases, L oo norm and L 2 -norm. In the scheme, all the agents are partitioned into two subgroups at each time by certain probability, and then use the relative group information that concerns all agents' states inside for state updating process. It is then shown that almost sure consensus can be achieved under the proposed scheme in both discrete time and continuous time for the two nonlinear cases. When for L oo -norm group information, almost sure consensus is achieved if and only if the weighting parameter is greater than one in discrete-time case, and the weighting parameter is positive in continuous-time case. When for L 2 -norm group information, the sufficient conditions to guarantee system consensus almost surely are the weighting parameter greater than ,/ n / 2 and positive in discrete-time case and continuous-time case, respectively. Finally, numerical simulations are proposed to validate the theoretical results.

ID DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB We propose a general non-linear analytical framework to study the evolution of the opinion state of a population of moving individuals. This novel scheme allows us to study a broad range of social phenomena, like, for example, the influence of agent interaction dynamics in the opinion formation or the inclusion of different individual's idiosyncrasies. We consider societies composed by agents who adopt one of the n possible opinions or internal states. The opinion state may only be modified while the agent keeps contact with another one. In general, this framework could be solved numerically, and, for some special perturbative cases, it is possible to find analytical steady states. In order to check our scheme for different social conventions, we implement computational simulations of an ensemble of self-propelled agents, finding a good agreement between theory and simulation results. We found, for slow society kinetics in all the cases studied, that there exist a shift of the opinion populations towards the moderate opinion states. This suggest that active speed can be understood as a parameter measuring the social temperature of the community. Copyright (c) EPLA, 2014

AB The Eulerian-Lagrangian-Agent method (ELAM) couples three modelling approaches into a single, integrated simulation environment: (i) Eulerian descriptions, (ii) Lagrangian formulations, and (iii) agent reference frameworks. ELAMS are particularly effective at decoding and simulating the motion dynamics of individual aquatic organisms, using the output of high fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to represent complex flow fields. Here we describe the application of an ELAM to design a juvenile fish passage facility at Wanapum Dam on the Columbia River in the United States. This application is composed of three parts: (1) an agent-based model, that simulates the movement decisions made by individual fish, (2) an Eulerian CFD model that solves the 3D Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with a standard k-epsilon turbulence model with wall functions using a multi-block structured mesh, and (3) a Lagrangian particle-tracker used to interpolate information from the Eulerian mesh to point locations needed by the agent model and to track the trajectory of each virtual fish in three dimensions. We discuss aspects of the computational mesh topology and other CFD modeling topics important to this and future applications of the ELAM model for juvenille salmon, the Numerical Fish Surrogate. The good match between forecasted (virtual) and measured (observed) fish passage proportions demonstrates the value-added benefit of using agent-based models (i.e. the Numerical Fish Surrogate model) as part of common engineering practice for fish passage design and, more fundamentally, to simulate complex ecological processes.

The experiments show that complex collective signals are generated by this system through spontaneous emergence and joint operation of coherently acting groups representing hierarchically organized resonant clusters. Numerical simulations support these experimental findings. our results suggest that some forms of internal self-organization, characteristic for complex multiagent systems, are already possible in simple chemical systems.

AB We study the collective dynamics of a group of motile particles with a leader. The leader is unaffected by the particle members whereas each member is influenced by the leader and the other members. By using coupled oscillators theory and Lyapunov function method, we show how the group dynamics depends on the motion of the leader and the coupling weights among all particles. Generally speaking, two types of collective motions will occur, depending on different ranges of the coupling weights among the member particles. One is that all the member particles will move in the same direction and the other is that all the member particles move in such a way that the weighted centroid of the group approaches a fixed position. In each case, all the member particles eventually move in the same manner except for the directions of the motion in certain cases. Numerical simulations are worked out to demonstrate the theoretical results. The study suggests potential approaches to control a group motion by steering the motion of the leader and adjusting coupling patterns. This is of practical interest in applications of multiagent systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In many computational social simulation models only cursory reference to the foundations of the agent cognition used is made and computational expenses let many modellers chose simplistic agent cognition architectures. Both choices run counter to expectations framed by scholars active in the domain of rich cognitive modelling that see agent reasoning as socially inherently contextualized. The Manchester school of social simulation proposed a particular kind of a socially contextualized reasoning mechanism, so called endorsements, to implement the cognitive processes underlying agent action selection that eventually causes agent interaction. Its usefulness lies in its lightweight architecture and in taking into account folk psychological conceptions of how reasoning works. These and other advantages make endorsements an amenable tool in everyday social simulation modelling. A yet outstanding comprehensive introduction to the concept of endorsements is provided and its theoretical basis is extended and extant research is critically reviewed. Improvements to endorsements regarding memory and perception are suggested and tested against a case-study.

AB In this article we consider the special abilities needed by agents for assessing trust based on inference and reasoning. We analyze the case in which it is possible to infer trust towards unknown counterparts by reasoning on abstract classes or categories of agents shaped in a concrete application domain. We present a scenario of interacting agents providing a computational model implementing different strategies to assess trust. Assuming a medical domain, categories, including both competencies and dispositions of possible trustees, are exploited to infer trust towards possibly unknown counterparts. The proposed approach for the cognitive assessment of trust relies on agents' abilities to analyze heterogeneous information sources along different dimensions. Trust is inferred based on specific observable properties (manifesta), namely explicitly readable signals indicating internal features (krypta) regulating agents' behavior and effectiveness on specific tasks. Simulative experiments evaluate the performance of trusting agents adopting different strategies to delegate tasks to possibly unknown trustees, while experimental results show the relevance of this kind of cognitive ability in the case of open multiagent systems.

AB Background Cediranib is a highly potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling inhibitor of all three VEGF receptors. This phase I, single-center, dose-finding study was designed primarily to investigate the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of cediranib with various anticancer regimens in patients with advanced solid tumors. Experimental design Oral cediranib 20, 30, and/or 45 mg/day was given in combination with standard mFOLFOX6; docetaxel; irinotecan; irinotecan and cetuximab; or pemetrexed. The novel study design allowed simultaneous evaluation of the safety and PK of these regimens with cediranib in one study. Secondary assessments included a preliminary evaluation of efficacy. Results Fifty-nine patients received cediranib and were evaluable for safety. The most common adverse events across the study were fatigue and diarrhea (both n = 52). The most common CTC grade a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 3 adverse events were neutropenia (n = 19) and fatigue (n = 16). Cediranib did not appear to have a major effect on the PK profile of any chemotherapy agent tested. A preliminary assessment of efficacy showed that objective responses were achieved in some patients (n = 6) who had previously progressed on similar regimens without cediranib. Conclusion In this group of heavily pretreated patients, the study design permitted simultaneous assessment of multiple treatment arms. Treatment with cediranib and the various anticancer regimens was generally well tolerated, with no apparent PK interaction and preliminary evidence of antitumor activity.

AB In this study, we propose a decentralized mathematical model for predictive control of a system of multi-autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), also known as drones. Being decentralized and autonomous implies that all members make their own decisions and fly depending on the dynamic information received from other unmanned aircraft in the area. We consider a variety of realistic characteristics, including time delay and communication locality. For this flocking flight, we do not possess control for central data processing or control over each UAV, as each UAV runs its collision avoidance algorithm by itself. The main contribution of this work is a mathematical model for stable group flight even in adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy wind, rain, etc.) by adding Gaussian noise. Two of our proposed variance control algorithms are presented in this work. One is based on a simple biological imitation from statistical physical modeling, which mimics animal group behavior; the other is an algorithm for cooperatively tracking an object, which aligns the velocities of neighboring agents corresponding to each other. We demonstrate the stability of the control algorithm and its applicability in autonomous multi-drone systems using numerical simulations.

AB We extend the agent-based model of Anufriev and Bottazzi (2010) to the case with many risky assets. We show that under the procedural equilibrium, all assets with nonzero aggregate demand must have the same price returns. Heterogeneity in price returns appears when some assets face zero demand. In this case, the returns are essentially driven by the matrix of wealth-weighted products between demands and they generate a rich variety of patterns for agents' market shares. We formalize the dynamics of deterministic skeletons in our market model and consider the associated jacobian matrix, for which we provide a closed form expression up to a matrix inversion. We then introduce the characteristic ratio of an investment strategy, which involves the average dividend yields of the risky assets and the investors' portfolio compositions. When equilibrium returns are uniform and when the number of assets is not smaller than the number of agents, the equilibrium with a single survivor can only be stable if the survivor has the maximal characteristic ratio. Moreover, we prove that this stability criterion holds as long as the noise in the system is sufficiently small. We confirm all our findings with a thorough empirical analysis of numerical simulations, with and without noise. All in all, our results form a theoretical rationale for portfolio strategies tilted towards firms that pay high dividend yields. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Opinion formation; consensus; multiagent systems
ID COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR
AB This paper introduces an augmented model for first-order opinion dynamics, in which a weight of influence is attributed to each agent. Each agent's influence on another agent's opinion is then proportional not only to the classical interaction function, but also to its weight. The weights evolve in time and their equations are coupled with the opinions' evolution. We show that the well-known conditions for convergence to consensus can be generalized to this framework. In the case of interaction functions with bounded support, we show that constant weights lead to clustering with conditions similar to those of the classical model. Four specific models are designed by prescribing a specific weight dynamics, then the convergence of the opinions and the evolution of the weights for each of them are studied. We prove the existence of different long-term behaviors, such as emergence of a single leader and emergence of two co-leaders. Then we illustrate them via numerical simulations. Last, a statistical analysis is provided for the speed of convergence to consensus and for the clustering behavior of each model, together with a comparison to the classical opinion dynamics with constant equal weights.

ID NEGOTIATION; CONSENSUS; MODEL
AB Researchers tend to model people as individuals rather than as members of groups. This approach diminishes the impact of altruism and other group-supporting behaviors. For example, walkers may move slower than their capability to retain group cohesion. Current modeling approaches to capture group formation and dynamics lack the strategic elements required to model the complexity of human decision-making. Game theory provides a mechanism to introduce this strategic behavior. This article investigates strategic group formation through the introduction of cooperative game theory techniques into an agent-based model and simulation (ABMS). It shows some empirical results from this introduction. The approach requires looking at the Core instead of the more common Nash Equilibrium. The simulation outputs show some agents forming a large dominant group, much like a real-world mob. The model and results are relevant to policymakers trying to understand how humans navigate an environment through strategic social interactions.

DE Language dynamics; spreading on networks; multi-layer networks;
   agent-based models
ID SEMANTIC NETWORKS; EMERGENCE
AB We study the introduction of lexical innovations into a community of language users. Lexical innovations, i.e. new term added to people's vocabulary, plays an important role in the process of language evolution. Nowadays, information is spread through a variety of networks, including, among others, online and offline social networks and the World Wide Web. The entire system, comprising networks of different nature, can be represented as a multi-layer network. In this context, lexical innovations diffusion occurs in a peculiar fashion. In particular, a lexical innovation can undergo three different processes: its original meaning is accepted; its meaning can be changed or misunderstood (e. g. when not properly explained), hence more than one meaning can emerge in the population. Lastly, in the case of a loan word, it can be translated into the population language (i.e. defining a new lexical innovation or using a synonym) or into a dialect spoken by part of the population. Therefore, lexical innovations cannot be considered simply as information. We develop a model for analyzing this scenario using a multi-layer network comprising a social network and a media network. The latter represents the set of all information systems of a society, e. g. television, the World Wide Web and radio. Furthermore, we identify temporal directed edges between the nodes of these two networks. In particular, at each time-step, nodes of the media network can be connected to randomly chosen nodes of the social network and vice versa. In doing so, information spreads through the whole system and people can share a lexical innovation with their neighbors or, in the event they work as reporters, by using media nodes. Lastly, we use the concept of "linguistic sign" to model lexical innovations, showing its fundamental role in the study of these dynamics. Many numerical simulations have been performed to analyze the proposed model and its outcomes.

AB Social structure can theoretically regulate disease risk by mediating exposure to pathogens via social proximity and contact. Investigating the role of central individuals within a network may help predict infectious agent transmission as well as implement disease control strategies, but little is known about such dynamics in real primate networks. We combined social network analysis and a modeling approach to better understand transmission of a theoretical infectious agent in wild Japanese macaques, highly social animals which form extended but highly differentiated social networks. We collected focal data from adult females living on the islands of Koshima and Yakushima, Japan. Individual identities as well as grooming networks were included in a Markov graph -based simulation. In this model, the probability that an individual will transmit an infectious agent depends on the strength of its relationships with other group members. Similarly, its probability of being infected depends on its relationships with already infected group members. We correlated: (i) the percentage of subjects infected during a latency constrained epidemic; (ii) the mean latency to complete transmission; (iii) the probability that an individual is infected first among all group members; and (iv) each individual's mean rank in the chain of transmission with different individual network centralities (eigenvector, strength, betweenness). Our results support the hypothesis that more central individuals transmit infections in a shorter amount of time and to more subjects but also become infected more quickly than less central individuals. However, we also observed that the spread of infectious agents on the Yakushima network did not always differ from expectations of spread on random networks. Generalizations about the importance of observed social networks in pathogen flow should thus be made with caution, since individual characteristics in some real world networks appear less relevant than they are in others in predicting disease spread.

ID MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS; TOPOLOGY; AGENTS
AB This paper addresses the problem of consensus in networks structured in several clusters. The clusters are represented by fixed, directed and strongly connected graphs. They are composed by a number of agents which are able to interact only with other agents belonging to the same cluster. To every agent we associate a scalar real value representing its state. The states continuously evolve following a linear consensus protocol and approach local agreements specific to each cluster. In order to enforce a global agreement over the whole network, we consider that each cluster contains an agent that can be exogenously controlled. The state of this agent, called leader, will be quasi-periodically reseted by a local master controller that receives information from some neighboring leaders. In order to control the consensus value we have to firstly characterize it. Precisely we show that it depends only on the initial condition and the interaction topologies. Secondly, we provide sufficient Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) conditions for the global uniform exponential stability of the consensus in presence of a quasi-periodic reset rule. The study of the network behavior is completed by a decay rate analysis. Finally we design the interaction network of the leaders which allows to reach a prescribed consensus value. Numerical implementation strategy is provided before illustrating the results by some simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The reported research treats interactions between households and generated feedback dynamics in the adoption of various transportation mode alternatives. We consider a model in which an agent's choice is directly influenced by the percentages of the agent's neighbors and socioeconomic peers that make each choice. The model also accounts for shared unobserved attributes of the choice alternatives in the error structure. We address nonglobal interactions explicitly within different social and spatial network structures, combining advanced econometric estimation with computational techniques from multiagent-based simulation, and we present an empirical application of the model using pseudo-panel microdata collected by the Amsterdam Agency for Traffic, Transport and Infrastructure. Additional heterogeneity is introduced in the model through different mechanisms, such as individual-specific sociodemographic characteristics of the agents, individual-specific attributes of the choice alternatives, and the availability of alternatives. We conclude by highlighting limitations of our present study and recommendations for future work.

AB Sociality is primarily a coordination problem. However, the social (or communication) complexity hypothesis suggests that the kinds of information that can be acquired and processed may limit the size and/or complexity of social groups that a species can maintain. We use an agent-based model to test the hypothesis that the complexity of information processed influences the computational demands involved. We show that successive increases in the kinds of information processed allow organisms to break through the glass ceilings that otherwise limit the size of social groups: larger groups can only be achieved at the cost of more sophisticated kinds of information processing that are disadvantageous when optimal group size is small. These results simultaneously support both the social brain and the social complexity hypotheses.

AB This paper considers time-varying formation control for multiagent systems (MASs). The collective dynamics is modeled by a wave partial differential equation (PDE) in an angular symmetric annulus. The dynamical formation formed by a group of agents can be represented by wave PDEs due to the energy conservation property of wave PDEs. To achieve convergence of the MAS to desired time-varying formations, we design a boundary controller and a boundary observer by employing the backstepping method, which turns into a leader-enable actuation mode by using only local information. Closed-loop exponential stability with a desired decay rate in the H-1 norm is proven for both full state and output feedback designs, which means that the communication topology keeps unchanged and connected over time. Compared with the usual l-D wave equation, the design of the controller, observer, and their stability proof are more involved due to the Laplace operator in polar coordinates. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme of time-varying formation for MASs is illustrated via numerical simulations.

AB Many social phenomena can be viewed as processes in which individuals in social groups develop agreement (e.g., public opinion, the spreading of rumor, the formation of social and linguistic conventions). Conceptual Agreement Theory (CAT) models social agreement as a simplified communicational event in which an Observer and Actor exchange ideas about a concept , and where uses that information to infer whether 's conceptual state is the same as its own (i.e., to infer agreement). Agreement may be true (when infers that is thinking and this is in fact the case, event ) or illusory (when infers that is thinking and this is not the case, event ). In CAT, concepts that afford or become more salient in the minds of members of social groups. Results from an agent-based model (ABM) and probabilistic model that implement CAT show that, as our conceptual analyses suggested would be the case, the simulated social system selects concepts according to their usefulness to agents in promoting agreement among them (Experiment 1). Furthermore, the ABM exhibits more complex dynamics where similar minded agents cluster and are able to retain useful concepts even when a different group of agents discards them (Experiment 2). We discuss the relevance of CAT and the current findings for analyzing different social communication events, and suggest ways in which CAT could be put to empirical test.

AB The moral foundations theory supports that people, across cultures, tend to consider a small number of dimensions when classifying issues on a moral basis. The data also show that the statistics of weights attributed to each moral dimension is related to self-declared political affiliation, which in turn has been connected to cognitive learning styles by the recent literature in neuroscience and psychology. Inspired by these data, we propose a simple statistical mechanics model with interacting neural networks classifying vectors and learning from members of their social neighbourhood about their average opinion on a large set of issues. The purpose of learning is to reduce dissension among agents when disagreeing. We consider a family of learning algorithms parametrized by 3, that represents the importance given to corroborating (same sign) opinions. We define an order parameter that quantifies the diversity of opinions in a group with homogeneous learning style. Using Monte Carlo simulations and a mean field approximation we find the relation between the order parameter and the learning parameter 8 at a temperature we associate with the' importance of social influence in a given group. In concordance with data, groups that rely more strongly on corroborating evidence sustain less opinion diversity. We discuss predictions of the model and propose possible experimental tests.

AB This paper deals with the consensus control problem for a class of nonlinear discrete time-varying stochastic multiagent systems (MASs) over a finite horizon via static output feedback. The measurement output available for the controller is not only from the individual agent itself but also from its neighboring ones according to the given topology. The nonlinearities described by statistical means can encompass several classes of well-studied nonlinearities in the literature. A new index of mean-square consensus performance, which quantifies the deviation level from the state of individual agent to the average value of all agents' states, is proposed to reflect the transient consensus behavior of the MAS. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a time-varying output feedback controller such that: 1) the H-infinity consensus performance defined over a given finite horizon is guaranteed with respect to the additive noises and 2) at each time step, the mean-square consensus performance satisfies the prespecified upper bound constraint. By using a set of recursive matrix inequalities, sufficient conditions are derived for the existence of the desired control scheme for achieving both H-infinity and mean-square consensus performance requirements. Finally, a simulation example is utilized to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed control protocol.

AB Background: Agent based models (ABM) are useful to explore population-level scenarios of disease spread and containment, but typically characterize infected individuals using simplified models of infection and symptoms dynamics. Adding more realistic models of individual infections and symptoms may help to create more realistic population level epidemic dynamics.
   Methods: Using an equation-based, host-level mathematical model of influenza A virus infection, we develop a function that expresses the dependence of infectivity and symptoms of an infected individual on initial viral load, age, and viral strain phenotype. We incorporate this response function in a population-scale agent-based model of influenza A epidemic to create a hybrid multiscale modeling framework that reflects both population dynamics and individualized host response to infection.
   Results: At the host level, we estimate parameter ranges using experimental data of H1N1 viral titers and symptoms measured in humans. By linearization of symptoms responses of the host-level model we obtain a map of the parameters of the model that characterizes clinical phenotypes of influenza infection and immune response variability over the population. At the population-level model, we analyze the effect of individualizing viral response in agent-based model by simulating epidemics across Allegheny County, Pennsylvania under both age-specific and age-independent severity assumptions.
   Conclusions: We present a framework for multi-scale simulations of influenza epidemics that enables the study of population-level effects of individual differences in infections and symptoms, with minimal additional computational cost compared to the existing population-level simulations.

AB This paper is concerned with solving a large category of convex optimization problems using a group of agents, each only being accessible to its individual convex cost function. The optimization problems are modeled as minimizing the sum of all the agents' cost functions. The communication process between agents is described by a sequence of time-varying yet balanced directed graphs which are assumed to be uniformly strongly connected. Taking into account the fact that the communication channel bandwidth is limited, for each agent we introduce a vector-valued quantizer with finite quantization levels to preprocess the information to be exchanged. We exploit an event-triggered broadcasting technique to guide information exchange, further reducing the communication cost of the network. By jointly designing the dynamic event-triggered encoding-decoding schemes and the event-triggered sampling rules (to analytically determine the sampling time instant sequence for each agent), a distributed subgradient descent algorithm with constrained information exchange is proposed. By selecting the appropriate quantization levels, all the agents' states asymptotically converge to a consensus value which is also the optimal solution to the optimization problem, without committing saturation of all the quantizers. We find that one bit of information exchange across each connected channel can guarantee that the optimiztion problem can be exactly solved. Theoretical analysis shows that the event-triggered subgradient descent algorithm with constrained data rate of networks converges at the rate of O(ln t/root t). We supply a numerical simulation experiment to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and to validate the correctness of theoretical results.

AB 1. In social contexts, animal behaviour is often studied in terms of group-level characteristics. One clear example of this is the collective motion of animals in decentralized structures, such as bird flocks and fish schools. A major goal of research is to identify how group-level behaviours are shaped by the traits of individuals within them. Few methods exist to make these connections. Individual assessment is often limited, forcing alternatives such as fitting agent-based models to experimental data.
   2. We provide a systematic experimental method for sorting animals according to socially relevant traits, without assaying them or even tagging them individually. Instead, they are repeatedly subjected to behavioural assays in groups, between which the group memberships are rearranged, in order to test the effect of many different combinations of individuals on a group-level property or feature. We analyse this method using a general model for the group feature, and simulate a variety of specific cases to track how individuals are sorted in each case.
   3. We find that in the case where the members of a group contribute equally to the group feature, the sorting procedure increases the between-group behavioural variation well above what is expected for groups randomly sampled from a population. For a wide class of group feature models, the individual phenotypes are efficiently sorted across the groups and thus become available for further analysis on how individual properties affect group behaviour. We also show that the experimental data can be used to estimate the individual-level repeatability of the underlying traits.
   4. Our method allows experimenters to find repeatable variation in social behaviours that cannot be assessed in solitary individuals. Furthermore, experiments in animal behaviour often focus on comparisons between groups randomly sampled from a population. Increasing the behavioural variation between groups increases statistical power for testing whether a group feature is related to other properties of groups or to their phenotypic composition. Sorting according to socially relevant traits is also beneficial in artificial selection experiments, and for testing correlations with other traits. Overall, the method provides a useful tool to study how individual properties influence social behaviour.

AB Composite nucleating agent (CNA) consisting of zinc oxide as a crystallization promoter and phenylphosphonic acid zinc salt (PPZn) as an heterogeneous nucleation agent was employed to improve the crystallization behaviors of branched poly (lactic acid) (B-PLA) which was prepared by use of multi-functional epoxy-based chain extender (CE). The differential scanning calorimeter results showed that the crystallinity and crystallization temperature of prepared B-PLA/CNA were higher than that of linear poly (lactic acid) (L-PLA) and B-PLA at a high cooling rate. The corresponding phenomena of heterogeneous nucleation of B-PLA/CNA were observed by means of polarized optical microscope. The crystalline mechanism research results show that the degradation reaction and chain extending reaction were occurred simultaneously after the addition of CE and CNA into the PLA, PPZn as an effective nucleation points could increase the nucleation density and the degraded short molecular chains with higher chain mobility would improve crystal growth during the crystallization of the branched PLA. Non-isothermal cold crystallization kinetics of various B-PLA with different content of CNA was studied. The corresponding result showed that the crystallinity and crystallization rate increased obviously with the CNA content greater than or equal to 5phr, as well as the crystallization time decreased. The similar experimental results of non-isothermal and isothermal melt crystallization kinetics also showed that CNA had a significant impact on crystallization behavior of B-PLA.

DE Multi-stage demand system; Italian Electricity market; Demand
   substitutability and complementarity
ID PRICES
AB The purpose of this paper is to analyze and test demand behavior in the organized electricity market. According to a theoretical framework of heterogeneous agents' behavior, we estimate a complete multi-stage system weakly separable using individual demand bid data in the Italian Power Exchange. The novel contribution of this paper is twofold. Firstly, we model hourly demand of heterogeneous groups of agents acting in the Italian electricity market with a simultaneous system for all 24 hours. Secondly, we empirically measure the entire structure of expenditure elasticities and cross price elasticities for all 24 hours of the day, ascertaining whether hourly electricity demands can be considered normal or luxury goods and substitutes or complements in an organized electricity market. Econometric estimation shows that price elasticity tends to be higher when hourly price peak. Moreover, electricity exhibits both substitutability and complementarity characteristic in different hours of the day, the former during the day and the latter during the night. Electricity appears to be a normal good during nighttime and a luxury good during daytime. The demand structure has welfare improving policy implications, because appropriate regulation can favor consumer behavior adjustment to shave consumption away from peak prices, thus yielding lower aggregate equilibrium expenditures. To this end, we advocate reforming the actual administered two-price tariff structure to introduce real time pricing options for Italian final users.

AB Despite a large body of experimental data demonstrating consistent group outcomes in social dilemmas, a close look at individual behavior at the micro level reveals a more complicated story. From round to round, individual behavior appears to be almost random. Using a combination of formal deduction and agent-based simulations, we argue that any theory of individual choice that accounts for the observed behavior of real people is likely to require 1) premises of probabilistic choice, 2) preferences that are a function of others' previous behavior (i.e., context dependent), and 3) preferences that are other-regarding rather than simply self-interested. We present a model that fits the requirements.

AB Several components that interact with each other to evolve a complex, and, in some cases, unexpected behavior, represents one of the main and fascinating features of the mammalian immune system. Agent-based modeling and cellular automata belong to a class of discrete mathematical approaches in which entities (agents) sense local information and undertake actions over time according to predefined rules. The strength of this approach is characterized by the appearance of a global behavior that emerges from interactions among agents. This behavior is unpredictable, as it does not follow linear rules. There are a lot of works that investigates the immune system with agent-based modeling and cellular automata. They have shown the ability to see clearly and intuitively into the nature of immunological processes. NetLogo is a multiagent programming language and modeling environment for simulating complex phenomena. It is designed for both research and education and is used across a wide range of disciplines and education levels. In this paper, we summarize NetLogo applications to immunology and, particularly, how this framework can help in the development and formulation of hypotheses that might drive further experimental investigations of disease mechanisms.

AB Certain social preference models have been proposed to explain fairness behavior in experimental games. Existing bodies of research on evolutionary games, however, explain the evolution of fairness merely through the self-interest agents. This paper attempts to analyze the ultimatum game's evolution on complex networks when a number of agents display social preference. Agents' social preference is modeled in three forms: fairness consideration or maintaining a minimum acceptable money level, inequality aversion, and social welfare preference. Different from other spatial ultimatum game models, the model in this study assumes that agents have incomplete information on other agents' strategies, so the agents need to learn and develop their own strategies in this unknown environment. Genetic Algorithm Learning Classifier System algorithm is employed to address the agents' learning issue. Simulation results reveal that raising the minimum acceptable level or including fairness consideration in a game does not always promote fairness level in ultimatum games in a complex network. If the minimum acceptable money level is high and not all agents possess a social preference, the fairness level attained may be considerably lower. However, the inequality aversion social preference has negligible effect on the results of evolutionary ultimatum games in a complex network. Social welfare preference promotes the fairness level in the ultimatum game. This paper demonstrates that agents' social preference is an important factor in the spatial ultimatum game, and different social preferences create different effects on fairness emergence in the spatial ultimatum game.

AB Making unconventional emergent plan for dense crowd is one of the critical issues of evacuation simulations. In order to make the behavior of crowd more believable, we present a real-time evacuation route approach based on emotion and geodesic under the influence of individual emotion and multi-hazard circumstances. The proposed emotion model can reflect the dynamic process of individual in group on three factors: individual emotion, perilous field, and crowd emotion. Specifically, we first convert the evacuation scene to Delaunay triangulation representations. Then, we use the optimization-driven geodesic approach to calculate the best evacuation path with user-specified geometric constraints, such as crowd density, obstacle information, and perilous field. Finally, the Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics method is used for local avoidance of collisions with nearby agents in real-time simulation. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient and well suited for real-time simulations of crowd evacuation.

AB Social play is common in mammals but its adaptive significance is not well understood. A commonly held hypothesis is that social play allows juveniles to learn skills and rules for cooperation as adults. On this view, the adaptive benefit of social play derives from the benefits of cooperation as adults. However, cooperation is only beneficial if it is used in populations of predominantly cooperators; otherwise, it is a costly strategy. We investigated the latter problem by modeling the link between social play and subsequent adult cooperation using an agent-based model. In our model, agents had a play gene with allelic social play states (i.e., play or not play). Juveniles with a play gene learned to cooperate by successfully engaging in social play with another juvenile agent with a play gene. As adults, agents played the stag hunt game with other adults to obtain resources for reproduction. Those that learned to cooperate by playing as juveniles cooperated in the stag hunt game. When agents aggregated into small groups, we found that social play could evolve by facilitating the learning of cooperation. Our theoretical results also show that social play is a novel mechanism for the indirect evolution of cooperation.

TI Effects of Workers' Social Learning: Focusing on Absence Behavior

AB Workers' consistent attendance is an indispensable condition for successful construction projects, but many construction projects still suffer from the productivity loss originating from workers' absenteeism. To deal with this problem, construction managers have mainly used formal controls (e.g.,penalties) targeting those individuals who present excessive absenteeism. However, recent research papers on absenteeism have testified to the paramount role of social factors, such as social norm, on workers' absence behavior. Despite the increasing attention being paid to the social factors of workers' absence behavior, discussion on how a social norm in favor of worker attendance control can be developed is sparse. If how such social norms emerge and how they play a role in controlling workers' behavior are clear, construction managers can invest time in promoting favorable absence norms rather than focusing on regulations targeting individuals. Therefore, this paper studies the system-level effect of workers' social learning using an experimental analysis with simulations in order to extend the knowledge of the social aspect in workers' absence behavior. To conduct the analysis, an agent-based model was developed to serve as a comprehensive model that incorporates mechanisms of workers' formal and social learning. The model was constructed by using theoretical and empirical findings on absence behavior drawn from scholarly literature. Then the constructed agent-based model was used to explore possible scenarios in organizations with simulations. With the simulation results, the following are demonstrated: (1)high social adaptation can work as a force to either increase or decrease workers' absence rates; (2)when strict self-regulation is prevalent among workers, high social adaptation can lead to the development of a positive social norm at the jobsite; and (3)when high social adaptation reinforces formal rules, this occurrence reduces the need for additional formal controls on worker behavior. The results from this paper are expected to help construction organizations in understanding the availability of social norms in favor of management, and ultimately in using the social norm for effective labor control that meets little resistance.

AB The effect of polymer matrix elasticity on the magnetocapacitance characteristics for nanocompostie composed of Fe3O4 nanoparticles and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was investigated by finite element method (FEM) and experiment. In the simulation model, micro-macroscopic coupling method was applied. By this method, the multi-physics coupling behaviour of the magnetocapacitance effect was achieved and the effect of polymer elasticity on the matrix deformation and magnetocapacitance characteristics of the nanocomposite was investigated. Meanwhile, nanocomposites with different elastic moduli were prepared by adjusting the ratio of curing agent to prepolymer in PDMS. The elastic modulus of the nanocomposite reduced with the decreasing ratio of curing agent. The magnetocapacitance effect was enhanced for the nanocomposite with lower elastic modulus at the same magnetic field. The experimental results were in good agreement with the simulation results. The model provides a new route to research the magnetocapacitance effect of similiar composite material system.

AB Context: Models of how people move around cities play a role in making decisions about urban and land-use planning. Previous models have been based on space and time, and have neglected the social aspect of travel. Recent work on agent-based modelling shows promise as a new approach, especially for models with both social and spatial elements.
   Objective: This paper demonstrates the design and implementation of an agent-based model of social activity generation and scheduling for experimental purposes to explore the effects of social space in addition to physical space. As a side-effect, the paper discusses the need for and requirements on structured design of agent-based models and simulations.
   Method: Model design was based on the MASQ meta-model and implemented in Python. The model was then tested against several hypotheses with several initial networks.
   Results: The model allowed us to investigate the effects of social networks. We found that the model was most sensitive to the pair attributes of the network, rather than the global or personal attributes.
   Conclusion: As demonstrated, a structured approach to model development is important in order to be able to understand and apply the results, and for the model to be extensible in the future. Agent-based modelling approaches allow for inclusion of social elements. For models incorporating social networks, testing the sensitivity to the initial network is important to ensure the model performs as expected. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agent-based modelling is an approach that has been receiving attention by the land use modelling community in recent years, mainly because it offers a way of incorporating the influence of human decision-making on land use in a mechanistic, formal, and spatially explicit way, taking into account social interaction, adaptation, and decision-making at different levels. Specific advantages of agent-based models include their ability to model individual decision-making entities and their interactions, to incorporate social processes and non-monetary influences on decision-making, and to dynamically link social and environmental processes. A number of such models are now beginning to appear-it is timely, therefore, to review the uses to which agent-based land use models have been put so far, and to discuss some of the relevant lessons learnt, also drawing on those from other areas of simulation modelling, in relation to future applications. In this paper, we review applications of agent-based land use models under the headings of (a) policy analysis and planning, (b) participatory modelling, (c) explaining spatial patterns of land use or settlement, (d) testing social science concepts and (e) explaining land use functions. The greatest use of such models so far has been by the research community as tools for organising knowledge from empirical studies, and for exploring theoretical aspects of particular systems. However, there is a need to demonstrate that such models are able to solve problems in the real world better than traditional modelling approaches. It is concluded that in terms of decision support, agent-based land-use models are probably more useful as research tools to develop an underlying knowledge base which can then be developed together with end-users into simple rules-of-thumb, rather than as operational decision support tools.

AB Herein, epoxy resin is cured by coupling quantum chemical calculations with molecular dynamics simulations that enable the prediction of material characteristics with fewer artificial parameters. A polymer network is formed by the reaction between base resin and curing agent. The reaction uses activation energy and heat of formation data obtained by first-principle calculations coupled with global reaction route mapping algorithms. Density, glass-transition temperature, Young's modulus, and curing conversion are used to validate the procedure. Experimental and simulation results indicate that base resin with multi-functional reaction groups increase glass-transition temperature and Young's modulus because of cross-linking at the molecular scale.

AB In this paper, from the perspective of opinion dynamics theory, we investigate the interaction mechanism of a group of autonomous agents in an e-commerce community (or social network), and the influence power of opinion leaders during the formation of group opinion. According to the opinion's update manner and influence, this paper divides social agents within a social network into two subgroups: opinion leaders and opinion followers. Then, we establish a new bounded confidence-based dynamic model for opinion leaders and followers to simulate the opinion evolution of the group of agents. Through numerical simulations, we further investigate the evolution mechanism of group opinion, and the relationship between the influence power of opinion leaders and three factors: the proportion of the opinion leader subgroups, the confidence levels of opinion followers, and the degrees of trust toward opinion leaders. The simulation results show that, in order to maximize the influence power in e-commerce, enhancing opinion leaders' credibility is crucial. (c) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Social facilitation has been researched for decades, but in the face of the development of virtual reality technology, new questions arise regarding the possibility of its occurrence in this environment -in the presence of computer-generated agents. Past research provided inconclusive answers: several experiments confirmed this possibility, but several others disagreed. On the other hand, previous studies have shown the important role of VR characteristics, such as realism or co-presence, in evoking other psychological phenomena. However, no study has investigated the interplay between the presence of computer-generated agents and perceived social realism in evoking social facilitation in virtual reality. To this end, the present randomized control study was conducted. The sample consisted of professional firefighters (N= 48), divided into an experimental group with virtual bystanders and a control group without them. Subjects were instructed to perform a rescue procedure in a virtual reality headset. The performance of participants was logged and they completed questionnaires regarding sense of presence in the virtual environment, perceived realism of the environment and perceived co-presence of virtual agents. The obtained results confirmed the role of social realism as a moderator of the occurrence of social facilitation in the presence of computer-generated agents. At the same time, the main effect of facilitation was not confirmed. These results support predictions that the subjective feeling of being in a realistic company of others may be more important in evoking social facilitation than objective facts. Furthermore, the results contribute to the debate regarding the mechanism of social facilitation, suggesting that simple augmentation of the environment with social distractors is not always enough, thus questioning the attentional explanation of the effect. Taken together, our results extend previous findings on social facilitation and open up new possibilities for designing effective virtual environments.

AB There is a need to improve the outcomes for men with high-risk localised, nodal or metastatic prostate cancer, or with aggressively relapsing disease after initial therapy for local disease. This group of men is currently managed with long-term hormone therapy. Thus we aim to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of three different systemic therapies (docetaxel, zoledronic acid and celecoxib) used alone or combined at the initiation of hormone manipulation for high-risk prostate cancer. A novel statistical design (multi-arm, multistage method) simultaneously tests multiple distinct strategies in parallel against a single control arm. The trial has several 'stages', from initial confirmation of safety to a phase III assessment of survival, with a series of intervening activity stages. This method provides a means of assessing several agents more quickly and efficiently, and allows inactive treatments to be dropped from further study at an early stage. STAMPEDE has been designed to address in parallel the activity and efficacy of these agents for this patient group. It is a flagship randomized clinical trial for academic research into prostate cancer in the UK. More than 500 patients have been recruited on schedule, confirming the acceptability of this complex trial design to patients and clinicians. The trial targets a population of approximate to 3000 patients.
   STAMPEDE is a major new trial with a novel design applicable to the synchronous testing of several agents. It is hoped that the results will improve outcomes for patients with high-risk prostate cancer. The design could be applicable to the study of new therapies in other cancer types. Continued efforts are required by the urological cancer community to maintain the excellent recruitment shown to date.

AB This article proposes a design approach, based on the integral sliding mode control paradigm, devoted to give robustness to multiagent systems executing arbitrary distributed optimization and consensus protocols which do not take this feature into account. Robustness is understood as the capability of rejecting the effect of exogenous disturbances, parameter uncertainties, and uncertain couplings between the agents dynamics, by achieving the same emerging behavior as that corresponding to a reference multiagent system (MAS) designed to achieve a given coordination objective in the nominal case. The proposed approach yields a distributed state feedback which can seamlessly be integrated into existing distributed optimization and cooperative control protocols which are usually prone to disturbances and uncertainties corrupting the MAS dynamics. Nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis supports the claimed properties. Numerical simulations, showing how popular distributed optimization and consensus protocols can effectively be robustified are discussed.

TI Non-Bayesian Social Learning With Imperfect Private Signal Structure
SO IEEE ACCESS

DE Social network; Bayesian inference; signal structure; asymptotic

ID DECISION-MAKING
AB As one of the classic models that describe the belief dynamics over social networks, a non-Bayesian social learning model assumes that members in the network possess accurate signal knowledge through the process of Bayesian inference. In order to make the non-Bayesian social learning model more applicable to human and animal societies, this paper extended this model by assuming the existence of private signal structure bias. Each social member in each time step uses an imperfect signal knowledge to form its Bayesian part belief and then incorporates its neighbors' beliefs into this Bayesian part belief to form a new belief report. First, we investigated the intrinsic learning ability of an isolated agent and deduced the conditions that the signal structure needs to satisfy for this isolated agent to make an eventually correct decision. According to these conditions, agents' signal structures were further divided into three different types, "conservative," "radical," and "negative." Then, we switched the context from isolated agents to a connected network; our propositions and simulations show that the conservative agents are the dominant force for the social network to learn the real state, while the other two types might prevent the network from successful learning. Although fragilities do exist in non-Bayesian social learning mechanism, "be more conservative" and "avoid overconfidence" could be effective strategies for each agent in the real social networks to collectively improve social learning processes and results.

AB The work deals with modelling the emergence of pathological crowd behaviours (avalanches, stranding) in the event of emergency evacuations. We propose a system of message propagating agents under spatial and social interactions, assuming that the agents are endowed with a specific internal logic. Therefore, the proposed crowd behaviour model is a hybrid fusing spatial, social and logical models. We have performed extensive simulations varying the system parameters. Experimental results show that agents using a Boolean logic reasoning model produce avalanches, while agents using a Diamond logic reasoning model lead to stranded crowds.

AB This paper addresses the bipartite consensus over cooperation-competition networks affected by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Consider that a network consists of multiple interactive agents, and the relationship between neighboring agents is cooperative or competitive. Meanwhile, information transmission among the agents is unavailable during the intervals of attacks. In order to save communication resources and exclude the Zeno behavior, an event-triggered scheme depending on the sampled-data information from neighboring agents is proposed, and efficient defense strategies in response to the attacks are put forward. Suppose that the frequency and duration of DoS attacks meet certain requirements, then according to the signed graph theory, the LaSalle's invariance principle, and the convergence of monotone sequences, the results of bipartite consensus via the event-triggered protocol are provided, which are mainly related to the communication topology of the network, the sampling period, and the threshold parameters in the event-triggered scheme. It is shown that the bipartite consensus is realized even though the DoS attacks take place frequently. Furthermore, this paper discusses the bipartite consensus in the presence of DoS attacks with a random unsuccessful rate. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the theoretical results.

TI A maximum entropy model for opinions in social groups
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
LA English
DT Article
ID PHASE-TRANSITIONS; DYNAMICS
AB We study how the opinions of a group of individuals determine their spatial distribution and connectivity, through an agent-based model. The interaction between agents is described by a Hamiltonian in which agents are allowed to move freely without an underlying lattice (the average network topology connecting them is determined from the parameters). This kind of model was derived using maximum entropy statistical inference under fixed expectation values of certain probabilities that (we propose) are relevant to social organization. Control parameters emerge as Lagrange multipliers of the maximum entropy problem, and they can be associated with the level of consequence between the personal beliefs and external opinions, and the tendency to socialize with peers of similar or opposing views. These parameters define a phase diagram for the social system, which we studied using Monte Carlo Metropolis simulations. Our model presents both first and second-order phase transitions, depending on the ratio between the internal consequence and the interaction with others. We have found a critical value for the level of internal consequence, below which the personal beliefs of the agents seem to be irrelevant.

AB Evolutionary dynamics has been widely used to characterize the evolution and formation of behavioral consensus. Governed by evolutionary dynamics, a network of agents reaches consensus at a selected state of all mutants or all residents. Of special interest is the question of how agents select the global consensus state through local state updating. This paper aims at establishing a link between local state updating and global consensus state selection. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the evolutionary dynamics on complex networks and derive some fundamental principles of consensus state selection. More specifically, if the probability that an agent adopts a mutant in one-step updating is monotonically increasing with the fitness of the mutant, monotonically increasing with the mutant set, and submodular or supermodular with the mutant set, then the probability that the network of agents converges to the all-mutant state is monotonically increasing with the fitness of the mutant, monotonically increasing with the initial mutant set, and submodular or supermodular with the initial mutant set, respectively. These results guarantee that the common decision of a group can well reflect the concerns of all group members with evolutionary dynamics. The theoretical results are applied to the well-known death-birth process on networks and validated by numerical simulation.

AB We investigate the problem of truth discovery based on opinions from multiple agents (who may be unreliable or biased) that form a social network. We consider the case where agents' reliabilities or biases are correlated if they belong to the same community, which defines a group of agents with similar opinions regarding a particular event. An agent can belong to different communities for different events, and these communities are unknown a priori. We incorporate knowledge of the agents' social network in our truth discovery framework and develop Laplace variational inference methods to estimate agents' reliabilities, communities, and the event states. We also develop a stochastic variational inference method to scale our model to large social networks. Simulations and experiments on real data suggest that when observations are sparse, our proposed methods perform better than several other inference methods, including majority voting, TruthFinder, AccuSim, the Confidence-Aware Truth Discovery method, the Bayesian classifier combination (BCC) method, and the community BCC method.

AB Understanding the mechanisms that give rise to social structure is central to predicting the evolutionary and ecological outcomes of social interactions. Modeling this process is challenging, because all individuals simultaneously behave in ways that shape their social environments-a process called social niche construction (SNC). In earlier work, we demonstrated that aggression acts as an SNC trait in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), but the mechanisms of that process remained cryptic. Here, we analyze how individual social group preferences generate overall social structure. We use a combination of agent-based simulation and approximate Bayesian computation to fit models to empirical data. We confirm that genetic variation in aggressive behavior influences social group structure. Furthermore, we find that female decamping due to male behavior may play an underappreciated role in structuring social groups. Male-male aggression may sometimes destabilize groups, but it may also be an SNC behavior for shaping desirable groups for females. Density intensifies female social preferences; thus, the role of female behavior in shaping group structure may become more important at high densities. Our ability to model the ontogeny of group structure demonstrates the utility of the Bayesian model-based approach in social behavioral studies.

AB Human societies are characterized by three constituent features, besides others. (A) Options, as for jobs and societal positions, differ with respect to their associated monetary and non-monetary payoffs. (B) Competition leads to reduced payoffs when individuals compete for the same option as others. (C) People care about how they are doing relatively to others. The latter trait-the propensity to compare one's own success with that of others-expresses itself as envy. It is shown that the combination of (A)-(C) leads to spontaneous class stratification. Societies of agents split endogenously into two social classes, an upper and a lower class, when envy becomes relevant. A comprehensive analysis of the Nash equilibria characterizing a basic reference game is presented. Class separation is due to the condensation of the strategies of lower-class agents, which play an identical mixed strategy. Upper-class agents do not condense, following individualist pure strategies. The model and results are size-consistent, holding for arbitrary large numbers of agents and options. Analytic results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. An analogy to interacting confined classical particles is discussed.

AB The deregulation of electricity markets has continued apace around the globe. The best structure foe deregulated markets is a subject of much debate, and the consequences of poor structural choices can be dramatic. Understanding the effect of structure on behavior is essential, but the traditional economics approaches of field studies and experimental studies are particularly hard to conduct in relation to electricity markets. This paper describes an agent based computational economics approach for studying the effect of alternative structures and mechanisms on behavior in electricity markets. Autonomous adaptive agents, using hierarchical learning classifier systems, learn through competition in a simulated model of the UK market in electricity generation. The complex agent structure was developed through a sequence of experimentation to test whether it was capable of meeting the following requirements: first, that the agents are able to learn optimal strategies when competing against nonadaptive agents; second,, that the agents are able to learn strategies observable in the real world when competing against other adaptive agents; and third, that cooperation without explicit communication can evolve in certain market situations. The potential benefit of an evolutionary economics approach to market modeling is demonstrated by examining the effects of alternative payment mechanisms on the behavior of agents.

AB This paper develops a three-dimensional in silico hybrid model of cancer, which describes the multi-variate phenotypic behaviour of tumour and host cells. The model encompasses the role of cell migration and adhesion, the influence of the extracellular matrix, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and the signalling triggered by chemical cues and growth factors. The proposed in silico hybrid modelling framework combines successfully the advantages of continuum-based and discrete methods, namely the finite element and agent-based method respectively. The framework is thus used to realistically model cancer mechano-biology in a multiscale fashion while maintaining the resolution power of each method in a computationally cost-effective manner. The model is tailored to simulate glioma progression, and is subsequently used to interrogate the balance between the host cells and small sized gliomas, while the go-or-grow phenotype characteristic in glioblastomas is also investigated. Also, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are examined with respect to their effect in (macroscopic) tumour growth, brain tissue perfusion and tumour necrosis. Finally, we use the in silico framework to assess differences between low-grade and high-grade glioma growth, demonstrating significant differences in the distribution of cancer as well as host cells, in accordance with reported experimental findings.

AB Women nearly twice as often develop social anxiety disorder (SAD) compared to men. The reason for this difference is still being debated. The present study investigates gender differences and the effect of male versus female agents in low (LSA) and high socially anxious (HSA) participants regarding the acquisition and extinction of social fear in virtual reality (VR). In a social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, 60 participants actively approached several agents, some of which were paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US) consisting of a verbal rejection and spitting simulated by an aversive air blast (CS C), or without an US (CS). Primary outcome variables were defined for each of the 4 levels of emotional reactions including experience (fear ratings), psychophysiology (fear-potentiated startle), behavior (avoidance), and cognition (recognition task). Secondary outcome variables were personality traits, contingency ratings, heart rate (HR), and skin conductance response (SCR). As hypothesized, fear ratings for CS C increased significantly during acquisition and the differentiation between CS C and CS vanished during extinction. Additionally, women reported higher fear compared to men. Furthermore, a clear difference in the fear-potentiated startle response between male CS C and CS at the end of acquisition indicates successful SFC to male agents in both groups. Concerning behavior, results exhibited successful SFC in both groups and a general larger distance to agents in HSA than LSA participants. Furthermore, HSA women maintained a larger distance to male compared to female agents. No such differences were found for HSA men. Regarding recognition, participants responded with higher sensitivity to agent than object stimuli, suggesting a higher ability to distinguish the target from the distractor for social cues, which were on focus during SFC. Regarding the secondary physiological outcome variables, we detected an activation in HR response during acquisition, but there were no differences between stimuli or groups. Moreover, we observed a gender but no CS+/CS- differences in SCR. SFC was successfully induced and extinguished according to the primary outcome variables. VR is an interesting tool to measure emotional learning processes on different outcome levels with enhanced ecological validity. Future research should further investigate social fear learning mechanisms for developing more efficient treatments of SAD.

AB A model of opinion dynamics with two types of agents as social actors are presented, using the Ising thermodynamic model as the dynamics template. The agents are considered as opportunists which live at sites and interact with the neighbors, or fanatics/missionaries which move from site to site randomly in persuasion of converting agents of opposite opinion with the help of opportunists. Here, the moving agents act as an external influence on the opportunists to convert them to the opposite opinion. It is shown by numerical simulations that such dynamics of opinion formation may explain some details of consensus formation even when one of the opinions are held by a minority. Regardless the distribution of the opinion, different size societies exhibit different opinion formation behavior and time scales. In order to understand general behavior, the scaling relations obtained by comparing opinion formation processes observed in societies with varying population and number of randomly moving agents are studied. For the proposed model two types of scaling relations are observed. In fixed size societies, increasing the number of randomly moving agents give a scaling relation for the time scale of the opinion formation process. The second type of scaling relation is due to the size dependent information propagation in finite but large systems, namely finite-size scaling.

AB The simulation of a crowd evacuating public buildings can be an important reference in planning the layout of buildings and formulating evacuation strategies. This paper proposes an agent-based crowd model; a crowd evacuation navigation simulation model is proposed for the multi-obstacle environment. We introduce the concept of navigation factor to describe the proximity of the navigation point to the exit. An algorithm for creating navigation points in multi-obstacle environment is proposed along with the global navigation and local navigation control algorithms of the crowd. We construct a crowd evacuation simulation prototype system with different simulation scenes using the scene editor. We conduct the crowd evacuation simulation experiment in the multi-obstacle scene, recording and analyzing the relevant experimental data. The simulation prototype system can be used to derive the evacuation time of the crowd and analyze the evacuation behavior of the crowd. It is expected to provide a visual deduction method for crowd management in an evacuation emergency.

AB This study evaluated the efficacy of rabdosia rubescens against gingivitis and compared the therapeutic efficacy of different dosage forms of rabdosia rubescens. A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-simulation, positive-controlled and parallel trial was conducted. A total of 136 patients exhibiting clinical symptoms of gingivitis were enrolled. The subjects were randomly assigned to two groups: test group (n=67), in which rabdosia rubescens drop pill (960 mg) and 4 tablets of simulation agent of rabdosia rubescen were orally given to the subjects three times a day for 5 days; and control group (n=69), in which the subjects were administered the tablets of rabdosia rubescens (1000 mg) and 24 drop pills of simulation agent of rabdosia rubescens thrice daily for 5 days. The experimental protocols and diagnostic criteria were established by expert panel prior to the experiment. The clinical symptoms were graded according to the severity of the disease and quantified. The total scores and scores for each clinical symptom of gingivitis were assessed at baseline and on the 6th day post-treatment. The therapeutic efficacy was compared between the two groups and in each group itself before and after the treatment. The results showed that in the two groups, the subjects who were given rabdosia rubescens, drop pill or tablet, had a decrease in total scores and scores for each clinical symptom when compared with those before treatment (P < 0.01). There was significant difference in the therapeutic efficacy between the test group and the control group with the efficacy rate being 92.54% and 79.71% respectively (P < 0.05). It was concluded that rabdosia rubescens showed great promise in treating gingivitis. And rabdosia rubescens drop pill was more efficacious than rabdosia rubescens tablet.

TI Diversity-induced resonance in the response to social norms
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E

ID COOPERATION; DYNAMICS; DISORDER; SYSTEMS; DRIVEN
AB In this paper we focus on diversity-induced resonance, which was recently found in bistable, excitable, and other physical systems. We study the appearance of this phenomenon in a purely economic model of cooperating and defecting agents. An agent's contribution to a public good is seen as a social norm, so defecting agents face a social pressure, which decreases if free riding becomes widespread. In this model, diversity among agents naturally appears because of the different sensitivities towards the social norm. We study the evolution of cooperation as a response to the social norm (i) for the replicator dynamics and (ii) for the logit dynamics by means of numerical simulations. Diversity-induced resonance is observed as a maximum in the response of agents to changes in the social norm as a function of the degree of heterogeneity in the population. We provide an analytical, mean-field approach for the logit dynamics and find very good agreement with the simulations. From a socioeconomic perspective, our results show that, counterintuitively, diversity in the individual sensitivity to social norms may result in a society that better follows such norms as a whole, even if part of the population is less prone to follow them.

AB Bacteria Foraging Optimisation Algorithm is a collective behaviour-based meta-heuristics searching depending on the social influence of the bacteria co-agents in the search space of the problem. The algorithm faces tremendous hindrance in terms of its application for discrete problems and graph-based problems due to biased mathematical modelling and dynamic structure of the algorithm. This had been the key factor to revive and introduce the discrete form called Discrete Bacteria Foraging Optimisation (DBFO) Algorithm for discrete problems which exceeds the number of continuous domain problems represented by mathematical and numerical equations in real life. In this work, we have mainly simulated a graph-based road multi-objective optimisation problem and have discussed the prospect of its utilisation in other similar optimisation problems and graph-based problems. The various solution representations that can be handled by this DBFO has also been discussed. The implications and dynamics of the various parameters used in the DBFO are illustrated from the point view of the problems and has been a combination of both exploration and exploitation. The result of DBFO has been compared with Ant Colony Optimisation and Intelligent Water Drops Algorithms. Important features of DBFO are that the bacteria agents do not depend on the local heuristic information but estimates new exploration schemes depending upon the previous experience and covered path analysis. This makes the algorithm better in combination generation for graph-based problems and combination generation for NP hard problems.

AB Agricultural development and climate change will be two of the major stressors on the Amazon natural-human system in the decades to come. Environmental licensing for rural properties is being implemented in several states in the Brazilian Amazon with the goal of restoring forests in agricultural landscapes and mediating the impacts of these stressors. This study presents an agent-based model of ranching and land exchange, informs it with empirical results from social research in the Ji-Parana River Basin, Rondonia, Brazil, and investigates the social, economic, and environmental outcomes that can be expected as a result of environmental licensing in the context of climate change. Model results informed by these data suggest that although an environmental licensing scheme with monitoring and enforcement may increase the level of forested land in ranching landscapes, it may do so at the expense of the small producer. To the extent that effective monitoring and enforcement exist, a focus on larger holdings will help to mediate this negative social impact. These results suggest that a middle ground can be found in cases where current environmental goals conflict with legacies of past colonization and resource-use regimes.

AB Dose-response experiments characterize the relationship between infectious agents and their hosts. These experiments are routinely used to estimate the minimum effective infectious dose for an infectious agent, which is most commonly characterized by the dose at which 50 per cent of challenged hosts become infected-the ID50. In turn, the ID50 is often used to compare between different agents and quantify the effect of treatment regimes. The statistical analysis of dose-response data typically makes the assumption that hosts within a given dose group are independent. For social animals, in particular avian species, hosts are routinely housed together in groups during experimental studies. For experiments with non-infectious agents, this poses no practical or theoretical problems. However, transmission of infectious agents between co-housed animals will modify the observed dose-response relationship with implications for the estimation of the ID50 and the comparison between different agents and treatments. We derive a simple correction to the likelihood for standard dose-response models that allows us to estimate dose-response and transmission parameters simultaneously. We use this model to show that: transmission between co-housed animals reduces the apparent value of the ID50 and increases the variability between replicates leading to a distinctive all-or-nothing response; in terms of the total number of animals used, individual housing is always the most efficient experimental design for ascertaining dose-response relationships; estimates of transmission from previously published experimental data for Campylobacter spp. in chickens suggest that considerable transmission occurred, greatly increasing the uncertainty in the estimates of dose-response parameters reported in the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accounting for transmission in the analysis of dose-response data for Campylobacter spp. challenges our current understanding of the differing response of chickens with respect to host-age and in vivo passage of bacteria. Our findings suggest that the age-dependence of transmissibility between hosts-rather than their susceptibility to colonization-is the mechanism behind the 'lag-phase' reported in commercial flocks, which are typically found to be Campylobacter free for the first 14-21 days of life.

AB Agricultural intensification and abandonment have been identified as two of the more prominent and polarizing drivers of landscape change in Europe. These transitions may induce deterioration in landscape functioning and character, particularly in cultural landscapes demonstrative of evolving human-environment dynamics that have sustained environmental benefits through time. Cultural and behavioral motives are important root influences to such landscape transitions, yet efforts to address landscape degradation are often hampered by a failure to account for the heterogeneous decision-making nature of its agents of change and the inherent complexity of socio-ecological systems. Novel techniques are required to further disentangle responses to multi-level drivers and discuss alternative landscape development trajectories. Agent-based models constructed by means of participatory approaches present increasingly applied tools in this context. This study sought to capture and model the future perspectives emerging from presently occurring farming discourses in the region of Gera (Lesvos, Greece), characterized by persistent abandonment of its traditionally managed olive plantations. We constructed an agent-based model iteratively in collaboration with the local farming community and experts in landscape research. Empirical findings informed the model through the construction of a farmer typology, revealhig a heavy reliance of the farming community upon sectorial profitability, prevalent cultural farming motives and emerging landscape initiatives. The model examined the de-coupled role of agricultural profitability and landscapes initiatives in shaping the behavior of land managers, mapping alternative landscape futures over a period of 25 years. Model results illustrate both increased profitability and action by landscape initiatives are required to reverse abandonment trends within the simulated time frame. The hypothesized ability of landscape initiatives to maintain and promote a cultural drive amongst adhering farmers is crucial for securing behavioral transformations towards professionalism. This study confirmed agent-based modelling to be intuitively received by stakeholders who significantly contributed to model structure refinement and the rejection of a status quo scenario.

AB The shift toward sustainable electricity systems is one of the grand challenges of the 21st century. Decentralized production from renewable sources, electric mobility, and related advances are at odds with traditional power systems where central, large-scale generation of electricity follows inelastic consumer demand. Information systems innovations can enable new forms of dynamic electricity trading that leverage real-time consumption information and that use price signals to incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. However, the best designs for these innovations, and the societal implications of different design choices, are largely unclear. We are addressing these challenges through the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC), a competitive gaming platform on which numerous research groups now jointly devise, benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions to the sustainable electricity challenge. Based on the Power TAC community's results, we give preliminary empirical evidence for the efficacy of competitive gaming platforms, and for the community's contributions toward resolving the sustainable electricity challenge.

AB Researchers in marketing are often interested in analyzing how an agent's discrete choice decision affects a subsequent or concurrent discrete choice decision by the same or different agent. This analysis may necessitate the use of a simultaneous equations model with discrete and continuous endogenous variables as explanatory variables. In this paper, we offer an error augmentation approach to Hierarchical Bayesian estimation of a simultaneous bivariate probit model containing both discrete and continuous endogenous variables. We accomplish the error augmentation in our MCMC algorithm using a Metropolis-Hastings step that generates the error components of the latent variables in our model. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that our error augmentation algorithm recovers closely the true parameters of the simultaneous bivariate probit model. We then apply our algorithm to customer churn data from a wireless service provider. We formulate a simultaneous bivariate probit model to study the impact of a customer's multiple product relationships with a firm (multi-buying) on the likelihood of churn by that customer. The empirical results show that the act of multi-buying significantly reduces churn even though the customers who are more predisposed to multi-buy have an inherently higher predisposition to churn.

This study models the effects of social influence on household evacuation behavior in anticipation of a hurricane event. An agent-based model was developed in this study to simulate: 1) a home workplace social network between households residing in the Florida Keys, 2) the communication of a hurricane evacuation order among socially linked households, and 3) the resulting spatio-temporal diffusion of household evacuation behavior. Data sources informing model implementation include U.S. Census block group data, business databases, and statistics from hurricane evacuation surveys. Simulated model results from the model were validated with empirical traffic records observed at a Florida Keys monitoring station during evacuation from Hurricane Georges in 1998. This model builds upon previous research using agent-based models to simulate hurricane evacuation by incorporating multiple data sources and validating results with empirical traffic patterns. Such an empirically-grounded model facilitates locally relevant exploration of evacuation behavior to support the development of more effective evacuation plans and preparedness for future hurricane events.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model of population desegregation and provides a thorough analysis of the social behavior leading to it, namely, the contact hypothesis. Based on the parameters of frequency and intensity of influence of group leaders on the population, the proposed model is constituted by two layers: 1) a physical layer of the population that is influenced by and 2) a virtual layer of group leaders. The model of negotiation and survival of group leaders are governed by the nature-inspired evolutionary process of queen ants, also known as Foundress Dilemma. The motivation of using a virtual grouping concept (instead of taking a subset of population as the group leaders) is to stay focused on finding the conditions leading individuals in a society tolerating a significantly diversified (desegregated) neighborhood, rather than, indulging into complex details, which would be more relevant to studies targeting the evolution of societal group and leaders. A geographic information system-driven simulation is performed, which reveals that: 1) desegregation is directly proportional to the frequency of group leaders' contact with the population and 2) mostly, it remains ineffective with an increase in the intensity of group leaders' contact with the population. The mechanism of group selection (the conflict resolution model resolving the Foundress Dilemma) reveals an exciting result concerning negative influence of cooperative group leaders. Most of the time, desegregation decreases with increase in cooperative leaders (the leaders enforcing desegregation) when compared with fierce leaders (the leaders enforcing segregation).

AB Social hierarchies exist throughout the animal kingdom, including among humans. Our daily interactions inevitably retied social dominance relationships between individuals. How do we mentally represent such concepts? Studies show that social dominance is represented as vertical space (i.e. high = dominant) by adults and preschool children, suggesting a space-dominance representational link in social cognition. However, little is known about its early development. Here, we present experimental evidence that 12- to 16-month-old infants expect agents presented in a higher spatial position to be more socially dominant than agents in a lower spatial position. After infants repeatedly watched the higher and lower agents being presented simultaneously, they looked longer at the screen when the lower agent subsequently outcompeted the higher agent in securing a reward object, suggesting that this outcome violated their higher-is-dominant expectation. We first manipulated agents' positions by presenting them on a podium (experiment 1). Then we presented the agents on a double-decker stand to make their spatial positions directly above or below each other (experiment 2), and we replicated the results (experiment 3). This research demonstrates that infants expect spatially higher-positioned agents to be socially dominant, suggesting deep roots of the space-dominance link in ontogeny.

AB We consider the fruits of integrating agent-based modeling (ABM) with lab-based experimental research with human subjects. While both ABM and lab experiments have similar aims-to identify the rules, tendencies, and heuristics by which individual agents make decisions and respond to external stimuli-they work toward their common goal in notably different ways. Behavioral-lab research typically exposes human subjects to experimental manipulations, or treatments, to make causal inferences by observing variation in response to the treatment. ABM researchers ascribe individual simulated "agents" with decision rules describing their behavior and subsequently attempt to replicate "macro" level empirical patterns. Integration of ABM and lab experiments presents advantages for both sets of researchers. ABM researchers will benefit from exposure to a larger set of empirically validated mechanisms that can add nuance and refinement to their models of human behavior and system dynamics. Lab-oriented researchers will gain from ABM a method for assessing the validity and magnitude of their findings, adjudicating between competing mechanisms, developing new theory to test in the lab, and exploring macro-level, long-run implications of subtle, micro-level observations that can be difficult to observe in the field. We offer an example of this mixed-method approach related to status, social networks, and job search and issue guidance for future research attempting such integration.

AB This paper addresses distributed average tracking of physical second-order agents with heterogeneous unknown nonlinear dynamics, where there is no constraint on input signals and there is no need for correct initialization. The unknown non-linear terms in agents' dynamics are heterogeneous, satisfying a Lipschitz-like condition that will be defined later and is more general than the Lipschitz condition. In the proposed algorithm, a control input and a filter are designed for each agent. Each agent's filter has two outputs and the idea is that the first output estimates the average of the input signals, and the second output estimates the average of the input velocities asymptotically. In parallel, each agent's position and velocity are driven to track, respectively, the first and the second outputs. Having an unknown term in agents' dynamics necessitates designing the filters for agents. Since the nonlinear terms in agents' dynamics can be unbounded and the input signals are arbitrary, novel time-varying gains are employed in agents' filters and control inputs to overcome these unboundedness effects. Finally, the results are improved to achieve the distributed average tracking for a group of double-integrator agents, where there is no constraint on input signals and the filter is not required anymore. Numerical simulations are also presented to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB Majority-vote models on scale-free hypergraphs are investigated by means of numerical simulations with different variants of system dynamics. Hypergraphs are generalisations of ordinary graphs in which higher order of social organisation is included by introducing hyperedges corresponding to social groups, connecting more than two nodes. In the models under study, opinions of agents (two-state spins) placed in nodes are updated according to a probabilistic rule with control parameter representing social noise. The probability of a single spin flip depends on the average opinion within only one social group (hyperedge) the agent belongs to. This introduces an intermediate level of social interactions, in contrast with the case of networks, where the opinion of an agent usually depends on the average opinion of all neighbours. In all cases under consideration a second-order phase transition to a state with an uniform opinion was found as a function of the social noise, with the critical value of the control parameter and the critical exponents depending on the hypergraph topology and details of the system dynamics (node or hyperedge update).

AB Multi-arm trials are an efficient way of simultaneously testing several experimental treatments against a shared control group. As well as reducing the sample size required compared to running each trial separately, they have important administrative and logistical advantages. There has been debate over whether multi-arm trials should correct for the fact that multiple null hypotheses are tested within the same experiment. Previous opinions have ranged from no correction is required, to a stringent correction (controlling the probability of making at least one type I error) being needed, with regulators arguing the latter for confirmatory settings. In this article, we propose that controlling the false-discovery rate (FDR) is a suitable compromise, with an appealing interpretation in multi-arm clinical trials. We investigate the properties of the different correction methods in terms of the positive and negative predictive value (respectively how confident we are that a recommended treatment is effective and that a non-recommended treatment is ineffective). The number of arms and proportion of treatments that are truly effective is varied. Controlling the FDR provides good properties. It retains the high positive predictive value of FWER correction in situations where a low proportion of treatments is effective. It also has a good negative predictive value in situations where a high proportion of treatments is effective. In a multi-arm trial testing distinct treatment arms, we recommend that sponsors and trialists consider use of the FDR.

AB This paper discusses the problem of controlling formation shapes for a group of nonholonomic unicycle-type agents with constant speeds. The control input is designed to steer their orientations and the aim is to achieve a desired formation configuration for all the agents subject to constant-speed constraints. The circular motion center is adopted as a virtual position for each agent to define the desired formation shape. We consider several different formation design approaches based on different formation specifications under different interaction graphs. In particular, two different formation design approaches, namely, a displacement-based approach and a distance-based approach, are discussed in detail to coordinate constant-speed agents in achieving a desired formation shape with stable circular motions via limited interactions. The communication and measurement requirements for each approach are also discussed. Furthermore, we propose a combined controller to stabilize a formation shape and synchronize the heading of each agent simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed formation control schemes is validated by both numerical simulations and real experiments with actual unmanned fixed-wing aircraft.

AB This article investigates the fully distributed observer-based adaptive fault-tolerant synchronization problem (SP) of multiagent systems with event-triggered control mechanisms. First, a nonlinear and discontinuous adaptive observer-based event-triggered fault-tolerant controller is proposed for each agent to overcome the occurrence of unknown faults and unmeasurable full states of the controlled system. Besides, an adaptive triggering function consisting of state-dependent and time-dependent threshold is developed to adjust the parameter of triggering threshold online. Then, a modified nonlinear and continuous observer-based controller with adaptive ETC strategy is developed to overcome the chattering phenomenon from the discontinuous controller. It is proved that under two controllers, the SP not only can be achieved in a fully distributed way without continuous communication for both the controller updates and the triggering condition detecting but also exclusion of "Zeno behavior" can be realized. Finally, the effective algorithms can be verified by giving numerical simulations related to mobile robots.

AB Fog radio access networks (F-RANs) have been seen as promising paradigms to handle the stringent requirements in the 5G era by utilizing the cache and resource management capabilities of fog access points (FAPs). To achieve better system performance, cache resource and radio resource should be jointly optimized. However, fully centralized optimization can put heavy burden on the resource manager in the cloud. Faced with this issue, a hierarchical resource management architecture is adopted. Specifically, the resource manager in the upper layer maximizes a long-term utility by optimizing cache resource, which is adaptive to the statistics of channel gains and user content requests. In the lower layer, FAPs self-organize into multiple clusters to mitigate inter-FAP interference in each transmission interval given user content requests, channel gains and cache configuration. Under per-FAP fronthaul capacity constraints, interactions among FAPs are further modeled by a coalition formation game. Considering the coupling of FAPs and the resource managers strategies and the hierarchy of resource management, the joint cache and radio resource management is formulated as a Stackelberg game with the resource manager and FAPs being the leader and followers, respectively. To achieve Stackelberg equilibrium, a distributed coalition formation algorithm is first developed for FAPs to achieve a stable state. Since there is no closed form for the leaders objective and the leaders strategy is discontinuous, two model-free reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are utilized, which can approach a global and a local optimal caching strategy, respectively, taking into account the cluster formation behavior of FAPs. Simulation results show that the proposed cluster formation scheme and multi-agent RL based caching scheme outperform the baselines.

AB Fire evacuation modeling benefits from the application of social science both in terms of accuracy and external validation. This paper describes PrioritEvac, a novel agent-based model which incorporates the social dimension of group loyalty into fire evacuation and responses to fire and smoke. It uses individual priorities, making for a dynamic approach that allows greater agency and nuance. PrioritEvac is programmed in NetLogo and validated using extensive data collected from the Station nightclub fire. The statistical analysis of the results of the model indicate that, compared to historical patterns, it reproduces along multiple metrics including a mean of 114 deaths (std. dev. = 38) over 50 runs, which puts the actual result of the fire within one standard deviation of the mean results of the simulation. Overall, the mean differential along all the metrics is 79, significantly outperforming all published ABM models of the Station nightclub fire that did not incorporate social relationships.

AB In an attempt to reproduce and study the dynamics of financial markets, a random agent-based financial price model is developed and investigated by the finite-range multitype contact dynamic system, in which the interaction and dispersal of different types of investment attitudes in a stock market are imitated by viruses spreading. With different parameters of birth rates and finite-range, the normalized return series are simulated by Monte Carlo simulation method and numerical studied by power-law distribution analysis and autocorrelation analysis. To better understand the nonlinear dynamics of the return series, a q-order autocorrelation function and a multi-autocorrelation function are also defined in this work. The comparisons of statistical behaviors of return series from the agent-based model and the daily historical market returns of Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Component Index indicate that the proposed model is a reasonable qualitative explanation for the price formation process of stock market systems.

AB Poor context integration, the process of incorporating both previous and current information in decision making, is a cognitive symptom of schizophrenia. The maintenance of the contextual information has been shown to be sensitive to changes in excitation-inhibition (EI) balance. Many regions of the brain are sensitive to EI imbalances, however, so it is unknown how systemic manipulations affect the specific regions that are important to context integration. We constructed a multi-structure, biophysically-realistic agent that could perform context-integration as is assessed by the dot pattern expectancy task. The agent included a perceptual network, a memory network, and a decision making system and was capable of successfully performing the dot pattern expectancy task. Systemic manipulation of the agent's EI balance produced localized dysfunction of the memory structure, which resulted in schizophrenia-like deficits at context integration. When the agent's pyramidal cells were less excitatory, the agent fixated upon the cue and initiated responding later than the default agent, which were like the deficits one would predict that individuals on the autistic spectrum would make. This modelling suggests that it may be possible to parse between different types of context integration deficits by adding distractors to context integration tasks and by closely examining a participant's reaction times.
   Author summary
   Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental health disorder and its underlying etiology is currently unknown. Neural imbalances in the neural excitation and inhibition of specific regions of the brain have been hypothesized to cause symptoms of schizophrenia. Most regions of the brain have specific excitation-inhibition balances that permit their functioning in the processing of information. How systemic changes in the excitation-inhibition balance cause specific deficits and dysfunction within neural circuits is unknown. A common cognitive deficit in schizophrenia is difficulty with context integration, which is the ability to successfully use previous and current information when making decisions. We assessed how this symptom could be caused by an imbalance in neural excitation and inhibition by simulating the effects of potential imbalances in a model agent. Global imbalances in the agent's neural excitation and inhibition led to impairment of specific circuits. These dysfunctional circuits produced behavioral deficits that were like those observed in individuals with schizophrenia. These simulations suggested how specific neural circuits may be disrupted by global changes in excitation or inhibition, ways to improve the assessment of context integration, new approaches to analyzing behavior, and why it may be beneficial to assess context integration in autism spectrum disorder.

AB In this paper we investigate the finite-time and fixed-time consensus problems of multiagent networks with pinning control and noise perturbation. In order to reach the finite-time and fixed-time consensus, several pinning protocols are proposed. Compared with the consensus protocols without pinning control, the proposed finite-time and fixed-time protocols need to control only a small fraction of agents, which is practical and has advantages from the physical viewpoint of energy consumption. More specifically, the deterministic and stochastic protocols include the graph (p + 1)-Laplacian, a nonlinear generalization of the standard graph Laplacian. We show that, unlike the protocols with the standard (linear) graph Laplacian, those with the graph (p + 1)-Laplacian solve the finite-time as well as the fixed-time consensus problems. By using the finite-time and fixed-time stability theory and the algebra graph theory, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the finite-time and fixed-time consensus. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of the theoretical results.

AB This paper analyses the formation tracking of groups of mobile robots moving on the plane. A leader robot is chosen to follow a prescribed trajectory whilst the rest, considered as followers, are formed in an open-chain configuration. Two formation-tracking control laws using approximate velocities are proposed, in which some velocities must be communicated between robots in order to ensure the simultaneous preservation of the formation and the following of the group path. The main result is analysis of the convergence of the two proposed control laws. The restriction of inaccurate information occurs in decentralized multi-robot platforms, in which the mobile agents are only able to measure positions and the velocities' functions are estimated using online numerical methods. A numerical simulation of both controllers in the case of omnidirectional robots is shown. For the case of the unicycle-type robots, real-time experiments of both controllers were implemented and tested.

AB We propose a non-Bayesian social learning update rule for agents in a network, which minimizes the sum of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true distribution generating the agents' local observations and the agents' beliefs (parameterized by a hypothesis set), and a weighted varentropy-related term. The varentropy-related term allows us to control the rate of convergence of our update rule, which also reuses some of the most recent observations of each agent to speed up convergence. Under mild technical conditions, we show that the belief of each agent concentrates on the optimal hypothesis set, and we derive a bound for the convergence rate. Furthermore, to overcome the performance degradation due to misinforming agents, who use a corrupted likelihood functions in their belief updates, we propose to use multiple social networks that update their beliefs independently and a convex combination mechanism among the beliefs of all the networks. Simulations with applications to location identification and group recommendation demonstrate that our proposed methods offer improvements over two other current state-of-the art non-Bayesian social learning algorithms.

AB Increased intensity of agriculture and landscape homogenization are threatening biodiversity in landscapes. We reviewed 67 case studies addressing the impact of agriculture on biodiversity in model based scenario approaches and compared the information they provide on biodiversity, spatial characteristics, scenarios, and landscapes. We found an overall large diversity of approaches that we summarized statistically into six groups. "Biodiversity based agent based models", "Expert based exploration of land use change with GIS" and "Land use approaches of biodiversity with spatially explicit statistical model" are specialized biodiversity studies with high complexity in terms of biodiversity modelling with agent-based models or mechanistic models. On the other hand, "Bioeconomic modelling of policy impacts in favor of restoration of beneficial habitats", "Participatory simulation studies of landscape futures" and "Large scale multi criteria studies of innovative scenarios with optimization" do not consider species' behavior or landscape configuration, but do address a large range of socioeconomic and environmental issues. As a contribution to developing quantitative and policy-relevant biodiversity conservation studies in landscape, we present the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. We then suggest combining different approaches, particularly with the use of agent-based models and mechanistic models, integrating spatially explicit drivers of biodiversity change and the socio-economic context of farming in a participatory manner. We give recommendations on the inclusion of more taxa in future studies and collaboration between scientists from different disciplines to develop innovative solutions that can halt the biodiversity decline in agricultural landscapes.

AB The method of agent-based modeling is rarely used in social psychology, but has the potential to complement and improve traditional research practices. An agent-based model (ABM) consists of a number of virtual individuals the "agents" interacting in an artificial, experimenter-controlled environment. In this article, we discuss several characteristics of ABMs that could prove particularly useful with respect to recent recommendations aimed at countering issues related to the current "replication crisis". We address the potential synergies between planning and implementing an ABM on the one hand, and the endeavor of pre-registration on the other. We introduce ABMs as tools for both the generation and the improvement of theory, testing of hypotheses, and for extending traditional experimental approaches by facilitating the investigation of social processes from the intra-individual all the way up to the societal level. We describe examples of ABMs in social psychology, including a detailed description of the CollAct model of social learning. Finally, limitations and drawbacks of agent-based modeling are discussed. In annex 1 and 2, we provide literature and tool recommendations for getting started with an ABM.

DE Multi-intent; Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Multi-modal;
   Sentiment; Policy learning; Task-oriented
AB Creation of task-oriented dialog/virtual agent (VA) capable of managing complex domain-specific user queries pertaining to multiple intents is difficult since the agent must deal with several subtasks simultaneously. Most end-to-end dialogue systems, however, only provide user semantics as inputs from texts into the learning process and neglect other useful user behaviour and information from other modalities such as images. This stresses the benefit of incorporating multi-modal inputs for eliciting user preference in the task. Also, sentiment of the user plays a significant role in achieving maximum user/customer satisfaction during the conversation. Thus, it is also important to incorporate users' sentiments during policy learning, especially when serving user's composite goals. For the creation of multi-modal VA aided with sentiment for conversations encompassing multi-intents, this paper introduces a new dataset, named Vis-SentiVA: Visual and Sentiment aided VA created from open-accessed conversational dataset. We present a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) typically options-based VA to learn policies for serving multi-intent dialogues. Multi-modal information (texts and images) extraction to identify user's preference is incorporated in the learning framework. A combination of task-based and sentiment-based rewards is integrated in the hierarchical value functions for the VA to be user adaptive. Empirically, we show that all these aspects induced together in the learning framework play a vital role in acquiring higher dialogue task success and increased user contentment in the process of creating composite-natured VAs. This is the first effort in integrating sentiment-aware rewards in the multi-modal HRL framework. The paper highlights that it is indeed essential to include other modes of information extraction such as images and behavioural cues of the user such as sentiment to secure greater user contentment. This also helps in improving success of composite-natured VAs serving task-oriented dialogues.

AB Organophosphorus compound poisoning (OPC) is a global issue. The problem is aggravated with the threats of terrorist use, unintentional use and irresponsible practice as happened recently in turmoil countries. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the old-generation antihistamine promethazine (PROM), a drug with multi pharmacological actions, as an antidote to extremely and highly toxic (WHO's class IA and IB) OPC poisoning in experimental animal models conducted on adult male wistar rats. Experimental groups were treated intraperitoneal (i.p.) with LD70 of methyl paraoxon (MPOX), class IA and dicrotophos (DCP), class IB alone and a combination of simultaneously i.p. injection of PROM. Mortality was recorded at 30 minutes, 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, 48 hours post injections. RBC-AChE was measured in survivals. MPOX was chosen for further studies with atropine (ATR) and pralidoxime (PAM). In addition to Kaplan-Meir survival analysis, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatinine kinase (CK) from serum were measured in all experimental groups with MPOX. The results revealed significant protection by PROM in both MPOX and DCP intoxicated rats, though the inhibition of RBC-AChE was high. The observed results show that groups treated with a combination of MPOX and PROM or MPOX, PROM, and PAM were protected higher than those treated with MPOX and ATR or MPOX, ATR, and PAM though statistically not significantly different (P <= 0.05). No effect was observed on the activity of LDH and CK. The study concludes that PROM may be effectively used in OPC poisoning. However, risk/benefits trials and further studies with different doses and other OPC groups are warranted.

AB Adaptation to climate change depends to a significant extent on behavioural change in the form of individual adaptation action. We investigate the case of urban neighbourhood activation for the support of the elderly during the more likely occurring extreme heat waves generated by climate change. The proposed integrative theoretical consideration makes on the one hand reference to social dilemma theory and on the other to concepts from behavioural theory and social psychology. The case context is particularly challenging because it involves intra-individual dynamics of psychological processes, inter individual dynamics of social influence and environmental dynamics governed by future climate scenarios. To account for the spatial and temporal dynamics of social mobilisation the proposed methodical approach is agent-based modelling. The presented social simulation experiments obtain their empirical grounding from a fine grained set of socio-geographic data for the target area which groups the population according to sociological lifestyles in a spatially explicit way. Simulation results show that social mobilisation of neighbourhood support can be substantially inhibited because passive habits establish quicker than prosocial behaviours which require successful social coordination prior to becoming habitual. In contrast, an alternative scenario simulation reveals that a time-limited intervention can provide an enlarged temporal window of opportunity for cooperative habits to stabilise and to persist after the end of the intervention.

AB We studied the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) density on tumor growth dynamics, both on the sub- and the multi-cellular level using our previously developed model. This algorithm simulates the growth of a brain tumor using a multi-scale two-dimensional agent-based approach with an integrated transforming growth factor alpha (TGFL alpha) induced EGFR-gene-protein interaction network. The results confirm that increasing cell receptor density correlates with an acceleration of the tumor system's spatio-temporal expansion dynamics. This multicellular behavior cannot be explained solely on the basis of spatial sub-cellular dynamics, which remain qualitatively similar amongst the three glioma cell lines investigated here in silico. Rather, we find that cells with higher EGFR density show an early increase in the phenotypic switching activity between proliferative and migratory traits, linked to a higher level of initial auto-stimulation by the PLCT-mediated TGF alpha-EGFR autocrine network. This indicates a more active protein level interaction in these chemotactically acting tumor systems and supports the role of post-translational regulation for the implemented EGFR pathway. Implications of these results for experimental cancer research are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a 300 mm integrated circuit (IC) foundry fab, the intrabay automation is more important than a 200 min ones In general, the intrabay automation systems include the automated controls of the process tools, overhead hoist transports (OHTs), stockers, and rail shortcuts. These control systems are operated concurrently. They must be cooperated seamlessly to increase the system performance and to avoid deadlocks. In this paper, the behaviors of the intrabay automation systems are modeled using the distributed agent oriented Petri net (DAOPN). The fab intrabay DAOPN models are categorized into the new-order generation, OHT vehicle dispatching, zone control, path decision, and tool processing agent models. Finally, the DAOPN is defined, and the modeling procedures of the intrabay behaviors are all illustrated. Consequently, an experimental intrabay OHT loop is discussed and evaluated using the proposed DAOPN models and the DAOPN simulator.

AB The paper deals with the use of empirical data in social science agent-based models. Agent-based models are too often viewed just as highly abstract thought experiments conducted in artificial worlds, in which the purpose is to generate and not to test theoretical hypotheses in an empirical way. On the contrary, they should be viewed as models that need to be embedded into empirical data both to allow the calibration and the validation of their findings. As a consequence, the search for strategies to find and extract data from reality, and integrate agent-based models with other traditional empirical social science methods, such as qualitative, quantitative, experimental and participatory methods, becomes a fundamental step of the modelling process. The paper argues that the characteristics of the empirical target matter. According to characteristics of the target, ABMs can be differentiated into case-based models, typifications and theoretical abstractions. These differences pose different challenges for empirical data gathering, and imply the use of different validation strategies.

AB The present paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) system called a state predictor-based RL system in order to solve the explosion of state space and create cooperative behaviors in multiagent systems. The proposed system realizes a predictive function by representing both the present and the next state-action groups with ITPM, an incremental topology map. The proposed system is applied to the pursuit problem, and its performance is evaluated by comparison with the conventional RL method in computer simulations. The experimental results show that the proposed system can appropriately learn in a complex environment which is hardly solved by the conventional RL. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the proposed system can acquire cooperative strategies. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In open railway access markets, a train service provider (TSP) negotiates with an infrastructure provider (IP) for track access rights. This negotiation has been modeled by a multiagent system in which the IP and the TSP are represented by separate software agents. One of the tasks of the IP agent is to generate feasible (and preferably optimal) track access rights, subject to the constraints submitted by the TSP agent. This paper formulates an IP-TSP transaction and proposes a branch-and-bound algorithm for the IP agent to identify the optimal track access rights. Empirical simulation results show that the model is able to emulate rational agent behaviors. The simulation results also show good consistency between the timetables that were attained from the proposed methods and those that were derived by the scheduling principles adopted in practice.

AB A consensus problem consists of a group of dynamic agents who seek to agree upon certain quantities of interest. This problem can be generalized in the context of convex metric spaces that extend the standard notion of convexity. In this paper we introduce and analyze a randomized gossip algorithm for solving the generalized consensus problem on convex metric spaces, where the communication between agents is controlled by a set of Poisson counters. We study the convergence properties of the algorithm using stochastic calculus. In particular, we show that the distances between the states of the agents converge to zero with probability one and in the rth mean sense. In the special case of complete connectivity and uniform Poisson counters, we give upper bounds on the dynamics of the first and second moments of the distances between the states of the agents. In addition, we introduce instances of the generalized consensus algorithm for several examples of convex metric spaces together with numerical simulations.

TI Learning from neighbours
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES

DT Article
AB When payoffs from different actions are unknown, agents use their own past experience as well as the experience of their neighbours to guide their decision making. In this paper, we develop a general framework to study the relationship between the structure of these neighbourhoods and the process of social learning.
   We show that, in a connected society, local learning ensures that all agents obtain the same payoffs in the long run. Thus, if actions have different payoffs, then all agents choose the same action, and social conformism obtains. We develop conditions on the distribution of prior beliefs, the structure of neighbourhoods and the informativeness of actions under which this action is optimal. In particular, we identify a property of neighbourhood structures-local independence-which greatly facilitates social learning. Simulations of the model generate spatial and temporal patterns of adoption that are consistent with empirical work.

AB This introduction attempts to convey a sense of the possible, or near possible, with respect to the cutting edge of computer-based methods supporting social science research and inquiry. In addition, it is also intended to reflect computationally inspired perspectives, metaphors, models, and theories that may affect society. To that end, this article, through the introduction of the authors who contributed to this volume, explores the role played by agency-level computational methods, as opposed to aggregate level, in reshaping the practice and use of social science/inquiry. Agency-focused methods as used in this introduction not only emphasize the action of agents within an artificial environ but also attempt to encompass approaches beyond the cellular automata methods typically associated with agent-based modeling environments.

AB When people express their opinions for an issue, they can express both exact opinions and uncertain opinions, such as numerical interval opinions. Moreover, social network is a crucial medium of opinion interaction and evolution. In this paper, uncertain opinion evolution with bounded confidence effects in social networks is investigated by theoretical demonstration and numerical examples analyses, and experiments simulations analyses. Theoretical results show when all the agents are with uncertainty tolerances, then the ratios of agents expressing uncertain opinions are impossible to decrease, even increase, as time increases; while when all the agents are without uncertainty tolerances, then the ratios of agents expressing uncertain opinions are impossible to increase, even decrease, as time increases. Moreover, the average widths of uncertain opinions are always smaller than the maximum opinion width of all the initial opinions among agents. Experiments simulations results show different ratios of agents with uncertainty tolerances and different ratios of agents expressing uncertain opinions have strong impact on the ratios of the agents expressing the uncertain opinions in the stable state, and the average widths of uncertain opinions in the stable state.

AB This paper addresses the source-seeking problem in which a group of autonomous vehicles must locate and follow the source of some signal based on measurements of the signal strength at different positions. Based on the observation that the gradient of the signal strength can be approximated by a circular formation of agents via a simple weighted average of the signal measured by each agent, we propose a combination of a cooperative control law to stabilize the agents to a circular formation and a distributed consensus-based source-seeking algorithm, which is guaranteed to steer the circular formation toward the vicinity of the source location. In particular, the proposed algorithm is provided with two tunable parameters that allow for a tradeoff between speed of convergence, noise filtering, and formation stability. The benefit of using consensus-based algorithms resides in a more realist discrete time control of the agents and in asynchronous communication resilient to delays, which is particularly relevant for underwater applications. The analytic results are complemented with numerical simulations.

AB Experimental observations in iterated public goods games are explained by a simple but empirically well-grounded model of long-term reinforcement learning. In many experiments, medium levels of cooperation at the beginning decrease with further repetitions. However, in some settings, the actors only slowly learn the individual benefits of defection. In the present model, the decay in cooperation is mitigated by high individual returns, a large group size or stability in the group's composition. Results from agent-based simulations are presented, and the underlying mechanisms are disclosed. The proposed explanation stresses the role of exploratory noise: if multiple actors explore their alternatives simultaneously, the marginal benefit of defection diminishes and cooperation can be sustained.

AB The study of how people acquire and diffuse information among heterogeneous populations has a rich history in the social sciences. However, few approaches have been developed to better understand how information diffusion patterns and processes affect resource management in complex socio-ecological systems. This is a timely issue for crop protection diffusion programs, which have a larger place than ever on the international policy agenda due to the growing number of challenges related to controlling agricultural pests. To assess the impact of heterogeneous farmer behaviors (receptivity toward IPM practices) and types of information diffusion (either active or passive) on the success of integrated pest management (IPM) programs, we developed a socio-ecological model coupling a pest model (population growth and dispersion) with a farmer behavioral model (pest control and diffusion of pest management practices). The main objective of the model was to provide insights to explore effective IPM information diffusion strategies at the farmer community level. Our simulations revealed 1) that passive IPM information diffusion among agents seemed to be more effective to control pests over the community of agents than active diffusion and 2) that increasing levels of agent heterogeneity would significantly slow down pest control dynamics at the community level, but to a lower extent in the case of passive IPM information diffusion. Our findings therefore suggest that IPM diffusion programs should focus their efforts in developing methods to create purposefully the conditions for social learning as a deliberate pest control mechanism, while taking into account potential limitations related to the commonly reported farmer heterogeneity. Our study further stresses the need to develop a comprehensive and empirically based framework for linking the social and ecological disciplines across space and time in agricultural system management. While we specifically focus on pest infestation levels and IPM information diffusion strategies in this study, our approach to understand information diffusion within heterogeneous human populations in interaction with environmental features would be applicable to a much wider range of both social and resource management issues.

AB Algorithms offer a rich, expressive language for modelers of biological and social systems. They lay the grounds for numerical simulations and, crucially, provide a powerful framework for their analysis. The new area of natural algorithms may reprise in the life sciences the role differential equations have long played in the physical sciences. For this to happen, however, an "algorithmic calculus" is needed. We discuss what this program entails in the context of influence systems, a broad family of multiagent models arising in social dynamics.

DE consensus performance region; leader-following consensus; nonlinear
   multiagent systems; randomly switching communication topologies
AB The communication network is usually susceptible to effective communication channel capacity variation and transmission imperfections, which renders the connection among networked agents unstable. Motivated by this fact, we assume that the communication graphs are Markovian randomly switching, because the Markovian chain process is commonly employed to describe the network subject to Rayleigh fading channel. Under such a communication connection assumption, this article investigates the globally Script capital H-infinity leader-following consensus control problem for grouped agents with nonlinear dynamics. Different nonlinear dynamics, including Lur'e and Lorenz-type chaotic systems, are considered. By using the tools from the robust control theory, the conditions guaranteeing the globally Script capital H-infinity leader-following consensus are derived. Under such conditions, consensus control protocols can be designed solely based on the relative state information transmitted over the communication network, by solving some linear matrix inequalities. Then, we characterize the robustness of the controlled systems against the variation of the communication graphs with the globally Script capital H-infinity leader-following consensus performance region. It is theoretically shown that the networked nonlinear systems under the proposed controller yield unbounded and connected robust performance regions. Finally, the theoretical results are verified by conducting numerical simulations on networks consisting of Chua's oscillators and Lu systems.

AB Deterioration of reinforced concrete structures has been a subject of interest for the researchers, practicing engineers, and decision makers who work on the reliability assessment and safety evaluation of civil infrastructure systems. Over the last two decades, several studies have approached this subject and developed numerical and experimental methods to quantify the extent of deterioration over time. The studies completed to date, however, lack the comprehensive probabilistic approach needed to consider the uncertainties involved in the deterioration of structural components during their service life. To address this issue, the current study develops a computational framework that examines the time-dependent effects of multiple environmental stressors on the integrity of structural components. This framework takes into account the mutual interactions of all exposure factors and provides a reliable estimate of the extent of penetration of deteriorating agents into concrete. Given the capabilities of this framework, the scope of this investigation is extended to incorporate various sources of uncertainty into the predictive models. For this purpose, the most influential parameters that represent material properties, geometric characteristics, exposure conditions, and limit state criteria are considered as random variables and their corresponding probability distributions are identified. Multidimensional Gaussian and non-Gaussian stochastic fields are generated to evaluate the spatial variation of each of these parameters. The generated fields are introduced to the computational framework and the probabilistic measures of the vulnerability of structural components to the attack of deteriorating agents are presented.

AB Theoretical and experimental studies from psychological and behavioral sciences show that heuristics and social networks play an important role in decision-making under risk. The goal of this paper is to investigate the effects of empirical social networks and different behavioral rules on farmers' irrigation adoption under drought risk and its impacts on several macroeconomic indicators such as the rate of adaptation, water demand and regional agricultural income. We present an application of a spatial economic ABM which is able to simulate the effect of droughts on crop production, farm income and farm decision-making. The agents' population is parameterized using survey data, including data on social networks. Four experiments are conducted combining two climate scenarios with two behavioral scenarios (maximizers vs. heuristic-based agents). The results show that the adoption process follows a different path in the scenario with heuristic-based farmers. The adoption of irrigation is slower in the short run due to reliance on information from social networks and farmers' uncertainty regarding drought events. This results in agricultural income loss and a lower water demand in the short run compared to the scenario with maximizing agents.

AB In prior research, a statistically cheap method was developed to monitor transportation network performance by using only a few groups of agents without having to forecast the population flows. The current study validates this multiagent inverse optimization (MAIO) method using taxi GPS trajectory data from the city of Wuhan, China. Using a controlled 2,062-link network environment and different GPS data processing algorithms, an online monitoring environment was simulated using real data over a 4-h period. Results show that using samples from only one origin-destination (OD) pair, the MAIO method can learn network parameters such that forecasted travel times have a 0.23 correlation with the observed travel times. By increasing the monitoring from just two OD pairs, the correlation improved further, to 0.56.

AB In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the evolution of behavior may be better understood as the evolution of the learning mechanisms that produce it, and that such mechanisms should be modeled and tested explicitly. However, this approach, which has recently been applied to animal foraging and decision-making, has rarely been applied to the social and communicative behaviors that are likely to operate in complex social environments and be subject to multi-level selection. Here we use genetic, agent-based evolutionary simulations to explore how learning mechanisms may evolve to adjust the level of nestling begging (offspring signaling of need), and to examine the possible consequences of this process for parent offspring conflict and communication. In doing so, we also provide the first step-by-step dynamic model of parent offspring communication. The results confirm several previous theoretical predictions and demonstrate three novel phenomena. First, negatively frequency-dependent group-level selection can generate a stable polymorphism of learning strategies and parental responses. Second, while conventional reinforcement learning models fail to cope successfully with family dynamics at the nest, a newly developed learning model (incorporating behaviors that are consistent with recent experimental results on learning in nestling begging) produced effective learning, which evolved successfully. Third, while kin-selection affects the frequency of the different learning genes, its impact on begging slope and intensity was unexpectedly negligible, demonstrating that evolution is a complex process, and showing that the effect of kin-selection on behaviors that are shaped by learning may not be predicted by simple application of Hamilton's rule.

ID JUDGMENT; DEMOCRACY; ACCURACY; ABILITY; ADVICE; BIAS
AB The advantages of groups over individuals in complex decision-making have long interested scientists across disciplinary divisions. Averaging over a collection of individual judgments proves a reliable strategy for aggregating information, particularly in diverse groups in which statistically independent beliefs fall on both sides of the truth and contradictory biases are cancelled out. Social influence, some have said, narrows variation in individual opinions and undermines this wisdom-of-crowds effect in continuous estimation tasks. Researchers, however, neglected to study social-influence effects on voting in discrete choice tasks. Using agent-based simulation, we show that under voting - the most widespread social decision rule - social influence contributes to information aggregation and thus strengthens collective judgment. Adding to our knowledge about complex systems comprised of adaptive agents, this finding has important ramifications for the design of collective decision-making in both public administration and private firms.

Moreover, weights are assigned to reinforce convergence under super high-speed circumstances. Convergence performance is assessed via group polarization, convergence ratio and convergent time. As verified by numerical experiments, superior high-speed performance and fast convergence are achieved simultaneously in the improved adaptive-velocity model. The weighted adaptive model prominently improved super high-speed performance with short convergent time and low energy consumption. Then, the parameter space of the weighted adaptive flocking model is investigated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   AFFORDANCES; PERFORMANCE; MOVEMENT; FOOTBALL; GAMES; KNOWLEDGE
AB Similar to other complex systems in nature (e.g., a hunting pack, flocks of birds), sports teams have been modeled as social neurobiological systems in which interpersonal coordination tendencies of agents underpin team swarming behaviors. Swarming is seen as the result of agent co-adaptation to ecological constraints of performance environments by collectively perceiving specific possibilities for action (affordances for self and shared affordances). A major principle of invasion team sports assumed to promote effective performance is to outnumber the opposition (creation of numerical overloads) during different performance phases (attack and defense) in spatial regions adjacent to the ball. Such performance principles are assimilated by system agents through manipulation of numerical relations between teams during training in order to create artificially asymmetrical performance contexts to simulate overloaded and underloaded situations. Here we evaluated effects of different numerical relations differentiated by agent skill level, examining emergent inter-individual, intra-and inter-team coordination. Groups of association football players (national - NLP and regional-level - RLP) participated in small-sided and conditioned games in which numerical relations between system agents were manipulated (5v5, 5v4 and 5v3). Typical grouping tendencies in sports teams (major ranges, stretch indices, distances of team centers to goals and distances between the teams' opposing line-forces in specific team sectors) were recorded by plotting positional coordinates of individual agents through continuous GPS tracking. Results showed that creation of numerical asymmetries during training constrained agents' individual dominant regions, the underloaded teams' compactness and each team's relative position on-field, as well as distances between specific team sectors. We also observed how skill level impacted individual and team coordination tendencies. Data revealed emergence of co-adaptive behaviors between interacting neurobiological social system agents in the context of sport performance. Such observations have broader implications for training design involving manipulations of numerical relations between interacting members of social collectives.

ID STRATEGIES; AGENT
AB We model and analyze a guiding problem, where the drivers try to steer the evaders' positions toward a target region while the evaders always try to escape from drivers. This problem is motivated by the guidance-by-repulsion model [R. Escobedo, A. Ibanez and E. Zuazua, Optimal strategies for driving a mobile agent in a "guidance by repulsion" model, Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul. 39 (2016) 58-72] where the authors answer how to control the evader's position and what is the optimal maneuver of the driver. First, we analyze well posedness and behavior of the one-driver and one-evader model, assuming of the same friction coefficients. From the long-time behavior, the exact controllability is proved in a long enough time horizon. Then, we extend the model to the multi-driver and multi-evader case. We assumed three interaction rules in the context of collective behavior models: flocking between evaders, collision avoidance between drivers and repulsive forces between drivers and evaders. These interactions depend on the relative distances, and each agent is assumed to be undistinguishable and obtained an averaged effect from the other individuals. In this model, we develop numerical simulations to systematically explore the nature of controlled dynamics in various scenarios. The optimal strategies turn out. to share a common pattern to the one-driver and one-evader case: the drivers rapidly occupy the position behind the target, and want to pursuit evaders in a straight line for most of the time. Inspired by this, we build a feedback strategy which stabilizes the direction of evaders.

AB Artificial neural networks (ANN) are biologically inspired computer programs designed to simulate the way in which the human brain processes the information. In the past few years, coupling of experimental design (ED) and ANN became useful tool in the method optimization. This paper presents the application of ED-ANN in analysis of chromatographic behavior of indinavir and its degradation products. According to preliminary study, full factorial design 2(4) was chosen to set input variables for network training. Experimental data (inputs) and results for retention factors from experiments (outputs) were used to train the ANN with aim to define correlation among variables. For networks training multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with back propagation (BP) algorithm was used. Network with the lowest root mean square (RMS) had 4-8-3 topology. Predicted data were in good agreement with experimental data (correlation was higher than 0.9713 for training set). Regression statistics confirmed good ability of trained network to predict compounds retention. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Living in a large social group is thought to increase disease risk in wild animal populations, but comparative studies have provided mixed support for this prediction. Here, we take a social network perspective to investigate whether patterns of social contact within groups influence parasite risk. Specifically, increased modularity (i.e. sub-grouping) in larger groups could offset the increased disease risk associated with living in a large group. We simulated the spread of a contagious pathogen in random social networks to generate theoretically grounded predictions concerning the relationship between social network connectivity and the success of socially transmitted pathogens. Simulations yielded the prediction that community modularity (Q) negatively impacts parasite success. No clear predictions emerged for a second network metric we considered, the eigenvector centralization index (C), as the relationship between this measure and parasite success depended on the transmission probability of parasites. We then tested the prediction that Q reduces parasite success in a phylogenetic comparative analysis of social network modularity and parasite richness across 19 primate species. Using a Bayesian implementation of phylogenetic generalized least squares and controlling for sampling effort, we found that primates living in larger groups exhibited higher Q, and as predicted by our simulations, higher Q was associated with lower richness of socially transmitted parasites. This suggests that increased modularity mediates the elevated risk of parasitism associated with living in larger groups, which could contribute to the inconsistent findings of empirical studies on the association between group size and parasite risk. Our results indicate that social networks may play a role in mediating pressure from socially transmitted parasites, particularly in large groups where opportunities for transmitting communicable diseases are abundant. We propose that parasite pressure in gregarious primates may have favored the evolution of behaviors that increase social network modularity, especially in large social groups.

AB Background: There has been a growing interest of pharmacophore hybridization in anticancer drug discovery that may be utilized for designing new potential lead candidates against multiple targets that may exhibit synergetic activity. Pyrazole and 1,2,3-triazole nucleus are amongst the most important ones.
   Method: Statistically validated 3D-QSAR models of the pyrazolo-triazole hybrids on 4 different types of human cancer cell lines (U87MG, PC-3, HT-29 and A549) are constructed through simulated annealing k-Nearest neighbor molecular field analysis (SA-kNN-MFA) method followed by robust molecular docking study, druggability assessment and in silico ADMET analysis.
   Results: 3D-QSAR study reveales the importance of electronegative group at R-1 position and 3,4-OCH3 substituent at R-2 position that may enhance biological potency against these cancer cell lines. The docking analysis suggests that the pyrazolo-triazole hybrids may have better binding affinities compared to the redocked co-crystallized ligand for targets namely CDK-2, CDK-5, FTase, HSP-90, TGF-beta, topoisomerase-I and tubulin. Moreover, these compounds show better ADMET profile than the standard drug 5-fluorouracil.
   Conclusion: The results of molecular docking, druggability and ADMET analysis may focus the utility of targeting these possible potential enzymes for developing newer pyrazolo-triazoles as multi-targeted anticancer agents.

AB In emergency situation, mass panic often causes more causalities than the disaster itself. The crowd emotional model could be used to simulate how crowd behavior in emergency scenarios and be helpful for developing crowd evacuation plans in emergency situations. However, existing crowd emotional models usually set model parameters in an empirical manner and are not validated by real cases. In this paper, a crowd emotional model is proposed to simulate the crowd movement in outdoor emergency situations. First of all, the crowd entropy and the movement difference are proposed to describe the emotional impact of the crowd scene on the agents. The perception of vision and hearing are considered, and the calculation formulas of the agent's emotional intensity and crowd emotional contagion are proposed. By calculating individual trajectories in the real video, the cumulative differences between the movements of the real crowd and the corresponding virtual crowd are analyzed. At last, a multi-parameter optimization method is implemented by the differential evolution algorithm. To verify the parameters in models, three videos which are generated from three real cases, including explosion attack, shooting incident, and crowd disturbance are selected for experimental verification. The results showed that the proposed model could be a feasible method for optimizing parameters to simulate the emergency scenario.

AB This paper presents a three-dimensional and compressible biological cell model based on discrete element method using multiple interacting agent that represent cellular structures within a simulated environment. The cytoplasm and nucleoplasm fluid behavior in the cell is time dependent. When taking this approach, it is important to calibrate protoplasmic flow behaviors through simulation techniques such as compressing the cell and examining the agents representing the cell cytoplasm seeping between the ones representing the confining cell membrane. This type of modelling may motivate future work on simulating simultaneous operations and interactions of multiple cellular agents in an attempt to re-create and predict the appearance of complex phenomena such as protoplasmic seepage that is caused by the force actuations of neighboring cells. Seepage occurs when a cytoplasm agent passes between three membrane particles connected in a triangular network. Based on the force-deformation response of spheres having variable size and stiffness, semi-analytic expressions are developed for the force required to cause seepage and solved numerically to find the maximum resistance offered by the membrane against cytoplasm seepage. The equations are based on force equilibrium and the constitutive relations for particle contact and membrane stiffness. In multi-particle representations of an individual cell undergoing deformation, different modes of cytoplasm seepage through confining cell membranes can occur. This can be avoided if simple criteria are satisfied. These findings can lead to certain fundamental laws for the improvement of novel cell-to-organ simulation techniques based on discrete element method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Biomass tar as a byproduct during the gasification process can lead to many problems, such as condensation and subsequent plugging downstream. However, the knowledge of the correlations between the tar formation and conversion and the gas-solid hydrodynamics in fluidized bed gasifiers (FBGs) is still limited compared to other aspects of biomass gasification. In this study, a three-dimensional comprehensive model that simultaneously coupled the detailed tar kinetics and the homo- and heterogeneous kinetics with the multi-phase particle-in-cell hydrodynamics was constructed for a biomass FBG. Numerical predictions were in very good agreement with experimental data. The influences of the oxygen concentration in the gasifying agent and the biomass particle size distributions on the gasification process were investigated using the comprehensive model. Numerical findings indicated that a high oxygen concentration of the gasifying agent reduces the nitrogen dilute effects and increases the gasification temperature, giving rise to a low tar yield and high gasification efficiency. A small particle size enhances the releasing and diffusing rates of volatiles from biomass particles, resulting in a low tar yield and high gas yield and gasification efficiency. It is believed that the comprehensive model can assist to explore the tar formation and conversion behaviors on the particle scale for the biomass gasification process.

AB Prior studies on opinion modeling focus on nonlinear physics or statistical physics methods, or simulating the opinion interaction merely by the principle of the minority being subordinate to the majority, which falls short on theoretically illustrating how the opinion interaction is affect by multiple factors relevant to both parties. This paper is motivated to propose an agent-based online opinion formation model based on attitude change theory, group behavior theory and evolutionary game theory in the perspective of sociology and psychology. In this model, there are three factors influencing the persuasion process, including credibility of the leaders, characteristic of the recipient, and situation. The proposed model is applied to Twitter to analyze the influence of topic type, parameter changing, and opinion leaders on opinion formation. Experimental results show that the opinion formation of controversial topic shows greater uncertainty and sustainability. The ratio of game benefit to cost has a significant impact on opinion formation and a moderate ratio will result in the longest relaxation time or most unified global opinions. Furthermore, celebrities with a large amount of followers are more capable of influencing public opinion than experts. This paper enriches the researches on opinion formation modeling, and the results provide managerial insights for business on public relations and market prediction. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this paper, the bipartite consensus problem of heterogeneous multiagent systems composed of first-order and second-order agents is considered by utilizing the event-triggered control scheme. Under structurally balanced directed topology, event-triggered bipartite consensus protocol is put forward, and event-triggering functions consisting of measurement error and threshold are designed. To exclude Zeno behavior, an exponential function is introduced in the threshold. The bipartite consensus problem is transformed into the corresponding stability problem by means of gauge transformation and model transformation. By virtue of Lyapunov method, sufficient conditions for systems without input delay are obtained to guarantee bipartite consensus. Furthermore, for the case with input delay, sufficient conditions which include an admissible upper bound of the delay are obtained to guarantee bipartite consensus. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained theoretical results.

AB We propose a new model of opinion formation, the Opinion Changing Rate (OCR) model. Instead of investigating the conditions that allow consensus in a world of agents with different opinions, we study the conditions under which a group of agents with different natural tendency (rate) to change opinion can find agreement. The OCR is a modified version of the Kuramoto model, one of the simplest models for synchronization in biological systems, adapted here to a social context. By means of several numerical simulations, we illustrate the richness of the OCR model dynamics and its social implications.

ID AGENT-BASED MODELS; COLLECTIVE RATIONALITY; EVOLUTION; CHOICE
AB This paper presents an agent-based model of team reasoning in a social dilemma game. Starting from the conundrum of empirically high levels of cooperation in dilemma games, contradicting traditional utility maximisation assumptions of game theory, Bacharach (1999, 2006) developed a theory of team reasoning. The idea behind team reasoning is that agents do not try to maximise their own utility but make choices as part of a team. This paper presents a model of preference convergence, mirroring adaptation dynamics of team reasoning. It describes an agent-based model simulating a repeated public goods game between a designated set of agents, a team. In the model agents have a probability to choose cooperation or defection, adjusting this preferences in the face of the revealed preferences of other players. The model is a classic binary choice model mapping an individual's preference for cooperation onto the binary behaviour choice of cooperation and defection. Preferences are updated in reaction to the behaviour choices of the team. Starting from simple stated preferences, the model implements a reframing of utility maximisation as applying to a group rather than an individual, modelling the importance of social interaction for individual preferences and the dependency of choice on social context. Results show that team reasoning, as implemented here, can explain high levels of cooperation found in the real world resulting from a wide range of settings. It also shows that team reasoning, as implemented here, is not a 'sucker' strategy except when adaptation rates are very slow. This paper demonstrates how agent-based models can be used to examine the role of social contexts for individual decision making.

AB Although rapid social change reflects each society's unique combination of myriad social, historical, political, and economic factors, we argue that the defining features of such change can be understood with recourse to the dynamic processes inherent in complex systems. Accordingly, we present a formal model that describes, in minimalist terms, the dynamics associated with rapid societal transitions in a society's norms and attitudes-and to the potential for rapid reversals of these transitions. The model predicts that societies in the midst of rapid change are characterized by dual realities corresponding to the new and the old, so that models focusing only on changes in the central tendency of a societal attitude provide a misleading account of rapid social change. This model is implemented in computer simulations and validated with empirical data concerning the transition in Eastern Europe from communism to democracy and a free market economy in the late 1980s.

AB Animals have evolved complex foraging strategies to obtain a nutritionally balanced diet and associated fitness benefits. Recent research combining state-space models of nutritional geometry with agent-based models (ABMs), show how nutrient targeted foraging behavior can also influence animal social interactions, ultimately affecting collective dynamics and group structures. Here we demonstrate how social network analyses can be integrated into such a modeling framework and provide a practical analytical tool to compare experimental results with theory. We illustrate our approach by examining the case of nutritionally mediated dominance hierarchies. First we show how nutritionally explicit ABMs that simulate the emergence of dominance hierarchies can be used to generate social networks. Importantly the structural properties of our simulated networks bear similarities to dominance networks of real animals (where conflicts are not always directly related to nutrition). Finally, we demonstrate how metrics from social network analyses can be used to predict the fitness of agents in these simulated competitive environments. Our results highlight the potential importance of nutritional mechanisms in shaping dominance interactions in a wide range of social and ecological contexts. Nutrition likely influences social interactions in many species, and yet a theoretical framework for exploring these effects is currently lacking. Combining social network analyses with computational models from nutritional ecology may bridge this divide, representing a pragmatic approach for generating theoretical predictions for nutritional experiments.

ID GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; HUMAN UROTHELIAL CELLS; IN-VITRO; G1 PHASE;
   PROLIFERATION; AUTOCRINE; ADHESION; PROTEIN; DIFFERENTIATION; ACTIVATION
AB Background: Most mathematical models of biochemical pathways consider either signalling events that take place within a single cell in isolation, or an 'average' cell which is considered to be representative of a cell population. Likewise, experimental measurements are often averaged over populations consisting of hundreds of thousands of cells. This approach ignores the fact that even within a genetically-homogeneous population, local conditions may influence cell signalling and result in phenotypic heterogeneity.
   We have developed a multi-scale computational model that accounts for emergent heterogeneity arising from the influences of intercellular signalling on individual cells within a population. Our approach was to develop an ODE model of juxtacrine EGFR-ligand activation of the MAPK intracellular pathway and to couple this to an agent-based representation of individual cells in an expanding epithelial cell culture population. This multi-scale, multi-paradigm approach has enabled us to simulate Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) activation in a population of cells and to examine the consequences of interpretation at a single cell or population-based level using virtual assays.
   Results: A model consisting of a single pair of interacting agents predicted very different Erk activation (phosphorylation) profiles, depending on the formation rate and stability of intercellular contacts, with the slow formation of stable contacts resulting in low but sustained activation of Erk, and transient contacts resulting in a transient Erk signal. Extension of this model to a population consisting of hundreds to thousands of interacting virtual cells revealed that the activated Erk profile measured across the entire cell population was very different and may appear to contradict individual cell findings, reflecting heterogeneity in population density across the culture. This prediction was supported by immunolabelling of an epithelial cell population grown in vitro, which confirmed heterogeneity of Erk activation.
   Conclusion: These results illustrate that mean experimental data obtained from analysing entire cell populations is an oversimplification, and should not be extrapolated to deduce the signal: response paradigm of individual cells. This multi-scale, multi-paradigm approach to biological simulation provides an important conceptual tool in addressing how information may be integrated over multiple scales to predict the behaviour of a biological system.

AB This paper investigates the adaptive group consensus of networked Euler-Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainties under directed topology graph. A novel decomposition approach is developed by using both algebraic graph theory and matrix theory. Three distributed adaptive group consensus protocols are proposed for the cases of topology graphs with acyclic partition and balanced couple, respectively. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for solving group consensus problems are established. It is shown that for the case of directed acyclic graphs, the group consensus can always be guaranteed by the structure of acyclic interaction topology. In particular, an explicit expression of group consensus states can be obtained using the proposed integral protocol, which can be used to develop a unified approach yielding the desired group consensus. For the case of directed balanced couple graphs, a simple algebraic criterion for ensuring group consensus is presented in terms of the eigenvalue computation of Laplacian matrix and thus can be easily applied in practice. Finally, numerical simulations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodologies.

AB The dynamic behavior of complex adaptive spatial systems is driven by interactions that occur among system components. The proper representation of individual-individual and individual-environment interaction in agent-based simulations of such systems is, therefore, of paramount importance to model design. In this article we develop and implement a context-driven, agent-based modeling approach that supports the explicit representation of situation-dependent information for decision making within dynamic spatial environments. This context-driven approach is characterized by the identification of primitive contextual elements, the organization of such elements into context patterns, and contextualized learning. We synthesize two existing frameworks for the representation of spatiotemporal context and extend them to include higher level constructs and feedback mechanisms needed for learning and adaptation. Contextualized information is organized, analyzed, and used by agents to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. Dynamically changing information relevant to the decision-making processes of agents is captured in this approach and used to drive spatiotemporal learning in agents. We examine the utility of this context-driven approach via an agent-based model of elk movement. Elk in this model are represented as contextually aware intelligent agents that learn optimal movement patterns and adapt to heterogeneous landscape dynamics. The internal and external stimuli received by elk during migration are incorporated into the representation of agent context. The context-driven approach, as experimental results indicate, provides solid support for the representation of individual-centric interactions within complex adaptive spatial systems.

AB Understanding the relationships between seasonal social networks and diversity in artifact styles, is crucial for examining the production and reproduction of knowledge among complex foraging societies such as those of the Pacific Northwest Coast. This agent-based model examines the impact of seasonal aggregation, dispersion, and learning opportunities on the richness and evenness of artifact styles under random social learning (unbiased transmission). The results of these simulations suggest that the relationship between learning opportunities and innovation rate has more impact on artifact style richness and evenness than seasonal social networks. Seasonal aggregation does appear to result in a higher amount of one-off rare variants, but this effect is not statistically significant. Overall, the restriction of learning opportunities appears more crucial in patterning cultural diversity among complex foragers than the potential impacts from individuals drawing on different seasonal social networks.

A process model of dyadic social influence is built on top of a dynamic model of status and task participation that describes the emergence of a stable power and prestige order. Two models of group decision-making are examined: a static model for which the beliefs of actors do not change, and a process model for which they do as a function of the standing of each member of each interacting pair in the evolving power and prestige order. The models are compared on a set of N=111 cases, each requiring an affirmative or negative group response to a proposition A( c) that pertains to a case c. Initial beliefs are assigned to each of five members of distinct professions based on an analysis of independently collected behavioral data pertinent to the proposition to be affirmed or denied in each case. Although the two influence models yield identical decisions in 70% of the cases examined, the differences between them are statistically significant and in several

AB Cooperation declines in repeated public good games because individuals behave as conditional cooperators. This is because individuals imitate the social behaviour of successful individuals when their payoff information is available. However, in human societies, individuals cooperate in many situations involving social dilemmas. We hypothesize that humans are sensitive to both success (payoffs) and how that success was obtained, by cheating (not socially sanctioned) or good behaviour (socially sanctioned and adds to prestige or reputation), when information is available about payoffs and prestige. We propose and model a repeated public good game with heterogeneous conditional cooperators where an agent's donation in a public goods game depends on comparing the number of donations in the population in the previous round and with the agent's arbitrary chosen conditional cooperative criterion. Such individuals imitate the social behaviour of role models based on their payoffs and prestige. The dependence is modelled by two population-level parameters: affinity towards payoff and affinity towards prestige. These affinities influence the degree to which agents value the payoff and prestige of role models. Agents update their conditional strategies by considering both parameters. The simulations in this study show that high levels of cooperation are established in a population consisting of heterogeneous conditional cooperators for a certain range of affinity parameters in repeated public good games. The results show that social value (prestige) is important in establishing cooperation.

AB Animals living in groups compete for food resources and face food conflicts. These conflicts are affected by social factors (e.g. competition level) and behavioural strategies (e.g. avoidance). This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the complex interactions between social factors and behavioural strategies affecting feeding and social interaction patterns in animals. We focused on group-housed growing pigs, Sus scrofa, which typically face conflicts around the feeder, and of which patterns in various competitive environments (i.e. pig:feeder ratio) have been documented soundly. An agent-based model was developed to explore how interactions among social factors and behavioural strategies can affect various feeding and social interaction patterns differently under competitive situations. Model results show that pig and diet characteristics interact with group size and affect daily feeding patterns (e.g. feed intake and feeding time) and conflicts around the feeder. The level of competition can cause a turning point in feeding and social interaction patterns. Beyond a certain point of competition, meal-based (e.g. meal frequency) and social interaction patterns (e.g. displacements) are determined mainly by behavioural strategies. The average daily feeding time can be used to predict the group size at which this turning point occurs. Under the model's assumptions, social facilitation was relatively unimportant in the causation of behavioural patterns in pigs. To validate our model, simulated patterns were compared with empirical patterns in conventionally housed pigs. Similarities between empirical and model patterns support the model results. Our model can be used as a tool in further research for studying the effects of social factors and group dynamics on individual variation in feeding and social interaction patterns in pigs, as well as in other animal species.

ID ECONOMICS; EVOLUTION
AB Agent-based simulations and human-subject experiments explore the emergence of respect for property in a specialization and exchange economy with costless theft. Software agents, driven by reciprocity and hill-climbing heuristics and parameterized to replicate humans when property is exogenously protected, are employed to predict human behavior when property can be freely appropriated. Agents do not predict human behavior in a new set of experiments because subjects innovate, constructing a property convention of "mutual taking" in 5 out of the 6 experimental sessions that allows exchange to crowd out theft. When the same convention is made available to agents, they adopt it and again replicate human behavior. Property emerges as a social convention that exploits the capacity for reciprocity to sustain trade.

AB This article considers the rendezvous problem of a group of heterogeneous second-order agents subject to information transmission delays. A major challenge to construct a fully distributed rendezvous protocol is to deal with these delays, which are assumed to be nonuniform and time-varying. Inspired by the fact that a large enough damping coefficient can improve the robustness of a second-order agent against external disturbance, we overcome the above challenge by studying the impact of the damping coefficient on the rendezvous problem. To theoretically analyze the impact, one type of static rendezvous protocol is first proposed and employed. It is interesting to find that agents can reach rendezvous under the static protocol if the damping coefficient is large enough, even though the duration of the time-delay is uncertain. This fact indicates that a large damping coefficient can make the static protocol be robust to the uncertainty of time-delay, which is consistent with the common sense. Then, we apply this impact to deal with the uncertainty introduced by the nonuniform time-varying information delays. To fully apply this impact, we adopt an adaptive approach to making the damping coefficient automatically adapt with the changes of the time-delay. Hence, two classes of fully distributed and adaptive rendezvous protocols are designed, which do not need the global information of the entire communication graph or the value of these time-delays at all. The difference between two classes of protocols is whether it can realize low-frequency learning or not. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed on multiple robots to illustrate the analytical results.

AB Agent-based models, perhaps more than other models, feature large numbers of parameters and potentially generate vast quantities of results data. This paper shows through the FEARLUS-G project (an ESRC e-Social Science Initiative Pilot Demonstrator Project) how deploying an agent-based model on the Semantic Grid facilitates international collaboration on investigations using such a model, and contributes to establishing rigorous working practices with agent-based models as part of good science in social simulation. The experimental workflow is described explicitly using an ontology, and a Semantic Grid service with a web interface implements the workflow. Users are able to compare their parameter settings and results, and relate their work with the model to wider scientific debate.

AB Friendship formation between a pair of individuals (dyads) and its dynamics is a complex phenomenon that has been extensively studied in the literature. Assortative, relational, and proximity mechanisms are the recognized social processes that are responsible for the formation of these dyadic ties. In this paper, we develop an agent-based model that derives its essence from social processes, fuzzy game theory, and social network analysis. The process of dyadic friendship formation depends on the agent's (participant's) spatial configuration, attributes affecting friendship, and interaction with other agents. To model these interactions, we use fuzzy iterated prisoner's dilemma (Fuzzy-IPD) utilizing the decision factors contributing to similar social processes. These strategies have been independently discussed in previously published studies. We, however, use them in combination to design a descriptive model with different experimental settings in an ad-hoc simulation framework. Using an integrationist approach, we blend multiple individual components of friendship formation to construct a comprehensive model. The analysis of the model thus developed reveals a possible interaction pattern responsible for the evolution of the layered associations. This paper further validates various levels of friendship ties (strong ties, medium ties, and weak ties) in social networks as reported in the published sociological studies.

AB In human societies, opinion formation is mediated by social interactions, consequently taking place on a network of relationships and at the same time influencing the structure of the network and its evolution. To investigate this coevolution of opinions and social interaction structure, we develop a dynamic agent-based network model by taking into account short range interactions like discussions between individuals, long range interactions like a sense for overall mood modulated by the attitudes of individuals, and external field corresponding to outside influence. Moreover, individual biases can be naturally taken into account. In addition, the model includes the opinion-dependent link-rewiring scheme to describe network topology coevolution with a slower time scale than that of the opinion formation. With this model, comprehensive numerical simulations and mean field calculations have been carried out and they show the importance of the separation between fast and slow time scales resulting in the network to organize as well-connected small communities of agents with the same opinion.

AB gent-based models are versatile tools for studying how societal opinion change, including political polarization and cultural diffusion, emerges from individual behavior. This study expands agents' psychological realism using empirically-motivated rules governing interpersonal influence, commitment to previous beliefs, and conformity in social contexts. Computational experiments establish that these extensions produce three novel results: (a) sustained "strong" diversity of opinions within the population, (b) opinion subcultures, and (c) pluralistic ignorance. These phenomena arise from a combination of agents' intolerance, susceptibility and conformity, with extremist agents and social networks playing important roles. The distribution and dynamics of simulated opinions reproduce two empirical datasets on Americans' political opinions.

AB The emergence of complex society is a milestone in the history of human society evolution. China is one of the few regions in the world where the earliest complex society appeared; however, its driving mechanisms remain unresolved. On the base of available evidence from both archaeology and Holocene climate, in combination with agency theory, this study attempts to address the driving mechanisms for the simultaneous emergence of complex societies in multiple areas of China around 5.5 cal ka BP. It is hypothesized that three factors, including climate change, population growth, and circumscription, jointly act and cause regional population-resource imbalance and trigger inter-group conflicts and wars. Such competitions provide the opportunity for some power-pursuing agents to break the restriction of social leveling mechanism and to become the centralized decision-making leaders, which further lead to the emergence of incipient large-scale complex societies. Increase in extreme climate events during 6.0-5.0 cal ka BP cooling period causes frequent occurrence of resource stress and increase in the frequency of inter-group competitions, which creates conditions for the legitimation, institutionalization, and persistence of centralized leadership, and finally leads to the formation of persistent institutionalized inequity. Our research result can explain not only the process and mechanism of complex society formation, but also two phenomena which cannot be reasonably explained by previous theories, that are, why the earliest complex societies in China emerge around 5.5 cal ka BP, and why they appear simultaneously in multiple regions.

AB Using stopping boundaries developed for group sequential trials, we control the overall type 1 error for a series of tests that evaluate the treatment effect of an experimental agent in each of several predefined marker subgroups. We then go on to present a procedure based on these group sequential stopping boundaries that provides strong control of type 1 error for testing a series of hypothesis regarding the treatment effect over a range of marker expression. Finally this use of group sequential procedures to control the type 1 error in biomarker subset testing will be compared with some other benchmark procedures in a simulation.

AB This paper addresses the emergence of a common phonetic code in a society of communicating speech agents using evolutionary techniques. Predictions for the large vowel systems of the world's languages using the Maximum Use of Available distinctive Features (MUAF) principle are discussed. Simulations of the use of supplementary phonetic features in large vowel systems axe presented. These experimental results show how simple local rules of interaction between speaking agents are sufficient to explain some of the universal characteristics of the phonological structure of the world's languages.

AB The individual behavior model is a contributory factor to improve the accuracy of agent based simulation in different scenarios. However, few studies have considered moving threat agents, which often occur in terrorist attacks caused by attackers with close range weapons (e.g., sword, stick). At the same time, many existing behavior models lack validation from cases or experiments. This paper builds a new individual behavior model based on seven behavioral hypotheses. The driving-forces model is an extension of the classical social force model considering scenarios including moving threat agents. An experiment was conducted to validate the key components of the model. Then the model is compared with an advanced Elliptical Specification II social force model, by calculating the fitting errors between the simulated and experimental trajectories, and being applied to simulate a specific circumstance. Our results show that the driving-forces model reduced the fitting error by an average of 33.9% and the standard deviation by an average of 44.5%, which indicates the accuracy and stability of the model in the studied situation. The new driving-forces model could be used to simulate individual behavior when analyzing the risk of specific scenarios using agent-based simulation methods, such as risk analysis of close-range terrorist attacks in public places.

AB Long duration historical studies have been formative in shaping comparative analysis. Yet historical processes are notoriously difficult to study, and their findings equally difficult to validate empirically. In this paper, I take Robert Putnam's work on Civic Traditions in Modem Italy and attempt to bridge the gap between the study's historical starting point and contemporary observations, using an agent-based model of social interaction. My use of a computational model to study historical processes - in this case the inculcation and spread of social capital - supports Putnam's claim of path dependence. Moving beyond Putnam's study, my results indicate that the formation of civic (or uncivic) communities is not deterministic, that their emergence is sensitive to historical shocks, and that the absence of political boundaries lowers aggregate levels of civicness in regions characterized by effective institutions. In addition, the simulation suggests that minor improvement to ineffective institutions - making them moderately effective - constitute a mid-level equilibrium trap with the least desirable social consequences.

AB The Tokyo Virtual Living Lab is an experimental space based on 3D Internet technology that lets researchers conduct controlled driving and travel studies, including those involving multiple users in the same shared space. This shared-use feature is crucial for analyzing interactive driving behaviors in future smart cities. The lab's novelty is two-fold: it outputs a semantically enriched graphical navigation network using free map data as input, and it includes a navigation segment agent that coordinates a multiagent traffic simulator. This simulator, which is based on the navigation network, supports the integration of user-controlled vehicles.

AB Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging is sensitive to dilute labile proton and microenvironment properties such as pH and temperature, and provides vital information complementary to the conventional MRI methods. Whereas the Bloch equations coupled by exchange terms (i.e., Bloch-McConnell equations) have been utilized to quantify 2-pool CEST contrast, it is tedious to extend the Bloch-McConnell equations to describe CEST contrast beyond four saturation transfer sites. Hence, it is necessary to develop a scalable yet reasonably accurate numerical solution to describe the complex multi-pool CEST contrast. It is postulated here that the multi-pool CEST contrast can be quantified by modifying the classic 2-pool model. Although the direct exchange among labile proton groups is often negligible, labile protons may be coupled indirectly through their interaction with bulk water protons, which has to be quantified. The coupling term was solved empirically, and the proposed simplified solution was shown in good agreement with the conventional simulation. Moreover, the proposed solution is scalable, and can be easily extended to describe multi-pool CEST contrast. In sum, our study established a simplified and scalable, yet reasonably accurate numerical solution, suitable for quantitatively describing multi-pool CEST contrast. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB We study the relation between different social behaviors and the onset of epidemics in a model for the dynamics of sexual transmitted diseases. The model considers the society as a system of individual sexuated agents that can be organized in couples and interact with each other. The different social behaviors are incorporated assigning what we call a promiscuity value to each individual agent. The individual promiscuity is taken from a distribution and represents the daily probability of going out to took for a sexual partner, abandoning its eventual mate. In terms of this parameter we find a threshold for the epidemic which is much lower than the classical SIR model prediction, i.e., R-o (basic reproductive number) = 1. Different forms for the distribution of the population promiscuity are considered showing that the threshold is weakly sensitive to them. We study the homosexual and the heterosexual case as well.

AB This article reports on the initial development of a generic framework for integrating Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with Massive Multi-player Online Gaming (MMOG) technology to support the integrated modeling of human-environment resource management and decision-making. We review Web 2.0 concepts, online maps, and games as key technologies to realize a participatory construction of spatial simulation and decision making practices. Through a design-based research approach we develop a prototype framework, GeoGame, that allows users to play board-game-style simulations on top of an online map. Through several iterations we demonstrate the implementation of a range of design artifacts including: real-time, multi-user editing of online maps, web services, game lobby, user-modifiable rules and scenarios building, chat, discussion, and market transactions. Based on observational, analytical, experimental and functional evaluations of design artifacts as well as a literature review, we argue that a MMO GeoGame-framework offers a viable approach to address the complex dynamics of human-environmental systems that require a simultaneous reconciliation of both top-down and bottom-up decision making where stakeholders are an integral part of a modeling environment. Further research will offer additional insight into the development of social-environmental models using stakeholder input and the use of such models to explore properties of complex dynamic systems.

TI Evolution of Electoral Preferences for a Regime of Three Political
   Parties
SO DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this article, we use a discrete system to study the opinion dynamics regarding the electoral preferences of a nontendentious group of agents. To measure the level of preference, a continuous opinion space is used, in which the preference (opinion) can evolve from any political option, to any other; for a regime of three parties, a circle is the convenient space. To model a nonbiased society, new agents are considered. Besides their opinion, they have a new attribute: an individual iterative monoparametric map that imitates a process of internal reflection, allowing them to update their opinion in their own way. These iterative maps introduce six fixed points on the opinion space; the points' stability depends on the sign of the parameter. When the latter is positive, three attractors are identified with political options, while the repulsors are identified with the antioptions (preferences diametrically opposed to each political choice). In this new model, pairs of agents interact only if their respective opinions are alike; a positive number called confidence bound is introduced with this purpose; if opinions are similar, they update their opinion considering each other's opinion, while if they are not alike, each agent updates her opinion considering only her individual map. In addition, agents give a certain level of trust (weight) to other agent's opinions; this results in a positive stochastic matrix of weights which models the social network. The model can be reduced to a pair of coupled nonlinear difference equations, making extracting analytical results possible: a theorem on the conditions governing the existence of consensus in this new artificial society. Some numerical simulations are provided, exemplifying the analytical results.

AB Background: Enteric fever has persistence of great impact in Sudanese public health especially during rainy season when the causative agent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi possesses pan endemic patterns in most regions of Sudan - Khartoum.
   Objectives: The present study aims to assess the recent state of antibiotics susceptibility of Salmonella Typhi with special concern to multidrug resistance strains and predict the emergence of new resistant patterns and outbreaks.
   Methods: Salmonella Typhi strains were isolated and identified according to the guidelines of the International Standardization Organization and the World Health Organization. The antibiotics susceptibilities were tested using the recommendations of the Clinical Laboratories Standards Institute. Predictions of emerging resistant bacteria patterns and outbreaks in Sudan were done using logistic regression, forecasting linear equations and in silico simulations models.
   Results: A total of 124 antibiotics resistant Salmonella Typhi strains categorized in 12 average groups were isolated, different patterns of resistance statistically calculated by (y = ax - b). Minimum bactericidal concentration's predication of resistance was given the exponential trend (y = n - e(x)) and the predictive coefficient - R-2 > 0 < 1 are approximately alike. It was assumed that resistant bacteria occurred with a constant rate of antibiotic doses during the whole experimental period. Thus, the number of sensitive bacteria decreases at the same rate as resistant occur following term to the modified predictive model which solved computationally.
   Conclusion: This study assesses the prediction of multi-drug resistance among S. Typhi isolates by applying low cost materials and simple statistical methods suitable for the most frequently used antibiotics as typhoid empirical therapy. Therefore, bacterial surveillance systems should be implemented to present data on the aetiology and current antimicrobial drug resistance patterns of community-acquired agents causing outbreaks.

AB This paper studies the trading volumes and wealth distribution of a novel agent-based model of an artificial financial market. In this model, heterogeneous agents, behaving according to the Von Neumann and Morgenstern utility theory, may mutually interact. A Tobin-like tax (TT) on successful investments and a flat tax are compared to assess the effects on the agents' wealth distribution. We carry out extensive numerical simulations in two alternative scenarios: (i) a reference scenario, where the agents keep their utility function fixed, and (ii) a focal scenario, where the agents are adaptive and self-organize in communities, emulating their neighbours by updating their own utility function. Specifically, the interactions among the agents are modelled through a directed scale-free network to account for the presence of community leaders, and the herding-like effect is tested against the reference scenario. We observe that our model is capable of replicating the benefits and drawbacks of the two taxation systems and that the interactions among the agents strongly affect the wealth distribution across the communities. Remarkably, the communities benefit from the presence of leaders with successful trading strategies, and are more likely to increase their average wealth. Moreover, this emulation mechanism mitigates the decrease in trading volumes, which is a typical drawback of TTs.

AB We study a model of opinion formation based on the theory of social impact and the concept of cellular automata. The case is considered when two strong agents influence the group: a strong leader and an external social impact acting uniformly on every individual. There are two basic stationary states of the system: cluster of the leader's adherents and unification of opinions. In the deterministic limit the variation of parameters like the leader's strength or external impact can change the size of the cluster or, when they reach some critical values, make the system jump to another phase, For a certain range of parameters multistability and hysteresis phenomena are observed. In the presence of noise (social temperature) the rapid changes can be regarded as the first-order phase transitions. When both agents are in a kind of balance, a second-order transition and critical behaviour can be observed, Another kind of noise-induced transitions are the inverses (flips) of the unified group opinion due to random flips of the leader's opinion. Analytical results obtained within a mean field approximation are well reproduced in computer simulations. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Our emphasis is on the management of water service delivery (WSD) and on the institutional dynamics of the actors involved in the various water systems, therefore focusing on the interplay between human society and the environment. Water service delivery in Kenya and Ghana is of low quality and there are weak integrity mechanisms in place, which are prone to corruption. Water service delivery is also characterized by pragmatic and opportunistic management practices. We explore the extent to which corruption and management practices affect the performance of WSD by developing an exploratory agent-based model (ABM) that builds on the principal-agent theory. Based on empirical research from case studies in Kenya and Ghana, the different actors involved in WSD are modeled in terms of principals and agents that play various games reflecting different social dilemmas. Payoffs from the games are defined based on transparency, accountability, participation, and the social costs of the relationship between the principals and the agents. Decisions made by bounded-rational actors take into consideration the expected payoff but also social comparison. The results show that corruption risks and opportunistic practices reduce the performance of WSD. Furthermore, the relevance of the work is the highlighting of the use of social simulation (ABM), built on case studies, to understand these complex relationships in Kenya and Ghana.

AB Based on previous models (Hemelrijk 1998; Puga-Gonzalez, Hildenbrant & Hemelrijk 2009), we have developed an agent-based model and software, called A-KinGDom, which allows us to simulate the emergence of the social structure in a group of non-human primates. The model includes dominance and affiliative interactions and incorporates two main innovations (preliminary dominance interactions and a kinship factor), which allow us to define four different attack and affiliative strategies. In accordance with these strategies, we compared the data obtained under four simulation conditions with the results obtained in a previous study (Dolado & Beltran 2012) involving empirical observations of a captive group of mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus). The results show that the combination of the effect of kinship on affiliative interactions and the use of ambiguity-reducing attack provide results that are the most similar to the results of the biological model (i.e., a captive group of mangabeys) used in this study.

TI Towards sentiment aided dialogue policy learning for multi-intent
   conversations using hierarchical reinforcement learning
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Purpose Developing a Dialogue/Virtual Agent (VA) that can handle complex tasks (need) of the user pertaining to multiple intents of a domain is challenging as it requires the agent to simultaneously deal with multiple subtasks. However, majority of these end-to-end dialogue systems incorporate only user semantics as inputs in the learning process and ignore other useful user behavior and information. Sentiment of the user at the time of conversation plays an important role in securing maximum user gratification. So, incorporating sentiment of the user during the policy learning becomes even more crucial, more so when serving composite tasks of the user. Methodology As a first step towards enabling the development of sentiment aided VA for multi-intent conversations, this paper proposes a new dataset, annotated with its corresponding intents, slot and sentiment (considering the entire dialogue history) labels, namedSentiVA, collected from open-sourced dialogue datasets. In order to integrate these multiple aspects, a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) specificallyoptionsbased VA is proposed to learn strategies for managing multi-intent conversations. Along with task success based immediate rewards, sentiment based immediate rewards are also incorporated in the hierarchical value functions to make the VA user adaptive. Findings Empirically, the paper shows that task based and sentiment based immediate rewards cumulatively are required to ensure successful task completion and attain maximum user satisfaction in a multi-intent scenario instead of any of these rewards alone. Practical implications The eventual evaluators and consumers of dialogue systems are users. Thus, to ensure a fulfilling conversational experience involving maximum user satisfaction requires VA to consider user sentiment at every time-step in its decision making policy. Originality This work is the first attempt in incorporating sentiment based rewards in the HRL framework.

AB Recent advances in genome inspired target discovery, small molecule screens, development of biological and nanotechnology have led to the introduction of a myriad of new differently sized agents into the clinic. The differences in small and large molecule delivery are becoming increasingly important in combination therapies as well as the use of drugs that modify the physiology of tumors such as anti-angiogenic treatment. The complexity of targeting has led to the development of mathematical models to facilitate understanding, but unfortunately, these studies are often only applicable to a particular molecule, making pharmacokinetic comparisons difficult. Here we develop and describe a framework for categorizing primary pharmacokinetics of drugs in tumors. For modeling purposes, we define drugs not by their mechanism of action but rather their rate-limiting step of delivery. Our simulations account for variations in perfusion, vascularization, interstitial transport, and non-linear local binding and metabolism. Based on a comparison of the fundamental rates determining uptake, drugs were classified into four categories depending on whether uptake is limited by blood flow, extravasation, interstitial diffusion, or local binding and metabolism. Simulations comparing small molecule versus macromolecular drugs show a sharp difference in distribution, which has implications for multi-drug therapies. The tissue-level distribution differs widely in tumors for small molecules versus macromolecular biologic drugs, and this should be considered in the design of agents and treatments. An example using antibodies in mouse xenografts illustrates the different in vivo behavior. This type of transport analysis can be used to aid in model development, experimental data analysis, and imaging and therapeutic agent design.

AB Domesticated pigs, Sus scrofa, vary considerably in feeding, social interaction and growth patterns. This variation originates partly from genetic variation that affects physiological factors and partly from behavioural strategies (avoid or approach) in competitive food resource situations. Currently, it is unknown how variation in physiological factors and in behavioural strategies among animals contributes to variation in feeding, social interaction and growth patterns in animals. The aim of this study was to unravel causation of variation in these patterns among pigs. We used an agent-based model to explore the effects of physiological factors and behavioural strategies in pigs on variation in feeding, social interaction and growth patterns. Model results show that variation in feeding, social interaction and growth patterns are caused partly by chance, such as time effects and coincidence of conflicts. Furthermore, results show that seemingly contradictory empirical findings in literature can be explained by variation in pig characteristics (i.e. growth potential, positive feedback, dominance, and coping style). Growth potential mainly affected feeding and growth patterns, whereas positive feedback, dominance and coping style affected feeding patterns, social interaction patterns, as well as growth patterns. Variation in behavioural strategies among pigs can reduce aggression at group level, but also make some pigs more susceptible to social constraints inhibiting them from feeding when they want to, especially low-ranking pigs and pigs with a passive coping style. Variation in feeding patterns, such as feeding rate or meal frequency, can indicate social constraints. Feeding patterns, however, can say something different about social constraints at group versus individual level. A combination of feeding patterns, such as a decreased feed intake, an increased feeding rate, and an increased meal frequency might, therefore, be needed to measure social constraints at individual level.

AB Secondary hydatidosis is an important problem encountered during the surgical treatment of hydatid cysts. This study describes an experimental model of secondary hydatidosis by cyst inoculation, used to explore whether simultaneous inoculation of protoscolocidal agents could prevent secondary hydatidosis. Fertile cyst fluid was injected into the pleural space of rabbits alone (group 1, n = 8), and in combination with 2% albendazole solution (group 2, n = 8), 20% hypertonic saline (group 3, n = 8) or 10% povidone-iodine (group 4, n = 8). Computed tomography imaging of the thorax, indirect haemagglutination (IHA) titres and eosinophil counts were used to determine cyst development. After 16 months, three control rabbits had pneumothorax, seven had cysts and four had parenchymal nodules. Histopathological investigation of nodules revealed 87.5% cyst formation. Pleural thickening was observed in rabbits from all groups. Cyst formation rates, IHA titres and eosinophilia counts were higher in group 1 than in groups 2 - 4. This study demonstrated the experimental formation of secondary hydatidosis and found that topical protoscolocidal agents were beneficial in preventing cyst recurrence.

AB Social sampling is a novel randomized message passing protocol inspired by social communication for opinion formation in social networks. In a typical social sampling algorithm, each agent holds a sample from the empirical distribution of social opinions at initial time, and it collaborates with other agents in a distributed manner to estimate the initial empirical distribution by randomly sampling a message from current distribution estimate. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the theoretical properties of the distributed social sampling algorithm over random networks. First, we provide a framework based on stochastic approximation to study the asymptotic properties of the algorithm. Then, under mild conditions, we prove that the estimates of all agents converge to a common random distribution, which is composed of the initial empirical distribution and the accumulation of quantized error. Besides, by tuning algorithm parameters, we prove the strong consistency, namely, the distribution estimates of agents almost surely converge to the initial empirical distribution. Furthermore, the asymptotic normality of estimation error generated by distributed social sample algorithm is addressed. Finally, we provide a numerical simulation to validate the theoretical results of this paper.

TI A Decentralized Partially Observable Decision Model for Recognizing the

AB Multiagent goal recognition is important in many simulation systems. Many of the existing modeling methods need detailed domain knowledge of agents' cooperative behaviors and a training dataset to estimate policies. To solve these problems, we propose a novel decentralized partially observable decision model (Dec-POMDM), which models cooperative behaviors by joint policies. In this compact way, we only focus on the distribution of joint policies. Additionally, a model-free algorithm, cooperative colearning based on Sarsa, is exploited to estimate agents' policies under the assumption of rationality, which makes the training dataset unnecessary. In the inference, considering that the Dec-POMDM is discrete and its state space is large, we implement a marginal filter (MF) under the framework of the Dec-POMDM, where the initial world states and results of actions are uncertain. In the experiments, a new scenario is designed based on the standard predator-prey problem: we increase the number of preys, and our aim is to recognize the real target of predators. Experiment results show that (a) our method recognizes goals well even when they change dynamically; (b) the Dec-POMDM outperforms supervised trained HMMs in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure; and (c) the MF infers goals more efficiently than the particle filter under the framework of the Dec-POMDM.

AB Strong reciprocity is a fundamental human characteristic associated with our extraordinary sociality and cooperation. Laboratory experiments on social dilemma games and many field studies have quantified well-defined levels of cooperation and propensity to punish/reward. The level of cooperation is observed to be strongly dependent on the availability of punishments and/or rewards. Here, we propose an operational approach based on the evolutionary selection of prosocial behaviors to explain the quantitative level of the propensity to punish in three experimental set-ups. A simple cost/benefit analysis at the level of a single agent, who anticipates the action of her fellows, determines an optimal level of altruistic punishment, which explains quantitatively experimental results on a third-party punishment game, the ultimatum game and an altruistic punishment game. We also report numerical simulations of an evolutionary agent-based model of repeated agent interactions with feedback by punishments, which confirms that the propensity to punish is a robust emergent property selected by the evolutionary rules of the model. The cost-benefit reasoning is not to be taken literally but rather to embody the result of the selection pressure of co-evolving agents that have make them converge to their preferences (which can be seen as either hard-wired and/or culturally selected). In this view, the prosocial preference of humans is a collective emergent process, robustly selected by adaptation and selection. Our main contribution is to use evolutionary feedback selection to quantify the value of the prosocial propensity to punish, and test this prediction on three different experimental set-ups.

ID EVOLUTION; NETWORKS
AB Structural (or social) balance is regarded as a fundamental social process. It has been used to explain how the feelings, attitudes and beliefs, which the social actors have towards each other, promotes the formation of stable (but not necessarily conflict free) social groups. While balance theory has a rich and long history, it has lost favor in recent times. The empirical work has taken one of two forms. Most empirical work on social balance has focused on dyads and triples, and findings have been inconsistent. The remaining studies focus on the structure of the group as a whole. Results here have been inconsistent also. One major problem is that the first line of work is based only on the source ideas of Heider while the second has been based only on the ideas of Cartwright and Harary. Some of the inconsistencies may be due to this empirical split where the two streams of ideas do not inform each other. We propose a new theoretical model for social balance in the form of an agent-based simulation model. The results we present account for several of the inconsistencies found in the literature. The model simulates distinct but interdependent social actors making positive and negative selections of each other in efforts to reach balanced cognitive states. The design variables for the simulations are group size, degree of contentiousness of a group and the mode of communicating choices regarding the existence and sign of social ties. The group level balance mechanism used by the dynamic model is based on the idea of partition balance, as proposed by Doreian and Mrvar [Soc. Netw. 18 (1996) 149]. Actor selections, over time, generate networks that partition group members into stable, balanced subsets at equilibrium or near equilibrium. The design variables have complicated impacts on the number of actor choices made to reach balance, the level of group imbalance, the number of actors with balanced images and the number of plus-sets formed.

AB Agent-based modeling has become increasingly popular in recent years, but there is still no codified set of recommendations or practices for how to use these models within a program of empirical research. This article provides ideas and practical guidelines drawn from sociology, biology, computer science, epidemiology, and statistics. We first discuss the motivations for using agent-based models in both basic science and policy-oriented social research. Next, we provide an overview of methods and strategies for incorporating data on behavior and populations into agent-based models, and review techniques for validating and testing the sensitivity of agent-based models. We close with suggested directions for future research.

AB Automated negotiation under the infrastructure of e-commerce is becoming an important issue. However, although the communication protocols and frameworks of automated negotiation have been extensively investigated, the corresponding tactics and strategies are still underdeveloped and need to be evaluated further. Based on the negotiation model proposed by Faratin et al., this paper examines the performance of automated negotiation tactics and intends to provide concise suggestions for the users of automated negotiation. First, theoretical analysis is used to evaluate the behavior-dependent tactics. Constructive conclusions are obtained when single-issue negotiations are considered. Next, a new framework for applying single-issue tactics to multi-issue negotiation is proposed. Based on this framework, theoretical analysis is then extended to multi-issue cases. Finally, different from the previous work, exhaustive simulations based on two-issue negotiations are performed to evaluate the effectiveness of behavior-dependent and time-dependent tactics. The experimental results provide several important insights into negotiation tactics.

AB For autonomous intelligent robots continually interacting with the environment it is essential to store temporal and sequential information. In this paper, we consider a non-Markovian sequential task in which the preceding state alone does not determine the next action. To achieve a better fitness, the agent must have a working memory to reach the target position, must ignore irrelevant sensory inputs, and at a higher level, it has to deal with the non-Markovian order of sequential task. In our work, we applied an extended evolutionary algorithm to evolve the structure and the weight connections of the recurrent neural controller. In order to improve the convergence of evolution and reduce the computation time, we employed a multi-population Genetic Algorithm (MPGA) where subpopulations cooperate and compete with eachother. Simulation and experimental results using the Cyber Rodent robot show that optimal recurrent neural architectures were generated through the course of evolution.

AB In a context characterized by a growing demand for networked services, users of advanced applications sometimes face network performance troubles that may actually prevent them from completing their tasks. Therefore, providing assistance for user communities that have difficulties using the network has been identified as one of the major issues of performance-related support activities. Despite the advances network management has made over the last years, there is a lack of guidance services to provide users with information that goes beyond merely presenting network properties. In this light, the research community has been highlighting the importance of User-Perceived Quality (UPQ) scores during the evaluation of network services for network applications, such as Quality of Experience (QoE) and Mean Opinion Score (MOS). However, despite their potential to assist end-users to deal with network performance troubles, only few types of network applications have well established UPQ scores. Besides that, they are defined through experiments essentially conducted in laboratory, rather than actual usage. This paper thus presents a knowledge and Collaboration-based Network Users' Support (CNUS) Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) Process that predicts UPQ scores to assist users by focusing on the collaboration among them through the sharing of their experiences in using network applications. It builds (i) a knowledge base that includes not only information about network performance problems, but also applications' characteristics, (ii) a case base that contains users' opinions, and (iii) a user database that stores users' profiles. By processing them, CNUS benefits users through the indication of the degree of satisfaction they may achieve based on the general opinion from members of their communities in similar contexts. In order to evaluate the suitability of CNUS, a CBR system was built and validated through an experimental study conducted in laboratory with a multi-agent system that simulated scenarios where users request for assistance. The simulation was supported by an ontology of network services and applications and reputation scheme implemented through the PageRank algorithm. The results of the study pointed to the effectiveness of CNUS, and its resilience to users' collusive and incoherent behaviors. Besides that, they showed the influence of the knowledge about network characteristics, users' profiles and application features on computer-based support activities. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Pedestrian simulation is a consolidated area of application in which agent-based models are often employed; successful case studies are described in the literature and commercial, off-the-shelf simulators are commonly employed by decision makers and consultancy companies. Most state-of-the-art models, however, generally do not consider the explicit representation of pedestrians aggregations (groups) and their implications on the overall system dynamics. This work is aimed at discussing the relevance and significance of this research effort with respect to the need of empirical data about the implication of the presence of groups of pedestrians in different situations (e.g., changing density, spatial configurations of the environment). The article describes an agent-based model encompassing both traditional individual motivations (i.e., tendency to stay away from other pedestrians while moving toward the goal) and a simplified mechanism considering the cohesion effects related to the presence of groups in the crowd. The model is tested in a simple scenario to evaluate the implications of some modeling choices and the presence of groups in the simulated scenario. Moreover, the model is applied in a real-world scenario characterized by the presence of organized groups as an instrument for crowd management. Results are discussed and compared to experimental observations and to data available in the literature.

Here we analyze how the effect of social protection policies, which favor agents of lower wealth during the exchange, influences the stability and some relevant economic indicators of the system. On the other hand, we study how periods of interruption of these policies produce, in the short and long term, changes in the system. In all cases, a steady state is reached, but with varying relaxation times. We conclude that regulations may improve economic mobility and reduce inequality. Moreover, our results indicate that the removal of social protection entails a high cost associated with the hysteresis of the distribution of wealth. Economic inequalities increase during the period without social protection and decrease when they are restored. But recovery to the initial equilibrium may take longer than it took to disturb it. In some extreme cases, inequality is irreversible. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Fast and accurate computational biology models offer the prospect of accelerating the development of personalized medicine. A tool capable of estimating treatment success can help prevent unnecessary and costly treatments and potential harmful side effects. A novel high-performance Agent-Based Model (ABM) was adopted to simulate and visualize multi-scale complex biological processes arising in vocal fold inflammation and repair. The computational scheme was designed to organize the 3D ABM sub-tasks to fully utilize the resources available on current heterogeneous platforms consisting of multi-core CPUs and many-core GPUs. Subtasks are further parallelized and convolution-based diffusion is used to enhance the performance of the ABM simulation. The scheme was implemented using a client-server protocol allowing the results of each iteration to be analyzed and visualized on the server (i.e., in-situ) while the simulation is running on the same server. The resulting simulation and visualization software enables users to interact with and steer the course of the simulation in real-time as needed. This high-resolution 3D ABM framework was used for a case study of surgical vocal fold injury and repair. The new framework is capable of completing the simulation, visualization and remote result delivery in under 7 s per iteration, where each iteration of the simulation represents 30 min in the real world. The case study model was simulated at the physiological scale of a human vocal fold. This simulation tracks 17 million biological cells as well as a total of 1.7 billion signaling chemical and structural protein data points. The visualization component processes and renders all simulated biological cells and 154 million signaling chemical data points. The proposed high-performance 3D ABM was verified through comparisons with empirical vocal fold data. Representative trends of biomarker predictions in surgically injured vocal folds were observed.

AB We review the agent-based models (ABM) on social physics including econophysics. The ABM consists of agent, system space, and external environment. The agent is autonomous and decides his/her behavior by interacting with the neighbors or the external environment with the rules of behavior. Agents are irrational because they have only limited information when they make decisions. They adapt using learning from past memories. Agents have various attributes and are heterogeneous. ABM is a non-equilibrium complex system that exhibits various emergence phenomena. The social complexity ABM describes human behavioral characteristics. In ABMs of econophysics, we introduce the Sugarscape model and the artificial market models. We review minority games and majority games in ABMs of game theory. Social flow ABM introduces crowding, evacuation, traffic congestion, and pedestrian dynamics. We also review ABM for opinion dynamics and voter model. We discuss features and advantages and disadvantages of Netlogo, Repast, Swarm, and Mason, which are representative platforms for implementing ABM.

AB We propose a new pairwise Fermi updating rule by considering a social average payoff when an agent copies a neighbor's strategy. In the update rule, a focal agent compares her payoff with the social average payoff of the same strategy that her pairwise opponent has. This concept might be justified by the fact that people reference global and, somehow, statistical information, not local information when imitating social behaviors. We presume several possible ways for the social average. Simulation results prove that the social average of some limited agents realizes more significant cooperation than that of the entire population.

AB The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of homophily on diffusion over social networks. An agent-based simulation model is developed to serve as the experimental ground for this analysis. Diffusion dynamics of a nonsticky innovation is investigated by varying homophily levels in the social network depicted in the model as the primary control variable. First of all, the results show that homophily is self-reinforcing. Second, starting from a nonhomophilous network, early increases in the level of homophily have a positive effect on the extent of diffusion, whereas further increases have a negative impact. Finally, several local minima and maxima are observed in the relation between the homophily level and the extent of diffusion. Our analysis focuses on node properties such as connectedness and average degrees in order to explain the observed regular relationship between homophily and diffusion. We argue that (i) homophily increases the connectedness of different status groups separately and (ii) increasing levels of homophily decreases the marginal importance of a single homophilous tie by increasing the sources of valuable information. Future research involves investigating the coevolution of social behavior and networks by allowing the adopted innovation to lead to value homophily, exploration of different diffusion initiation types, and different adoption heuristics.

SO SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY

DT Article
DE Agent-based simulation; Abstraction; Optimization; Online learning
AB Simulating fine-grained agent-based models requires extensive computational resources. In this article, we present an approach that reduces the number of agents by adaptively abstracting groups of spatial agents into meta-agents that subsume individual behaviours and physical forms. Particularly, groups of agents that have been clustering together for a sufficiently long period of time are detected by observer agents and then abstracted into a single meta-agent. Observers periodically test meta-agents to ensure their validity, as the dynamics of the simulation may change to a point where the individual agents do not form a cluster any more. An invalid meta-agent is removed from the simulation and subsequently, its subsumed individual agents will be put back in the simulation. The same mechanism can be applied on meta-agents thus creating adaptive abstraction hierarchies during the course of a simulation. Experimental results on the simulation of the blood coagulation process show that the proposed abstraction mechanism results in the same system behaviour while speeding up the simulation.

AB A key research area in autonomous driving is how to model the driver's decision-making behavior, due to the fact it is significant for a self-driving vehicles considering their traffic safety and efficiency. However, the uncertain characteristics of vehicle and pedestrian trajectories affect urban roads, which poses severe challenges to the cognitive understanding and decision-making of autonomous vehicle systems in terms of accuracy and robustness. To overcome the abovementioned problems, this paper proposes a Bayesian driver agent (BDA) model which is a vision-based autonomous vehicle system with learning and inference methods inspired by human driver's cognitive psychology. Different from the end-to-end learning method and traditional rule-based methods, our approach breaks the driving system up into a scene recognition module and a decision inference module. The perception module, which is based on a multi-task learning neural network (CNN), takes a driver's-view image as its input and predicts the traffic scene's feature values. The decision module based on dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) then makes an inferred decision using the traffic scene's feature values. To explore the validity of the Bayesian driver agent model, we performed experiments on a driving simulation platform. The BDA model can extract the scene feature values effectively and predict the probability distribution of the human driver's decision-making process accurately based on inference. We take the lane changing scenario as an example to verify the model, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) correlation between the BDA model and human driver's decision process reached 0.984. This work suggests a research in scene perception and autonomous decision-making that may apply to autonomous vehicle system.

AB Agent-based models have been used to simulate complex social systems in many domains. Historically research in agent decision-making has been performed with the goal of creating an agent who acts rational. However, experimental economics has shown that human beings do not always make rational decisions. Based on Kahneman and Tversky's descriptive theory, this paper proposes a computational agent-based model of human-like intuitive decisions and bounded rationality. A series of experiments are conducted to evaluate the concept, the model and their impacts on endowing agents with human-like decisions. Our experiments show that a selfish agent defers from the strategy of the rational agent and is more similar to human strategy.

AB Adolescents tend to adopt behaviors that are similar to those of their friends, and also tend to become friends with peers that have similar interests and behaviors. This tendency towards homogeneity applies not only to conventional behaviors such as working for school and participating in sports activities, but also to risk behaviors such as drug use, oppositional behavior or unsafe sex. The current study aims at building an agent model to answer the following related questions: How do friendship groups evolve and what is the role of behavioral similarity in friendship formation? How does homogeneity among peers emerge, with regard to conventional as well as risk behaviors? On the basis of the theoretical and empirical literature on friendship selection and influences on risk behavior during adolescence we first developed a conceptual framework, which was then translated into a mathematical model of a dynamic system and implemented as an agent-based computer simulation consisting of simple behavioral rules and principles. Each agent in the model holds distinct property matrices including an individual behavioral profile with a list of risky (i.e., alcohol use, aggressiveness, soft drugs) and conventional behaviors (i.e., school attendance, sports, work). The computer model simulates the development, during one school year, of a social network (i.e. formation of friendships and cliques), the (dyadic) interactions between pupils and their behavioral profiles. During the course of simulation, the agents' behavioral profiles change on the basis of their interactions resulting in individual developmental curves of conventional and risk behaviors. These profiles are used to calculate the (behavioral) similarity and differences between the various agents. Generally, the model output is analyzed by means of visual inspection (i.e., plotting developmental curves of behavior and social networks), systematic comparison and by calculating additional measures (i.e., using specific social analysis software packages). Simulation results conclusively indicate model validity. The model simulates qualitative properties currently found in research on adolescent development, namely the role of homophily, the appearance of friendship clusters, and the increase in behavioral homogeneity among friends. The model not only converges with empirical findings, but furthermore helps to explain social psychological phenomena (e.g. the emergence of homophily among adolescents).

AB A reproducible experimental model of intraabdominal infections in rats has been devised in order to simulate intraabdominal infections in patients. The experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of biapenem with imipenem. Three groups of animals were used, each group consisting of 20 animals. Antibacterial agents were given by injection initially 1 h after surgery and then at 12 h intervals for 12 days. The drugs and amounts of agents given per dose were biapenem 10 mg and imipenem 10 mg, respectively. The control group received 0.9% sterile saline. 80% of the untreated animals died within 3 days. Animals treated with biapenem or imipenem had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only two animals in the two treatment groups died. Biapenem seems to be useful in the treatment of intraabdominal infections.

AB We study groups of interacting agents who are trying to discover probabilistic truths on the basis of sequentially provided evidence and information about the belief states of other group members. The main research question is which combination of epistemic principles- combinations of an evidential update rule, a rule for determining peerhood, and a rule for aggregating probability functions-such groups should adopt to strike the best balance between being fast and being accurate, where the former is understood by reference to how long it takes before a majority of the group assigns a high probability to the true hypothesis, and the latter by reference to the average Brier penalty incurred by the group. The main methodology to be used is that of agent-based optimization, which is a specific form of evolutionary computing. We implement this methodology in a generalization of the Hegselmann-Krause model. In the end, we are able to identify optimal procedures for taking into account both direct evidence and information about one's peers' beliefs. At the same, we note that optimality for such procedures is dependent on context. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A border surveillance operation requires sophisticated sensor planning, as sensors are usually scarce and cannot cover an entire region simultaneously. Border patrol agents act as moving sensors in a border region, and the border patrol agents' coverage moves around the region dynamically, increasing the chance of approaching a trespassing agent. Typically, the locations of trespassing agents cannot be fully observed due to the size of the border region and obstacles. In addition, intelligent trespassing agents may dynamically adjust their traveling paths so that the border patrol agents cannot predict their locations easily. Trespassing agents are assumed to leave traces that indicate their footprints, providing their estimated locations. Border patrol agents may use the trespassers' footprints as partial information to leverage patrol path planning. We propose an adaptive border patrol process as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), in which an individual border patrol agent's decision is determined dynamically on the basis of trespassing agents' partially observed locations. The observations are shared among individual border patrol agents, allowing the border patrol agents to cooperate. The zoning technique is used to limit the planning scope of an individual border patrol agent, and Monte Carlo simulation is applied to reduce the complexity of the POMDP planning problem. Empirical experiments are conducted by means of simulated agents. The simulation parameters are derived from the interviews with a group of border patrol experts. The results in different scenarios show that the proposed patrol path planning scheme outperforms other patrol path planning schemes in terms of the trespasser detection rate. The simulation results are validated with respect to subject matter experts (SMEs), where SMEs are the same border patrol experts who had given the interviews. The proposed method has potential in border surveillance as an assisting system for human border patrol or an automated guidance system in robots or drones.

AB A well-trod debate at the nexus of cognitive science and linguistics, the so-called past tense debate, has examined how rules and exceptions are individually acquired (McClelland & Patterson, ; Pinker & Ullman, ). However, this debate focuses primarily on individual mechanisms in learning, saying little about how rules and exceptions function from a sociolinguistic perspective. To remedy this, we use agent-based models to examine how rules and exceptions function across populations. We expand on earlier work by considering how repeated interaction and cultural transmission across speakers affects the dynamics of rules and exceptions in language, measuring linguistic outcomes within a social system rather than focusing individual learning outcomes. We consider how population turnover and growth effect linguistic rule dynamics in large and small populations, showing that this method has considerable potential particularly in probing the mechanisms underlying the linguistic niche hypothesis (Lupyan & Dale, ).
   Cuskley, Loreto & Kirby (2018) explore how the diversity of social groups influences the linguistic system. Using agent-based modelling for simulating language evolution in a concentrated time frame, they suggest that the morphology of languages (e.g. the plural -s or past tense -ed in English) used in larger groups including more non-native speakers is less complex.

TI Location Choice Modeling for Shopping and Leisure Activities with MATSim
   Combining Microsimulation and Time Geography
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
AB The activity-based multiagent simulation toolkit MATSim adopts a coevolutionary approach to capturing the patterns of people's activity scheduling and participation behavior at a high level of detail. Until now, the search space of the MATSim system was formed by every agent's route and time choice. This paper focuses on the crucial computational issues that have to be addressed when the system is being extended to include location choice. This results in an enormous search space that would be impossible to explore exhaustively within a reasonable time. With the use of a large-scale scenario, it is shown that the system rapidly converges toward a system's fixed point if the agents' choices are per iteration confined to local steps. This approach was inspired by local search methods in numerical optimization. The study shows that the approach can be incorporated easily and consistently into MATSim by using Hager-strand's time-geographic approach. This paper additionally presents a first approach to improving the behavioral realism of the MATSim location choice module. A singly constrained model is created; it introduces competition for slots on the activity infrastructure, where the actual load is coupled with time-dependent capacity restraints for every activity location and is incorporated explicitly into the agent's location choice process. As expected,. this constrained model reduces the number of implausibly overcrowded activity locations. To the authors' knowledge, incorporating competition in the activity infrastructure has received only marginal attention in multiagent simulations to date, and thus, this contribution is also meant to raise the issue by presenting this new model.

AB Humans everywhere cooperate in groups to achieve benefits not attainable by individuals. Individual effort is often not automatically tied to a proportionate share of group benefits. This decoupling allows for free-riding, a strategy that (absent countermeasures) outcompetes cooperation. Empirically and formally, punishment potentially solves the evolutionary puzzle of group cooperation. Nevertheless, standard analyses appear to show that punishment alone is insufficient, because second-order free riders (those who cooperate but do not punish) can be shown to outcompete punishers. Consequently, many have concluded that other processes, such as cultural or genetic group selection, are required. Here, we present a series of agent-based simulations that show that group cooperation sustained by punishment easily evolves by individual selection when you introduce into standard models more biologically plausible assumptions about the social ecology and psychology of ancestral humans. We relax three unrealistic assumptions of past models. First, past models assume all punishers must punish every act of free riding in their group. We instead allow punishment to be probabilistic, meaning punishers can evolve to only punish some free riders some of the time. This drastically lowers the cost of punishment as group size increases. Second, most models unrealistically do not allow punishment to recruit labor; punishment merely reduces the punished agent's fitness. We instead realistically allow punished free riders to cooperate in the future to avoid punishment. Third, past models usually restrict agents to interact in a single group their entire lives. We instead introduce realistic social ecologies in which agents participate in multiple, partially overlapping groups. Because of this, punitive tendencies are more expressed and therefore more exposed to natural selection. These three moves toward greater model realism reveal that punishment and cooperation easily evolve by direct selection-even in sizeable groups.
