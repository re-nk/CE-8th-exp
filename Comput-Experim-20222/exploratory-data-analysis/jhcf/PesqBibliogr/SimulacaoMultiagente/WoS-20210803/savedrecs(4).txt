AB The time-course of the humoral immune response of female blackflies after a challenge with bacteria, different Onchocerca microfilariae species, bacterial endotoxin and microfilarial extract was investigated. Strong bacteriolytic and growth inhibition activities against the Gram-positive bacterium Micrococcus luteus were induced by all agents. Specific differences were found in activity levels and time-course. Notably the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced a very early, profound bacteriolytic and antibacterial response, which declined within a day after injection. In contrast, the bacteriolytic activities after Escherichia coli D31 and Onchocerca microfilariae infections were lower, but remained elevated over the observation period of 4 days. The bacteriolytic activity was correlated to a haemolymph protein with a molecular weight of around 14 kDa. Anti-Gram-positive activity in the E. coli infected group appeared within the first 6 h. However, it took 4 days in the microfilarial infected blackflies to reach significant levels. The active agent was identified to be a peptide with a molecular weight of around 4-4.5 kDa. Activity against the Gram-negative bacteria E. coli was detected in blackflies injected with E. coli D31, O. dukei microfilariae and microfilarial extract on days 1 and 4 after injection. The immune response in S. damnosum s.l. naturally infected via a bloodmeal on cattle supported the findings of the experimental infections. Similarities of the immune response kinetics between bacterial and filarial infections suggested that intracellular Wolbachia bacteria, released from microfilariae, could be responsible for the antibacterial response. This is supported by the observation that the induction of an immune response in the Drosophila melanogaster mbn-2 cell line by the filarial extract is blocked by polymyxin B, which forms inactive complexes with bacterial LPS.

TI Disease-driven reduction in human mobility influences human-mosquito
   contacts and dengue transmission dynamics
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID PUERTO-RICO; HETEROGENEITIES; POPULATION; PEOPLE; IMPACT
AB Heterogeneous exposure to mosquitoes determines an individual's contribution to vector-borne pathogen transmission. Particularly for dengue virus (DENV), there is a major difficulty in quantifying human-vector contacts due to the unknown coupled effect of key heterogeneities. To test the hypothesis that the reduction of human out-of-home mobility due to dengue illness will significantly influence population-level dynamics and the structure of DENV transmission chains, we extended an existing modeling framework to include social structure, disease-driven mobility reductions, and heterogeneous transmissibility from different infectious groups. Compared to a baseline model, naive to human pre-symptomatic infectiousness and disease-driven mobility changes, a model including both parameters predicted an increase of 37% in the probability of a DENV outbreak occurring; a model including mobility change alone predicted a 15.5% increase compared to the baseline model. At the individual level, models including mobility change led to a reduction of the importance of out-of-home onward transmission (R, the fraction of secondary cases predicted to be generated by an individual) by symptomatic individuals (up to -62%) at the expense of an increase in the relevance of their home (up to +40%). An individual's positive contribution to R could be predicted by a GAM including a non-linear interaction between an individual's biting suitability and the number of mosquitoes in their home (>10 mosquitoes and 0.6 individual attractiveness significantly increased R). We conclude that the complex fabric of social relationships and differential behavioral response to dengue illness cause the fraction of symptomatic DENV infections to concentrate transmission in specific locations, whereas asymptomatic carriers (including individuals in their pre-symptomatic period) move the virus throughout the landscape. Our findings point to the difficulty of focusing vector control interventions reactively on the home of symptomatic individuals, as this approach will fail to contain virus propagation by visitors to their house and asymptomatic carriers.
   Author summary
   Human mobility patterns can play an integral role in vector-borne disease dynamics by characterizing an individual's potential contacts with disease-transmitting vectors. Dengue virus is transmitted by a sedentary vector, but human mobility allows individuals to have contact with mosquitoes at their home and other houses they frequent (their activity space). When accounting for the decreased mobility of symptomatic dengue cases in an agent-based simulation model, however, we found a severely diminished role of the activity space in onward transmission. Those who received the majority of their mosquito contacts outside their home experienced decreases in expected bites and onward transmission when mobility changes were accounted for. Onward transmission was driven by a synergistic relationship between the number of mosquitoes in an individual's home and their biting suitability, where even those with the highest biting suitability would have limited contribution to transmission given a low number of household mosquitoes. Reactive vector control, which often targets symptomatic cases, could be effective for slowing onward transmission from these cases, but will fail to control virus transmission due to the disproportionate contribution of asymptomatic infections.

AB In the framework of small-scale agent-based financial market models, the paper starts out from the concept of structural stochastic volatility, which derives from different noise levels in the demand of fundamentalists and chartists and the time-varying market shares of the two groups. It advances several different specifications of the endogenous switching between the trading strategies and then estimates these models by the method of simulated moments (MSMs), where the choice of the moments reflects the basic stylized facts of the daily returns of a stock market index. In addition to the standard version of MSM with a quadratic loss function, we also take into account how often a great number of Monte Carlo simulation runs happen to yield moments that are all contained within their empirical confidence intervals. The model contest along these lines reveals a strong role for a (tamed) herding component. The quantitative performance of the winner model is so good that it may provide a standard for future research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID DEFORESTATION
AB Agricultural expansion and over-cutting of trees for fuelwood are important causes of deforestation in and and semi-arid countries such as Sudan. The consequence is increased desertification and high erosion and loss of soil nutrients leading to declining agricultural productivity. However, the social costs of the deforestation externality are not taken into account in present forest management and land use planning in Sudan leading to tinder-pricing and over-exploitation of the country's forest resources. This study evaluated the suitability of approaches commonly used by most forest resource management agencies for prediction of the state and control of harvesting of forest resources against alternative empirical simulation models using relevant information about economic behaviour of trading agents in the fuelwood market. Results showed the clear Superiority of models integrating market behaviour over current approaches in the ability to better simulate real trends of wood consumption and hence depletion rates. The study also adopted an optimal control model to derive socially optimal forest harvesting regimes. The results showed that Current rates of forest resource rent recovery and reforestation efforts are very far from optimal. Results also suggest that, in addition to optimal pricing and higher reforestation efforts, promotion and availability of fuel substitutes and investment in wood energy conversion efficiencies have a strong potential for curbing the problem of deforestation in Sudan.

AB Turn-taking is a preverbal skill whose mastering constitutes an important precondition for many social interactions and joint actions. However, the cognitive mechanisms supporting turn-taking abilities are still poorly understood. Here, we propose a computational analysis of turn-taking in terms of two general mechanisms supporting joint actions: action prediction (e.g., recognizing the interlocutor's message and predicting the end of turn) and signaling (e.g., modifying one's own speech to make it more predictable and discriminable). We test the hypothesis that in a simulated conversational scenario dyads using these two mechanisms can recognize the utterances of their co-actors faster, which in turn permits them to give and take turns more efficiently. Furthermore, we discuss how turn-taking dynamics depend on the fact that agents cannot simultaneously use their internal models for both action (or messages) prediction and production, as these have different requirements-or, in other words, they cannot speak and listen at the same time with the same level of accuracy. Our results provide a computational-level characterization of turn-taking in terms of cognitive mechanisms of action prediction and signaling that are shared across various interaction and joint action domains.

AB A comprehensive multiscale, multiphase dynamic model is developed to simulate heterogeneous vinyl chloride (VCM) suspension polymerisation in industrial batch reactors. From the numerical solution of the proposed integrated model, the evolution of the molecular (i.e. molecular weight distribution, long chain branching, short chain branching, terminal double bonds) and morphological (i.e. particle size distribution, porosity) polymer properties in a PVC batch suspension polymerisation reactor can be predicted. In particular, the polymer molecular properties are determined by employing a kinetic mechanism which describes the VCM free radical polymerisation in both monomer and polymer rich phases. Semi-empirical and phenomenological expressions are used to describe the breakage and coalescence rates of dispersed monomer droplets in terms of the type and concentration of suspending agent, quality of agitation and evolution of the physical, thermodynamic and transport properties of the polymerisation system. The dynamic discretised particle population balance equation (PBE) is solved to calculate the dynamic evolution of the particle size distribution of the produced PVC. Furthermore, the primary particle size distribution (PPSD) inside the polymerising monomer droplets, which influences to a large degree the porosity of the final PVC grains, is determined by the solution of a PBE governing the nucleation, growth and aggregation of the primary particles. Finally, dynamic mass and energy balances are derived to assess the dynamic behaviour of the PVC batch suspension polymerisation reactors. The theoretical model predictions show good agreement with a comprehensive series of experimental data provided by the PVC industry. This verification of the proposed model makes it a powerful tool for the simulation of large scale PVC batch suspension polymerisation reactors.

AB We examined drivers of article citations using 776 articles that were published from 1990 to 2012 in a broad-based and high-impact social sciences journal, The Leadership Quarterly. These articles had 1191 unique authors having published and received in total (at the time of their most recent article published in our dataset) 16,817 articles and 284,777 citations, respectively. Our models explained 66.6% of the variance in citations and showed that quantitative, review, method, and theory articles were significantly more cited than were qualitative articles or agent-based simulations. As concerns quantitative articles, which constituted the majority of the sample, our model explained 80.3% of the variance in citations; some methods (e.g., use of SEM) and designs (e.g., meta-analysis), as well as theoretical approaches (e.g., use of transformational, charismatic, or visionary type-leadership theories) predicted higher article citations. Regarding statistical conclusion validity of quantitative articles, articles having endogeneity threats received significantly fewer citations than did those using a more robust design or an estimation procedure that ensured correct causal estimation. We make several general recommendations on how to improve research practice and article citations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Moisture adsorption isotherm and glass transition temperature of various spray-dried soy sauce powders containing different types and concentrations of maltodextrins were studied and compared. Maltodextrins of dextrose equivalent (DE) = 5, DE = 10 and DE = 15, respectively, with concentrations of 20 or 40 % (w/v) were used as carrier agents. The equilibrium moisture content was reduced with increased maltodextrin concentration, whereas it was not apparently influenced by the value of maltodextrin DE. Both the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Guggenheim-Anderson-de Boer (GAB) models could be applied to simulate the moisture adsorption behaviour of the soy sauce powders. The monolayer moisture content of the powders was determined by fitting experimental data to the BET/GAB models with a (w) up to 0.53, although both models could fit satisfactorily with the experimental data to a higher water activity level(.) The glass transition temperatures (T (g)) of the powders equilibrated under various water activities were determined using a differential scanning calorimeter. Increasing moisture adsorption of the soy sauce powders resulted in a T (g) reduction, and the experimental T (g) values fitted the Gordon-Taylor model well. The BET and Gordon-Taylor models were applied together to predict the critical moisture contents (i.e. 0.0464-0.0777 g water/g dry matter) and water activities (i.e. 0.032-0.241), above which the soy sauce powders become vulnerable to degradation and changes in their physicochemical properties.

AB Adolescent smoking and friendship networks are related in many ways that can amplify smoking prevalence. Understanding and developing interventions within such a complex system requires new analytic approaches. We draw on recent advances in dynamic network modeling to develop a technique that explores the implications of various intervention strategies targeted toward micro-level processes. Our approach begins by estimating a stochastic actor-based model using data from one school in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The model provides estimates of several factors predicting friendship ties and smoking behavior. We then use estimated model parameters to simulate the coevolution of friendship and smoking behavior under potential intervention scenarios. Namely, we manipulate the strength of peer influence on smoking and the popularity of smokers relative to nonsmokers. We measure how these manipulations affect smoking prevalence, smoking initiation, and smoking cessation. Results indicate that both peer influence and smoking-based popularity affect smoking behavior and that their joint effects are nonlinear. This study demonstrates how a simulation-based approach can be used to explore alternative scenarios that may be achievable through intervention efforts and offers new hypotheses about the association between friendship and smoking.

AB Using an equation-free analysis approach we identify a Hopf bifurcation point and perform a two-parameter continuation of the Hopf point for the macroscopic dynamical behavior of an interacting particle model. Due to the nature of systems with a moderate number of particles and noise, the quality of the available numerical information requires the use of very robust numerical algorithms for each of the building blocks of the equation-free methodology. As an example, we consider a particle model of a crowd of pedestrians where particles interact through pairwise "social forces." The pedestrians move along a corridor where they are constrained by the walls of the corridor, and two crowds are aiming, from opposite directions, to pass through a narrowing doorway perpendicular to the corridor. We focus our investigation on the collective behavior of the model. As the width of the doorway is increased, we observe an onset of oscillations of the net pedestrian flux through the doorway, described by a Hopf bifurcation. An equation-free continuation of the Hopf point in the two parameters, door width and ratio of the pedestrian velocities of the two crowds, is performed.

AB 1. Simple models were developed to explore the interaction between the lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) pest Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and its introduced braconid parasite Microctonus aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in New Zealand.
   2. A model for the population dynamics of S. discoideus demonstrated that observed levels of parasitism account for a decline in pest abundance, in spite of strong density-dependent mortality in the host.
   3. An empirical model for changes in parasitism from year to year, spanning five to six parasitoid generations each year, suggested that control is likely to be maintained in the long term and that the interaction is stable.
   4. Tentative values were established for the average searching efficiency of M. aethiopoides (approximately 0.25 m2  per parasitoid per generation) and for parameters governing pseudo-interference and a functional response to host density, based on analysis of discrete parasitoid generations.
   5. Based on experimental data and field temperatures, a simulation model of daily parasitoid behaviour over summer, when generations overlap, supported the hypothesis that atypically developing parasitoids are those oviposited in newly emerged adult weevils. The model accounted for the observed atypical summer build-up of parasitism which is essential for the success of biological control.
   6. The models suggested that biological control of S. discoideus is complementary to other forms of control, including other biological control agents, because subsequent levels of parasitism appear little affected by changes in pest density.
   7. It is argued that quantitative analysis of specific biological control case studies, both successful and unsuccessful, is a vital prerequisite for improvements in general biocontrol theory and practice.

ID COMMUNICATION; QUALITY; MODEL
AB Motivating language (ML) is a leader oral-communication strategy which has been significantly linked to such positive employee outcomes as higher job performance, increased job satisfaction, lower intention to turnover, and decreased absenteeism. However, most ML research has not targeted an organizational system at multiple levels. In brief, we have not looked at how this beneficial form of communication is actually implemented throughout an organization, including at the CEO level. In response to this gap, our main goals were to identify robust hypotheses on ML diffusion for future empirical testing, better understand the emergent processes of ML adoption within an organization, and advance development of related theory. These goals were achieved through an agent-based simulation model, drawn from management, communication, and social network scholarship. More specifically, overview, design concepts, and details protocol and NetLogo software were applied to simulate ML diffusion among all leader levels within an organization. This model also captured the influences of predicted moderators, and results were then interpreted to create testable hypotheses. Findings suggest that top-leader oral language use and organizational culture have the most profound impact on ML diffusion, followed by rewards, with partial weak support for the effects of training, turnover, and time. Recommendations were also made for future research on this topic, especially for empirical tests.

AB Aldehydes are relevant analytes in a wide range of samples, in particular, food and beverages but also body fluids. Hydrazines can undergo nucleophilic addition with aldehydes or ketones giving origin to hydrazones (a group of stable imines) that can be suitably used in the identification of aldehydes. Herein, 4-hydrazinobenzoic acid (HBA) was, for the first time, used as the derivatizing agent in analytical methodologies using liquid chromatography aiming the determination of low-molecular aldehydes. The derivatization reaction was simultaneously performed along with the extraction process, using gas-diffusion microextraction (GDME), which resulted in a clean extract containing the HBA-aldehyde derivates. The corresponding formed imines were determined by both high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) with UV spectrophotometric detection (HPLCUV) and capillary electrophoresis with diode array detection (CE-DAD). HBA showed to be a rather advantageous derivatization reagent due to its stability, relatively high solubility in water and other solvents, high selectivity and sensibility, reduced impurities, simple preparation steps and applicability to different separation and/or different detection techniques. Limits of detections (LODs) of the optimized methodologies (in terms of time and pH among other experimental variables) were all below 0.5 mg L-1, using both instrumental techniques. Furthermore, for the first time, the HBA-aldehyde derivatives were analyzed by LC with mass spectrometry (LC-MS), demonstrating the possibility of identification by MS of each compound. The developed methodologies were also successfully applied in the analysis of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde in several alcoholic beverages. This was also the first time GDME was combined with CE, showing that it can be a valuable sample preparation tool for electrophoresis, in particular by eliminating the interference of ions and inorganic constituents present in the samples.

AB In this work, we perform an in-depth experimental and computational study about the structure-directing effect of two new chiral organic quaternary ammonium dications bearing twoN-methyl-prolinol units linked by a xylene spacer inparaormetarelative orientation, displaying four enantiopure stereogenic centers in (S) configuration. Synthesis results show that thepara-xylene derivative is an efficient structure-directing agent, promoting the crystallization of ZSM-12 (in pure-silica composition), beta zeolite (as pure-silica, or in the presence of Al or Ge), and a mixture of polymorphs C, A and B of zeolite beta (in the presence of Ge). In contrast, themeta-xylene derivative showed a much poorer structure-directing activity, yielding only amorphous materials unless Ge is present in the gel, where beta and polymorph C (together with A and B) zeolites crystallized. Molecular simulations showed that thepara-xylene dication displays a cylindrical shape suitable for confining in zeolite pores, while themeta-xylene derivative has an angular shape that shifts from the typical dimensions required for 12MR zeolite channels. Despiteenantio-purity of thepara-xylene dication with (S,S,S,S) configuration, no enrichment in polymorph A of the zeolite beta samples obtained was observed by Transmission Electron Microscopy. With the aid of molecular simulations, the failure in transferring chirality to the zeolite is explained by the loose fit of this SDA in the large-pores of zeolite beta, and a lack of close geometrical fit with the chiral element of polymorph A, as evidenced by the very similar interaction of the cation with the two enantiomorphic space groups of polymorph A. Nevertheless, the molecular-level knowledge gained in this work can provide insights for the future design of more efficient SDAs towards the synthesis of chiral zeolites.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Targeting complementary pathways will achieve better treatment efficacy than a single agent high-dose strategy that could increase risk of side effects and tumor resistance. To target COX-2, 5-LOX, and ODC simultaneously, we tested the effects of a dual 5-LOX-COX inhibitor, licofelone, and an ODC inhibitor, DFMO, alone and in combination, on NNK-induced lung tumors in female A/J mice. Seven-week-old mice were treated with NNK (10 mu mol/mouse, single dose, i.p.) and randomized to different treatment groups. Three weeks after injection, mice were fed control or experimental diets (DFMO 1500/3000 ppm, licofelone 200/400 ppm, or a low-dose combination of 1500 ppm DFMO and 200 ppm licofelone) for 17 or 34 weeks. Both agents significantly inhibited tumor formation in a dose-dependent manner. As anticipated more adenomas and adenocarcinomas were observed at 17 and 34 weeks, respectively. Importantly, low dose combination of DFMO and licofelone showed more pronounced effects at 17 or 34 weeks in inhibiting the total tumor formation (similar to 60%, p < 0.0001) and adenocarcinoma (similar to 65%, p < 0.0001) compared to individual high dose of DFMO (similar to 44% and 46%, p < 0.0001) and licofelone (similar to 48% and 55%, p < 0.0001). DFMO and combination-treated mice lung tumors exhibited modulated ODC pathway components (Oat, Oaz, SRM, SMS, and SAT, p < 0.05) along with decreased proliferation (PCNA, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A) and increased expression of p53, p21 and p27 compared to mice fed control diet. Both DFMO and licofelone significantly inhibited tumor inflammatory markers. Our findings suggest that a low-dose combined treatment targeting inflammation and polyamine synthesis may provide effective chemoprevention.

ID CONSUMPTION; MODEL
AB We seek to establish the general empirical importance of investment-motivated saving. Our hypothesis is that inadequate financial intermediation will induce agents to save more in order to undertake lumpy physical investment in the future. The result is a positive relationship between the degree of capital market imperfection and the size of the private saving rate. A simulation exercise calibrated on Taiwan found a close match between the simulated and actual data. Regression analysis established that the private saving rate was negatively related to the level of financial market sophistication.

AB The coronavirus is a group of viruses found in animals as well as humans and have been detected since the 1960s. However, a newly identified form, SARS-CoV-2, has triggered a recent pandemic of respiratory disease now called COVID-19. There is currently no specific antiviral drug for the treatment of this pandemic, with most treatment strategies focused on symptomatic management and supportive therapy. As such, several drug discovery efforts are ongoing for potent treatment agents, with medicinal plants gradually gaining prominence. Approximately 80% of the South African population use traditional medicines to meet their primary health care needs. The current study aimed to identify potential COVID-19 therapeutic agents from a list of 29 bioactive compounds isolated from commonly used South African medicinal plants using molecular docking and molecular dynamics. Molecular docking identified arabic acid from Acacia senegal and L-canavanine found in Sutherlandia frutescens as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3C-like main protease. Similarly, hypoxoside isolated from Hypoxis hemerocallidea and uzarin from Xysmalobium undulatum, were identified as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymerase. These four bioactive compounds exhibited favourable binding orientations characterized by strong molecular interactions within respective inhibitors binding pockets of the target enzymes. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the binding of the identified inhibitors are characterized by structural perturbations which favour the inhibitory potency of these bioactive compounds. Additionally, in silico pharmacokinetic assessment of the compounds demonstrated favourable anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties. Although not conclusive, further experimental exploration of these compounds could serve as a starting point for the discovery of novel SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic. (C) 2020 SAAB.

AB Seventeen new amide/sulfonamide containing nimesulide derivatives were synthesized and characterized by several spectroscopic techniques and primarily investigated for their inhibitory potential on COX enzymes and other pro-inflammatory factors. Experimental analyses showed that among seventeen compounds, N8 and N10 have remarkable potency and selectivity for the COX-2 enzyme over COX-1 at very low doses as compared to nimesulide. Moreover, both N8 and N10 selectively reduced the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated COX-2 mRNA expression level while the COX-1 level remained stable. Both PGE2 release and nitric oxide production in macrophage cells were significantly suppressed by the N8 and N10 treatment groups. In silico ADME/Tox, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also conducted. Additionally, all compounds were also screened in a panel of cancer cell lines for their antiproliferative properties by MTT and SRB assays. Compound N17 exhibited a considerable antiproliferative effect on the colon (IC50: 9.24 mu M) and breast (IC50: 11.35 mu M) cancer cell lines. N17 exposure for 48 h decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and increased the expression of apoptogenic BAX. Besides, the BAX/BCL-2 ratio was increased with visible ultrastructural changes and apoptotic bodies under scanning electron microscopy. In order to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of selected hits on the target structures, multiscale molecular modeling studies are also conducted. Our combined in silico and in vitro results suggest that N8 and N10 could be further developed as potential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), while cytotoxic N17 might be studied as a potential lead compound that could be developed as an anticancer agent.

AB Monocyte migration into the vessel wall is an early step in atherogenesis. Even though a number of chemotactic factors have been identified, the regulation of the chemotactic response is not clearly understood. As the release of arachidonic acid has been implicated in monocyte chemotaxis, we studied the influence of LDL, which can supply this fatty acid to cells, on the chemotactic mobility of monocytes. Migration of human monocytic U937 cells was abolished by a 30-hour incubation in medium containing lipoprotein-depleted 10% fetal calf serum. Thereafter, human VLDL, LDL, acetyl LDL, methyl LDL, HDL, free cholesterol, linoleic acid, oleic acid, or arachidonic acid was added. At the end of varying incubation periods (0.5 to 8 hours), chemotaxis, viability, and cellular cholesterol content were measured. In the same experimental setting we also studied the effects of the pharmacological agents chloroquine, indomethacin, and acetylsalicylic acid on LDL-mediated chemotaxis. Chemotaxis was restored by LDL in a dose- and time-dependent manner starting at concentrations as low as 5 mu g/mL and at incubations;as brief as 30 minutes. The other lipoproteins tested (VLDL, HDL, acetyl LDL, and methyl LDL) as well as free cholesterol had no comparable effect on chemotaxis. Viability and total cholesterol content did not differ among the groups. Simultaneous incubation of cells with chloroquine, indomethacin, and acetylsalicylic acid reduced restitution of chemotaxis by LDL by 71%, 82%, and 68%, respectively. In contrast, the agents had only slight inhibitory effects on the chemotactic mobility of serum-fed control cells. Incubation with linoleic acid showed a 60% restoration of chemotaxis, whereas arachidonic acid stimulated chemotaxis by 140% compared with the positive control. Preincubation of LDL with the monoclonal antibody MB47 directed against LDL resulted in a significantly reduced migratory response. The data suggest a novel cyclooxygenase-dependent regulatory mechanism of chemotaxis by LDL.

AB The fundamental interactions of a series of chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants on amorphous silica particulates have been investigated with transmission infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The simulants methyl dichlorophosphate (MDCP), dimethyl cholorophosphate (DMCP), trimethyl phosphate (TMP), dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), and diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) were chosen to help develop a comprehensive understanding for how the structure and functionality of CWA surrogate compounds affect uptake and hydrogen-bond strengths at the gas-surface interface. Each simulant was found to adsorb molecularly to silica through the formation of strong hydrogen bonds primarily between isolated surface silanol groups and the oxygen atom of the P=O moiety in the adsorbate. The TPD data revealed that the activation energy for desorption of a single simulant molecule from amorphous silica varied slightly with coverage. In the limit of zero coverage and the absence of significant surface defects, the activation energies for desorption DMCP < TMP < DMMP < DIMP. This trend demonstrates the critical role of electron-withdrawing substituents in determining the adsorption energies through hydrogen-bonding interactions. The infrared spectra for each adsorbed species, recorded during uptake, showed a significant shift in the frequency of the v(SiO-H) mode as the hydrogen bonds formed. A clear linear relationship between the desorption energy and the shift of the surface v(SiO-H) mode across this series of adsorbates demonstrates that the Badger-Bauer relationship, established origninally for solute-solvent interactions, effectively extends to gas-surface interactions. High-level electronic structure calculations, including extrapolation to the complete basis set limit, reproduce the experimental energies of all simulants with high levels of accuracy and have been employed to provide insight into the molecular-level details of adsorption geometries for the simulants and to predict the interaction energies for the CWA isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (sarin).

AB Purpose: Our previous study revealed that simultaneously targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) additively or synergistically inhibited growth of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in vitro. However, an in vivo efficacy of this combined treatment in SCCHN has not been studied.
   Experimental Design: Nude mice were pretreated with control (1% Tween 80), ZD1839 (50 mg/kg) alone, celecoxib (50 mg/kg) alone, or a combination of ZD1839 and celecoxib at the same dosages for 7 days before injection of a human SCCHN cell line Tu212. The animals were continuously treated with the agents 5 days a week for about 11 weeks.
   Results: Tumor growth in the combined treatment was significantly inhibited compared with the control (P < 0.001), ZD1839 (P = 0.005), or celecoxib (P < 0.001). At the same time, a dramatic delay of tumor progression was observed in the combined treatment compared with all other three groups. Molecular analysis showed that the combined treatment significantly decreased prostaglandin E metabolite production. The cooperative effect of these two agents in combination was also associated with down-regulation of phosphorylated EGFR, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and phosphorylated signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 levels and reduction of vascular endothelial growth factor and Ki-67 expression. Specifically, gene silencing of both EGFR and COX-2 by small interfering RNA further confirmed the cooperative antitumor effect.
   Conclusion: The current results strongly suggest that a cooperative effect of the combined treatment on tumor progression is mediated through blocking both EGFR- and COX-2-related pathways. This combination regimen may provide a promising strategy for cancer therapy and chemoprevention in SCCHN.

AB Ultrasound contrast agents are now emerging as effective vehicles for delivering therapeutic agents to target tissues. In the present study, we used ultrasound-targeted, contrast-bound antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine with negative inotropic effects. We compared the efficacy of left ventricular vs. intravenous administration and determined the optimal time for delivery. WKY rats were treated with perfluorocarbon-exposed sonicated dextrose albumin (PESDA) microspheres incubated with 100 mug of antisense oligonucleotide directed against TNF-alpha. Contrast was infused into either the superior vena cava or the left ventricular cavity along with simultaneous application of ultrasound. Twenty-four hours later, the animals underwent 15 min of ischemia and 2 h reperfusion. Control animals underwent sham operation only, ischemia/reperfusion only, or received PESDA only. A second group received treatment just prior to, or immediately after the onset of ischemia. At the end of the experimental period, hearts were removed and analyzed for TNF-alpha by northern and western blotting. While no TNF-alpha expression was detected in sham-operated animals, robust expression of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein was seen in controls treated with ultrasound and PESDA alone. In contrast, intravenous or left ventricular administration of antisense oligonucleotides significantly inhibited ischemia/reperfusion-induced TNF-alpha expression. Direct delivery into the left ventricular cavity was more effective than intravenous administration, and delivery just prior to ischemia was most effective in attenuating TNF-alpha expression. Furthermore, attenuation of TNF-alpha expression also significantly inhibited other post-ischemic inflammatory mediators including IL-1beta and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Thus, ultrasound-targeted antisense oligonucleotides can effectively attenuate post-ischemic cytokine expression when delivered in a clinically relevant time frame, obviating the need for pretreatment.

AB Cyclosporin A is routinely used in transplant therapy following allogeneic or xenogeneic tissue transplantation to prevent rejection. This immunosuppressive drug is also neurotoxic; however, its mechanisms of action for neurotoxicity are poorly understood. Undifferentiated and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-induced differentiated neuroblastoma (NB) cells were used as an experimental model to study the toxicity of cyclosporin A. Results showed that cyclosporin A promoted the outgrowth of neurites and inhibited the growth of undifferentiated NB cells. When cyclosporin A was added simultaneously with R020-1724, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, or with prostaglandin E-1, a stimulator of adenylate cyclase, it markedly enhanced the growth inhibitory and differentiation effects of these cAMP-stimulating agents. In addition, cyclosporin A added to cAMP-induced differentiated NB cells caused dose-dependent degeneration of these cells as evidenced by the vacuolization of cytoplasm and the fragmentation of nuclear and cytoplasmic materials; however, neurites remained intact. Cyclosporin A alone did not alter the intensity of cell immunostaining for ubiquitin or beta-amyloid peptide (amino acids 1-14) (A beta(1-14)); however, it enhanced the intensity of staining for both ubiquitin and A beta in cells that were treated with cAMP-stimulating agents. The intensity of staining of amyloid precursor protein (amino acids 44-63) (APP(44-63)) did not change in any treated group, suggesting that the increase in A beta staining is due to increased processing of APP to A beta. We propose that one of the mechanisms of cyclosporin A-induced neurotoxicity involves increased levels of A beta and ubiquitin.

AB Virtual heritage architectural and cultural reconstructions may be enhanced by populating the environment with simulated people. There are a number of important human modeling issues to address, such as situationally appropriate clothing, occupations, and behaviors. Our interest here is focused on how people interact with portable items in their environment: namely, whether they are carrying items and what those items are. With an end goal of enabling lifelike, data-driven, agent-based populace simulations, we conducted an informal but systematic ethnographic observational study of the items carried by more than 3,000 people in two different urban community environments: an indoor market and an outdoor city plaza. We recorded the number and types of items carried by each person, along with their gender, estimated age category, and whether they were alone or in a group. We performed a basic statistical analysis of the results. There were two highly significant findings: (1) a strong and similar majority of all people carry at least one item (76.63% in the indoor setting and 79.79% in the outdoor setting); and (2) the types and amounts of items carried were highly consistent across the two different environments, implying that the data may be applicable in a wide range of scenarios.

ID ELECTRICITY MARKET
AB In the deregulated framework in place in most power systems, a significant part of the energy is traded through auctions on day-ahead markets where agents submit bids to either buy or sell energy. When defining a bidding strategy, generators usually resort to models that anticipate and simulate agent interactions. The residual demand curve (RDC), a well-known approach to representing competitor behaviour, enables generators to formulate effective oligopolistic strategies.
   One way to estimate and build an RDC is to use information available about other agents' bids on previous and comparable days as a reference, This basic approach to market modelling has proven useful in the past in European power exchanges. In the current context, however, characterised by substantial market penetration on the part of non-dispatchable renewable resources, the suitability of this method of RDC building may need to be tested.
   This paper first analyses how the results of day-ahead auctions on European power exchanges have been affected by the growing penetration of renewable energy. It then questions both the use of RDC as an approach in this changing context and the aforementioned simplified estimation method to compute these curves. The discussion is illustrated with empirical evidence from the Iberian market. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasound medical imaging (UMI) is the most widely used image analysis technique, and often requires advanced in-vitro set up to perform morphological and functional investigations. These studies are based on contrast properties both related to tissue structure and injectable contrast agents (CA). In this work, we present a three-dimensional structure composed of two different hydrogels reassembly the microvascular network of a human tissue. This phantom was particularly suitable for the echocontrastographic measurements in human microvascular system. This phantom has been characterized to present the acoustic properties of an animal liver, that is, acoustic impedance (Z) and attenuation coefficient (AC), in UMI signal analysis in particular; the two different hydrogels have been selected to simulate the target organ and the acoustic properties of the vascular system. The two hydrogels were prepared starting from cellulose derivatives to simulating the target organ parenchyma and using a PEG-diacrylate to reproduce the vascular system. Moreover, harmonic analysis was performed on the hydrogel mimicking the liver parenchyma hydrogel to evaluate the ultrasound (US) distortion during echographic measurement. The phantom was employed in the characterization of an experimental US CA. Perfect agreement was found when comparing the hydrogel acoustical properties materials with the corresponding living reference tissues (i.e., vascular and parenchimal tissue).

AB The inhibition impacts of two non-toxic glycine derivatives, namely, bicine (N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine) and tricine (N-(tri(hydroxymethyl)methyl) glycine) on copper corrosion were investigated in 3.5% NaCl solutions. Surprisingly, there is no report on using bicine and/or tricine as corrosion inhibitors for Cu and its alloys in a seawater-like environment. The effects of bicine and tricine on the corrosion behavior of Cu in 3.5% NaCl were examined using the open circuit potential, Tafel polarization, and AC spectroscopy (EIS) techniques. The corrosion rate decreased as a function of the inhibitor dose. The Tafel and EIS parameters showed that the inhibitors decreased both the anodic and cathodic corrosion currents and inhibited the charge transfer process by adsorption on the Cu surface. The inhibition property was attributed to the adsorption of inhibitor molecules with the Langmuir model. Tricine showed a superior inhibition performance of more than 98% at a concentration of similar to 5 mmol L-1. The free energy of adsorption data revealed physical adsorption. The outcomes of Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical studies well supported the experimental data.

AB Many clinical trials involve a sequential stopping rule to specify the conditions under which a study might be terminated earlier before its planned completion. The most important issue in the design stage is to determine common operating characteristics such as Type I and Type II error rates, for which crude Monte Carlo simulation methods are widely adopted. However, it is well known that crude Monte Carlo may lead to large variabilities in resultant estimates and excessive waste of computational resources. In this article, we propose an efficient importance sampling approach for determining Type I and Type II error rates in both fully sequential and group sequential clinical trial designs with either immediate responses or survival endpoints. The approach is insensitive to the underlying statistics of interest, and can be easily built into a general algorithm to evaluate error rates, determine sample sizes, test statistical hypotheses, and construct confidence intervals. Our Simulation results on a hypotensive agent trial and a modified Beta-Blocker Heart Attack Trial indicate that the proposed approach is not only superior to the crude Monte Carlo method, but may also provide many-fold savings in simulation cost.

AB The purpose of the present study is to provide a tool for an efficient design and synthesis of non-viral vectors for small RNA delivery. The effects of properties of the polycation, such as molecular weight, charge density and backbone structure, to polyplex structure and physicochemical behavior were systematically evaluated. The condensing agents, polyethylenimine (PEI), chitosan (CS) and poly(allylamine) (PM) were added to sRNA molecules at different N/P ratio. The efficiency of encapsulation and protection of sRNA, as well as polyplex size, zeta potential and morphology were followed and compared. The results show that PEI/sRNA polyplexes display a small size and positive zeta potential. However, for low molecular weights, this polycation is unable to protect sRNA in the presence of a decompacting agent. With chitosan, sRNA is efficiently compacted at high N/P ratios. The CS/sRNA complexes display small sizes, ca. 200 nm, positive surface charge and also good stability. Finally, the PAA/sRNA polyplexes were found to be the smallest at low N/P ratios, displaying a good encapsulation efficiency and high stability. A rationale for the experimental observations is provided using Monte Carlo simulation for systems with polycations of different length and charge density. The simulations showed that there is an interplay between the size of polycation chains and its charge density that define the degree of condensation for sRNA. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Nonionic surfactants of the Triton X-series find various applications in extraction processes and as solubilizing agents for the purification of membrane proteins. However, so far no optimized parameters are available to perform molecular simulations with a biomolecular force field. Therefore, we have determined the first optimized set of CHARMM parameters for the Triton X-series, enabling all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In order to validate the new parameters, micellar sizes (aggregation numbers) of Triton X-114 and Triton X-100 have been investigated as a function of temperature and surfactant concentration. These results are comparable with experimental results. Furthermore, we have introduced a new algorithm to obtain micelle structures from self-assembly MD simulations for the COSMOmic method. This model allows efficient partition behavior predictions once a representative micelle structure is available. The predicted partition coefficients for the systems Triton X-114/water and Triton X-100/water are in excellent agreement with experimental results. Therefore, this method can be applied as a screening tool to find optimal solute-surfactant combinations or suitable surfactant systems for a specific application.

AB Statistical association between congenital autism and prenatal exposure to ritodrine (4-(2-((1R,2S)-1-hydroxy-1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propan-2-ylamino)ethyl)phenol) as a tocolytic agent was a matter of concern. Moreover, neuronal nitric oxide momentous role in various behavioral and cognitive functions was reported. In this context, a correlation between prenatal exposures to ritodrine, neuronal nitric oxide level and autism occurrence must be investigated. For this reason, we proposed possible inhibition of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) by ritodrine. An insight toward our hypothesis approval was done through docking ritodrine into the catalytic pocket of nNOS. Apparently, ritodrine shared at least five critical binding interactions with a potent nNOS inhibitor (PDB code: JI7). Subsequent in vitro experiment pointed out that ritodrine indeed inhibited the enzymatic activity of nNOS at low micromolar level. As a conclusion, ritodrine should not be used as a tocolytic agent but as a novel non peptidomimetic nNOS inhibitor lead scaffold for future optimization.

AB Long-range dependence in volatility is one of the most prominent examples in financial market research involving universal power laws. Its characterization has recently spurred attempts to provide some explanations of the underlying mechanism. This paper contributes to this recent line of research by analyzing a simple market fraction asset pricing model with two types of traders - fundamentalists who trade on the price deviation from estimated fundamental value and trend followers whose conditional mean and variance of the trend are updated through a geometric learning process. Our analysis shows that agent heterogeneity, risk-adjusted trend chasing through the geometric learning process, and the interplay of noisy fundamental and demand processes and the underlying deterministic dynamics can be the source of power-law distributed fluctuations. In particular, the noisy demand plays an important role in the generation of insignificant autocorrelations (ACs) on returns, while the significant decaying AC patterns of the absolute returns and squared returns are more influenced by the noisy fundamental process. A statistical analysis based on Monte Carlo simulations is conducted to characterize the decay rate. Realistic estimates of the power-law decay indices and the (FI)GARCH parameters are presented.

AB Crowding effects relevant to the phase stability of binary mixtures of rod-like and spherical particles are investigated by means of Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric NPT ensemble. The two types of particles are represented, respectively, by freely rotating hard spherocylinders of a moderate aspect ratio (L/sigma = 5) and hard spheres of the same diameter sigma. Molar fractions of spheres ranging x(HS) = 0.00-0.37 are considered with the aim of characterizing the crowding effects on the liquid crystal phases of the hard spherocylinder fluid induced by the spherical component as depleting agent. We find that the addition of the spherical crowder is beneficial for the stabilization of the layers of the rod-like particles characteristic of the smectic phase. On the contrary, the addition of spheres has a negative impact upon the stability of the nematic phase, where the rod-like particles tend to align collectively parallel to each other. Interestingly, the spheres tend to arrange forming rod-like clusters in the nematic phase and lamellar structures in the smectic phase, which is compensated by the entropy gained by the spherocylinder particles in each phase. The main results are in qualitative agreement with recent experimental and theoretical studies and serve to test the prediction of current equations of state for these types of binary mixtures.

AB The conservation and protection of ancient buildings and art-works made of stone materials, that constitute the Cultural Heritage of each Country, are very delicate tasks involving different experts and disciplines. The most common and successful method for protecting the stone-made constructions and art-works consists in applying on their surfaces protective layers of polymers having oleo-hydrophobic character. Polymer materials themselves can undergo degradation if they interact with external agents, thus reducing their protective features. The durability of the protected stones is the subject of many investigations in the last decades, but, among the agents able to severely affect the treated stone substrates outdoor exposed, only little attention has been paid so far to the effects of bird droppings, also known as guano. This work would contribute to fill this gap, assessing the effects due to bird excreta on two kinds of stone (a very porous, Lecce stone, and a more compact, Trani stone) protected with an experimental polymer coating containing SiO2 nanoparticles in comparison with two commercial protective polymer products. Color, surface hydrophobicity, water vapor permeability, and capillary water absorption were evaluated before and after exposure to pancreatin, used to simulate bird droppings. Different behaviors were observed depending on the stone porosity and the nature of the polymer coating. Good performance was obtained using the coatings with nanoparticles.

AB Antimicrobial peptides are an important class of therapeutic agents used against a wide range of pathogens such as gram-negative and -positive bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The minimal inhibitory concentration at the level of the pathogen membrane is a major determinant of the pharmacokinetic behavior and, consequently, it can affect their antimicrobial activity. Here we generated quantitative structure-activity relationship models (3D-QSAR-comparative molecular field analysis/comparative molecular similarity indices analysis) using a database of 33 mastoparan analogs, antimicrobial peptides with known experimental activity, and further used these models to predict the minimal inhibitory concentration for 18 new mastoparan analogs, obtained by computational mutagenesis. We discuss two options for structural alignment of mastoparan analogs: superposition of C-alpha trace atoms or superposition of all backbone atoms. Significant values of the cross-validated correlation q (2) (higher than 0.60) and the fitted correlation r (2) (higher than 0.90) of our models indicate that they are reliable enough for activity prediction in the case of new derivatives. This allows us to identify compounds with possibly enhanced antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, which are suggested for further experimental studies.

AB Recent literature has developed the conjecture that important statistical features of stock price series, such as the fat tails phenomenon, may depend mainly on the market microstructure. This conjecture motivated us to investigate the roles of both the market microstructure and agent behavior with respect to high-frequency returns and daily returns. We developed two simple models to investigate this issue. The first one is a stochastic model with a clearing house microstructure and a population of zero-intelligence agents. The second one has more behavioral assumptions based on Minority Game and also has a clearing house microstructure. With the first model we found that a characteristic of the clearing house microstructure, namely the clearing frequency, can explain fat tail, excess volatility and autocorrelation phenomena of high-frequency returns. However, this feature does not cause the same phenomena in daily returns. So the Stylized Facts of daily returns depend mainly on the agents' behavior. With the second model we investigated the effects of behavioral assumptions on daily returns. Our study implicates that the aspects which are responsible for generating the stylized facts of high-frequency returns and daily returns are different. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The concrete used in making specimens of study was designed according to the ACI method 211.1, it was considered to design the concrete mixture a ratio w/c=0.65 (f'c=250 kg/cm(2)), two types of cement, ordinary portland cement (CPC 30R) and sulphate-resisting cement (CPC 30R RS), in the specimens were embedded as reinforcement bars of steel AISI 1018 and Galvanized steel. E-corr was evaluated according to the standard ASTM C-876-09 and the corrosion kinetics I-corr it was monitored by the technique of Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR), according to standard ASTM G-59-97(2009). The results of E-corr and I-corr correspond to 266 days of exposition in specimens to SP soil type contaminated with MgSO4 indicating with increasing concentration of aggressive agent to 3% it is considerably decreased the corrosion resistance of the concrete specimens produced with sulphate resisting cement and reinforced with galvanized steel.

AB While Reinforcement Learning (RL) is not traditionally designed for interactive supervisory input from a human teacher, several works in both robot and software agents have adapted it for human input by letting a human trainer control the reward signal. In this work, we experimentally examine the assumption underlying these works, namely that the human-given reward is compatible with the traditional RL reward signal. We describe an experimental platform with a simulated RL robot and present an analysis of real-time human teaching behavior found in a study in which untrained subjects taught the robot to perform a new task. We report three main observations on how people administer feedback when teaching a Reinforcement Learning agent: (a) they use the reward channel not only for feedback, but also for future-directed guidance; (b) they have a positive bias to their feedback, possibly using the signal as a motivational channel; and (c) they change their behavior as they develop a mental model of the robotic learner. Given this, we made specific modifications to the simulated RL robot, and analyzed and evaluated its learning behavior in four follow-up experiments with human trainers. We report significant improvements on several learning measures. This work demonstrates the importance of understanding the human-teacher/robot-learner partnership in order to design algorithms that support how people want to teach and simultaneously improve the robot's learning behavior.

AB This paper presents a new framework to synthesize humanoid behavior by learning and imitating the behavior of an articulated body using motion capture. The video-based motion capturing method has been developed mainly for analysis of human movement, but is very rarely used to teach or imitate the behavior of an articulated body to a virtual agent in an on-line manner. Using our proposed applications, new behaviors of one agent can be simultaneously analyzed and used to train or imitate another with a novel visual learning methodology. In the on-line learning phase, we propose a new way of synthesizing humanoid behavior based on on-line learning of principal component analysis (PCA) bases of the behavior. Although there are many existing studies which utilize PCA for object/behavior representation, this paper introduces two criteria to determine if the dimension of the subspace is to be expanded or not and applies a Fisher criterion to synthesize new behaviors. The proposed methodology is well-matched to both behavioral training and synthesis, since it is automatically carried out as an on-line long-term learning of humanoid behaviors without the overhead of an expanding learning space. The final outcome of these methodologies is to synthesize multiple humanoid behaviors for the generation of arbitrary behaviors. The experimental results using a humanoid figure and a virtual robot demonstrate the feasibility and merits of this method.

AB Currently, the potential to interfere with the pathology of beta-amyloid targeting a well-known drugable enzyme, the acetylcholinesterase (AChE), is opened. Peripheral or dual binding site inhibitors of AChE may simultaneously alleviate the cognitive and behavioral deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and, more importantly, act as disease-modifying agents delaying amyloid plaque formation. As part of a rational drug design program directed to find dual binding site AChE inhibitors, several families of compounds have been synthesized as potent AChE inhibitors. From these series, several drug candidates were selected based on their potent and selective inhibition of AChE (subnanomolar activity) and their interference with the P-amyloid aggregation in vitro (IC50 in the low micromolar range). First in vivo data confirm our initial hypothesis. Oral treatment with NP-61 for 3 months is able to reverse the cognitive impairment (Morris water maze test) and to reduce plaque load in the brains of human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (Swedish mutation). These results suggest that NP-61, a potent P-amyloid modulator, is able to reverse the AD-like neurodegenerative phenotype in transgenic mice, indicating a promising disease-modifying agent for clinical application.

AB The diagnostic capabilities of ultrasound imaging can be improved with contrast- specific nonlinear imaging modalities such as harmonic and subharmonic imaging. The nonlinear response of an encapsulated microbubble in an acoustic field is strongly influenced by the shell viscoelastic properties that are determined by the shell composition and thickness. In this paper, the subharmonic performance of a surfactant encapsulated microbubble was optimized by choosing the appropriate composition of shell material with the aid of theoretical model. To study the effects of viscoelastic properties of microbubble shell materials on the nonlinear scattered response of microbubbles, a theoretical model- modified Herring equation for the oscillation of encapsulated microbubbles in the ultrasound field was employed. Based on this model, a computer aided design system was developed to optimize and analyze the acoustic properties, particularly subharmonic responses, of microbubbles under different shell parameters. Furthermore, surfactant encapsulated microbubbles with different viscoelastic properties were prepared by changing the shell composition. Their shell viscoelastic behavior was measured indirectly as dilational modulus of monolayer film formed with surfactant molecular. Moreover, in vitro quantitative acoustic properties measurements of these microbubbles were carried out to evaluate their subharmonic performance. Both of the theoretical simulation and acoustic measurement showed that the surfactant encapsulated microbubbles with good subharmonic properties could be designed and prepared by adjusting the shell material composition with the guide of the computer aided design system.

AB Wealth and income inequality has attracted intensive interest in recent years due to its great significance both in reality and theory. Inspection on individual behaviors in a microscopic view would be useful in clarifying possible reasons for inequality and proper policies for reducing inequality and poverty. This paper presents an inhomogeneous agent-based model to explore the emergence of income inequality, in which individuals with varied qualities work, consume and invest. In despite of the small attribute difference for individuals, large income/wealth inequality and class differentiation naturally occur through a mechanism of capital (investment) income, which shares some analogy to the endogenous growth. The obtained income distribution is well described with an exponential law at smaller values and a power law at large values. Education, which is modeled as increasing the average productivity and decreasing the productivity width, is able to improve the equality and lower the Gini coefficient. The uplift of salary level hampers the speed of investment (industrialization) and the short-term income, but it brings long-term benefits of higher efficiency and equality. These results support the potential capacity of the model as a basic and open framework to investigate multifarious questions regarding income inequality. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB We report an experimental study of mouse sperm motility that shows chief aspects characteristic of neurons: the anesthetic (produced by tetracaine) and excitatory (produced by either caffeine or calcium) effects and their antagonic action. While tetracaine inhibits sperm motility and caffeine has an excitatory action, the combination of these two substances balance the effects, producing a motility quite similar to that of control cells. We also study the effects of these agents (anesthetic and excitatory) on the melting points of pure lipid liposomes constituted by 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) and dipalmitoyl phosphatidic acid (DPPA). Tetracaine induces a large fluidization of the membrane, shifting the liposomes melting transition temperature to much lower values. The effect of caffeine is null, but its addition to tetracaine-doped liposomes greatly screen the fluidization effect. A high calcium concentration stiffens pure lipid membranes and strongly reduces the effect of tetracaine. Molecular Dynamics Simulations are performed to further understand our experimental findings at the molecular level. We find a strong correlation between the effect of antagonic molecules that could explain how the mechanical properties suitable for normal cell functioning are affected and recovered.

AB The weak interface bonding strength between organic fibers and inorganic cement is the main challenge for organic fiber-enhanced cement due to the lack of necessary physical and chemical affinity. In order to improve the interface bonding strength between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) fibers and cement, SiO2 nanoparticles (SiO2 NPs) were grafted to high strength and high modulus PVA fibers using gamma-(2,3-epoxypropoxy) propytrimethoxysilane (KH560) as coupling agent. The grafted-PVA fibers were endowed with a Nano-rough surface and high chemical reactivity with cement. The orthogonal experimental results show that the optimal grafting rate between SiO2 NPs and PVA fibers was 8.5 wt% with reaction time of 2 h, reaction temperature of 110 degrees C, and catalyst weight percentage of 10 wt%. With SiO2-grafted PVA fibers as the enhancement, their tensile strength and pullout bonding strength in cement increased up to 21% and 43% compared with pure PVA fibers, respectively. The enhancement of interfacial behavior between PVA fiber and cement was further evidenced by the finite element analysis and simulation. In conclusion, grafting SiO2 NPs on PVA fibers can improve the interfacial bonding strength toward cement under small deformation, which implied the enhanced reinforcement and crack resistance for cement. This effect was primarily attributed to the synergistic friction and chemical bonding forces between SiO2 NPs and cement.

AB Natural swarms can be formed by various creatures. The swarms can conduct demanded behaviors to adapt to their living environments, such as passing through harsh terrains and protecting each other from predators. At micrometer and nanometer scales, formation of a swarm pattern relies on the physical or chemical interactions between the agents owing to the absence of an on-board device. Independent pattern formation of different swarms, especially under the same input, is a more challenging task. In this work, a swarm of nickel nanorods is proposed and by exploiting its different behavior with the nanoparticle swarm, independent pattern formation of diverse microrobotic swarms under the same environment can be conducted. A mathematical model for the nanorod swarm is constructed, and the mechanism is illustrated. Two-region pattern changing of the nanorod swarm is discovered and compared with the one-region property of the nanoparticle swarm. Experimental characterization of the nanorod swarm pattern is conducted to prove the concept and validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. Furthermore, independent pattern formation of different microrobotic swarms was demonstrated. The pattern of the nanorod swarm could be adjusted while the other swarm was kept unchanged. Simultaneous pattern changing of two swarms was achieved as well. As a fundamental research on the microrobotic swarm, this work presents how the nanoscale magnetic anisotropy of building agents affects their macroscopic swarm behaviors and promotes further development on the independent control of microrobotic swarms under a global field input.

AB It is expected that robots of the future will coexist and interact with humans in places such as homes and offices. In order to make the interaction of service robots with humans safe and effective, new technologies must be developed, ranging from physical material design for robot bodies, to intelligent controllers. Simulation provides a convenient and efficient research environment for design, testing and implementation of service robots. This paper presents a simulated world that includes a realistic simulated human and a simulated robot which delivers and hands over an object to the human. The human is made realistic by being modeled using physiological data and anthropomorphic equations of motion. The robot's design is also based upon realistic specifications. The robot's intelligence is achieved through a number of independent software agents that contend for the robot's behavior production, named Contention Architecture. The proposed actions of the autonomous agents are evaluated based on a number of criteria so as to select one action to be taken by the robot. The experimental results of the interaction between human and robot through the task of handover is presented. It is shown that the robot is not only capable of performing the task effectively, but is also able to compensate for the unexpected movements of the human, while allowing no harm to come to the person through physical contact.

AB Background: African trypanosomiasis, also known as "sleeping sickness" in humans and "nagana" in livestock is an important vector-borne disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. Control of trypanosomiasis has focused on eliminating the vector, the tsetse fly (Glossina, spp.). Effective tsetse fly control planning requires models to predict tsetse population and distribution changes over time and space. Traditional planning models have used statistical tools to predict tsetse distributions and have been hindered by limited field survey data.
   Methodology/results: We developed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to provide timing and location information for tsetse fly control without presence/absence training data. The model is driven by daily remotely-sensed environment data. The model provides a flexible tool linking environmental changes with individual biology to analyze tsetse control methods such as aerial insecticide spraying, wild animal control, releasing irradiated sterile tsetse males, and land use and cover modification.
   Significance: This is a bottom-up process-based model with freely available data as inputs that can be easily transferred to a new area. The tsetse population simulation more closely approximates real conditions than those using traditional statistical models making it a useful tool in tsetse fly control planning.

AB This paper revisits the Kareken-Wallace model of exchange rate formation in a two-country overlapping generations world. Following the seminal paper by Arifovic [Journal of Political Economy 104 (1996) 510] we investigate a dynamic version of the model in which agents' decision rules are updated using genetic algorithms. Our main interest is in whether the equilibrium dynamics resulting from this learning process helps to explain the main stylized facts of free-floating exchange rates (unit roots in levels together with fat tails in returns and volatility clustering). Our time series analysis of simulated data indicates that for particular parameterizations, the characteristics of the exchange rate dynamics are, in fact, very similar to those of empirical data. The similarity appears to be quite insensitive with respect to some of the ingredients of the genetic algorithm (i.e. utility-based versus rank-based or tournament selection, binary or real coding). However, appearance or not of realistic time series characteristics depends crucially on the mutation probability (which should be low) and the number of agents (not more than about 1000). With a larger population, this collective learning dynamics looses its realistic appearance and instead exhibits regular periodic oscillations of the agents' choice variables. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

SO AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS

DT Article
DE Robustness; Irrational agents; Incentive mechanism; Reputation system;
   Electronic marketplace
AB In game theoretical analysis of incentive mechanisms, all players are assumed to be rational. Since it is likely that mechanism participants in the real world may not be fully rational, such mechanisms may not work as effectively as in the idealized settings for which they were designed. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the robustness of incentive mechanisms against various types of agents with bounded rational behaviors. Such evaluations would provide us with the information needed to choose mechanisms with desired properties in real environments. In this article, we first propose a general robustness measure, inspired by research in evolutionary game theory, as the maximal percentage of invaders taking non-equilibrium strategies such that the agents sustain the desired equilibrium strategy. We then propose a simulation framework based on evolutionary dynamics to empirically evaluate the equilibrium robustness. The proposed simulation framework is validated by comparing the simulated results with the analytical predictions based on a modified simplex analysis approach. Finally, we implement the proposed simulation framework for evaluating the robustness of incentive mechanisms in reputation systems for electronic marketplaces. The results from the implementation show that the evaluated mechanisms have high robustness against a certain non-equilibrium strategy, but is vulnerable to another strategy, indicating the need for designing more robust incentive mechanisms for reputation management in e-marketplaces.

   CONSENSUS
AB Fully active electrohydraulic control of a quarter-car test rig is considered from both a modelling and experimental point of view. This paper develops a nonlinear active hydraulic design for the active suspension system, which improves the inherent trade-off between ride quality and suspension travel. The novelty is in the use of pole assessment controller to drive a nonlinear active suspension with a new insight into the model through consideration of a new term, friction forces. Therefore, this model has taken into account the dynamic inclination angle (alpha -/+Delta alpha) between linkage and actuator regardless of the fact that the designer made an only vertical motion (bounce mode) of the wheel and body units. The second contribution of this paper is that it investigated the control force generation, therefore, the nonlinear hydraulic actuator whose effective bandwidth depends on the magnitude of the suspension travel, which incorporates the dynamic equation of servovalve, is deeply researched. The nonlinear friction model is accurately established, which relies on the dynamics system analysis and the fact of slipping the body on lubricant supported bearings; this model will caption all the friction behaviours that have been observed experimentally. In addition, the hydraulic system is used to generate the system inputs as a road simulator. The controller smoothly shifts its focus between the conflicting objectives of ride comfort and rattle space utilisation, softening the suspension when suspension travel is small and stiffening it as it approaches the travel limits. Thus, the nonlinear design allows the closed-loop system to behave differently in different operating regions. The improvement achieved with our design is illustrated through comparative experiments and simulations. C++ compiler environment is used to simulate the physical system to be controlled. The results show good servo control and fast regulation of abrupt disturbances.

AB Purpose: Despite a large public health interest in substance use among athletes, only a few works have addressed illicit drug use in relation with sport practice. We have studied cannabis use to enhance both sportive and non-sportive performance among French sport university students.
   Methods: An anonymous self-reported questionnaire was administered to a sample of students from six Sport Science Universities from Southern France. Information on sport practice and cannabis use (frequency, quantity, motives) was collected.
   Results: Males were more prone to have already used cannabis to enhance non-sportive performance as well as sportive performance. The simultaneous equation model indicated that both kinds of enhancing-substance use were endogenous: cannabis use to enhance sportive performance leads to cannabis use to enhance non-sportive performance and reciprocally. Moreover, the relaxing properties of cannabis may be frequently used to enhance performance. Cannabis use to enhance sportive performance was positively related to the competitive level and to sliding sports.
   Conclusions: The present study helps to improve understanding on an empirical paradox about the relationship between doping agents use and so-called 'recreational' drug use among athletes. Indeed, people who use doping agents may also use 'recreational' drugs for a 'non-recreational' purpose. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Tissue mimicking phantoms have been widely reported to be an important tool for development, optimisation and performance testing of ultrasound-based diagnostic techniques. In particular, modern applications of tissue mimicking phantoms often include characterisation of the nonlinear behaviour of experimental ultrasound contrast agents. In such cases, the tissue-mimicking materials should be chosen not only based on the values of their density, speed of sound and attenuation coefficient, but also considering their effect on the appearance of "native harmonics" due to nonlinear distortion of ultrasound signal during propagation. In a previous paper it was demonstrated that a cellulose-based hydrogel is suitable to simulate nonlinear acoustical behaviour of liver tissue for thicknesses up to 8 cm. In this paper we present the experimental characterisation of the nonlinear acoustical behaviour of a different polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA)-based hydrogel, in order to assess whether and how it can improve the performances and overcome some limitations of the cellulose-based hydrogel as liver tissue-mimicking material. Samples of pig liver tissue, cellulose-based hydrogel and PEGDA-based hydrogel were insonified in a through-transmission set-up, employing 2.25-MHz pulses with different mechanical index (MI) values. Second harmonic and first harmonic amplitudes were extracted from the spectra of received signals and their difference was then used to compare sample behaviours. Obtained results show how a new more accurate and combined experimental model of linear and nonlinear acoustical behaviour of liver tissue is feasible. In fact, a further confirmation of the cellulose-based hydrogel effectiveness to precisely simulate the liver tissue for penetration depths up to 8 cm was provided, and it was also shown that the employment of the PEGDA-based hydrogel can extend the range of useful tissue-mimicking material thicknesses up to 11 cm, moreover allowing a considerable improvement of the time stability and behaviour reliability of the corresponding manufactured phantoms.

AB Under transportation network supply and demand uncertainty, travel time reliability emerges from non-linear interactions among numerous travellers who are driven by self-interest, learn and adapt in changing situations, and therefore can be modelled as an emergent network property. This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework for the study of complexity regarding travel time reliability on the basis of empirically derived individual decision rules, and develops an agent-based evolutionary model for travel time reliability analysis. Findings show that actual route choice behaviours related to network reliability are often non-optimal, and that these behaviours themselves are important determinants of travel time reliability under network supply and demand uncertainty. While many travellers search for alternative routes under uncertainty, few travellers actually change routes. Route choice rules employed by travellers can successfully improve travel time reliability in most tested uncertainty scenarios, but they do not necessarily reduce absolute travel time. While reducing demand uncertainty improves travel time and planning under uncertainty, the model provides a theoretically sound tool for analysing the impact of traveller information systems on individual travel behaviour and network performance. It can also serve as an empirically estimated router for microscopic traffic simulators or act as a behavioural assignment algorithm for activity-based travel demand models.

AB Aim of this work was to perform simulated measurements of the magnetic behavior of a novel class of bimodal nanosized contrast agents (CAs), made of a silica core covered by smaller superparamagnetic nanoparticles (NPs) and designed to be detected through both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in order to compare their performance in terms of MRI signal enhancement with that of the superparamagnetic NPs alone. The considered bimodal nanocomposites consisted of 330-nm silica nanospheres covered by either superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs or dumbbell-like FePt-IO nanocrystals. We simulated the MRI signal generated by each of the considered CAs during a brain venography in standard clinical conditions. Quantitative assessments of signal enhancement were carried out as a function of the main model parameters. The performed numerical simulations showed that the magnetic response of the novel nanocomposites was similar or better compared to that of the superparamagnetic NPs alone for echo times longer than 20 ms, leading to an easier detection of smaller vessels. Obtained results suggest that the bimodal NPs have an exciting potential for the development of innovative clinical protocols for multimodal imaging, combining quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow and targeted molecular imaging of specific diseases.

AB Asphaltenes represent the heaviest fraction of crude oils, being recognized by their tendency to self-associate and precipitate. Asphaltene precipitation and subsequent deposition can cause problems in all stages of production. The objective of this paper is to model Brazilian crude oil and asphaltene systems using the PC-SAFT equation of state. Asphaltenes were extracted from crude oil through the addition of different n-alkanes. The PC-SAFT was capable of accurately predicting liquid density for toluene and asphaltenes and boiling point elevation for crude oil at different concentrations of toluene. Asphaltene precipitation from model oil allowed us to evaluate the influence of binary interaction parameters on modeling results. The influence of precipitant agent (n-hexane and n-heptane) on the asphaltene phase behavior was analyzed, showing that n-hexane was able to precipitate more asphaltenes than n-heptane, as expected. Furthermore, simulated results are in agreement with experimental observations: the average relative errors are 3.75 % and 10.25 % for the weight percentage of precipitated asphaltene using n-hexane and n-heptane as precipitant, respectively.

AB The application of Building Information Modeling can break the barrier between project owner and contractor. However, its application may cause an interest conflict between them. The conflict is focusing on the scramble for potential benefits brought by information asymmetry, and it may hinder the application of BIM in reverse. Focusing on information asymmetry, this research analyzed the interaction between BIM's promotion and project owner, contractor's interest game by combining Asymmetric Information theory and game theory. Based on the description of the interest conflict process, this research built a modified Principal-Agent model. By numerical analysis, it is proved that through BIM's effect of reducing information asymmetry in project, BIM's negative impact on contractors profit may let contractor refuse BIM's contract which will finally lead to the failure of BIM's promotion. Then, this research simulated the interest conflict by using the modified PA model. Through comparative analysis on the results, this research suggested: 1) project owners should choose BIM at proper stage but not the most advanced one, 2) contractor's effort cannot be ignored when promoting BIM, 3) variety of policies should be made in order to deal with specific problems when promoting BIM at different stages.

AB Through the development and usage of an agent-based model, this article investigates firms' adaptive strategies against disruptions in a supply chain network. Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a real-world supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies.

AB An advanced vision of the mRNA translation is presented through a hybrid modeling approach. The dynamics of the polysome formation was investigated by computer simulation that combined agent based model and fine-grained Markov chain representation of the chemical kinetics. This approach allowed for the investigation of the polysome dynamics under non-steady-state and non-continuum conditions. The model is validated by the quantitative comparison of the simulation results and Luciferase protein production in cell-free system, as well as by testing of the hypothesis regarding the two possible mechanisms of the Edeine antibiotic. Calculation of the Hurst exponent demonstrated a relationship between the microscopic properties of amino acid elongation and the fractal dimension of the translation duration time series. The temporal properties of the amino acid elongation have indicated an anti persistent behavior under low mRNA occupancy and evinced the appearance of long range interactions within the mRNA-ribosome system for high ribosome density. The dynamic and temporal characteristics of the polysomal system presented here can have a direct impact on the studies of the co-translation protein folding and provide a validated platform for cell-free system studies.

AB Thermal effects in a H2O and CO2 assisted tubular direct carbon solid oxide fuel cell (DC-SOFC) are numerically investigated. Parametric simulations are further conducted to study the effects of operating potential, the distance between carbon and anode, inlet gas temperature, and anode inlet gas flow rate on the thermal behaviors of the fuel cell. It is found that the fuel cell with H2O as gasification agent performs considerably better than the cell with CO2 as gasification agent in all cases. It is also found that the temperature field of the fuel cell is highly uneven. The breakdown of the heat sources in the fuel cell shows that the H2O assisted DC-SOFC has much higher heat generation and consumption than the CO2 assisted cell. Interestingly, a thermal neutral voltage is observed, at which no heating or cooling of the cell is needed. In addition, the distance between the anode and the carbon layer is required to be as small as possible, which improves the temperature uniformity of the fuel cell. The results of this study demonstrates the importance of thermal effects in DC-SOFCs and form a solid foundation for DC-SOFC thermal management. (C) 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

DE Neural representation; Neuronal packet hypothesis; Phenotypic
   representation; Markov blankets; Active inference; Free-energy principle
AB The aim of this paper is to leverage the free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference, to develop a generic, generalizable model of the representational capacities of living creatures; that is, a theory of phenotypic representation. Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns of ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory input or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological systems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of living creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and nonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information geometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal states to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive) external states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and emergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet hypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent representation, we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing ensembles of active inference agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic generative model are able to encode recoverable information about a stimulus array.

AB Leaf beetles Gastrophysa viridula have attracted recently increased research interest from various points of view, since they are: (i) pest insects in rhubarb crops; (ii) potential biocontrol agents of dock plants Rumex spp. in grasslands; and (iii) a model species in ecological studies on insect population dynamics, biochemistry, behavior, biomechanics and biomimetics. The continuous rearing of beetles at standardized conditions may help to unify the fitness state of different individuals, allowing a better comparison of experimental results. The present communication suggests a modular space- and time-saving rearing method of G. viridula in stackable faunariums under laboratory conditions, which has been successfully established and continuously used over the last 5 years. Several developmental stages were kept in separate boxes, and multiple generations were kept simultaneously, depending on the required number of beetles.

AB Reducing gas hold-up has been identified as a key objective to improve the performance of Syncrude's LC-Finer(SM) unit. Redesign of the liquid recycle pan in the freeboard region, aided by multiphase CFD simulation and tests in a kerosene cold model experimental system, led to reduced gas hold-ups. The addition of an anti-foam agent did not provide any improvement. Cold-flow dimensional similitude tests demonstrated the importance of gas density, distributor geometry, and interfacial phenomena. Grid redesign was undertaken to diminish swirl and provide improved radial distribution of gas. Dispersion tests indicate favourable catalyst mixing in the reactors.

TI Field validation of a free-agent cellular automata model of fire spread

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
LA English
DT Article
ID ANOMALOUS DIFFUSION; SIMULATING FIRE; GRASS FIRES; DYNAMICS; WIND
AB A cellular automata fire model represents 'elements' of fire by autonomous agents. A few simple algebraic expressions substituted for complex physical and meteorological processes and solved iteratively yield simulations for 'super-diffusive' fire spread and coupled surface-layer (2-m) fire-atmosphere processes. Pressure anomalies, which are integrals of the thermal properties of the overlying heated plume, drive the surface winds around and through the fire. Five simulations with differing fuel and wind conditions were compared with fire and meteorological data from an experimental grassfire (FireFlux). The fire model accurately simulated bulk patterns of measured time-series of 2-m winds at two towers and observed fire behaviour (spread rate, flaming depth and heat released). Fidelity to spatial windfields in the vicinity of the fire was similar to results from full-physics fire models for other grassfires. Accurate predictions of fire spread depend critically on accurate wind speeds and directions at the location of the fire. Simulated fire-atmosphere coupling using FireFlux data increased wind speeds across the fire line by up to a factor of three. With its computational speed relative to full-physics models, the fire model can inform full-physics modellers regarding problems of interest. Although the fire model is tested for homogeneous fuels on flat terrain, the model is designed for simulating complex distributions of fire within heterogeneous distributions of fuels over complex landscapes.

TI Calibrating an agent-based model of longitudinal human activity patterns

SO JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY

DT Article
ID EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT; VARIABILITY; AGGREGATE; DIETARY
AB Patterns of human behavior over extended periods of time are important for characterizing human exposure to hazardous chemicals. Because longitudinal behavior patterns for an individual are difficult to obtain, exposure-assessors have characterized such patterns by linking daily records from multiple individuals. In an earlier publication, we developed an alternative strategy that was based on agent-based simulation modeling. Specifically, we created a software program, Agent-Based Model of Human Activity Patterns (ABMHAP), that generates year-long longitudinal behavior patterns. In this paper, we both calibrate and evaluate ABMHAP using human behavior data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Consolidated Human Activity Database (CHAD). We use the longitudinal data (data on individuals' activities over multiple days) in CHAD to parameterize ABMHAP, and we use single-day behavior data from CHAD to evaluate ABMHAP predictions. We evaluate ABMHAP's ability to simulate sleeping, eating, commuting, and working (or attending school) for four populations: working adults, nonworking adults, school-age children, and preschool children. The results demonstrate that ABMHAP, when parameterized with empirical data, can capture both interindividual and intraindividual variation in behaviors in different types of individuals. We propose that simulating annual activity patterns via ABMHAP may allow exposure-assessors to characterize exposure-related behavior in ways not possible with traditional survey methods.

TI Cooperative dynamics of snowdrift game on spatial distance-dependent

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B
LA English
DT Article
AB We investigate the evolution of cooperative behaviors of small-world networking agents in a snowdrift game mode, where two agents (nodes) are connected with probability depending on their spatial Euclidean lattice distance in the power-law form controlled by an exponent alpha. Extensive numerical simulations indicate that the game dynamics crucially depends on the spatial topological structure of underlying networks with different values of the exponent alpha. Especially, in the distance-independent case of alpha=0, the small-world connectivity pattern contributes to an enhancement of cooperation compared with that in regular lattices, even for the case of having a high cost-to-benefit ratio r. However, with the increment of alpha > 0, when r >= 0.4, the spatial distance-dependent small-world (SDSW) structure tends to inhibit the evolution of cooperation in the snowdrift game.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This paper focuses on investigating financial asset returns' extreme risks, which are defined as the negative log returns over a certain threshold. A simple agent-based model is constructed to explain the behavior of the market traders when extreme risks occur. We consider both the volatility clustering and the heavy tail characteristics when constructing the model. Empirical study uses the China securities index 300 daily level data and applies the method of simulated moments to estimate the model parameters. The stationarity and ergodicity tests provide evidence that the proposed model is good for estimation and prediction. The goodness-of-fit measures show that our proposed model fits the empirical data well. Our estimated model performs well in out-of-sample Value-at Risk prediction, which contributes to the risk management.

AB A mathematical model was proposed to describe the behavior of liquid emulsion membranes for the extraction of penicillin G in a continuous countercurrent mixing column. A polyamine-type surfactant acts not only as carrier but also as surface-stabilizing agent; thus the influence of surfactant on extraction should be considered in mathematical modeling when its effect is significant. The proposed model takes into account the influence of surfactant on mass transfer. The advancing front model was employed for deriving the overall mass transfer coefficient in the emulsion globule, and the axial dispersion model was applied to the external feed phase. The experimental data were compared with the proposed model, the calculations without considering the contribution of the surfactant to extraction, and the calculations without considering diffusion in the emulsion phase.

AB Osmotic dehydration (OD) is generally used as a pre-treatment for the dehydration of food before they are subjected to further processing such as freezing and drying. OD is an effective way for reducing product water content. Immersion of fish in concentrated brines is a widely used preservation technique. The aim of this study was to optimize the mass transfer occurred during the OD of sardine sheets (SS) by surface response methodology. Experimental groups (EG) of four SS each were set up and pre-weighed. One EG was used to determine initial moisture and salt content. The EG were simultaneously immersed in a predetermined brine solution and temperature according to a composite central design. The brine solutions and temperatures were 17.1; 19; 22; 25, 26.9% and 29, 30, 32, 34, 35 degrees C respectively. The EG were withdrawn from each brine solution at 115, 140, 180, 220 and 245 min of immersion. Each SS was weighed and final moisture and salt content were determined, then water and mass loss, and salt gain were calculated. Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and multiple lineal regressions to obtaining the models. The optimum zone was obtained by plotting the models and over imposing the contour plots of the maximum water loss and salt gain with the minimum mass loss. The optimum zone was found at 26.5% of brine solution, 31.6-31.8 degrees C of temperature and 245 min of immersion. In this zone the water loss, mass loss and salt gain were 0.26, 0.145, 0.187 g/g respectively.

ID STOCK-MARKET; CHAOS; BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICS; AGENTS; MODEL
AB This paper aims to contribute to the literature on the explanatory power of behavior models with heterogeneous agents. The authors present a new nonlinear structural stock market model which is a nonlinear deterministic process buffeted by dynamic noise. An exogenous noise is introduced to the model with the assumption of IID normal innovations of the fundamental value in order to investigate how noisy dynamics interacts with deterministic process. The market is composed of two typical trader types: the rational fundamentalists and the boundedly rational traders governed by greed and fear. The interaction between noise and deterministic element determines the evolution process of the system as key parameters are changed. The authors find the model is able to generate time series that exhibit dynamical and statistical properties closely resembling those of the S&P500 index, such as volatility clustering, fat tails (leptokurtosis), autocorrelation in square and absolute return, larger amplitude, crashes and bubbles. The authors also investigate the nonlinear dependence structure in our data. The results indicate that the GARCH-type model cannot completely account for all nonlinearity in our simulated market, which is thus consistent with the results from real markets. It seems that the nonlinear structural model is more powerful to give a satisfied explanation to market behavior than the traditional stochastic approach.

AB We consider a typical realization of a qubit as a single particle in two-path interferometric circuits built from phase shifters, beam splitters and detectors. This framework is often taken as a standard example illustrating various paradoxes and quantum effects, including non-locality. In this paper we show that it is possible to simulate the behaviour of such circuits in a classical manner using stochastic gates and two kinds of particles, real ones and ghosts, which interact only locally. The model has built-in limited information gain and state disturbance in measurements which are blind to ghosts. We demonstrate that predictions of the model are operationally indistinguishable from the quantum case of a qubit, and allegedly 'non-local' effects arise only on the epistemic level of description by the agent whose knowledge is incomplete due to the restricted means of investigating the system.

And also, the cytotoxicity of materials used in the experiment was evaluated. Nano-HAp types were synthesized by the precipitation method. Forty dentin specimens were randomly divided into five groups of; 1no treatment (control), 2specimens treated with 10% pure nano-HAp and 3, 4, 5 specimens treated with 1%, 2%, and 3% F(-)doped 10% nano-HAp, respectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of the materials used; pH, FTIR, and scanning electron microscopy evaluations were performed before and after degredation in simulated body fluid. To determine cytotoxicity of the materials, MTT assay was performed. Statistical evaluations were performed with F and t tests. All of the nano-HAp materials used in this study built up an effective covering layer on the dentin surfaces even with plugs in tubules. It was found that this layer had also a resistance to degradation. None of the evaluated nano-HAp types were have toxicity. Fluoride doping showed a positive effect on physical and chemical stability until a critical value of 1% F-. The all evaluated nano-HAp types may be effectively used in dentin hypersensitivity treatment. The formed nano-HAp layers were seem to resistant to hydrolic deletion. The pure and 1% F(-)doped nano-HAp showed the highest biocompatibility thus it was assessed that pure and 1% F(-)doped materials may be used as an active ingredient in dentin hypersensitivity agents.

AB The nonlinear response of gas bubbles to acoustic excitation is an important phenomenon in both the biomedical and engineering sciences. In medical ultrasound imaging, for example, microbubbles are used as contrast agents on account of their ability to scatter ultrasound nonlinearly. Increasing the degree of non-linearity, however, normally requires an increase in the amplitude of excitation, which may also result in violent behaviour such as inertial cavitation and bubble fragmentation. These effects may be highly undesirable, particularly in biomedical applications, and the aim of this work was to investigate alternative means of enhancing nonlinear behaviour. In this preliminary report, it is shown through theoretical simulation and experimental veri. cation that depositing nanoparticles on the surface of a bubble increases the nonlinear character of its response significantly at low excitation amplitudes. This is due to the fact that close packing of the nanoparticles restricts bubble compression.

ID PYROLYSIS; WASTE; PP
AB In this study, NiO reduction behavior was investigated in the gas atmosphere generated by polypropylene (PP) pyrolysis to reveal the feasibility of using polypropylene as a reducing agent precursor for metal oxides. Chemical equilibrium calculations were performed to guide the experimental studies and to better understand the processes. PP fibers and NiO powder were simultaneously heated to 600-900 K in a tubular reactor. During heating, the PP was pyrolyzed into the gaseous species as indicated by the mass measurements. NiO was reduced to Ni by the pyrolytic gas carried by Ar flow. The thermodynamic calculations predicted that the pyrolytic gas consisted of mainly H-2, CH4, and C6H6. The degree of NiO reduction increased with temperature and with the pyrolyzed the PP mass. The oxide reduction was complete at 800-900 K, provided that the sufficient amount of PP was pyrolyzed. The results show that NiO reduction via PP pyrolysis route is feasible.

AB Rare earth oxysulfides obtained from the activation of rare earth oxides were effective catalysts for the simultaneous reduction of SO, and NO by CO to elemental S. The most active catalysts were Sm2O2S and Nd2O2S, over which a conversion of >95% for both SO2 and NO was obtained at 475 degreesC. Exceptional behavior was observed over CeO2, which showed a low activity for desulfurization, but a high activity for denitrification. The seperating experimental results showed that COS was an intermediate not only for the reduction of SO2 by CO but also for the reduction of NO by CO. Thus, a COS intermediate mechanism was proposed to describe the simultaneous reaction. Based on the mechanism, the difference among the activities of the rare earth oxides was discussed.

AB Electromigration behavior of metal ions in the presence of high concentrations of polyethylene glycol as a complexing agent was investigated under acidic non-buffered conditions. Simulation of the isotachophoretic steady state of the system containing the neutral polymer was performed. Both the complexation and the influence of viscosity on the electrophoretic mobility were taken into account. Good agreement between the calculated results and the experimentally obtained values was achieved. Based on the theoretical model, a new approach for the estimation of polymer-metal stability constants from experimental isotachophoretic data was proposed. Stability constants of Li+, Na+, Cs+, Mg2+, Sr2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Lu3+ and Y3+ ions with polyethylene glycol were determined. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The phosphogypsum (PG) stockpile in Yunnan, China, is one of the largest accumulations of PG. Our group has focused on the application of chemical looping gasification (CLG) with a PG oxygen carrier characterized by high silicon content. FactSage 7.1 software was used for the thermodynamic simulation analysis of the reaction mechanism and reaction characteristics at different temperatures. Experiments were conducted at a laboratory scale in a fixed-bed facility with lignite as fuel using PG as an oxygen carrier and N-2/H2O as gasifying agents at a temperature of 1173 K. We investigated the gasification performance and silicon transfer behavior during chemical looping gasification using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, X-ray diffractometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The results indicated that the silicon in PG participated in the production of syngas through a series of parallel and tandem side reactions (R10-R15) during the reduction process. The high-silicon PG was more conducive to syngas production than the desilicated PG during the reduction process of CLG under the investigated experimental conditions. At 1173 K, the sequence of the parallel reactions was R15 > R8 > R12 > R9, suggesting that an increase in the silicon content inhibited the production of H2S (R8) by increasing the silicon content, which is highly desirable for a clean production process. In CLG, the silicon in the fresh oxygen carrier PG was transformed from SiO2 into CaSiO3, Ca3SiO7, and Ca2SiO4; distributed unevenly; and attached to the surface of CaSO4 after eight cycles. The theory of the Zener effect was developed to understand the mechanism of the interaction between the inert support SiO2 and PG oxygen carrier.

AB In this paper, we present the concepts behind the implementation of behavioral and cognitive capabilities in objects used for controlling workstations in manufacturing systems. These capabilities characterize a new class of objects called agents; such objects intuitively play the role of human decision-makers in the system modeled. Three types of reasoning activities are considered: a meta-reasoning level to control the inference/search reasoning activities, the local reasoning level incorporating simple rule-based procedures and an extended reasoning level representing the reasoning activities that cannot be performed using simple procedures and thus require external knowledge agents to assist the decision-making process. Implementation issues are discussed, illustrated by an application of the approach to the modeling of workstations in a rolling-mill facility.

AB We study the spreading of an agent in a medium whose susceptibility changes irreversibly at the first encounter with the agent. This can model epidemics with partial immunization or population growth with incomplete replenishment of food (in both cases the susceptibility for growth decreases after the first attack) or epidemics in which the resistance is weakened by the first infection (increased susceptibility). In such models one can have no growth at all, compact growth, or annular growth. We delineate the phase diagram and study the scaling behavior at the phase boundaries. Our arguments are supported by simulations in one and two dimensions. Although our model does not involve multiple absorbing states, we claim that our results explain the ''nonuniversal'' behavior seen in models with such states.

AB Three widely used antibiotics from the rifamycin family, rifamycin SV sodium salt, rifampicin and rifaximin, have been characterized by resonance Raman (RR) and surface-enhanced resonance Raman spectroscopy (SERRS). SERRS spectra were recorded using aqueous silver colloidal dispersions prepared with two reducing agents, sodium borohydride and hydroxylamine hydrochloride, for a range of pH values to identify the SERRS-active substrate surface most suitable for each of the three antibiotics. Rifampicin was found to give intense SERRS signals only for the borohydride-reduced colloid and only at pH < 7.7, whereas the hydroxylamine HCl-reduced colloid was the best substrate for rifaximin, giving considerably more intense SERRS spectra than the borohydride colloid. SERRS spectra of rifaximin were observed only at pH < 7.0. It is proposed that the marked pH dependence of the SERRS enhancement results from a transition from an anionic to a neutral zwitterionic state. SERRS spectra of rifamycin SV were not observed for any experimental conditions. The antibiotics display remarkably contrasting SERRS behaviour, reflecting differences in the nature of the substituent groups on the chromophore ring. A vibrational assignment of the RR spectra and detailed comparison between the RR and SERRS data have given insight into the mechanism of adsorption of the antibiotics onto the Ag surface. Rifampicin and rifaximin adsorb adopting an approximately similar vertical orientation of the chromophore ring with respect to the surface; however, rifampicin adsorbs by direct chemical interaction with the Ag whereas rifaximin does not form a direct bond with the Ag surface.

AB Two-dimensional collective cell migration assays are used to study cancer and tissue repair. These assays involve combined cell migration and cell proliferation processes, both of which are modulated by cell-to-cell crowding. Previous discrete models of collective cell migration assays involve a nearest-neighbour proliferation mechanism where crowding effects are incorporated by aborting potential proliferation events if the randomly chosen target site is occupied. There are two limitations of this traditional approach: (i) it seems unreasonable to abort a potential proliferation event based on the occupancy of a single, randomly chosen target site; and, (ii) the continuum limit description of this mechanism leads to the standard logistic growth function, but some experimental evidence suggests that cells do not always proliferate logistically. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a generalised proliferation mechanism which allows non-nearest neighbour proliferation events to take place over a template of r >= 1concentric rings of lattice sites. Further, the decision to abort potential proliferation events is made using a crowding function, f (C), which accounts for the density of agents within a group of sites rather than dealing with the occupancy of a single randomly chosen site. Analysing the continuum limit description of the stochastic model shows that the standard logistic source term, lambda C(1-C), where lambda is the proliferation rate, is generalised to a universal growth function, lambda C f(C). Comparing the solution of the continuum description with averaged simulation data indicates that the continuum model performs well for many choices of f (C) and r. For nonlinear f (C), the quality of the continuum-discrete match increases with r.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the effect of desensitizing dentifrices on dentin wear and tubule occlusion using a three-phase, single blind, crossover in situ trial. Methods: The dentifrices containing Arginine and calcium carbonate (1,450 ppmF) and Novamin, (1,426 ppmF) were tested in two conditions: A: abrasion and B: erosion/abrasion. A dentifrice without desensitizing agents was used as control (1,450 ppmF). In each study phase, 10 volunteers used intra-oral appliances containing dentin specimens (pre-treated with EDTA, to simulate hypersensitive dentin), which were either submitted to erosion with a cola-like drink (pH 2.6), 4x/day (2 minutes), followed by toothbrushing, using electric toothbrushes, with standard pressure (2x/day, 5 seconds), or toothbrushing only. Dentin surface loss (SL, in am) was determined with optical profilometry at the 3rd and 5th days of cycling. Dentin surface was analyzed with environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), post EDTA and post cycling, and the dentin tubules were counted using Image J software. Data were statistically analyzed (alpha= 0.05). Results: For condition A and B, there were no significant differences in SL among toothpastes in both experimental times. There were also no significant differences between times within groups. For ESEM, in A, Toothpaste with Novamin was the only dentifrice that showed significantly less opened tubules post cycling than post EDTA. In B, Toothpaste with Novamin and control toothpaste presented less opened tubules post cycling. In conclusion, toothbrushing with the tested dentifrices promoted similar levels of dentin loss; however, for tubule occlusion, the toothpaste with Novamin was the only toothpaste effective for both conditions, abrasion and erosion/abrasion.

AB A mathematical model for simulation of gasification processes of solid fuels in atmospheric or pressurised bubbling fluidised beds incorporating bed and freeboard hydrodynamics, fuel drying and de volatilization, and chemical reaction kinetics is presented. The model has been used to simulate four bubbling fluidised bed gasifiers, described in literature, of different scales from atmospheric laboratory scale up to pressurised commercial scale, processing brown coal, peat and sawdust. The gasifiers have been operated within a wide range of parameters using air, air/steam or oxygen/steam as gasification agent, operating with or without recirculation of fines at operating pressures up to 2.5 MPa. The simulation results for overall carbon conversion, temperature and concentrations of gaseous species agree sufficiently well with published experimental data. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB This paper presents a lifecycle model (LCM) to simulate bacterial evolution from a finite population of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria. The potential of this approach is in relating the microscopic behaviors of single bacterial cell to the macroscopic effects of bacterial colonies. This can be accomplished via use of an individual-based modeling method under the framework of agent-environment-rule (AER). Here, our study focuses on investigating the behaviors at different developmental stages in E. coli lifecycle and developing a new biologically inspired methodology for static or dynamic systems. The experimental results through a varying environment demonstrates that our model can be used to study under which circumstances a certain bacterial behaviors emerges, and also give an inspiration to design a new biological optimization algorithm being used for optimization problems.

AB Background and Purpose SU4312, a potent and selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), has been designed to treat cancer. Recent studies have suggested that SU4312 can also be useful in treating neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we assessed neuroprotection by SU4312 against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity and further explored the underlying mechanisms. Experimental Approach MPP+-treated neurons and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated zebrafish were used to study neuroprotection by SU4312. NOS activity was assayed in vitro to examine direct interactions between SU4312 and NOS isoforms. Key Results SU4312 unexpectedly prevented MPP+-induced neuronal apoptosis in vitro and decreased MPTP-induced loss of dopaminergic neurons, reduced expression of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase and impaired swimming behaviour in zebrafish. In contrast, PTK787/ZK222584, a well-studied VEGFR-2 inhibitor, failed to prevent neurotoxicity, suggesting that the neuroprotective actions of SU4312 were independent of its anti-angiogenic action. Furthermore, SU4312 exhibited non-competitive inhibition of purified neuronal NOS (nNOS) with an IC50 value of 19.0M but showed little or no effects on inducible and endothelial NOS. Molecular docking simulations suggested an interaction between SU4312 and the haem group within the active centre of nNOS. Conclusions and Implication SU4312 exhibited neuroprotection against MPP+ at least partly via selective and direct inhibition of nNOS. Because SU4312 could reach the brain in rats, our study also offered a support for further development of SU4312 to treat neurodegenerative disorders, particularly those associated with NO-mediated neurotoxicity.

AB The central nervous system is vulnerable to complications caused by diabetes. These complications lead to increased oxidative stress in the brain, resulting in damage to the cerebral cortex, among other regions. Insulin and hypoglycemic agents are still the most widely used treatments. However, current research with an experimental model of diabetes suggests the use of antioxidants, such as melatonin. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that exogenous melatonin may decrease or prevent the effects of diabetes in the frontal cortex of the rat brain. Fifty albino rats were allocated into five groups: GC = rats without diabetes induction, GD = diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin, GDM = streptozotocin-induced and melatonin-treated diabetic rats, GDI = diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin and treated with insulin, GDMI = diabetic rats induced by streptozotocin and treated with melatonin and insulin simultaneously. Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin (60mg/kg). Insulin (5U/day) was administered subcutaneously and melatonin (10mg/kg) by drinking water; both treatments last days after. We analyzed animals? weight, the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-?, apoptosis, glycogen, and did morphometry and histopathology of the frontal cortex were analyzed. The results showed that the cerebral cortex of the diabetic animals presented axonal degeneration, reduced number of neurons in the cortex, reduced glycogen, increased IL-6 and TNF-? expression, high apoptotic index, and reduced animal weight and the brain. Treatment with melatonin associated or not with insulin prevented such effects. Thus, we conclude that melatonin associated with insulin may be an alternative for avoiding the impact of diabetes in the brain?s frontal cortex.

AB MAX-phase (Ti2AlC) gel-cast foams manufactured using agarose as gelling agent were investigated in terms of their microstructural, mechanical and thermal properties. The microstructural analysis of Ti2AlC foams made using SEM were compared with those using X-ray micro tomography. The Young's Modulus of Ti2AlC foams was determined using the impulse excitation technique. This experimental data was correlated with the GibsonAshby, Spnggs and Cross-property relation models. The thermal conductivity measurements were carried out by Laser-Flash analysis correlating to the pore network in the Ti2AlC foam structure derived from pCT measurement. FEM-simulations of the mechanical behaviour were carried out on real structure models to determine a strut wise stress distribution under load.

AB A mathematical model was proposed to describe the behavior of liquid emulsion membranes for the extraction of penicillin G in a continuous countercurrent mixing column. A polyamine-type surfactant acts not only as a carrier but also as a surface-stabilizing agent; thus the influence of surfactant on extraction should be considered in mathematical modeling when its effect is significant. The proposed model takes into account the influence of surfactant on mass transfer. The advancing front model was employed for deriving the overall mass transfer coefficient in the emulsion globule, and the axial dispersion model was applied to the external feed phase. The experimental data were compared with the proposed model, the calculations without considering the contribution of the surfactant to extraction, and the calculations without considering diffusion in the emulsion phase.

AB The emergence of cooperation and the effectiveness of penalties among competing agents are studied via a model of evolutionary game incorporating adaptive behavior and penalties for illegal acts. For initially identical agents, a phase diagram is obtained via an analytic approach, with results in good agreement with numerical simulations. The results show that there exists a critical penalty for achieving a completely honest population and a sufficiently well-behaved initial population, requires no penalty. Self-organized segregation to extreme actions emerges in the dynamics fora system with uniformly distributed initial tendencies for cooperation. After training, the penalty can be relaxed without ruining the adapted cooperative behavior. Results of our model ill a Population taking oil the form of a 2D square lattice are also reported.

AMPs are unusual in that, in place of some external load management system, each AMP periodically recalculates network and program parameters and may independently move to a better execution environment. Load management emerges from the behaviour of collections of AMPs.
   The paper explores the extent of greedy effects by simulating collections of AMPs and proposes negotiating AMPs (NAMPs) to ameliorate the problem. We present the design of AMPs with a competitive negotiation scheme (cNAMPs), and compare their performance with AMPs by simulation. We establish new properties of balanced networks of AMPs, and use these to provide a theoretical analysis of greedy effects. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Aim The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a single application of two topical fluoride agents: NNaF and APF (2% neutral sodium fluoride gel and 1.23% acidulated phosphate fluoride gel, respectively) on the surface roughness (Ra) of Fuji IX GP, Ketac N100, Vitremer, Dyract AP, Compoglass F and Filtek Ultimate. Study Design: The effect of NNaF and APF on the surface roughness of fluoride-releasing restorative materials was tested on disk-shaped material specimens with a surface profilometer.
   Methods All materials were handled according to manufacturer's instructions. ISO standardised specimens were prepared for each material and then stored in distilled water for 24 hr. Each sample was polished with 600 and 1200 grit sandpaper on both sides while keeping the material surface wet. Ra measurements were performed on untreated specimens initially and after 1 min, 4 min and simulated 2-years for both fluoride applications, respectively. The mean Ra values for all specimens were measured using a surface profilometer.
   Statistics Differences in surface roughness values were assessed using paired t-test. The differences between the experimental groups were analysed with one-way ANOVA; p<0.05 was accepted as statistically significant
   Results The results of the present study indicated that Ra values for Fuji IX GP and Vitremer increased significantly after all APF, but not NNaF applications. All tested materials exhibited increased Ra values for both treatment regimes, but this was not found statistically significant
   Conclusion APF gel application significantly increased the surface roughness of both Fuji IX GP and Vitremer for all time periods.

AB Lunasin is a 44 amino acid peptide with multiple functional domains including an aspartic acid tail, an RGD domain, and a chromatin-binding helical domain. We recently showed that Lunasin induced a phenotype switch of cancer initiating cells (CIC) out of the stem compartment by inducing melanocyte-associated differentiation markers while simultaneously reducing stem-cell-associated transcription factors. In the present study, we advance the hypothesis that Lunasin can reduce pools of melanoma cells with stem cell-like properties, and demonstrate that Lunasin treatment effectively inhibits the invasive potential of CICs in vitro as well as in vivo in a mouse experimental metastasis model. Mice receiving Lunasin treatment had significantly reduced pulmonary colonization after injection of highly metastatic B16-F10 melanoma cells compared to mice in the control group. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that Lunasin reduced activating phosphorylations of the intracellular kinases FAK and AKT as well as reduced histone acetylation of lysine residues in H3 and H4 histones. Using peptides with mutated activity domains, we functionally demonstrated that the RGD domain is necessary for Lunasin uptake and its ability to inhibit oncosphere formation by CICs, thus confirming that Lunasin's ability to affect CICs is at least in part due to the suppression of integrin signaling. Our studies suggest that Lunasin represents a unique anticancer agent that could be developed to help prevent metastasis and patient relapse by reducing the activity of CICs which are known to be resistant to current chemotherapies.

AB In this study, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was used to evaluate the changes that occurred in maxillofacial elastomers subjected to different disinfecting regimens. Acommercial polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) and an experimental chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) were treated with different disinfection procedures for a period that simulates 1 year of clinical service: microwave exposure (D1), hypochlorite solution (D2), neutral soap (D3), and a commercial disinfecting solution (D4). A fifth group was kept in dark storage as control. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis tests operated in a fixed frequency (1 Hz) over a range of temperatures (-130 degrees C to 20 degrees C for PDMS, -60 degrees C to 120 degrees C for CPE). Loss modulus (G"), storage modulus (G'), and loss factor (tan delta) were recorded as a function of temperature. The obtained glass transition temperature (T-g) values were subjected to statistical analysis. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis revealed changes in T-g values for both materials, which reflect the possible changes in their chemical and physical structure, after different disinfection procedures. The PDMS and CPE samples seem to have less dense structure maybe because of chain scission reaction that probably occurred during the disinfection procedures. According to statistical analysis, T-g values presented significant changes from the control samples among the different materials and disinfecting procedures. Microwave exposure and hypochlorite solution affect CPE significantly, whereas PDMS exhibited significant changes after being treated with a commercial antimicrobial agent, concerning changes that occurred in Tg. In all cases, Tg values were decreased compared with the untreated samples, which were stiffer, presenting higher Tg and G' values.

AB In the presence of multivalent cations, high molecular weight DNA undergoes a dramatic condensation to a compact, usually highly ordered toroidal structure. This review begins with an overview of DNA condensation : condensing agents, morphology, kinetics, and reversibility, and the minimum size required to form orderly condensates. It then summarizes the statistical mechanics of the collapse of stiff polymers, which shows why DNA condensation is abrupt and why toroids are favored structures. Various ways to estimate or measure intermolecular forces ii? DNA condensation are discussed all of them agreeing that the free energy change per base pair is very small, on the order of 1% of thermal energy. Experimental evidence is surveyed showing that DNA condensation occurs when about 90% of its charge is neutralized by counterions. The various intermolecular forces whose interplay gives rise to DNA condensation are then reviewed. The entropy loss upon collapse of the expanded wormlike coil costs free energy, and stiffness sets limits on tight curvature. However, the dominant contributions seem to come from ions and water Electrostatic repulsions must be overcome by high salt concentrations or by the correlated fluctuations of territorially bound multivalent cations. Hydration must be adjusted to allow a cooperative accommodation of the water structure surrounding surface groups on the DNA helices as they approach. Undulations of the DNA in its confined surroundings extend the range of the electrostatic forces. The condensing ions may also subtly modify the local structure of the double helix.

AB The performance of 2-[tris(hyroxycarbamoyl)methyl] carboxylic acids on flotation separation of diaspore over kaolinite and illite was investigated by using flotation tests, and their collecting performance was clarified by using density functional theory (DFT) calculation and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The flotation results of single minerals indicate that by using THDA, THCA or THTA as collector under neutral condition, diaspore presents good notability while kaolinite and illite exhibit poor notabilities. Among the three collectors, THCA displays the greatest difference in the notability between diaspore and aluminosilicate. The flotation results of the artificially mixed minerals show that under the condition of pH 7 and 2 x 10(-4) mol/L THCA, the A/S value in the concentrate is greatly increased and the separation of diaspore over aluminosilicates is feasible by using THCA as collector. DFT calculations show that large negative charges are located at the O and N atoms in the polar group of these collectors and the O atoms have more negative charges than N atoms. By comparison THCA has the highest HOMO energy, resulting in the highest collecting efficiency. The adsorption of collector on mineral surface by MD method indicates that the combination processes of collectors with mineral crystal are exothermic, and THCA has the greatest difference in binding energy between diaspore and aluminosilicate. A good correlation was found between the theoretical calculations and the experimental results. As a whole, THCA is a better collector to float and separate diaspore over aluminosilicates.

AB Purpose: Dexamethasone has been widely used to treat acute inflammatory diseases and endotoxic shocks in animal models. Meloxicam is one of the most commonly used antiinflammatory agents in avian species. However, little is known about the effects of dexamethasone and meloxicam on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammatory response in birds. In the present study, LPS-challenged broiler chickens were used to investigate the comparative protective effects of meloxicam and dexamethasone on LPS-induced acute inflammatory responses.
   Methods: Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) histopathological scores, selected serum acute phase reactants, inflammatory mediators, and gangliosides were evaluated in broiler chickens inoculated with E. coli LPS and simultaneously treated with two doses of meloxicam (0.5 and 2 mg/kg BW) and dexamethasone (2 and 4 mg/kg BW).
   Results: LPS-induced ALI scores were not significantly different between the meloxicamtreated, dexamethasone-treated, and untreated positive control groups at 4 hours after LPS inoculation. Interleukin-6 concentrations were also statistically the same among the positive control, dexamethasone-treated, and meloxicam-treated groups at 3 and 12 hours after LPS inoculation. However, these anti-inflammatory drugs reduced adenosine deaminase, ceruloplasmin, lipid-bound sialic acid, protein-bound sialic acid, and total sialic acid in LPS-inoculated broiler chickens at 12, 24, and 48 hours after LPS inoculation in a drug- and dose-dependent manner. Ovotransferrin concentrations were not significantly different between positive control and treatment groups at 12 hours after LPS inoculation. However, twenty-four hours after LPS inoculation, all the treated groups, except the one treated with 0.5 mg/kg meloxicam, showed significantly lower concentrations of ovotransferrin as compared with the positive control group.
   Conclusion: Our results showed that dexamethasone was more effective than meloxicam in inhibiting the LPS-induced response in broiler chickens by diminishing the serum levels of adenosine deaminase, ceruloplasmin, and gangliosides.

AB In this paper, a molecular dynamics simulation method was used to study the thermo-mechanical properties of cross-linked epoxy resins doped with nano silica particles that were grafted with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and 3-[2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]-propyl-trimethoxysilane with different chain lengths. Firstly, a set of pure epoxy resin models, and four sets of SiO2/EP composite models were established. Then, a reasonable structure was obtained through a series of optimizations using molecular dynamics calculations. Next, the mechanical properties, hydrogen bond statistics, glass transition temperature, free volume fraction, and chain spacing of the five models were studied comparatively. The results show that doped nano silica particles of surfaces grafted with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, and 3-[2-(2-aminoethylamino)ethylamino]-propyl-trimethoxysilane with different chain lengths enhanced mechanical properties such as elastic modulus, shear modulus, and volume modulus obviously. The glass transition temperature increased by 15-16 K, 40-41 K, and 24-27 K, respectively. Finally, the data show that the cross-linked epoxy resin modified by nanoparticles grafted with N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane had better effects for improving thermo-mechanical properties by the comparatively studying the five groups of parameter models under the same conditions.

AB Background: Oral mucositis is a frequent complication of radiochemotherapy. The origin of radiation-induced mucosa lesions is of iatrogenic nature although further development of mucositis is essentially influenced by infection. It can be assumed that disinfection measures should decrease the severity of mucositis induced by radiochemotherapy. Therefore, in a prospective randomised study the efficacy of prophylactic oral rinsing with a disinfection agent was investigated.
   Patients and Method: An open, randomised, prospective comparative trial was conducted with 40 patients undergoing radiochemotherapy of head and neck region due to malignant disease. The treatment scheme consisted of irradiation to tumor region and adjacent lymph nodes with a total dose of 71.3 Gy and simultaneous chemotherapy with carboplatin (60 mg/m(2)) on days 1 to 5 and 29 to 34. In all patients, a prophylaxis of mucositis with nystatine, rutosides, panthenol and immunoglobulin was undertaken. In addition, 20 patients rinsed oral cavity 4 times daily with povidone-iodine-solution, the comparative group rinsed with sterile water. Clinical examination of the oral mucosa was performed weekly. Onset, grading and duration of mucositis were used as main variables.
   Results: Clinically manifested oral mucositis was observed in 14 patients of the iodine group (mean grading: 1.0) and all 20 patients of the control group (mean grading: 3.0). Total duration (mean) of clinically observed mucositis was 2.75 weeks in treatment patients and 9.25 in control patients. Median AUC (area under curve for grade vs duration) was 2.5 in iodine rinsing patients and 15.75 in control patients. All differences found between the 2 groups were statistically significant. Increased iodine incorporation was not observed. A pathological increase of thyroid hormone levels in the iodine group was not found.
   Conclusions: The gained results indicate that incidence, severity and duration of radiochemotherapy-induced mucositis can be significantly reduced by oral rinsing with povidone-iodine performed additionally to the standard prophylaxis scheme.

AB BACKGROUND: beta-Lactam antibiotics demonstrate time-dependent killing. Prolonged infusion of these agents is commonly performed to optimize the time the unbound concentration of an antibiotic remains greater than the minimum inhibitory concentration and decrease costs, despite limited evidence suggesting improved clinical results.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether prolonged infusion of beta-lactam antibiotics improves outcomes in critically ill patients with suspected gram-negative infection.
   METHODS: We conducted a single-center, before-after, comparative effectiveness trial between January 2010 and January 2011 in the intensive care units at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, an urban teaching hospital affiliated with the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, MO. Outcomes were compared between patients who received standardized dosing of meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, or cefepime as an intermittent infusion over 30 minutes (January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2010) and patients who received prolonged infusion over 3 hours (August 1, 2010, to January 31, 2011).
   RESULTS: A total of 503 patients (intermittent infusion, n = 242; prolonged infusion, n = 261) treated for gram-negative infection were included in the clinically evaluable population. Approximately 50% of patients in each group received cefepime and 20% received piperacillin-tazobactam. More patients in the intermittent infusion group received meropenem (35.5% vs 24.5%; p = 0.007). Baseline characteristics were similar between groups, with the exception of a greater occurrence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the intermittent infusion group. Treatment success rates in the clinically evaluable group were 56.6% for intermittent infusion and 51.0% for prolonged infusion (p = 0.204), and in the microbiologically evaluable population, 55.2% for intermittent infusion and 49.5% for prolonged infusion (p = 0.486). Fourteen-day, 30-day, and inhospital mortality rates in the clinically evaluable population for the intermittent and prolonged infusion groups were 13.2% versus 18.0% (p = 0.141), 23.6% versus 25.7% (p = 0.582), and 19.4% versus 23.0% (p = 0.329).
   CONCLUSIONS: Routine use of prolonged infusion of time-dependent antibiotics for the empiric treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections offers no advantage over intermittent infusion antibiotic therapy with regard to treatment success, mortality, or hospital length of stay. These results were confirmed after controlling for potential confounders in a multivariate analysis.

AB To understand large-scale portfolio construction tasks we analyse sustainable economy problems by splitting up large tasks into smaller ones and offer an evolutional feed-forward system-based approach. The theoretical justification for our solution is based on multivariate statistical analysis of multidimensional investment tasks, particularly on relations between data size, algorithm complexity and portfolio efficacy. To reduce the dimensionality/sample size problem, a larger task is broken down into smaller parts by means of item similarity clustering. Similar problems are given to smaller groups to solve. Groups, however, vary in many aspects. Pseudo randomly-formed groups compose a large number of modules of feed-forward decision-making systems. The evolution mechanism forms collections of the best modules for each single short time period. Final solutions are carried forward to the global scale where a collection of the best modules is chosen using a multiclass cost-sensitive perceptron. Collected modules are combined in a final solution in an equally weighted approach (1/N Portfolio). The efficacy of the novel decision-making approach was demonstrated through a financial portfolio optimization problem, which yielded adequate amounts of real world data. For portfolio construction, we used 11,730 simulated trading robot performances. The dataset covered the period from 2003 to 2012 when environmental changes were frequent and largely unpredictable. Walk-forward and out-of-sample experiments show that an approach based on sustainable economy principles outperforms benchmark methods and that shorter agent training history demonstrates better results in periods of a changing environment.

AB Deep eutectic solvents (DES) have recently emerged as green ionic liquid candidates for several applications, including electrochemistry, nanomaterials, and petrochemical processing. However, there are few reports on DES as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) agents. In this research, four quaternary ammonium-based DES with urea, thiourea, ethylene glycol and glycerol were synthesized and characterized. The H- bond amount was monitored through infrared spectroscopy, and, simulated infrared spectra conducted through Gaussian_09W-9.5-Revision-D.01-SMP calculation to confirm the experimental spectra. The rheology and interfacial tension reducingability of the four DES were investigated in relation to the reservoir environment. The data indicate that the four solvents can enhance oil recovery in the underground reservoir, as further verified through modeling analysis and the viscosity-shearing profiles. Since theoretical computation provides a fruitful tool to simulate molecular geometry and physicochemical criteria of compounds. The chemical structure and geometry optimization conducted by COSMO-RS and TURBOMOLE package to predict screening charge density (sigma profile) and localized charges of the synthesized eutectic mixture, then functionalize the obtained data in predicting DES behavior through oil recovery applications. Moreover, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation conducted through DS-BIOVIA Materials Studio 2017 to investigate the affinity and interaction energies between the oil and the four DES solvents. Water flooding was carried out on a linear assembly, followed by DES displacement at a nearby coarse reservoir environment, where the results were prosperous as incremental oil recovery reach 77.4%. On a field scale, a simulation test was done on a three- dimensional reservoir model by using CMG software to evaluate the applicability of DES solvents in oil displacement techniques. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous reports on the quantum and computational chemistry of DES for application in the field of enhanced oil recovery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

DE Pattern-oriented modeling; Savanna elephants; Movement behavior
AB African elephants (Loxodonta africana) are well-studied and inhabit diverse landscapes that are being transformed by both humans and natural forces. Most tools currently in use are limited in their ability to predict how elephants will respond to novel changes in the environment. Individual-, or agent-based modeling (ABM), may extend current methods in addressing and predicting spatial responses to environmental conditions over time. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to simulate elephant space use and validated the model with movement data from elephants in Kruger National Park (KNP) and Chobe National Park (CNP). We simulated movement at an hourly scale, as this scale can reflect switches in elephant behavior due to changes in internal states and short-term responses to the local availability and distribution of critical resources, including forage, water, and shade. Known internal drivers of elephant movement, including perceived temperature and the time since an individual last visited a water source, were linked to the external environment through behavior-based movement rules. Simulations were run on model landscapes representing the wet season and the hot, dry season for both parks. The model outputs, including home range size, daily displacement distance, net displacement distance, and maximum distance traveled from a permanent water source, were evaluated through qualitative and quantitative comparisons to actual elephant movement data from both KNP and CNP. The ABM was successful in reproducing the differences in daily displacements between seasons in each park, and in distances traveled from a permanent water source between parks and seasons. Other movement characteristics, including differences in home range sizes and net daily displacements, were partially reproduced. Out of the all the statistical comparisons made between the empirical and simulated movement patterns, the majority were classified as discrepancies of medium or small effect size. We have shown that a resource-driven model with relatively simple decision rules generates trajectories with movement characteristics that are mostly comparable to those calculated from empirical data. Simulating hourly movement (as our model does) may be useful in predicting how finer-scale patterns of space use, such as those created by foraging movements, are influenced by finer spatio-temporal changes in the environment.

AB Using an overlapping-generations small open economy with endogenous lifetime a la Chakraborty (2004), we show that an increase in public investments in health is beneficial to life expectancy but can actually reduce both saving and domestic income per worker. Moreover, using the notion of A-efficiency introduced by Golosov et al. (2007) in a context of endogenous population (i.e., Pareto efficiency applied to people alive in every state), which contrasts with the P-efficiency criterion with respect to which the preference profiles of both born and unborn agents are evaluated in every state, some normative conclusions can be drawn: although the financing of health investments reduces both the disposable income and marginal propensity to consume of young individuals through increased labor income taxation, it also increases the length of life and can represent an A-Pareto improvement when the world interest rate is sufficiently high, because consumption when old becomes more attractive in such a case. Indeed, there exist: (i) a whole range of health tax rates that can effectively be used to increase social welfare, and (ii) an A-Pareto-efficient allocation. Moreover, the numerical simulations presented for some actual small open economies reveal that raising public health spending above the existing level causes both saving and domestic income to fall in all countries, while also finding that developed and underdeveloped (transition) economies are currently underinvesting (overinvesting) in health.

AB Electrochemical reduction of heavy elements from aqueous solution to amalgams was studied by radiopolarography and radiocoulometry.  Mechanism of actinide reduction on a mercury pool is discussed through simulation techniques.  Special emphasis is placed on redox reactions and potentials, kinetics of the process and effect of acetate and citrate ions as complexing agents.  Three groups of actinides have been found.  The first group represents actinium and from uranium to berkelium.  Reduction occurs in the experimental conditions via an irreversible 3-0 process.  The second group consists of the elements from fermium to nobelium, which are reduced in non-complexing solutions, or with acetate ions, similarly as barium and radium, via a reversible 2-0 reaction.  Finally, californium and einsteinium behave as in termediate elements.  It is noticeable that such groups are also observed in the actinide series by studying the structure of the trivalent aqua ions.  On the basis of the above mentioned investigations of actinides and lanthanides several examples of electrochemical application are presented.  Californium has been separated from preceding transuranium and lanthanide elements (except europium) by electrochemical reduction to amalgams in acetic solution.  Separation factors from 25-90 are achieved with appropriate cathodic potentials.  Similarly, this element could be separated from several heavier actinides with citric media.  The electrochemical preparation of mixed uranium-nickel and uranium-tin amalgama from aqueous acetate solutions is investigated.  The dependence of redox potentials of mixed amalgams on different atomic ratio U:Ni and U:Sn in amalgams is measured.  The large shift of redox potentials of mixed amalgams to the positive direction is detected when the atomic ratio U:Ni or U:Sn in amalgams reaches 1:5.  The thermal distillation of mercury from mixed amalgams with different U:Ni and U:Sn atomic ratios was carried out and the products were identified by chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction.  The intermetallics UNi5 and USN3 were prepared from mixed amalgams with the atomic ratios U:Ni = 1:5 and U:Sn = 1:3. The uranium and neptunium amalgams are prepared by electrolysis of aqueous acetate solutions and are processed into metals or nitrides U2N3, NpN by thermal distillation of mercury in vacuum or in nitrogen atmosphere.

AB In this paper, we present an enhanced high-power extrinsic diode side-pumped solid-state laser (DPSSL) model to accurately predict the dynamic operations and pump distribution under different practical conditions. We introduce a new implementation technique for the proposed model that provides a compelling incentive for the performance assessment and enhancement of high-power diode side-pumped Nd: YAG lasers using cooperative agents and by relying on the MATLAB, GLAD, and Zemax ray tracing software packages. A large-signal laser model that includes thermal effects and a modified laser gain formulation and incorporates the geometrical pump distribution for three radially arranged arrays of laser diodes is presented. The design of a customized prototype diode side-pumped high-power laser head fabricated for the purpose of testing is discussed. A detailed comparative experimental and simulation study of the dynamic operation and the beam characteristics that are used to verify the accuracy of the proposed model for analyzing the performance of high-power DPSSLs under different conditions are discussed. The simulated and measured results of power, pump distribution, beam shape, and slope efficiency are shown under different conditions and for a specific case, where the targeted output power is 140 W, while the input pumping power is 400 W. The 95% output coupler reflectivity showed good agreement with the slope efficiency, which is approximately 35%; this assures the robustness of the proposed model to accurately predict the design parameters of practical, high-power DPSSLs.

TI Effects of Pregnancy on Progression of Osteoarthritis Induced by

AB Hormones, particularly estrogen, are known to play a role in the development of osteoarthritis (OA). In relation to this, the impact of pregnancy on OA remains unknown. Pregnancy leads to decreased expressions of both synthetic and degradation genes of articular chondrocytes, as determined using in vitro tests, but no in vivo studies have been performed exploring pregnancy and OA simultaneously. The present study investigates the effect of pregnancy on the progression of OA in the rat joint degeneration model using an intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA). Twenty Wistar rats were divided into four groups: A-Pregnancy and intra-articular injection of MIA; B-MIA injection in naive rats; C-Pregnancy, and D-Sham injection of saline in naive rats. Articular cartilage was evaluated 18 days after the detection of vaginal plug in female rats using Janusz's macroscopic score, equilibrium partitioning of an ionic contrast agent via microcomputed tomography, and glycosaminoglycan (GAG) quantification. Results show that there was no significant difference in GAG content, attenuation, volume, and thickness of articular cartilage between pregnant and non-pregnant groups. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, pregnancy does not have observable effects on MIA-induced OA in rats at 3 weeks.

AB We propose a randomized phase II clinical trial design based on Bayesian adaptive randomization and predictive probability monitoring. Adaptive randomization assigns more patients to a more efficacious treatment arm by comparing the posterior probabilities of efficacy between different arms. We continuously monitor the trial using the predictive probability. The trial is terminated early when it is shown that one treatment is overwhelmingly superior to others or that all the treatments are equivalent. We develop two methods to compute the predictive probability by considering the uncertainty of the sample size of the future data. We illustrate the proposed Bayesian adaptive randomization and predictive probability design using a phase II lung cancer clinical trial, and we conduct extensive simulation studies to examine the operating characteristics of the design. By coupling adaptive randomization and predictive probability approaches, the trial can treat more patients with a more efficacious treatment and allow for early stopping whenever sufficient information is obtained to conclude treatment superiority or equivalence. The design proposed also controls both the type I and the type II errors and offers an alternative Bayesian approach to the frequentist group sequential design.

AB Objective. Root canal irrigation is an important adjunct to control microbial infection. This study aimed primarily to develop a transparent root canal model to study in situ Enterococcus faecalis biofilm removal rate and remaining attached biofilm using passive or active irrigation solution for 90s. The change in available chlorine and pH of the outflow irrigant were assessed.
   Methods. A total of forty root canal models (n =10 per group) were manufactured using 3D printing. Each model consisted of two longitudinal halves of an 18 mm length simulated root canal with size 30 and taper 0.06. E. faecalis biofilms were grown on the apical 3 mm of the models for 10 days in Brain Heart Infusion broth. Biofilms were stained using crystal violet for visualization. The model halves were reassembled, attached to an apparatus and observed under a fluorescence microscope. Following 60s of 9 mL of 2.5% NaOCl irrigation using syringe and needle, the irrigant was either left stagnant in the canal or activated using gutta-percha, sonic and ultrasonic methods for 30s. Images were then captured every second using an external camera. The residual biofilm percentages were measured using image analysis software. The data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis test and generalized linear mixed model.
   Results. The highest level of biofilm removal was with ultrasonic agitation (90.13%) followed by sonic (88.72%), gutta-percha (80.59%), and passive irrigation group (control) (43.67%) respectively. All agitation groups reduced the available chlorine and pH of NaOCl more than that in the passive irrigation group.
   Significance. The 3D printing method provided a novel model to create a root canal simulation for studying and understanding a real-time biofilm removal under microscopy. Ultrasonic agitation of NaOCl left the least amount of residual biofilm in comparison to sonic and gutta-percha agitation methods. (C) 2016 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We introduce a model gel system in which colloidal forces, structure, and rheology are measured by balancing the requirements of rheological and microscopy techniques with those of optical tweezers. Sterically stabilized poly(methyl methacrylate) colloids are suspended in cyclohexane (CH) and cyclohexyl bromide (CHB) with dilute polystyrene serving as a depletion agent. A study of the optical trap strength, rheology, and microscopic structure of the gels as a function of CH/CHB solvent composition identifies the conditions for which these measurements can be applied to characterize gel properties. The results indicate that a solvent comprising 37% weight fraction CH (w(CH) = 0.37) provides sufficient refractive index contrast to enable optical trapping, while maintaining good confocal microscopy imaging quality and minimal sedimentation effects on the bulk rheology. At this condition, and at a depletant concentration c = 8.64 mg/ml (c/c* = 0.81), results from optical trapping in a dilute sample show that 50% of bonds rupture at (3.3 +/- 0.5) pN. The linear strain-dependent elastic modulus of the corresponding gel (phi = 0.20) is G' = (1.8 +/- 0.6) Pa, and the mean contact number of the colloids in the gel structure is < z > = 5.4 +/- 0.1. The development of this model colloidal gel system yields a concomitant characterization of the interparticle forces, microstructure, and bulk rheology in a single experimental system, thereby allowing the simultaneous comparison of these different measures.

AB The effects of chiral discrimination in inclusion complexes formed by native beta-cyclodextrin and its substituted form (namely methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) with racemate or pure enantiomers of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen have been investigated in water. Stability constants and complexation efficiency have been determined for these host-guest systems with a 1: 1 molar ratio from phase solubility profiles, showing that in aqueous solution, methylated cyclodextrin is a better complex agent than native cyclodextrin, with more enhanced effects for the (R)-enantiomer. These results have been validated using NMR technique. In particular, (1)H NMR spectra in D(2)O show a splitting of the signals for the methyl group and the aromatic protons close to the asymmetric centre of the racemate ibuprofen included in cyclodextrin cavity.

ID MOBILE ROBOTS
AB In this work, the authors propose a formation control strategy of a group of three multirotor aerial vehicles being able to avoid multiple obstacles and collisions. To deal with this problem, a decentralized architecture is proposed which has one model predictive controller per vehicle including a set of convex constraints on the vehicle's position to prevent collisions with other agents and different shapes of obstacles. The resulting decentralized scheme controls the formation based on a virtual structure approach. For the purpose of avoiding collisions, each local controller considers the predicted position of every neighbor vehicles. The effectiveness of the developed scheme is demonstrated through numerical simulations considering a "figure-of-eight" as the reference trajectory, and the results show its capability to handle thrust force, obstacle and collision avoidance constraints.

AB Drawing from the literature on the minority game, this study proposes that predictive travel time information provided to drivers to assist with their route choices may not influence network flow; under the condition that route choices are made repeatedly by the same group of drivers, the drivers self-organize to reach the same network equilibrium regardless of the contents of the predictive travel time information given. A numerical example supports this conjecture by showing that improvements in network flow are negligibly small even when precise information on travel time is provided. If no predictive information is present, the results of agent-based route choice simulation studies indicate that higher levels of the cognitive capabilities of drivers tend to produce more self-organization and stable network flows and that information on those routes a driver did not take is important for this self-organization.

   Interventions: Simulation of the cachectic state often seen in patients with head and neck cancer, induction of squamous cell carcinoma, and administration of standard and arginine-supplemented diet.
   Main Outcome Measures: Effect of arginine supple-mentation on tumor growth, metastases, and host weight gain.
   Results: Tumor weight was significantly decreased in those animals receiving 5% arginine supplementation. The rate of metastases was lower in animals receiving arginine, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. All groups receiving supplemental arginine experienced weight loss, which contradicts the findings that arginine as an anabolic agent may not be present in cancer bearing hosts.

AB The effect of particle size, porosity and reactor temperature/reaction rate constant on the progress of a char particle conversion has been investigated numerically by solving the transport equation inside a reacting char particle. Numerical simulations have been conducted for three cases that include two extreme cases and one general case. The two extreme cases correspond to a very large Damkohler number (3.2607 x 10(3)) and a very small Damkohler number (0.0042). The third case corresponds to an intermediate value of Damkohler number. For the very large Damkohler number case, concentration profiles of the gasifying agent showed a steep gradient across the particle and the reaction occurred mostly in outer layer of the particle. This behavior corresponds to a diffusion controlled process. For the very small Darnkohler number case, gasifying agent concentration was a straight line parallel to the x-axis, with a y-axis value of the surrounding concentration. The reaction occurred homogeneously across the particle and the degree of conversion was only a function in time. This behavior corresponds to a chemically controlled process. The total conversion of the char particle as a function of time has also been calculated for different particle sizes, initial porosity and reaction rate constant. Variation in conversion profiles as a function of time due to variation in initial porosity and reaction rate constant were limited to a certain extent. Very high initial porosity values tend to shift the process towards a chemically controlled one; any further increase in porosity does not have a positive effect on the conversion-time relationship. Very high reaction rate constants tend to shift the process towards diffusion controlled process. Kinetic parameters have been determined experimentally using a chemically controlled process. The obtained parameters have been used in the model to determine the progress of char particle conversion at an increased reactor temperature of 1000 degrees C. The model has been compared to experimental results at the same temperature (1000 degrees C). The results showed very good agreement. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB We study an iterative cutting-plane algorithm on an integer program for minimizing the staffing costs of a multiskill call center subject to service-level requirements that are estimated by simulation. We solve a sample average version of the problem, where the service levels are expressed as functions of the staffing for a fixed sequence of random numbers driving the simulation. An optimal solution of this sample problem is also an optimal solution to the original problem when the sample size is large enough, Several difficulties are encountered when solving the sample problem, especially for large problem instances, and we propose practical heuristics to deal with these difficulties. We report numerical experiments with examples of different sizes. The largest example corresponds to a real-life call center with 65 types of calls and 89 types of agents (skill groups).

AB A simple, sensitive and robust method for simultaneous determination of antiepileptic drugs (gabapentin, pregabalin and vigabatrin) in human serum using GC-MS was developed and validated for clinical toxicology purposes. This method employs an emerging class of derivatization agents - alkyl chloroformates allowing the efficient and rapid derivatization of both the amino and carboxylic groups of the tested antiepileptic drugs within seconds. The derivatization protocol was optimized using the Design of Experiment statistical methodology, and the entire sample preparation requires less than 5 min. Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range from 0.5 to 50.0 mg/L, with adequate accuracy (97.9-109.3%) and precision (<12.1%). The method was successfully applied to quantification of selected.-aminobutyric acid analogs in the serum of patients in both therapeutic and toxic concentration ranges.

AB X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been jointly applied to the study of the Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus ducreyi (HdSOD) in interaction with the carbon monoxide molecule. The configurational flexibility of the Fe(II)-heme group, intercalated between the two subunits, has been sampled by MD simulations and included in the XANES data analysis without optimization in the structural parameter space. Our results provide an interpretation of the observed discrepancy in the Fe-heme distances as detected by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and the classical XANES analysis, in which the structural parameters are optimized in a unique structure. Moreover, binding of the CO molecule to the heme induces a long range effect on the Cu, Zn active site, as evidenced by both MD simulations and in vitro experiments. MD simulation of the CO bound system, in fact, highlighted a structural rearrangement of the protein-protein hydrogen bond network in the region of the Cu, Zn active site, correlated with an increase in water accessibility at short distance from the copper atom. In line, in vitro experiments evidenced an increase of copper accessibility to a chelating agent when the CO molecule binds to the heme group, as compared to a heme deprived HdSOD. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis that the HdSOD is a heme-sensor protein, in which binding to small gaseous molecules modulates the enzyme superoxide activity as an adaptive response to the bacterial environment.

AB Objective. Profound neuromuscular block (NMB) quantified by post-tetanic count (PTC) may prevent all muscle activity during anesthesia. We studied whether monitoring of PTC prevents airway pressure alarms or visible movements of the vocal cords and the abdomen during endo-laryngeal procedures (ELPs). Methods. In this prospective, double blind, study 50 healthy (ASA 1-3) patients scheduled for ELPs were randomized into five groups: atracurium, mivacurium, rocuronium, vecuronium and succinylcholine. During alfentanil-propofol anaesthesia, profound NMB was controlled by monitoring the PTC (target level PTC 0-2, 50 Hz tetanic stimulation) of the adductor pollicis muscle. The muscle relaxants were administered using bolus dosing in all groups but in the succinylcholine group. The early signs of recovery of NMB to be observed were: 1) airway pressure alarms, 2) movements of vocal cords on the laryngeal video monitor and 3) movements of the abdomen. The inference was based on 90% confidence interval tests. Results. During 50 ELP:s following signs of early recovery of NMB were recognized: 2 alarms of airway pressure, 16 laryngeal movements and 11 movements of the abdomen. The proportion of airway pressure alarms was significantly lower than proportion of all detectable movements (95% confidence interval analysis). Twelve of the movements were recorded at PTC zero level. The signs of early recovery of NMB were detected in all groups. Conclusions. PTC-monitoring following 50 Hz stimulation does not ensure total inactivity of muscles during alfentanil-propofol anesthesia, regardless which relaxant has been chosen. During ELPs, simultaneous observation of the vocal cords and the abdomen is more sensitive in detecting early recovery of NMB compared to our method of airway pressure monitoring.

AB Setting. There are no studies that exist within the primary care setting that address optimal opioid therapy in osteoarthritis patients. In light of the recently released US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on opioid use in chronic noncancer pain, there is a pressing need to better characterize the effectiveness of long- and short-acting opioids.
   Objective. To examine the effectiveness of short-acting opioids (SAO) vs long-acting opioids (LAO) and combination therapies (SAO and LAO) for treating chronic osteoarthritis pain in a retrospective trial.
   Methods. Average and lowest pain scores approximately one to two weeks prior to patient appointments were collected and averaged for both SAO and LAO patients who were actively enrolled in a pain clinic at an academic medical center.
   Results. There was no statistical difference between reported average and low pain scores for the SAO vs LAO groups (P = 0.201 and P = 0.296, respectively), although the SAO group on average had a significantly lower morphine equivalence (P<0.001). Various covariates for both groups were tested in an adjusted model to look at trends in the use of nonopioid medications (i.e., acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, and adjunct analgesic agents). No significant differences in pain scores existed when comparing covariates for the SAO vs LAO groups.
   Conclusions. The study suggests that in addition to being effective, short-acting opioid medications may also provide a safer and cheaper alternative to long-acting opioid therapies in the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis.
   Perspective. This article investigates the effectiveness of short-acting vs long-acting opioids for the treatment of chronic noncancer pain, specifically osteoarthritis. This information could potentially aid practitioners in primary care environments to design equally efficacious and less costly opioid regimens, while simultaneously enhancing patient safety.

AB Study Design. Experimental study.
   Objective. It was aimed to establish a cadaver model to imitate osteoporotic perfused vertebral bone and to allow for transpedicular transfer of bone cement and various new materials into vertebrae. The model was perfused to simulate vertebroplasty in the presence of transvertebral blood flow.
   Summary of Background Data. The injection of bone cement into vertebrae bears the risk of irreversible discharge of material into the venous system of the spinal canal. The bovine cadaver model studied allows visual studies of material distribution in a vertebral bone, the potential spill-out of material, and quantification of washout and disintegration phenomena.
   Methods. Thoracic and lumbar vertebrae from 1-year-old calves were cut transversally into 5 mm slices, macerated, and decalcified. The softened bone slices were compressed between 2 transparent plastic discs. A standard vertebroplasty cannula (outer diameter 3.5 mm, inner diameter 2.5 mm) was inserted into the vertebral body via the pedicle to transfer the different vertebroplasty materials. Arterial blood flow was simulated by means of liquid irrigation via 2 needles in the ventral part of the vertebral body slice. Metal powder was mixed with the solution to indicate the blood flow in the bone. The model was evaluated with the vertebroplasty cement polymethylmethacrylate.
   Results. The model permitted visualization of the insertion and distribution of vertebroplasty materials. Liquid bone cement was effused into the spinal canal as in the clinical situation. Higher modulus cement acted in the same way as in clinical vertebroplasty. Rigid vertebroplasty agents led to trabecular fractures and stable mechanical interactions with the bone and eventually moved dorsal bone fragments into the spinal canal. Sedimentation of the metal powder indicated regions of perfusion.
   Conclusion. The model simulated the clinical behavior of liquid and higher modulus vertebroplasty agents in the presence of blood flow. It enabled safe ex vivo testing of the mechanical and physical properties of alternative vertebroplasty materials under flow conditions.

AB PURPOSE The paradox of primary care is the observation that primary care is associated with apparently low levels of evidence-based care for individual diseases, but systems based on primary care have healthier populations, use fewer resources, and have less health inequality. The purpose of this article is to explore, from a complex systems perspective, mechanisms that might account for the effects of primary care beyond disease-specific care.
   METHODS In an 8-session, participatory group model-building process, patient, caregiver, and primary care clinician community stakeholders worked with academic investigators to develop and refine an agent-based computer simulation model to test hypotheses about mechanisms by which features of primary care could affect health and health equity.
   RESULTS In the resulting model, patients are at risk for acute illness, acute life-changing illness, chronic illness, and mental illness. Patients have changeable health behaviors and care-seeking tendencies that relate to their living in advantaged or disadvantaged neighborhoods. There are 2 types of care available to patients: primary and specialty. Primary care in the model is less effective than specialty care in treating single diseases, but it has the ability to treat multiple diseases at once. Primary care also can provide disease prevention visits, help patients improve their health behaviors, refer to specialty care, and develop relationships with patients that cause them to lower their threshold for seeking care. In a model run with primary care features turned off, primary care patients have poorer health. In a model run with all primary care features turned on, their conjoint effect leads to better population health for patients who seek primary care, with the primary care effect being particularly pronounced for patients who are disadvantaged and patients with multiple chronic conditions. Primary care leads to more total health care visits that are due to more disease prevention visits, but there are reduced illness visits among people in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Supplemental appendices provide a working version of the model and worksheets that allow readers to run their own experiments that vary model parameters.
   CONCLUSION This simulation model provides insights into possible mechanisms for the paradox of primary care and shows how participatory group model building can be used to evaluate hypotheses about the behavior of such complex systems as primary health care and population health.

AB The adaptive immune response is initiated in lymph nodes by contact between antigen-bearing dendritic cells (DCs) and antigen-specific T cells. A selected number of naive T cells that recognize a specific antigen may proliferate into expanded clones, differentiate, and acquire an effector phenotype. Despite growing experimental knowledge, certain mechanistic aspects of T cell behavior in lymph nodes remain poorly understood. Computational modeling approaches may help in addressing such gaps. Here we introduce an agent-based model describing T cell movements and their interactions with DCs, leading to activation and expansion of cognate T cell clones, in a two-dimensional representation of the lymph node paracortex. The primary objective was to test the putative role of T cell chemotaxis toward DCs, and quantitatively assess the impact of chemotaxis with respect to T cell priming efficacy. Firstly, we evaluated whether chemotaxis of naive T cells toward a nearest DC may accelerate the scanning process, by quantifying, through simulations, the number of unique T cell - DC contact events. We demonstrate that, in the presence of naive T cell-to-DC chemoattraction, a higher total number of contacts occurs, as compared to a T cell random walk scenario. However, the forming swarm of naive T cells, as these cells get attracted to the neighborhood of a DC, may then physically restrict access of additional T cells to the DC, leading to an actual decrease in the cumulative number of unique contacts between naive T cells and DCs. Secondly, we investigated the potential role of chemotaxis in maintaining cognate T cell clone expansion. The time course of cognate T cells number in the system was used as a quantitative characteristic of the expansion. Model-based simulations indicate that inclusion of chemotaxis, which is selective for already activated (but not naive) antigen-specific T cells, may strongly accelerate the time of immune response occurrence, which subsequently increases the overall amplitude of the T cell clone expansion process.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm in computer networks in which resource-constrained objects connect to unreliable Internet by using a wide range of technologies. The insecure nature of the Internet and wireless sensor networks, that are the main components of loT, make loT vulnerable to different attacks, especially routing attacks (as insider attacks). A novel real-time hybrid intrusion detection framework is proposed in this study that consists of anomaly-based and specification-based intrusion detection modules for detecting two well-known routing attacks in IoT called sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks. For this purpose, the specification-based intrusion detection agents, that are located in the router nodes, analyze the behavior of their host nodes and send their local results to the root node through normal data packets. In addition, an anomaly-based intrusion detection agent, that is located in the root node, employs the unsupervised optimum-path forest algorithm for projecting clustering models by using incoming data packets. This agent, which is based on the MapReduce architecture, can work in a distributed platform for projecting clustering models and consequently parallel detecting of anomalies as a global detection approach. The proposed method makes decision about suspicious behavior by using a voting mechanism. Notably, the proposed method is also extended to detect wormhole attack. The deployment of the hybrid proposed model is investigated in a smart-city scenario by an existing platform, as well. The free network's scale and the ability to identify malicious nodes are two key features of the proposed framework that are evaluated through different experiments in this study. The experimental results of simulated scenarios showed that the proposed hybrid method can achieve true positive rate of 76.19% and false positive rate of 5.92% when both sinkhole and selective-forwarding attacks were launched simultaneously. These rates in detecting wormhole attack are 96.02% and 2.08%, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We studied the effect of propranolol administration on risk assessment based on submaximal exercise testing performed early after myocardial infarction.  A total of 70 patients with recent infarction underwent modified Bruce treadmill testing with simultaneous measurement of expired gases in the absence of antianginal agents including beta-antagonists.  Among these, 31 patients who had at least one of the following abnormalities-ST depression greater-than-or-equal-to 1 mm (22 patients), chest pain (four patients), or treadmill time < 360 seconds (12 patients)-were studied in a randomized double-blind fashion and received either placebo or 240 mg of propranolol/day.  A total of 28 patients completed the randomized phase and were able to undergo repeat exercise testing an average of 3.4 +/- 1.8 days later.  Randomized groups were equivalent at baseline except for a higher peak oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (p < 0.05) in the propranolol compared with the placebo group; these differences were taken into account in statistical analyses of the study data.  Resting heart rate (59 +/- 1.2 versus 82 +/- 4.2 beats/min) and peak heart rate X systolic blood pressure (14,208 +/- 496 versus 20,075 +/- 1,062) were both significantly less (p < 0.01) after propranolol than after placebo.  Eight of nine patients treated with placebo maintained ST depression greater-than-or-equal-to 1 mm from the initial to the randomized exercise test, compared with only 4 of 13 receiving propranolol (p < 0.01).  In those with continued ST depression, time to positivity was significantly longer in those receiving propranolol compared with those taking placebo (538 +/- 73 versus 318 +/- 44 seconds, p < 0.05).  In contrast, the peak ratio between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption was higher in those receiving propranolol compared with those receiving placebo (0.93 +/- 0.04 versus 0.81 +/- 0.03, p < 0.05).  We conclude that propranolol therapy reduces evidence of ischemia and changes traditional estimates of potential cardiac risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing.

AB We study a family of monopoly models for markets characterized by time-varying demand functions, in which a boundedly rational agent chooses output levels on the basis of a gradient adjustment mechanism. After presenting the model for a generic framework, we analytically study the case of cyclically alternating demand functions. We show that both the perturbation size and the agent's reactivity to profitability variation signals can have counterintuitive roles on the resulting period-2 cycles and on their stability. In particular, increasing the perturbation size can have both a destabilizing and a stabilizing effect on the resulting dynamics. Moreover, in contrast with the case of time-constant demand functions, the agent's reactivity is not just destabilizing, but can improve stability, too. This means that a less cautious behavior can provide better performance, both with respect to stability and to achieved profits. We show that, even if the decision mechanism is very simple and is not able to always provide the optimal production decisions, achieved profits are very close to those optimal. Finally, we show that in agreement with the existing empirical literature, the price series obtained simulating the proposed model exhibit a significant deviation from normality and large volatility, in particular when underlying deterministic dynamics become unstable and complex.

AB The lifestyle and consumption patterns of the current mobile generation (m-generation), born after the Internet gained popularity, have changed dramatically. This study investigated university students' consumption attitude toward pop music and their behavior of illegally downloading such music by considering different law enforcement environments. In the first stage of our study, we designed and administered a questionnaire survey and collected 424 responses. The valid sample size was 394. On the basis of the sample, we developed a behavioral model that could be customized according to individual observation. In the second stage, we developed an agent-based model for performing a simulation. This study divided law enforcement environments into combinations of the probability of being arrested engaging in illegal downloading behavior and the financial penalty after being caught. The results revealed that in an environment where the strength of law enforcement is increased, the agents' willingness to illegally download music in the model decreases. This empirical study highlighted that the deterrent effects in both the real world and simulated model were more sensitive to the probability of being caught primarily because of illegal downloading behavior. Therefore, the study suggests that for the m-generation of the post-Internet age, the most feasible approach to achieving instant results is through effective and certain law enforcement, which can effectively reduce the copyright infringement in the pop music industry caused by illegal downloading.

DT Review
ID PERIODICITY; HISTORY
AB After an introductory section summarizing the paleontological data and some of their theoretical descriptions, we describe the "reset" model and its (in part analytically soluble) mean field version, which have been briefly introduced in Letters.(1,2) Macroevolution is considered as a problem of stochastic dynamics in a system with many competing agents. Evolutionary events (speciations and extinctions) are triggered by fitness records found by random exploration of the agents' fitness landscapes. As a consequence, the average fitness in the system increases logarithmically with time, while the rate of extinction steadily decreases. This non-stationary dynamics is studied by numerical simulations and, in a simpler mean field version, analytically. We also consider the effect of externally added "mass" extinctions. The predictions for various quantities of paleontological interest (life-time distribution, distribution of event sizes and behavior of the rate of extinction) are robust and in good agreement with available data.

AB Concurrent and reactive systems often exhibit multiple time scales. This situation occurs, for instance, in the discrete simulation of a sensor network where the time scale at which agents communicate is very different from the time scale used to model the internals of an agent.
   The paper presents reactive domains to simplify the programming of such systems. Reactive domains allow for several time scales to be defined and they enable time refinement, that is, the replacement of a system with a more detailed version, without changing its observed behavior.
   Our work applies to the REACTIVEEML language, which extends an ML language with synchronous programming constructs a to Esterel. We present an operational semantics for the extended language, a type system that ensures the soundness of programs, and a sequential implementation. We discuss how reactive domains can be used in a parallel implementation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Adipic acid behavior was studied as a cross-linkage agent for Canavalia ensiformis native starch. A 2(3) factorial design with two replicates of each treatment was utilized. Acid concentration (1 and 2%) and the chemical agent incorporation method (direct incorporation with an initial pH adjustment, direct addition with pH readjustment, and 3% NaOH simultaneous addition) were the factors utilized. Gel firmness and syneresis were used as response variables. Main factors and their interactions showed statistical influence (P < 0.05) over the cross-linkage level achieved; the most effective modification was obtained by reactant direct incorporation. Cross-linkage increased gel firmness (11.25 mm penetration) compared to native starch (14.75 mm penetration), diminished syneresis to 7.15 mL/50 mL, and reduced solubilization and swelling power to 18% and 28.04 g/g levels, respectively.

AB Objectives
   Ultrasound contrast agents, consisting of gas-filled microbubbles (MBs), have been imaged using several techniques that include ultrasound localization microscopy and targeted molecular imaging. Each of these techniques aims to provide indicators of the disease state but has traditionally been performed independently without co-localization of molecular markers and super-resolved vessels. In this article, we present a new imaging technology: a targeted molecular localization (TML) approach, which uses a single imaging sequence and reconstruction approach to co-localize super-resolved vasculature with molecular imaging signature to provide simultaneous anatomic and biological information for potential multiscale disease evaluation. Materials and Methods
   The feasibility of the proposed TML technique was validated in a murine hindlimb tumor model. Targeted molecular localization imaging was performed on 3 groups, which included control tissue (leg), tumor tissue, and tumor tissue after sunitinib an-tivascular treatment. Quantitative measures for vascular index (VI) and molecular index (MITML) were calculated from the microvasculature and TML images, respectively. In addition to these conventional metrics, a new metric unique to the TML technique, reporting the ratio of targeted molecular index to vessel surface, was assessed. Results
   The quantitative resolution results of the TML approach showed resolved resolution of the microvasculature down to 28.8 mu m. Vascular index increased in tumors with and without sunitinib compared with the control leg, but the trend was not statistically significant. A decrease in MITML was observed for the tumor after treatment (P < 0.0005) and for the control leg (P < 0.005) compared with the tumor before treatment. Statistical differences in the ratio of molecular index to vessel surface were found between all groups: the control leg and tumor (P < 0.05), the control leg and tumor after sunitinib treatment (P < 0.05), and between tumors with and without sunitinib treatment (P < 0.001). Conclusions
   These findings validated the technical feasibility of the TML method and pre-clinical feasibility for differentiating between the normal and diseased tissue states.

AB To elucidate the structural properties required for antihypertensive activity, three different molecular modelling techniques, two-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (2D-QSAR), group-based quantitative structure activity relationship (G- QSAR), and three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies, have been carried out on a series of substituted imidazolyl biphenyl sulfonylureas derivatives. Multiple linear regressions methodology, viz. variable simulated annealing and stepwise methods, was applied to derive models which were further validated for statistical significance and predictive ability by internal and external validation. The best 2D-QSAR model was selected, having showed best predictability of activity with cross- validated value (q(2)) 0: 7866, coefficient of determination (r(2)) = 0: 8003. The r(2)_pred value of 0.7651 indicates predictability of test set analogues and reveals a significant and robust model, and best G- QSAR model having r(2) = 7459 and q(2) = 0: 6712 with pred_ r(2) = 0: 7105 was developed by SA-MLR. Using k-nearest neighbour approach, various 3D-QSAR models were generated and selected on the basis of q(2) and predictive r(2) values. The analysed best 3D-QSAR model revealed a good fit, having r(2) value of 0.8240 and q(2) value of 0.7523. The predictive power of the model generated was validated using a test set comprising molecules with pred_ r(2) value of 0.7299. The results of two-dimensional QSAR and groupbased QSAR showed that a combination of revealed the key role of Baumann's alignment-independent topological descriptors along with other descriptors such as the number of SsssCH count, SaasCE-index, SsOHcount indices properties could be explored to design potent antihypertensive agents. Finally, it is hoped that the work presented here will play an important role in understanding the relationship of physiochemical parameters with structure and biological activity.

AB One of the challenging issues in supply chain management is the coordination of ordering processes, especially in dynamic situations. In recent years, reinforcement learning algorithms are considered to be efficient techniques for solving such problems. In this paper, an agent-based simulation technique has been integrated with a reinforcement learning algorithm and has been applied to model a four-echelon supply chain that faces non-stationary customer demands. This approach leads to the development of a novel and intelligent simulation-based optimization framework, which includes a detailed simulation modeling of supply chain behavior. Finally statistical methods, including the Var technique, are used for the risk evaluation and sensitivity analysis have been provided to support the decision making process under uncertainty.

AB This research proposes a computational framework for generating visual attending behavior in an embodied simulated human agent. Such behaviors directly control eye and head motions, and guide other actions such as locomotion and reach. The implementation of these concepts, referred to as the AVA, draws on empirical and qualitative observations known from psychology, human factors and computer vision. Deliberate behaviors, the analogs of scanpaths in visual psychology, compete with involuntary attention capture and lapses into idling or free viewing. Insights provided by implementing this framework are: a defined set of parameters that impact the observable effects of attention, a defined vocabulary of looking behaviors for certain motor and cognitive activity, a defined hierarchy of three levels of eye behavior (endogenous, exogenous and idling) and a proposed method of how these types interact.

AB We first analyze the distribution of metropolitan (city) size, the distribution of metropolitan (city) GDP and the relation of both distributions. It is found that (1) the tails of distributions of size and GDP both obey Pareto Law with the Pareto exponent 1; (2) compared with Pareto exponent in GDP, Pareto exponent in size is bigger. Then an agent model is built to study the underlying formation mechanism of distributions of region size and GDP. Our model presents the mechanism how economic factors flow between regions to reproduce the tail behavior and the difference between the Pareto exponents of size and those of GDP. At last, the simulated results agree with the real empirical well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Although a wealth of studies on companies' environmental behavior exists, little is known about the factors with the greatest influence on the evolution of such behavior. Thus, employing empirical data on China and an agent-based simulation model, this study examines the evolution from defensive to preventive environmental behavior. The results show that community support is the most important factor in this process, followed by managers' environmental awareness and companies' financial ability. However, financial ability is the most significant factor in the evolution from preventive to enthusiastic environmental behavior, followed by managers' environmental awareness and community support. Our identification of the most important factors can serve as a basis for decision makers to focus on improving the operational effectiveness of environmental policies.

AB The development of an inductive learning agent for simulating evolutionary processes (Ilse), which is meant to be linked to the ALBATROSS model, is discussed. The agent was developed to simulate learning and adaptation in travel behavior. It is assumed that at the start of the process, characterized by a high degree of uncertainty, individuals will display information-seeking behavior and choose the alternative that maximizes the entropy of outcomes. As learning proceeds, individuals will switch to goal-seeking behavior and select the alternative that maximizes the expected size of the outcome value. A series of computer experiments using simulated data were conducted to illustrate the system. Simulations showed that the system is able to learn even under conditions of noisy feedback, irrelevant attribute information, and fairly complicated interactions between relevant attributes. A combined information- and goal-seeking strategy increases learning speed.

AB Anthrax is an infectious disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic bacterium. The lethal factor (LF) enzyme is secreted by B. anthracis as part of a tripartite exotoxin and is chiefly responsible for anthrax-related cytotoxicity. As LF can remain in the system long after antibiotics have eradicated B. anthracis from the body, the preferred therapeutic modality Would be the administration of antibiotics together with an effective LF inhibitor. Although LF has garnered a great deal of attention as an attractive target for rational drug design, relatively few published inhibitors have demonstrated activity in cell-based assays and, to date, no LF inhibitor is available as a therapeutic or preventive agent. Here we present a novel in silico high-throughput virtual screening protocol that successfully identified 5 non-hydroxamic acid small molecules as new, preliminary LF inhibitor scaffolds with low micromolar inhibition against that target, resulting in a 12.8% experimental hit rate. This protocol screened approximately 35 million nonredundant compounds for potential activity against LF and comprised topomeric searching, docking and scoring, and drug-like filtering. Among these 5 hit compounds, none of which has previously been identified as a LF inhibitor, three exhibited experimental IC50 values less than 100 mu M. These three preliminary hits may potentially serve as scaffolds for lead optimization as well as templates for probe compounds to be used in mechanistic studies. Notably, Our docking Simulations predicted that these novel hits are likely to engage in critical ligand-receptor interactions with nearby residues in at least two of the three (S1', S1-S2, and S2') subsites in the LF Substrate binding area. Further experimental characterization of these compounds is in process. We found that micromolar-level LF inhibition can be attained by Compounds with non-hydroxamate zinc-binding groups that exhibit monodentate zinc chelation as long as key hydrophobic interactions with at least two LF subsites are retained.

AB We describe an approach to model genetic regulatory networks at the level of promotion inhibition circuitry through a class of stochastic spin models that includes spatial and temporal density fluctuations in a natural way. The formalism can be viewed as an agent-based model formalism with agent behaviour ruled by a classical spin-like pseudo-Hamiltonian playing the role of a local, individual objective function. A particular but otherwise generally applicable choice for the microscopic transition rates of the models also makes them of independent interest. To illustrate the formalism, we investigate (by Monte Carlo simulations) some stationary state properties of the repressilator, a synthetic three-gene network of transcriptional regulators that possesses oscillatory behaviour.

AB In this paper, we develop a theoretical contribution towards the understanding of the complex behavior of conjoint tumor-normal cell growth under the influence of immuno-chemotheraputic agents under simple immune system response. In particular, we consider a core model for the interaction of tumor cells with the surrounding normal cells. We then add the effects of a simple immune system, and both immune-suppression factors and immuno-chemotherapeutic agents as well. Through a series of numerical simulations, we illustrate that the interdependency of tumor-normal cells, together with choice of drug and the nature of the immunodeficiency, leads to a variety of interesting patterns in the evolution of both the tumor and the normal cell populations.

ID FINANCIAL FRAGILITY
AB This paper assumes that financial fluctuations are the result of the dynamic interaction between liquidity and solvency conditions of individual economic units. The framework is an extention of Sordi and Vercelli (2012) designed as an heterogeneous agent model which proceeds through discrete time steps within a finite time horizon. The interaction at the micro-level between economic units monitors the spread of contagion and systemic risk, producing interesting complex dynamics. The model is analysed by means of numerical simulations and systemic risk modelling, where local interaction of units is captured and analysed by the bilateral provision of liquidity among units. The behaviour and evolution of economic units are studied for different parameter regimes in order to investigate the relation between units' expectations, liquidity regimes and contagion. Liquidity policy implications are briefly discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We review the usefulness of urban spatial economic models of land use change for the study and policy analysis of spatial land use-environment interactions. We find that meaningful progress has been made in econometric and monocentric models extended to account for multiple sources of spatial heterogeneity and in the development of general equilibrium models with spatial dynamics. Despite these advances, more work is needed in developing models with greater realism. Most agent-based computational models of urban land use change currently lack economic fundamentals, but provide a flexible means of linking microlevel behavior and interactions with macrolevel land use dynamics. In combination with empirical methods to identify parameters, this framework provides a promising approach to modeling spatial land use dynamics and policy effects.

TI Urban growth and the emergent statistics of cities
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Urban theory models cities as spatial equilibria to derive their aggregate properties as functions of extensive variables, such as population size. However, this assumption seems at odds with cities' most interesting properties as engines of fast and variable processes of growth and change. Here, we build a general statistical dynamics of cities across scales, from single agents to entire urban systems. We include agents' strategic behavior to produce predictable growth rates, which requires balancing relative incomes and costs over time. We implement these dynamics using stochastic differential equations and control theory to demonstrate a number of general emergent properties of cities deriving from limit theorems applied to growth rates. This framework establishes necessary conditions for scaling to be conserved by urban dynamics and shows how exponent corrections can be calculated. These ideas are tested using stochastic simulations and a long timeseries for 382 US Metropolitan Areas over nearly five decades.

AB We describe the main idea and the conceptual architecture of a platform for simulating a large number of asynchronously interacting agents in continuous time. We show how the generic capabilities of the platform apply to the simulation of realistic stock market interactions. A particular example of a very dramatic market event that took place in Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) on September 20, 2002 is used to uncover the parameters characterizing the classical investor types within the market. The simple microscopic rules governing the individual agents behavior are shown to result in a collective market behavior similar to the one of a damped harmonic oscillator. Specifically, the aggregated influence of the fundamentalist traders is formally related to Hooke's law while the behavior of the trend followers corresponds to inertia and viscous friction forces.

AB Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) have been studied extensively as promising radiation dose enhancing agents. In the current study, the dose enhancement effect of GNPs for Ir-192 HDR brachytherapy is studied using Monte Carlo N-Particle code, version 6.2 (MCNP6.2) and compared with experimental results obtained using Burlin cavity theory formalism. The Ir-192 source is verified using TG-43 parameters and dose enhancement factors (DEFs) from GNPs are simulated for three different mass percentages of gold in the GNP solution. These results are compared to DEFs previously reported experimentally by our group (Bassiriet al2019Med. Phys.) for a GNP-containing volume in an apparatus designed in-house to measure dose enhancement with GNPs for high dose rate (HDR) Ir-192 brachytherapy. An HDR Ir-192 Microselectron v2 r HDR brachytherapy source was modeled using MCNP6.2 using the TG-43 formalism in water. Anisotropy and radial dose function were verified against known values. An apparatus designed to measure dose enhancement to a 0.75 cm(3)volume of GNPs from an Ir-192 brachytherapy seed with average energy of 0.38 MeV was built in-house and modeled using MCNP6.2. Burlin cavity correction factors were applied to experimental measurements. The macroscopic DEF was calculated for GNPs of size 30 nm at mass percentages of gold of 0.28%, 0.56% and 0.77%, using the repeating structures capability of MCNP6.2. DEF was calculated by dividing dose to the GNP solution by dose to water in the same volume. The radial dose function and anisotropy factor values at varying angles and distances were accurate when compared against known values. DEFs of 1.018 +/- 0.003, 1.031 +/- 0.003, and 1.041 +/- 0.003 for GNP solutions containing mass percent of gold of 0.28%, 0.56% and 0.77%, respectively, were computed. These DEFs were within 2% of experimental values with Burlin cavity correction factors applied for all three mass percentages of gold.

AB The relevance of risk preference and forecasting accuracy for investor survival has recently been the focus of a series of theoretical and simulation studies. At one extreme, it has been proven that risk preference can be entirely irrelevant (Sandroni in Econometrica 68:1303-1341, 2000; Blume and Easley in Econometrica 74(4):929-966, 2006). However, the agent-based computational approach indicates that risk preference matters and can be more relevant for survivability than forecasting accuracy (Chen and Huang in Advances in natural computation, Springer, Berlin, 2005; J Econ Behav Organ 67(3):702-717, 2008; Huang in J Econ Interact Coord, 2015). Chen and Huang (Inf Sci 177(5):1222-1229, 2007, 2008) further explained that it is the saving behavior of traders that determines their survivability. However, institutional investors do not have to consider saving decisions that are the most influential investors in modern financial markets. Additionally, traders in the above series of theoretical and simulation studies have learned to forecast the stochastic process that determines which asset will pay dividends, not the market prices and dividends. To relate the research on survivability to issues with respect to the efficient markets hypothesis, it is better to endow agents with the ability to forecast market prices and dividends. With the Santa Fe Artificial Stock Market, where traders do not have to consider saving decisions and can learn to forecast both asset prices and dividends, we revisit the issue of survivability and market efficiency. We find that the main finding of Chen and Huang 2008 that risk preference is much more relevant for survivability than forecasting accuracy still holds for a wide range of market conditions but can fail when the baseline dividend becomes very small. Moreover, the advantage of traders who are less averse to risk is revealed in the market where saving decisions are not taken into account. Finally, Huang's (2015) argument regarding the degree of market inefficiency is confirmed.

TI Morphology of technological levels in an innovation propagation model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID DYNAMICS
AB We study the dynamical properties of the propagation of innovation on a two-dimensional lattice, random network, scale-free network, and Cayley tree. In order to investigate the diversity of technological level, we study the scaling property of width, W(N, t), which represents the root mean square of the technological level of agents. Here, N is the total number of agents. From the numerical simulations, we find that the steady-state value of W(N, t), W-sat(N), scales as W-sat(N) similar to N-1/2 when the system is in a flat ordered phase for d >= 2. In the flat ordered phase, most of the agents have the same technological level. On the other hand, when the system is in a smooth disordered phase, the value of W-sat(N) does not depend on N. These behaviors are completely different from those observed on a one-dimensional (1D) lattice. By considering the effect of the underlying topology on the propagation dynamics for d >= 2, we also provide a mean-field analysis for W-sat(N), which agrees very well with the observed behaviors of W-sat(N). This directly shows that the morphological properties in order-disorder transition on a 1D lattice is completely different from that on higher dimensions. It also provides an evidence that the upper critical dimension for the roughening transition of the propagation of innovation is d(u)=2.

AB Electric vehicles offer the potential of climate-friendly driving and have received more and more attention in diffusion research recently. However, the effect of the availability of home charging options on the market potential of electric vehicles has not been targeted in detail in the diffusion process so far, although it represents a beneficial differentiation to conventional vehicles. Therefore, we present an agent-based simulation to address the buying behavior of German consumers regarding electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles using empirical data primarily derived from a choice-based conjoint study. We explicitly consider individual possibilities of home charging in our model, which appears to have an important influence on the diffusion of both, electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. However, its importance decreases with faster charging times at public charging stations. Furthermore, our findings reveal that in the longer term, technological progress in charging time, range, and charging station density of electric vehicles is presumably cannibalizing plug-in hybrid electric vehicles' market shares more than that of conventional vehicles. However, with still lower technological capabilities of electric vehicles, a governmental subsidy can initially promote plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, but electric vehicles will benefit later from that promotional effect.

AB We study identification and estimation of finite-horizon dynamic discrete choice models with a terminal action. We first demonstrate a new set of conditions for the identification of agents' time preferences. Then we prove conditions under which the per-period utilities are identified for all actions in the agent's choice-set, without having to normalize the utility for one of the actions. Finally, we develop a computationally tractable semiparametric estimator. The estimator uses a two-step approach that does not use either backward induction or forward simulation. Our methodology can be implemented using standard statistical packages without the need to write specialized computational routines, as it involves linear (or nonlinear) projections only. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate the superior performance of our estimator compared with existing two-step estimation methods. Monte Carlo studies further demonstrate that the ability to identify the per-period utilities for all actions is crucial for counterfactual predictions. As an empirical illustration, we apply the estimator to the optimal default behavior of subprime mortgage borrowers, and the results show that the ability to identify the discount factor, rather than assuming an arbitrary number as typically done in the literature, is also crucial for obtaining correct counterfactual predictions. These findings highlight the empirical relevance of key identification results of the paper.

AB Durability problems initiated from steel corrosion are unseen but critical issues, so that many researches are focused on chloride penetration evaluation. Even if RC (Reinforced Concrete) structures are exposed to normal environment, chloride ingress varies with concrete surface conditions and exposed period. This paper presents an analysis technique for chloride behavior evaluation considering time effect on diffusion and surface conditions assumed as double-layered system. For evaluation of deteriorated surface condition, field investigation was performed for concrete pavement exposed to deicing agent for 18 years. In order to consider enhanced surface concrete, chloride profiles in surface-impregnated concretes exposed to chloride attack for 2 years from previous research were investigated. Through reverse analysis, effectively deteriorated/enhanced depth of surface and the related reduced/enlarged diffusion coefficient in the depth are simulated. The proposed analysis technique was evaluated to handle the chloride behavior more accurately considering changes of chloride ingress within surface layer and decreased diffusion coefficient with time. For the concrete surface exposed to deicing agent, the deteriorated depth and enlarged diffusion coefficient are evaluated to be 12.5 similar to 15.0 mm and 200% increasing diffusion coefficient, respectively. The results in concrete containing enhanced cover show 10.0 similar to 12.5 mm of impregnated depth and 85% reduction of chloride diffusion in tidal and submerged conditions.

AB Theories of choice in economics typically assume that interacting agents act individualistically and maximize their own utility. Specifically, game theory proposes that rational players should defect in one-shot prisoners' dilemmas (PD). Defection also appears to be the inevitable outcome for agents who learn by reinforcement of past choices, because whatever the other player does, defection leads to greater reinforcement on each trial. In a computer simulation and 4 experiments, the authors show that, apparently paradoxically, when players' choices are correlated by an exogenous factor (here, the cooperativeness of the specific PD chosen), people obtain greater average reinforcement for cooperating, which can sustain cooperation. This effect arises from a well-known statistical paradox, Simpson's paradox. The authors speculate that this effect may be relevant to aspects of real-world human cooperative behavior.

DE Inverse reinforcement learning; Visuomotor behavior; Spatial navigation;
   Task priorities
ID BASAL GANGLIA; DOPAMINE
AB In a large variety of situations one would like to have an expressive and accurate model of observed animal or human behavior. While general purpose mathematical models may capture successfully properties of observed behavior, it is desirable to root models in biological facts. Because of ample empirical evidence for reward-based learning in visuomotor tasks, we use a computational model based on the assumption that the observed agent is balancing the costs and benefits of its behavior to meet its goals. This leads to using the framework of reinforcement learning, which additionally provides well-established algorithms for learning of visuomotor task solutions. To quantify the agent's goals as rewards implicit in the observed behavior, we propose to use inverse reinforcement learning, which quantifies the agent's goals as rewards implicit in the observed behavior. Based on the assumption of a modular cognitive architecture, we introduce a modular inverse reinforcement learning algorithm that estimates the relative reward contributions of the component tasks in navigation, consisting of following a path while avoiding obstacles and approaching targets. It is shown how to recover the component reward weights for individual tasks and that variability in observed trajectories can be explained succinctly through behavioral goals. It is demonstrated through simulations that good estimates can be obtained already with modest amounts of observation data, which in turn allows the prediction of behavior in novel configurations.

AB Policies on harvesting and conservation are developed in response to information about trends in the abundance of species, so making accurate estimates of abundance is important. However, estimating the abundance of sparsely distributed species is challenging, especially where direct observations are difficult. We collected observations of blacktip reef sharks Carcharhinus melanopterus by using remote underwater video cameras, and developed an agent-based model to generate estimates of the density of sharks from the frequency of observations made using the video. We augmented these observations with diel patterns in detections in different habitats of C. melanopterus with surgically implanted acoustic transmitters. Median estimates of density ranged from 2-9 ind. km(-2) at noon to 20-90 ind. km(-2) at dusk, depending on whether modelled movement paths were random or directional. These estimates suggest that individuals might exhibit diel patterns in movement, with directional movement to the reef flat during dusk. Data from tagged individuals supported this hypothesis, with more detections recorded from reef flat habitat during early evening and early morning than at other times of day. Estimates of density were among the highest reported for C. melanopterus. The agent-based model approach is flexible, and can be extended to simulate a range of behaviours and other types of observations.

TI Imagery in cognitive architecture: Representation and control at
   multiple levels of abstraction
SO COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB In a cognitive architecture, intelligent behavior is contingent upon the use of an appropriate abstract representation of the task. When designing a general-purpose cognitive architecture, two basic challenges related to abstraction arise, which are introduced and examined in this article. The perceptual abstraction problem results from the difficulty of creating a single perception system able to induce appropriate abstract representations in any task the agent might encounter, and the irreducibility problem arises because some tasks are resistant to being abstracted at all. The first contribution of this paper is identifying these problems, and the second contribution is showing a means to address them. This is accomplished through the use of mental imagery.
   To support imagery, a concrete (highly detailed) representation of the spatial state of the problem is maintained as an intermediate between the external world and an abstract representation. Actions can be simulated (imagined) in terms of this concrete representation, and the agent can derive abstract information by applying perceptual processes to the resulting concrete state. Imagery works to mitigate the perceptual abstraction problem by allowing a given perception system to work in a wider variety of tasks, since perception can be dynamically combined with imagery, and works to mitigate the irreducibility problem by allowing internal simulation of low-level control processes.
   To demonstrate these benefits, an implementation is described, which is an extension of the Soar architecture. An agent in this architecture that uses reinforcement learning and imagery to play an arcade game and an agent that performs sampling-based motion planning for a car-like vehicle are described, demonstrating the perceptual abstraction and irreducibility problems and the associated use of imagery to mitigate those problems in complex AI tasks.
   Previous AI systems have incorporated imagery-like processes, however, the functional benefit of imagery in those systems has typically been characterized as the ability to perform more efficient inference through the use of a specialized representation. The use of imagery here shows further benefits related to the perceptual abstraction and irreducibility problems, enriching the broader understanding of the role of imagery in cognitive systems.

AB Because the magnitude of spontaneous bacterial clearance can be similar or even higher than treatment effect, depending upon experimental model and bacterial strain used, this work investigated the value of rendering rats immunosuppressed to facilitate bacterial implantation and reduce spontaneous bacterial clearance. In a first step, rats received a single intravenous cyclophosphamide dose 4days before infection. Three different doses were tested: 10, 20, and 40mg/kg. After modeling with NONMEM V, the cyclophosphamide dose required to maintain white blood cell count <1.0x103/L from day 4 to day 5 was 30mg/kg. In a second step, influence of immunosuppression on lung bacterial titers was characterized. Rats were given one of the three intravenous cyclophosphamide doses (0, 10, 30mg/kg), and after 4days, they were infected by tracheal injection of 8.9 +/- 0.1log10cfu Enterobacter cloacae before being sacrificed at different times. Bacteria in homogenized lungs were quantitatively cultured on Drigalski agar. Bacterial lung count was closely influenced by the grade of induced leukopenia. A single intravenous 30mg/kg cyclophosphamide dose 4days before infection suppressed the spontaneous clearance of E.cloacae for at least 30h without significantly increasing animal mortality; this result seems to be linked to a white blood cell count maintained lower than 1.0x103/L for all the time. This modified animal model could be contributive in the evaluation of antibacterial agents, especially to simulate the behavior of intensive care unit immunocompromised patients.

TI Study of the mechanism of oscillatory solid-phase combustion by a
   non-linear chemical kinetic model
SO JOURNAL OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY-FARADAY TRANSACTIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB Oscillatory solid-phase pyrotechnic combustion in the following system
   NH4ClO4 + Mg (powder) + K2Cr2O7
   is studied, where NH4ClO4, Mg and K2Cr2O7 are the oxidant, reducing agent and frequency-modulating species, respectively, in order to elucidate a more detailed description of the oscillatory mechanism. The simplicity of this pyrotechnic system serves our purposes very well.
   It is shown that the combustion of the above system is highly oscillatory in nature. Once ignited, the mixture exhibits 'pulsed burning', the intensity of the combustion varying periodically between flash combustion (deflagration) and smokeless smouldering. A number of experiments were carried out which confirmed that the phenomenon is intrinsic and that the controlling process chemical in nature.
   According to the results of the experiments and the observed combustion phenomena, the following chemical kinetic mechanism for the oscillatory process is suggested
   [GRAPHICS]
   It is considered that the competiting reactions between the three phases of Mg with the oxidizable gases produced by the decomposition of NH4ClO4 control the oscillatory burning process. Based on this analysis, the following simplified qualitative chemical kinetical model is proposed
   [GRAPHICS]
   and kinetic equations are deduced. The results of the simulation of the autocatalytic model using non-linear numerical methods are reported and discussed. Steady-state solution and oscillatory behaviour is obtained, in good agreement with experimental phenomena.

AB Residential energy efficiency is an important strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There are many technologies that help improve residential energy efficiency, and in fact, increased energy efficiency has already helped reduce global greenhouse gas emissions significantly in the past. However, with greater innovation, further improvements can be made and improving energy efficiency is an ongoing activity. Policymakers around the world are putting strategies in place to speed up the adoption of energy efficient technologies and practices, but ultimately this process is based on choice by residents themselves. Human decision making and choice however is a very complex issue, and complex computational tools are required in order to analyse and/or predict the impact of various policies. Traditionally, equation-based models such as Bass and Choice models have been used to describe the diffusion of technologies in a population, but certain limitations have been identified. This article explores what these limitations are in the context of energy efficient residential technologies and how an alternative computational and empirical paradigm, Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), can help resolve some of these limitations. As such, this is a review article into how ABM can support analysis of strategies to catalyse greater uptake of energy efficiency in the residential sector.

AB A continuous flow micro-reactor irradiated by UV-LEDs was employed to treat coloured wastewater by adsorption and simultaneous photocatalysis. Zinc oxide (ZnO) immobilized on commercial zeolites pellets in spherical shape (ZEO) was used as catalytic material in a micro-reactor maximizing the photocatalyst exposition to light sources, irradiating uniformly the entire solution volume and improving the mass transfer phenomena. Experimental tests were carried out on crystal violet dye (CV) as one of the main dying agent present in textile wastewater. The comparison between adsorption and adsorption/photocatalytic tests showed that UV irradiation can achieve a steady state CV concentration value corresponding to an equilibrium condition between adsorption and photocatalytic oxidation. The higher removal efficiency (i.e. 93%) was observed with a liquid flow rate of 1.1 mL/min (contact time = 4.7 min; CV = 10 mg/L) under UV light irradiation. In the steady state, CV removal remained constant for the overall testing time. Bioassays evidenced that toxicity was not completely removed (i.e. final effluent ranked as "slight acute toxic") from wastewater suggesting its suitability for sewage collection discharge. A Dubinin Radushkevich (D-R) isotherm model was applied for studying the adsorption behaviour of ZnO/ZEO sample. CV adsorption constants were evaluated from experimental data carried out in dark conditions in a batch system. Kinetic expression of CV removal and the D-R adsorption were incorporated in the CV mass balance estimating the kinetic parameter. The model was validated comparing the calculated CV conversion with the experimental tests collected at different CV inlet concentration. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB To understand the nanoparticle formation of quercetin in the poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid/water system, a multiscale approach combining experimental, molecular, and mesoscale modelings was carried out. The evolution of interactions occurring between compounds mixed at different ratios was evaluated by the order parameter, calculated using MesoDyn simulations. The obtained results indicated that the studied systems allowed to produce spherical nanoparticles well distributed in the continuous medium (water). The fast kinetics of nanoparticle formation is reached with 10 g L-1 of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid, 0.5 g L-1 of quercetin, and 0.5% of polyvinyl alcohol. The corresponding order parameter of water (P-water) was equal to 0.018. The increase of poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid and quercetin concentrations and the lactic acid content in poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid favor the formation of nanoparticles with a large size. The formed nanoparticles were composed of quercetin in the center of the system, poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid, as the second layer, and polyvinyl alcohol as the third layer. The water is the continuous phase. The shape, the size, and the order organization of nanoparticles were checked experimentally using transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The obtained results indicated that experimental investigations are in good agreement with the simulated ones. Therefore, computational mesoscopic modeling can be used as a successful tool to predict the behavior of quercetin/poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid/water systems under different operating conditions.

AB Computational models of mechanobiological systems have been widely used to provide insight into these systems and also to predict their behaviour. In this context, vascular tissue engineering benefits from further attention given the challenges involved in developing functional low calibre vascular grafts with long-term patency. In this study, a novel multiscale mechanobiological modelling framework is presented, which takes advantage of lattice-free agent-based models coupled with the finite element method to investigate the dynamics of VSMC growth in vascular tissue engineering scaffolds. The results illustrate the ability of the mechanobiological modelling approach to capture complex multiscale mechanobiological phenomena. Specifically, the framework enabled the study of the influence of scaffold compliance and loading regime in regulating the growth of VSMCs in vascular scaffolds and their role in development of intimal hyperplasia (IH). The model demonstrates that low scaffold compliance compared to host arteries leads to increased luminal ingrowth and IH development. In addition, culture of a tissue-engineered blood vessel under a pulsatile luminal pressure reduced luminal ingrowth and enhanced collagen synthesis within the scaffold compared to non-pulsatile culture. The mechanobiological framework presented provides a robust platform for testing hypotheses in vascular tissue engineering and lends itself to use as an optimisation design tool.

AB A quantitative analysis was undertaken to calibrate the perfusion quantification technique based on tracking the first pass of a bolus of a blood pool contrast agent. A complete simulation of the bolus passage, of the associated changes in the T-2 and T-2(*) signals, and of the data processing was performed using the tracer dilution theory, an analytical theory of the MR signal from living tissues and numerical simulations. The noise was excluded in the simulation in order to analyze the ultimate accuracy of the method. It is demonstrated that the relationship between the contrast agent concentration and the associated changes in the transverse relaxation rate shows essentially different forms in studied tissue and in the reference artery. This effect results in systematic deviations of the measured blood flow, blood volume, and the residue function obtained with conventional processing from their true values. The error depends on the microvascular composition, the properties of the contrast agent, and the weights of the various compartments in the total signal. The results show that dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI can reach the goal of absolute perfusion quantification only with additional input from measurements of the microvascular architecture. Alternatively, the method can be used to provide such information if the perfusion is quantified by another modality. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This paper reviews the importance of the interaction between cultural evolution, biological evolution and individual cognition in understanding the cognitive nature of speech sound systems. Because of the effect of cultural evolution, typological properties of languages do not reflect individual cognitive mechanisms directly. In addition, the interaction between cultural evolution and biological evolution deeply influences what kind of cognitive adaptations to speech can evolve.
   Theoretical work and computer simulation have shown that at least two kinds of adaptations to speech and language can evolve. One consists of weak biases to discrete features of language (such as word order) that convey a functional advantage. The other consists of stronger adaptations involving continuous traits in which language and biology can co-evolve (the vocal tract being a possible example of such a co-evolved adaptation). Experimental work is underway to identify how exactly cultural and biological evolution interact in human speech and language, and what cognitive mechanisms (if any) may have undergone selective pressure related to speech and language.
   The paper reviews a number of studies that take the evolutionary perspective, focusing notably on agent-based computer simulations and on experimental work that simulates evolution in the laboratory or experimental work that investigates the interaction between individual learning behavior and cultural transmission directly. The paper argues that taking the evolutionary perspective (both cultural and biological, as well as their interaction) into account is necessary for a full understanding of the cognitive nature of language and speech.

AB The binding and antiproliferative activities of synthetic peptides 29-35 and 122-139 of interferon-alpha 2b, both of which contain a cysteine residue in their sequences, were studied in the presence or absence of a dissociation medium containing mainly urea, dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol. Although interferon-alpha 2b peptides either did not modify or slightly increased I-125-labelled interferon-alpha 2b specific binding to WISH cell-membrane receptors in the absence of dissociation medium, significant binding inhibition was obtained when both peptides were assayed in dissociation medium. Furthermore, also in the presence of dissociating agents, the two fragments inhibited cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner, the 122-139 sequence being more effective than the 29-35 sequence. No additive effect on interferon binding and cell proliferation was observed when both peptides were added simultaneously. Results obtained after submitting peptide 122-139 to gel filtration or PAGE under different experimental conditions showed the presence of dimers and/or noncovalent aggregates arising from intermolecular disulfide bridges or hydrophobic interactions. Thus, our results indicated that peptide effects on I-125-labelled interferon-alpha 2b binding and WISH cell proliferation were dearly manifested when the amount of monomeric species increased, showing that suitable experimental conditions should be used to study peptide behavior. The ability of both peptides to effectively trigger an interferon-specific biological action, such as cell growth inhibition, strongly suggested that 29-35 and 122-139 interferon-alpha 2b fragments constitute the conformational epitope or mimotope that interacts with the cytokine-specific receptor.

AB Carbon dioxide is known as an important agent in aqueous media to induce chemical attack on building materials. The leaching behavior of pea gravels, which are used as backfill material in continuous tunneling, is not entirely resolved until now. Evaluating the durability and economical advantage of individual backfill materials requires a proper experimental design to survey the dissolution reactions and to develop a useful modelling approach to calculate dissolution for carbonate bearing pea gravels. In this study a combined flow through reactor unit was developed, where conditions for chemical attack on gravel material can be simulated by changing flow rate and/or CO2 partial pressure. The addition of CO2(gas) was adjusted by pH(stat) conditions. Solution chemistry was monitored in-situ and by analyzing samples throughout experimental runs. For 5 natural gravels with different calcite(dolomite)/quartz ratios, the dissolution rates of Ca2+ for carbonates (R-Ca_cc; normalized on exposed carbonate surfaces) were found to reflect mineralogy, carbonate content, flow rates and thus saturation state conditions. R(Ca_dol )values for dolomite are significantly lower (10(-12) < R-Ca_dol < 10(-13) mol CM-2S-1) compared to calcite (10(-9)< R-Ca_cc < 10(-12)MOl CM-2S-1). The experimentally obtained R-Ca values from the pea gravels and literature data were used to develop a model that estimates the durability of pea gravel and Ca2+ transfer to a drainage system for potential carbonate scaling at various environmental conditions. Our contribution highlights that the application of limestone and dolostone as backfill material can only be reliably assessed by considering the local hydrological and hydrochemical conditions.

AB We focus on the state-of-the-art theory of electromigration under single and multiple complexation equilibrium. Only 1:1 complexation stoichiometry is discussed because of its unique status in the field of affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). First, we summarize the formulas for the effective mobility in various ACE systems as they appeared since the pioneering days in 1992 up to the most recent theories till 2015. Disturbing phenomena that do not alter the mobility of the analyte directly but cause an unexpected peak broadening have been studied only recently and are also discussed in this paper. Second, we turn our attention to the viscosity effects in ACE. Change in the background electrolyte viscosity is unavoidable in ACE but numerous observations scattered throughout the literature have not been reviewed previously. This leads to an uncritical employment of correction factors that may or may not be appropriate in practice. Finally, we consider the ionic strength effects in ACE, too. Limitations of the current theories are also discussed and the tasks identified where open problems still prevail.

AB Road surface maintenance is a difficult problem in traffic management due to the interference with traffic. Considering the irrational road surface maintenance scheme in practice, a bilevel simulation-optimization model is proposed in this paper. The decision-making variable of the upper-level model was the road surface maintenance scheme, while the objective was to minimize the total travel time and maintenance cost. Meanwhile, the lower-level model was designed to assign traffic flows, where cars choose their best route in real time at the intersections according to the utility function to make the model more realistic. The local branching algorithm and NetLogo simulation were applied respectively in the upper and lower models. A numerical test was employed to validate the proposed model. As results show, the bilevel programming model in this paper performs well in reducing the total travel time of travelers and improving the service level of road surface maintenance. The proposed model provides good feasibility and is a good reference for road managers and the decision making of actual road maintenance managers. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Disease spreading models need a population model to organize how individuals are distributed over space and how they are connected. Usually, disease agent (bacteria, virus) passes between individuals through these connections and an epidemic outbreak may occur. Here, complex networks models, like Erclos-Wenyi, Small-World, Scale-Free and Barabasi-Albert will be used for modeling a population, since they are used for social networks; and the disease will be modeled by a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model. The objective of this work is, regardless of the network/population model, analyze which topological parameters are more. relevant for a disease success or failure. Therefore, the SIR model is simulated in a wide range of each network model and a first analysis is done. By using data from all simulations, an investigation with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is done in order to find the most relevant topological and disease parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper interprets the hydromechanical behaviour of a steep, forested, instrumented slope during an artificial rainfall event, which triggered a shallow slope failure 15 h after rainfall initiation. The soil's mechanical response has been simulated by coupled hydro-mechanical finite-element analyses, using a critical state constitutive model that has been extended to unsaturated conditions. Failure occurs within a colluvium shallow soil cover, characterised as a silty sand of low plasticity. The hydraulic and mechanical parameters are calibrated, based on an extended set of experimental results, ranging from water retention curve measurements to triaxial stress path tests under both saturated and unsaturated conditions. Rainfall is simulated as a water flux at the soil surface and suitable boundary conditions account for the hydromechanical interaction between the soil cover and the underlying bedrock. The results are compared with field data of the mechanistic and the hydraulic responses up to failure and are found to provide a very satisfactory prediction. The study identifies water exfiltration from bedrock fissures as the main triggering agent, resulting in increased pore pressures along the soil-bedrock interface, reduced available shear strength and cause extensive plastic straining, leading to the formation and propagation of a failure surface.

AB Most problems concerning the durability and functional degradation of foam concrete are intimately related to water transfer. The water transfer behaviour in foam concrete under capillary absorption and full submersion conditions is studied in this paper. To overcome the low resolution between water and cement paste in in-situ X-ray computed tomography (XCT) tests, caesium chloride (CsCl; 6 wt%) was used as a contrast-enhancement agent. The dynamic changes to the wetting head and water distribution in foam concrete were successfully visualised in two and three dimensions. The multiscale pore structure of foam concrete was quantitatively characterised by a combination of mercury intrusion porosimetry (micropore <10 mu m) and XCT (macropore >10 mu m). The results show that the microporosity governs a large part of the capillary suction of water due to the high capillary force in these micropores. However, for macropores, they are partially connected and can hold water under pressure and simultaneously hinder capillary rise due to the blocking of the capillary network and prolonged transfer tortuosity. Finally, a numerical finite-volume model was used to simulate the dynamic water transfer process directly based on the XCT binary images. The modelling results agreed well with the experimental results.

TI Laboratory Characterization of Fouled Railroad Ballast Behavior
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA English
DT Article
ID SUPPORT
AB Fouling refers to the condition of railroad ballast when voids in this unbound aggregate layer are filled with relatively finer materials or fouling agents, which commonly come from breakdown of the ballast aggregate, outside contamination such as coal dust from coal trains, or subgrade soil intrusion. Effects of different fouling agents on ballast aggregate shear strength were studied at the University or Illinois. Through the use of a large direct shear (shear box) device, the strength properties of both clean and fouled ballast samples were determined when three types of fine materials-coal dust, plastic clayey soil, and mineral filler-were added to clean ballast samples at various percentages by weight of ballast under both dry and wet [mostly optimum moisture content (OMC)] conditions. Realistic sample preparation procedures were conducted to closely simulate field-fouling scenarios. Test results showed that when the coal dust fouling percentage increased, the ballast shear strength steadily decreased. Wet fouling was found to exacerbate this trend. Results of ballast samples fouled with clay and mineral filler also showed decreasing trends in strength properties; however, coal dust was by far the worst fouling agent for its impact on track substructure and roadbed. Approximately 15% coal dust fouling by weight of ballast was statistically significant to cause considerable strength reductions. In the case of ballast fully fouled with wet coal dust at 35% OMC, the friction angles obtained were as low as the friction angle of coal dust itself.

AB Purpose: The reported data of elderly ESCC are rather limited and there is a lack of information to guide treatment decisions for elderly patients with esophageal cancer. This study aims to identify the efficacy and factors for optimal treatment approaches for elderly esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone or concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT).
   Methods: This study included 184 I-III elderly ESCC patients aged >= 70 years treated by oral single agent CCRT (sCCRT) or double agents CCRT (dCCRT) or RT alone at a single institution in China. RT was delivered with Intensity Modulated Irradiation Therapy (IMRT) or Volumetric-Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). Sequential or simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) approach was applied for GTV dose escalation. Toxicities were evaluated by criteria of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Statistical analyses were performed on survival and failure patterns.
   Results: At a median follow-up time of 15.5 months, the 2- and 3-year estimated overall survival (OS) were 43.5% and 35.2%, respectively. T and N stage, GTV dose (cutoff value 56Gy), simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) technique and CCRT were significant predictors for the outcomes. sCCRT was significantly associated with higher OS, LRFS, and DFS when compared with RT alone and no difference was observed between sCCRT and dCCRT. 44% patients experienced treatment failure, among whom 65.4% developed local failure. 81.3% local failure occurred in GTV and 70.6% regional failures occurred out of radiation field. dCCRT was the only independent prediction factor for grade >= 2 neutropenia and gastrointestinal reactions compared with sCCRT and RT alone. No significant difference of toxicities was observed between sCCRT and RT alone.
   Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that CCRT in elderly patients had significant survival benefit compared to RT alone, especially using Single oral agent. sCCRT had less toxicities compared to dCCRT, and the toxicity was similar to RT alone. GTV dose >= 56 Gy and SIB technique were optimal approaches for radiotherapy.

AB We develop a model that jointly determines the distribution of income and the aggregate macrodynamics. We identify multiple channels through which alternative public policies such as transfers, consumption and income taxes, and public investment will affect the inequality-efficiency trade-off. Income tax and transfers have both a direct income and an indirect substitution effect; a consumption tax has only the latter. We present extensive numerical simulations motivated by the South African National Development Plan 2030, the objective of which is to reduce soaring inequality and increase per capita GDP. Our results illustrate how the judicious combination of social grants and a consumption tax may help achieve these targets. The simulations also suggest that the sharp decline in the private-public capital ratio, coupled with a high degree of complementarily between public and private capital may help explain the persistence of market inequality in South Africa during the last two decades.

AB Computational models constitute a fundamental asset for cancer research and drug R&D, as they provide controlled environments for testing of hypotheses and are characterized by the total knowledge of the system. These features are particularly useful for 3D cell culture models where a complex interaction among cells and their environments ensues.
   In this work, we present a programmable simulator capable of reproducing the behavior of cells cultured in 3D scaffolds and their response to pharmacological treatment. This system will be shown to be able to accurately describe the temporal evolution of the density of a population of MDA-MB-231 cells following their treatment with different concentrations of doxorubicin, together with a newly described drug-resistance mechanism and potential re-sensitization strategy. An extensive technical description of this model will be coupled to its experimental validation and to an analysis aimed at identifying which variables and behaviors account for differences in the response to treatment.
   Comprehensively, this work contributes to the growing field of integrated in-silico/in-vitro analysis of biological processes which has great potential for both the increase of our scientific knowledge and the development of novel, more effective treatments.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODEL; KURAMOTO; SPREAD
AB We introduce a model to study the interplay between information spreading and opinion formation in social systems. Our framework consists in a two-layer multiplex network where opinion dynamics takes place in one layer, while information spreads on the other one. The two dynamical processes are mutually coupled in such a way that the control parameters governing the dynamics of the node states at one layer depend on the dynamical states at the other layer. In particular, we consider the case in which consensus is favored by the common adoption of information, while information spreading is boosted between agents sharing similar opinions. Numerical simulations of the model point out that, when the coupling between the dynamics of the two layers is strong enough, a double explosive transition, i.e., a discontinuous transition both in consensus dynamics and in information spreading appears. Such explosive transitions lead to bi-stability regions in which the consensus-informed states and the disagreement-uninformed states are both stable solutions of the intertwined dynamics.

AB Two types of porous Si3N4 ceramics with different porosity are fabricated by gel casting technique, where the high pure Al2O3 and Y2O3 are selected as sintering additive. The effective Young's modulus and compression strength are tested by compressive experiments, respectively. The present emphasis is placed on the mechanical characterization of porous Si3N4 ceramics by employing finite element (FE) method. Extracting the primary features of bonded networks, the microstructure of real material is reconstructed in the numerical model. For the obtained materials with different porosity, their compressive behaviors are modeled by FE simulation, respectively. Afterwards, the effective Young's modulus and compression strength are calculated from the numerical results. Compared with experiment data, the calculated results provide a sufficient accordance. Moreover, the modeled failure mechanism in microstructure is also verified by experimental observation. Utilizing the present FE model, the influences of grain aspect ratio and properties of grain boundaries on the effective Young's modulus and compression strength are also investigated, which provides an insight into the relationship between microstructure and macro-mechanical properties for porous Si3N4 ceramics.

AB An overview of high-fidelity modeling of pathogen propagation, transmission and mitigation in the built environment is given. In order to derive the required physical and numerical models, the current understanding of pathogen, and in particular virus transmission and mitigation is summarized. The ordinary and partial differential equations that describe the flow, the particles and possibly the UV radiation loads in rooms or HVAC ducts are presented, as well as proper numerical methods to solve them in an expedient way. Thereafter, the motion of pedestrians, as well as proper ways to couple computational fluid dynamics and computational crowd dynamics to enable high-fidelity pathogen transmission and infection simulations is treated. The present review shows that high-fidelity simulations of pathogen propagation, transmission and mitigation in the built environment have reached a high degree of sophistication, offering a quantum leap in accuracy from simpler probabilistic models. This is particularly the case when considering the propagation of pathogens via aerosols in the presence of moving pedestrians.

AB A three-dimensional printed beam-steering reflector surface with dielectric fluids as the tuning agent is presented. The reflector is made using ECO-ABS with six rows of 19 parallel channels of square cross-sections. The permittivity of the ECO-ABS was measured at 2.55 with a loss tangent of 0.053. A conductor is placed at the back of the dielectric. The squared channels are filled with either distilled water or air. The effective permittivity within the reflector changes according to the material used to fill the channels. As an incident wave propagates through the printed dielectric, the configuration of air-water channels shapes the exiting phase front of the wave by locally controlling its phase delay. The resulting phase profile created by the air-water configuration leads to a steered beam. Numerical full-wave simulations show steerable angles ranging from -42 degrees to 23 degrees for a set of air-water configurations at 30 GHz. A prototype was fabricated and tested for the same configurations. Experiments confirm a wide range of angles starting at -40 degrees up to 20 degrees. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America

AB We investigated the tumor-targeted nanoparticles that influence heat generation. We suppose that all nanoparticles are fully functionalized and can find the target using active targeting methods. Unlike the commonly used methods, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the treatment procedure proposed in this study is purely noninvasive, which is considered to be a significant merit. It is found that the localized heat generation due to targeted nanoparticles is significantly higher than other areas. By engineering the optical properties of nanoparticles, including scattering, absorption coefficients, and asymmetry factor (cosine scattering angle), the heat generated in the tumor's area reaches to such critical state that can burn the targeted tumor. The amount of heat generated by inserting smart agents, due to the surface Plasmon resonance, will be remarkably high. The light-matter interactions and trajectory of incident photon upon targeted tissues are simulated by MIE theory and Monte Carlo method, respectively. Monte Carlo method is a statistical one by which we can accurately probe the photon trajectories into a simulation area. (C) 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Retinal vessel oxygen supply is important for retinal tissue metabolism. Commonly used retinal vessel oximetry devices are based on dual-wavelength spectral measurement of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin. However, there is no traceable standard for reliable calibration of these devices. In this study, we developed a fundus-simulating phantom that closely mimicked the optical properties of human fundus tissues. Microchannels of precisely controlled topological structures were produced by soft lithography to simulate the retinal vasculature. Optical properties of the phantom were adjusted by adding scattering and absorption agents to simulate different concentrations of fundus pigments. The developed phantom was used to calibrate the linear correlation between oxygen saturation (SO2) level and optical density ratio in a dual-wavelength oximetry device. The obtained calibration factors were used to calculate the retinal vessel SO2 in both eyes of five volunteers aged between 24 and 27 years old. The test results showed that the mean arterial and venous SO2 levels after phantom calibration were coincident with those after empirical value calibration, indicating the potential clinical utility of the produced phantom as a calibration standard.

ID FINANCIAL NETWORKS; CONTAGION
AB Trust is a collective, self-fulfilling phenomenon that suggests analogies with phase transitions. We introduce a stylized model for the build-up and collapse of trust in networks, which generically displays a first order transition. The basic assumption of our model is that whereas trustworthiness begets trustworthiness, panic also begets panic, in the sense that a small decrease in trustworthiness may be amplified and ultimately lead to a sudden and catastrophic drop of collective trust. We show, using both numerical simulations and mean-field analytic arguments, that there are extended regions of the parameter space where two equilibrium states coexist: a well-connected network where global confidence is high, and a poorly connected network where global confidence is low. In these coexistence regions, spontaneous jumps from the well-connected state to the poorly connected state can occur, corresponding to a sudden collapse of trust that is not caused by any major external catastrophe. In large systems, spontaneous crises are replaced by history dependence: whether the system is found in one state or in the other essentially depends on initial conditions. Finally, we document a new phase, in which agents are well connected yet distrustful.

TI BOOTSTRAP PERCOLATION ON RANDOM GEOMETRIC GRAPHS

DT Article
ID DIFFUSION; THRESHOLD; NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Bootstrap percolation (BP) has been used effectively to model phenomena as diverse as emergence of magnetism in materials, spread of infection, diffusion of software viruses in computer networks, adoption of new technologies, and emergence of collective action and cultural fads in human societies. It is defined on an (arbitrary) network of interacting agents whose state is determined by the state of their neighbors according to a threshold rule. In a typical setting, BP starts by random and independent "activation" of nodes with a fixed probability p, followed by a deterministic process for additional activations based on the density of active nodes in each neighborhood (theta activated nodes). Here, we study BP on random geometric graphs (RGGs) in the regime when the latter are (almost surely) connected. Random geometric graphs provide an appropriate model in settings where the neighborhood structure of each node is determined by geographical distance, as in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks as well as in contagion. We derive bounds p(c)', p(c)'' on the critical thresholds such that for all p > p(c)'' full percolation takes place, whereas for p < p(c)' it does not. We conclude with simulations that compare numerical thresholds with those obtained analytically.

AB Here we studied how participants steer to intercept uniformly moving targets in a virtual driving task. We tested the hypothesis that locomotor interception behavior cannot fully be explained by a strategy of nulling rate of change in pertinent agent-target relations such as the target-heading angle or target's bearing angle. In line with a previously reported observation and model simulations, we found that, under specific combinations of initial target eccentricity and target motion direction, locomotor paths revealed reversals in movement direction. This phenomenon is not compatible with unique reliance on first-order (i.e., rate-of-change based) information in the case of uniformly moving targets. We also found that, as expected, such reversals in movement direction were not observed consistently over all trials of the same experimental condition: their presence depended on the timing of the first steering action effected by the participant, with only early steering actions leading to reversals in movement direction. These particular characteristics of the direction-reversal phenomenon demonstrated here for a locomotor interception-by-steering task correspond to those reported for lateral manual interception. Together, these findings suggest that control strategies operating in manual and locomotor interception may at least share certain characteristics.

AB A simple, inexpensive, passive monitor, based on a textile-bound polyacryloamidoxime chelating agent (polyacryloamidoxime cloth), was evaluated for the analysis of selected trace heavy metals in water using both Energy Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (EDXRF) Spectroscopy and Wavelength Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (WDXRF) Spectroscopy as a means of analysis. Acid leaching of the sorbed metals followed by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption (GFAA) Spectroscopy was also carried out. It was shown that, in controlled in vitro experiments using a flow chamber, the sorption profiles of Pb and Cu by the cloth used were similar to those of chelating resins and fibres containing the amidoxime group. The rate of uptake of metals by the cloth was found to be dependent on the percent surface area converted to amidoxime groups, the concentration and type of metal being tested for, the time of exposure, the flow rate of solution and the temperature of solution. Distribution coefficients of 3.5 x 10(6) and 1.5 x 10(6) for Cu(II) and Pb(II) were observed and indicate a high degree of sample preconcentration. The average rates of uptake for Cu and Pb per gram of cloth were 600 and 200 mg per day respectively from dilute solution ([Cu]=5.9 mg l(-1), [Pb]=2.8 mg l(-1)). From replicate samples, a relative error of <10% was observed for the sorption of Cu and Pb. Experimental results of field tests involving the passive monitoring of river water and lake water under various conditions suggest that a number of ions can be identified and monitored simultaneously. The deployment of the monitors by the general public and the use of a mailing program was tested and shown to be practical. These results indicate the feasibility of using polyacryloamidoxime cloth as a passive monitor for trace metals in water.

AB The state transitions of solvated H-Ras protein with GTP were theoretically analyzed through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To accelerate the structural changes associated with the locations of two switch regions (I and II), the Parallel Cascade Selection MD (PaCS-MD) method was employed in this study. The interconversions between the State 1 and State 2 were thus studied in atomic details, leading to a reasonable agreement with experimental observations and consequent scenarios concerning the transition mechanism that would be essential for the development of Ras inhibitors as anti-cancer agents. Furthermore, the state-transition-based local network entropy (SNE) was calculated for the transition process from State 1 to State 2, by which the temporal evolution of information entropy associated with the dynamical behavior of hydrogen bond network composed of hydration water molecules was described. The calculated results of SNE thus proved to provide a good indicator to detect the dynamical state transition of solvated Ras protein system (and probably more general systems) from a viewpoint of nonequilibrium statistical thermodynamics.

TI Subband photoacoustic imaging for contrast improvement
SO OPTICS EXPRESS

DT Article
ID TOMOGRAPHY; RECONSTRUCTION; SIMULATIONS; AGENT
AB Contrast in photoacoustic imaging is primarily determined by optical absorption. This paper proposes a subband imaging method to further enhance the image contrast. The method is based on media with different absorptions generating acoustic waves with different frequency contents. Generally, assuming all other conditions remain the same, a high-absorption medium generates acoustic waves with higher frequency components, and hence the imaging contrast can be enhanced by appropriate selection of the spectral subbands. This study employed both finite-difference, time-domain-based simulations and phantom imaging. The numerical results show that the peak frequencies of the signals for objects with absorption coefficients of 1 and 100 cm(-1) were 2.4 and 7.8 MHz, respectively. Imaging an agar-based phantom further demonstrated that the contrast between two objects with absorption coefficients of 5.01 and 41.75 cm(-1) can be improved by 4-10 dB when the frequency band was changed from 0-7 to 7-14 MHz. Finally, a method to further enhance the contrast based on optimal weighting is also presented. The proposed method is of particular interest in photoacoustic molecular imaging.

AB Skin morphology formation on injection-molded isotactic polypropylene (PP) was investigated using micro-beam synchrotron wide-angle X-ray diffraction and numerical simulation. The 1-20 mu m depth range was characterized with an X-ray beam of 0.273 mu m X 0.389 mu m in size. From an evaluation of doping nucleating agents (NA) in PP, the NAs did not work at a depth of 1 mu m. alpha-specified NA affected crystallization within a 5-mu m depth. beta-specified PP showed alpha-form crystallinity at the 5-20 mu m depth. The mesomorphic crystal near the surface showed extremely high orientation. From viscoelastic flow simulation, PP molecules near the surface were oriented in the flow direction by extensional flow in the flow front, but freezing occurred faster than flow-induced crystallization. It was estimated that the delay of crystallization occurred during the transient temperature. The deformation rate did not cause a difference in crystal morphology near the surface, but the cooling rate did. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 51:1236-1244,2011. (C) 2010 Society of Plastics Engineers

DE Duration; Optimal stopping; Game estimation; Coordination
AB This paper studies inference in a continuous time game where an agent's decision to quit an activity depends on the participation of other players. In equilibrium, similar actions can be explained not only by direct influences but also by correlated factors. Our model can be seen as a simultaneous duration model with multiple decision makers and interdependent durations. We study the problem of determining the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium stopping strategies in this setting. This paper provides results and conditions for the detection of these endogenous effects. First, we show that the presence of such effects is a necessary and sufficient condition for simultaneous exits. This allows us to set up a nonparametric test for the presence of such influences, which is robust to multiple equilibria. Second, we provide conditions under which parameters in the game are identified. Finally, we apply the model to data on desertion in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and find evidence of endogenous influences. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated how social interaction among robotic agents changes dynamically depending on the individual belief of action intention. In a set of simulation studies, we examine dyadic imitative interactions of robots using a variational recurrent neural network model. The model is based on the free energy principle such that a pair of interacting robots find themselves in a loop, attempting to predict and infer each other's actions using active inference. We examined how regulating the complexity term to minimize free energy determines the dynamic characteristics of networks and interactions. When one robot trained with tighter regulation and another trained with looser regulation interact, the latter tends to lead the interaction by exerting stronger action intention, while the former tends to follow by adapting to its observations. The study confirms that the dyadic imitative interaction becomes successful by achieving a high synchronization rate when a leader and a follower are determined by developing action intentions with strong belief and weak belief, respectively.

AB Background: Pilsicainide hydrochloride is a class IC antiarrhythmic agent used for the treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of pilsicainide in healthy Korean and Japanese male volunteers to satisfy regulatory requirements for marketing pilsicainide in the Republic of Korea.
   Methods: This was an open-label, single-dose, parallel-group, dose-increasing study. It was simultaneously conducted in healthy Korean and Japanese volunteers from September 2005 through May 2006; pilsicainide was approved for use in the Republic of Korea in 2007. Subjects for the 100-mg group were enrolled after the performance of tolerability evaluations in the 50-mg dose group. Serial blood and urine samples were collected up to 24 hours after dosing, and drug concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tolerability was evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory parameters, and results of 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs).
   Results: Sixteen healthy Korean male subjects (mean [SD] age, 24.5 [4.2] years; weight, 71.8 [5.5] kg; height, 176.6 [6.3] cm) and 16 healthy male Japanese subjects (age, 24.7 [4.9] years; weight, 60.2 [4.4] kg; height, 171.9 [6.4] cm) were enrolled in the study. Values for AUC and C-max of pilsicainide increased proportionally with dose escalation in all subjects. Pilsicainide reached C-max 0.5 to 1.5 hours after dosing in both the Korean and Japanese subjects. The mean (SD) dose-normalized values for C-max for the Korean and Japanese subjects were 9.4 (1.9) and 9.2 (1.6) ng/mL/mg, respectively. The mean (SD) dose-normalized values for AUC(0-infinity) were 56.0 (8.0) ng (.) h/mL/mg in the Korean subjects and 53.8 (8.1) ng (.) h/mL/mg in the Japanese subjects. None of these findings were statistically significant. A total of 9 AEs occurred in 7 of the 1.6 Korean subjects; they included dizziness, feeling of being hot, somnolence, and atrioventricular block. All of the AEs were mild in severity and were considered possibly related to pilsicainide. Two of the 16 Japanese subjects had a total of 4 AEs. All of the AEs occurred in the subjects treated with 50 mg. Of the 2 Subjects with AEs, 1 subject had a decrease in blood pressure, a sense of discomfort, and PR-interval prolongation on ECG, while the other developed a premature ventricular contraction (PVC). The PR-interval prolongation and PVC were determined to be possibly related to pilsicainide, and these were mild in severity. The other AEs (ie, decreased blood pressure, sense of discomfort) were moderate in severity.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the pharmacokinetic profile of plisicainide was not significantly different between these healthy Korean and Japanese male volunteers. A single dose (50 or 100 mg) of pilsicainide was well tolerated in both ethnic groups. (Clin Ther. 2009;31.:609-618) (C) 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

AB Purpose: To test whether combining embolization with endothelial denudation could reduce endoleak persistence and recurrence after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in an animal model.
   Methods: Type I endoleaks with collateral outflow were created in bilateral iliac aneurysms in 12 dogs. In 6 animals (group 1), endoleaks were treated by thrombin injection, with or without mechanical denudation of the endothelium. In the other 6 animals (group 2), simultaneous occlusion and endothelial denudation was induced in one side by treatment with a gel containing ethanol, ethylcellulose, and lipiodol, whereas the other side was treated with saline control. Follow-up ultrasonography and angiography were performed before necropsy and histology at 3 months.
   Results: Denudation combined with thrombin injection led to higher aneurysm shrinkage than thrombin alone, as shown by the mean relative aneurysm diameter (89% vs. 124% at baseline, p<0.01) and length (61% vs. 82% at baseline, p, 0.01). Denudation did not significantly reduce endoleak occurrence (4/6 vs. 6/6); however, endoleaks in denuded aneurysms were significantly smaller and located in areas inaccessible to denudation. Six of the 10 endoleaks seen at 3 months occurred despite complete initial occlusion (recurrent endoleaks). In the gel-treated group, embolized aneurysms did not shrink significantly, and stent-graft thrombosis developed in 3/6 embolized aneurysms; however, the 3 other aneurysms showed no endoleaks, while all 6 saline-treated controls exhibited persistent endoleaks.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the role of recanalization in endoleak recurrence and indicates that combining embolization and endothelial denudation could be a promising strategy to prevent endoleak persistence or recurrence after EVAR. However, the sclerosing gel tested in this study is not appropriate since it is prone to migration with resultant stent-graft thrombosis. J Endovasc Ther. 2011;18:686-696

AB If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.

AB Background: Recently, several combined therapeutic strategies and targeted agents have been under investigation for their potential role in lung cancer. The combined administration of dendritic cells (DCs) and immune-adjuvant cytidyl guanosyl oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) after cryosurgery has proven to be an effective strategy for treating lung cancer. However, whether the application of CpG-ODN could affect the therapeutic results remained to be further explored.
   Material/Methods: The Lewis lung cancer (LLC)-bearing mice received cryoablation and injection of ex vivo-cultured DCs into the peritumoral zone. Subsequently, CpG-ODN was administered to experimental animals 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours after DC injection. The mice in the control group received coadministration of DCs and CpG-ODN simultaneously. Therapeutic effects were evaluated by survival rates. The resistance to rechallenge of LLC cell was assessed by lung metastasis and in vitro cytotoxicity of splenocytes. Furthermore, T-cell subsets and multiple cytokines (interleukin [IL]-4, -10, and-12; interferon [IFN]-gamma; tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) in the blood were assessed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.
   Results: Higher ratios of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and higher levels of IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha were found in the blood of the mice that received CpG-ODN therapy 12 h after DC injection. The cytotoxicity potency of the splenocytes of these mice was significantly higher compared with the mice in other groups. Moreover, the mice receiving CpG-ODN therapy 12 h after DC injection showed significantly better resistance to rechallenge. Compared with the mice in other groups, the mice receiving CpG-ODN therapy 12 h after DC injection were superior in survival rates and antimetastatic effects.
   Conclusions: Our study suggested that the therapeutic efficacy was closely associated with CpG-ODN administration in the combined therapeutic protocol of cryoablation, DCs, and immune adjuvant. In situ administration of CpG-ODN 12 h after DC injection might be considered the optimum application.

AB BACKGROUND Simultaneous production of commercial enzymes using agro-industrial residues by statistical approach is an important perspective in an industrial point of view. Despite the advantages of statistical methods optimization, the report on simultaneous production of pectinase and amylases are limited. The accumulation of agro-industrial residues causes serious environmental problems; however, citrus peel can be the important substrate for various enzymes production, including pectinase. These enzymes involving saccharification process and act as clarifying agent.
   RESULTS In this study, orange peel and banana peel mixture were used as the suitable substrate for pectinase and amylase production using Bacillus pumilus in solid-state culture. The process parameters were optimized for simultaneous production of enzymes by a traditional-one-variable-at-a-time approach, a two level full factorial design, central composite design and response surface methodology. Among the selected variables, moisture content of the medium, pH and mineral supplement significantly influenced pectinase and amylase production. Pectinase production increased over 3-fold, whereas, 2-fold increase on amylase production was achieved after optimization by statistical approach. The purified pectinase exhibited maximal activity at pH 8.0, temperature of 60 degrees C and the molecular weight was 60 kDa. The purified amylase was highly active at pH 8.0, at 50 degrees C and the molecular weight was 37 kDa. The enzyme showed activity on fruit pulp in increasing clarity in orange and carrot juice and the saccharification of starch.
   CONCLUSION Orange peel and banana peel mixture was effective as a solid medium for the simultaneous production of pectinase and amylase by Bacillus pumilus. Also, our statistical approach to optimize the medium components to yield more pectinase and amylase was fruitful and these enzymes showed appreciable results suitable for various applications.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Spatial memory refers to the part of the memory system that encodes, stores, recognizes and recalls spatial information about the environment and the agent's orientation within it. Such information is required to be able to navigate to goal locations, and is vitally important for any embodied agent, or model thereof, for reaching goals in a spatially extended environment.
   In this paper, a number of computationally implemented cognitive models of spatial memory are reviewed and compared. Three categories of models are considered: symbolic models, neural network models, and models that are part of a systems-level cognitive architecture. Representative models from each category are described and compared in a number of dimensions along which simulation models can differ (level of modeling, types of representation, structural accuracy, generality and abstraction, environment complexity), including their possible mapping to the underlying neural substrate.
   Neural mappings are rarely explicated in the context of behaviorally validated models, but they could be useful to cognitive modeling research by providing a new approach for investigating a model's plausibility. Finally, suggested experimental neuroscience methods are described for verifying the biological plausibility of computational cognitive models of spatial memory, and open questions for the field of spatial memory modeling are outlined.

AB Judea Pearl's Causal Model is a rich framework that provides deep insight into the nature of causal relations. As yet, however, the Pearl Causal Model (PCM) has had a lesser impact on economics or econometrics than on other disciplines. This may be due in part to the fact that the PCM is not as well suited to analyzing structures that exhibit features of central interest to economists and econometricians: optimization, equilibrium, and learning. We offer the settable systems framework as an extension of the PCM that permits causal discourse in systems embodying optimization, equilibrium, and learning. Because these are common features of physical, natural, or social systems, our framework may prove generally useful for machine learning. Important features distinguishing the settable system framework from the PCM are its countable dimensionality and the use of partitioning and partition-specific response functions to accommodate the behavior of optimizing and interacting agents and to eliminate the requirement of a unique fixed point for the system. Refinements of the PCM include the settable systems treatment of attributes, the causal role of exogenous variables, and the dual role of variables as causes and responses. A series of closely related machine learning examples and examples from game theory and machine learning with feedback demonstrates some limitations of the PCM and motivates the distinguishing features of settable systems.

ID MARKETS; BANKING
AB This paper integrates two themes in the intertemporal permit literature through the construction of an intertemporal banking system for a pollutant that creates both stock and flow damages. A permit banking system for the special case of a pollutant that only causes stock damages is also developed. This latter, simpler case corresponds roughly to the greenhouse gas emission reduction regime proposed by the U.S. Department of State as a means of fulfilling the U.S. commitment to the Framework Convention on Climate Change. This paper shows that environmental regulators can achieve the socially optimal level of emissions and output through time by setting the correct total sum of allowable emissions, and specifying the correct intertemporal trading ratio for banking and borrowing. For the case of greenhouse gases, we show that the optimal growth rate of permit prices, and therefore the optimal intertemporal trading rate, has the closed-form solution equal to the ratio of current marginal stock damages to the discounted future value of marginal stock damages less the decay rate of emissions in the atmosphere. Given a non-optimal negotiated emission path we then derive a permit banking system that has the potential to lower net social costs by adjusting the intertemporal trading ratio taking into account the behavior of private agents. We use a simple numerical simulation model to illustrate the potential gains from various possible banking systems.

AB Purpose One of the most significant problems in eutrophic lakes is the presence of algal blooms, which may affect phosphorus (P) inactivation agents (PIAs) in the control of P release from sediment. Therefore, in this study, lanthanum/aluminium co-modified thermally treated calcium-rich attapulgite (LA@TCAP) is used to analyse the influence and mechanisms of algal blooms on P inactivation effect to provide technical support for the application of PIAs. Materials and methods In August 2020, lake water, sediments, and algae were collected from Zhushan Bay in Lake Taihu and LA@TCAP was prepared in the laboratory. These samples were used to establish three groups of microscopic simulation experiments. Through sequential extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance, the mobile forms of P (Mobile-P) of sediment in each experimental group were measured and analysed, and the influence of algal blooms on the inactivation effect of the P immobilisation of LA@TCAP was determined. Physical and chemical properties of overlying water (DO, pH, algae organic matter (AOM), etc) and microbial community structure of capping layers were used to understand the influence mechanisms of algal blooms on the inactivation effect of PIAs. Results and discussion The concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the overlying water was reduced due to the decomposition of algal blooms, which increased the relative abundance of P-solubilising bacteria, and transformed more inert forms of P (Inert-P) into Mobile-P in the capping layer. Simultaneously, the algal blooms released OP, which passed through the capping layer and increased the OP content in the sediment. Under this dual effect, the Mobile-P content in the sediment increased, making LA@TCAP unable to inactivate the increased mobile-P, which was bound to affect the inactivation effect of LA@TCAP. Besides, the AOM released from the algal blooms combined with the metal ions in LA@TCAP, resulting in the reduction of adsorption sites of LA@TCAP for P. Conclusions The algal blooms significantly decreased the DO concentration in the overlying water, thereby affecting the microbial community and transforming more Inert-P into Mobile-P. In addition, the adsorption performance of LA@TCAP for P also reduced owing to AOM competed with P for the metal ions in the LA@TCAP. Thus, algal blooms reduced the ability of LA@TCAP to control the P release from sediment.

AB Skeletal muscle has an exceptional ability to regenerate and adapt following injury. Tissue engineering approaches ( e. g. cell therapy, scaffolds, and pharmaceutics) aimed at enhancing or promoting muscle regeneration from severe injuries are a promising and active field of research. Computational models are beginning to advance the field by providing insight into regeneration mechanisms and therapies. In this paper, we summarize the contributions computational models have made to understanding muscle remodeling and the functional implications thereof. Next, we describe a new agent-based computational model of skeletal muscle inflammation and regeneration following acute muscle injury. Our computational model simulates the recruitment and cellular behaviors of key inflammatory cells ( e. g. neutrophils and M1 and M2 macrophages) and their interactions with native muscle cells ( muscle fibers, satellite stem cells, and fibroblasts) that result in the clearance of necrotic tissue and muscle fiber regeneration. We demonstrate the ability of the model to track key regeneration metrics during both unencumbered regeneration and in the case of impaired macrophage function. We also use the model to simulate regeneration enhancement when muscle is primed with inflammatory cells prior to injury, which is a putative therapeutic intervention that has not yet been investigated experimentally. Computational modeling of muscle regeneration, pursued in combination with experimental analyses, provides a quantitative framework for evaluating and predicting muscle regeneration and enables the rational design of therapeutic strategies for muscle recovery.

AB The tissue optical clearing technique can significantly improve the quality of biomedical optical imaging. Previous investigations demonstrated that alcohols are excellent optical clearing agents for in vitro skin because they have hydroxyl. However, sugars with hydroxyl groups have received little attention. Here, three sugars, fructose, glucose, and ribose, were investigated using a molecular dynamics simulation and in vitro experiments. The simulated results revealed that fructose and ribose have the highest and lowest optical clearing potential, respectively, according to their propensity to form hydrogen bonds and bridges. The resolutions through skin samples after 24 min of immersion in fructose, glucose, or ribose solutions were quantitatively calculated using a USAF target and reached 14.3 +/- 1.2 mu m, 27.3 +/- 2.4 mu m, and 39.6 +/- 4.1 mu m, respectively, which are in accordance with the theoretical prediction. Unfortunately, topical fructose treatment of in vivo rat skin could not induce excellent optical clearing. Thus, a chemical penetration enhancer was used for in vivo studies. A comparison of laser speckle imaging of dermal blood flow after topical treatment with fructose, a penetration enhancer, and a mixture of the two to rat skin in vivo demonstrated that the mixture causes the largest increase in the resolution and contrast.

AB Stimulus equivalence (SE) and projective simulation (PS) study complex behavior, the former in human subjects and the latter in artificial agents. We apply the PS learning framework for modeling the formation of equivalence classes. For this purpose, we first modify the PS model to accommodate imitating the emergence of equivalence relations. Later, we formulate the SE formation through the matching-to-sample (MTS) procedure. The proposed version of PS model, called the equivalence projective simulation (EPS) model, is able to act within a varying action set and derive new relations without receiving feedback from the environment. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the field of equivalence theory in behavior analysis has been linked to an artificial agent in a machine learning context. This model has many advantages over existing neural network models. Briefly, our EPS model is not a black box model, but rather a model with the capability of easy interpretation and flexibility for further modifications. To validate the model, some experimental results performed by prominent behavior analysts are simulated. The results confirm that the EPS model is able to reliably simulate and replicate the same behavior as real experiments in various settings, including formation of equivalence relations in typical participants, nonformation of equivalence relations in language-disabled children, and nodal effect in a linear series with nodal distance five. Moreover, through a hypothetical experiment, we discuss the possibility of applying EPS in further equivalence theory research.

AB 4-benzyl-5-oxomorpholine-3-carbamide has been synthesized; single crystals were grown by slow evaporation solution growth technique at room temperature and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, FT-Raman and H-1-NMR. The compound crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P21/n. The molecular geometry of the compound was optimized by using Density Functional Theory (DFTI B3LYP) method with 6-311++G(d,p) basis set in the ground state and geometric parameters are in agreement with the X-ray analysis results of the structure. The experimental vibrational spectra were compared with the calculated spectra and each vibrational wave number was assigned on the basis of potential energy distribution (PED). The electronic and charge transfer properties have been explained on the basis of highest occupied molecular orbital's (HOMOs) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital's (LUMOs). Besides molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), frontier molecular orbital's (FMOs), some global reactivity descriptors, thermodynamic properties, non-linear optical (NLO) behavior and Mullikan charge analysis of the title compound were computed with the same method in gas phase, theoretically. Potential reactive sites of the title compound have been identified by average local ionization energy and Fukui functions, both mapped to the electron density surface. Bond dissociation energies for all single acyclic bonds have been calculated in order to investigate autoxidation and degradation properties of the title compound. Atoms with pronounced interactions with water molecules have been detected by calculations of radial distribution functions after molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental results are compared with the theoretical calculations using DFT methods for the fortification of the paper. Further the docking studies revealed that the title compound as a docked ligand forms a stable complex with pyrrole inhibitor with a binding affinity value of 7.5 kcal/mol. This suggests that the title compound might exhibit inhibitory activity against pyrrole inhibitor. To confirm the potential practical applicability of the title compound antimicrobial activity was tested against gram negative and gram positive bacteria. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that produced AC samples had a specific surface area of 319.5 m(2)/g when 5.0 M ZnCl2 was used as the activating agent at activation temperature and time of 700 degrees C and 60 min, respectively. Effects of various operational parameters such as initial pH, initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and contact time were investigated. The produced AC was found to have higher affinity to phenol than Cd2+, where removal efficiencies of 28 and 53% for Cd2+ and phenol, respectively, were achieved from binary solutions at optimum conditions of pH (5.5), AC dosage (0.15 g/50 mL) and contact time (120 and 480 min for Cd2+ and phenol, respectively). Experimental data on adsorption of Cd2+ and phenol was found to best fit the Freundlich isotherm model. Moreover, adsorption mechanism of both components was attributed to chemisorption, which was demonstrated by the equilibrium data that best fitted the pseudo-second order kinetic model.

AB Optimal growth conditions for GdSe1.85 crystals are found by the thermodynamic simulation of the Gd-Se-I system. The obtained data are used to grow GdSe1.85 crystals by the vapor transport method using iodine as a transport agent. The grown crystals are identified by microprobe and powder XRD analyses. The structure is determined by the single crystal XRD analysis and the composition is refined. The crystal structure is in general typical of the structures of REM polychalcogenides, however, the unit cell represents the metric type unknown previously: a = 4.0562(2) , b = 8.1065(5) , c = 9.2489(5) , alpha = 115.9990(10)A degrees, beta = 90.000(2)A degrees, gamma = 89.9750(10)A degrees, V = 273.34(3) 3, Z = 4, d(calc) = 7.659 g/cm(3), space group Pb11. The experimental material for the single crystal XRD analysis is obtained on an automated Bruker X8 APEX diffractometer (MoK (alpha) radiation, graphite monochromator, CCD detector resolution 1024x1024 pixel, distance to the detector L = 50 mm, rotation about the phi axis 15 min) by the standard procedure, 2274 measured reflections, out of them 1523 independent (R(int) = 0.0352), R factor [I > 2 sigma(I)] = 0.0517, R factor (all measured) = 0.0694).

AB Cognitive agents physically interacting with the world can best adapt to their task environments if they are able to learn motor skills from experience. Many cognitive architectures have focused on a single learning mechanism to accomplish such adaptation. Behavioral studies with humans, however, have shown that the acquisition of a motor skill generally occurs in two stages. In the initial stage, acquisition is performed via attention-demanding neural processes, producing a high cognitive load. This is followed by more fluent automatic processing, requiring Less deliberation. Neuroscientific studies have since identified two relevant interacting neural systems, suggesting that the acquisition of a motor skill involves a transition from heavy dependence on a system involving cognitive control to only weak dependence on such a system. This cognitive control system, which includes the prefrontal cortex, is thought to be responsible for acquiring and manipulating declarative representations of skills. This frontal system is seen as modulating processing in a more automatic neural pathway, which develops procedural representations over time. In this paper, we propose a biologically plausible computational model of motor skill automaticity. This model offers a neurocomputational account of the translation of declarative into procedural knowledge during learning. In support of the model, we review some previously reported experimental results, and we demonstrate, through simulation, how the model provides a parsimonious explanation for these results. The model is seen as exemplifying a novel approach to motor skill learning in artificial agents. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Magnetic field (MF) freezing of foods is an innovative process already developed at the industrial level. However, the real interaction among the variables taking place in the process is not yet given in the literature because the MF distribution inside the volume of the processing cell is still not well studied. This fact jeopardizes both drawing correct conclusions about the synergy produced by the programmed combination of physical agents and achieving an optimal design of the processing device. Three different representative magnetic freezing processes applied to foods are here dealt representing the modeling of the distribution of the MF around the foods. One of them is based on the application of a static MF produced from magnets in a laboratory freezer. Another one is promoted by the action of an oscillatory magnetic field (OMF) produced by an iron core inductor device disposed also in a laboratory freezer. The third one also is based on the action of an OMF produced by using air core inductor coils simulating the performance of a commercial food freezer. With the aim of understanding the interactions between foods and MF necessary to support beneficial actions of its presence during freezing, analytical, numerical modeling, and experimental procedures have been studied and are here reviewed. Taking into account the accuracy afforded by using modeling and considering also the difficulty of performing experimental determinations of MF inside the volume of the device during a real freezing process, the modeling procedure seems to be a very suitable and practical tool to know about the MF distribution in it. Due to the very different behaviors of the MF vectors that can be found depending on the design of the freezer and the location of the sample inside, it is recommended to perform a previous specific mathematical modeling for each planned MF freezing process applied to foods.

AB Background: Cadmium is considered the seventh most toxic heavy metal as per ATSDR ranking but its mechanism of toxicity is debated. Recently, we evaluated the effects of this metal on the erythrocyte of teleost fish (Oncorhynchus mykiss) leading us to hypothesize that the pro-oxidant activity of cadmium is not linked to mitochondria but more likely to haemoglobin. In this context, the main aim of this work was to detect the ability of Cd to induce structural perturbation in haemoproteins that present different structures and thus different functional properties and to identify what sites of interaction are mainly involved. Methods: The effect of Cd on the structural destabilization of the different haemoproteins was followed spectrophometrically through their precipitation. In addition, the sites of interaction between the different haemoproteins and bivalent cadmium ions were identified by MIB server followed by molecular docking/molecular dynamics simulations both in the dimeric and tetrameric associations. Results: Cadmium does not influence the autoxidation rate of Mb, HbA and trout HbI. However, the presence of this metal accelerates the precipitation process in trout HbIV in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the presence of 1-10-50-250-500-1000 mu M GSH, a chelating agent, reduces the ability of cadmium to accelerate the denaturation process although it is not able to completely prevent it. In order to explain the experimental results, a computational investigations was carried out to identify the cadmium cation affinity for the studied haemoglobins and myoglobin, both in their dimeric and tetrameric forms. As a result, the highest affinity cadmium binding sites for fish HbIV are located at the interface between tetramer-tetramer association, indicating that the cation can assist supramolecular protein aggregations and induce complex precipitation. For mammalian Hb, Mb and fish HbI computational investigation did not detect any site where Cd could to induce such aggregation, in line with the experimental results. Conclusion: The present study provides new information on the mechanisms of toxicity of cadmium by specific interaction with trout O. mykiss haemoglobin component.

AB The photoreduction of CO2 to carbon energy sources over catalysts is of great interest and significance. However, though many studies have been conducted at high CO2 concentrations, research on CO2 photoreduction at atmospheric concentrations remains rare. Herein, CoAl-layered double hydroxide (CoAl-LDH) nanosheets have been synthesized as a platform to explore low-concentration CO2 photoreduction. The CoAl-LDH nanosheets exhibited efficient photocatalytic activity for CO2 photoreduction to CH4 at atmospheric concentration (400 ppm) under simulated solar light, and the reaction proceeded without deactivation for 55 hours. A CH4 production rate of 4.3 mmol g(-1) h(-1) was achieved without the assistance of any sacrificial agent or noble metal. CO2 adsorption experiments showed that the CoAl-LDH nanosheets exhibited an adsorption capacity of 2.95 cm(3) g(-1), which was about twice that of P25 with a comparable specific surface area. XPS analysis indicated that CH4 generation was closely related to the divalent cobalt, and the CH4 yield decreases sharply when the divalent cobalt is oxidized, which was ascribed to the dissociation of water to release H for the hydrogenation of intermediates through further experimental analysis. This work emphasizes the importance of the alkaline OH group for the efficient adsorption of low-concentration CO2 and reveals the unique property of divalent cobalt for CO2 photoreduction.

AB A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) was developed and optimized for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of avian reovirus (ARV), avian adenovirus group I (AAV-1), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), and chicken anemia virus (CAV). Four sets of specific oligonucleotide primers were used in this test for ARV, AAV-1, IBDV, and CAV. The mPCR DNA products were visualized by gel electrophoresis and consisted of fragments of 365 by for IBDV, 421 by for AAV-1, 532 by for ARV, and 676 by for CAV. The mPCR assay developed in this study was found to be sensitive and specific. Detection of PCR-amplified DNA products was 100 pg for both CAV and IBDV, and 10 pg for both ARV and AAV-1 and this mPCR did not amplify nucleic acids from the other avian pathogens tested. The mPCR demonstrated similar sensitivity in tests using experimental fecal cloacal swab specimens that were spiked with ARV, AAV-1, IBDV, and CAV, and taken from specific pathogen free (SPF) chickens. This mPCR detected and differentiated various combinations of RNA/DNA templates from ARV, AAV-1, CAV, and IBDV without reduction of amplification from feces. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This work presents drug-likeness and the cardiotoxicity profiles of six potent pentamidine analogs 1-6 and three new compounds 7-9 as chemotherapeutics for therapy of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. A combination of experimental and computational approaches was used in the cardiotoxicity examination. The hERG trafficking and functionality of the hERG currents were tested by western blot analyses, immunofluorescent staining procedures, and patch-clamp electrophysiological assays. Cardiotoxicity combined with blocking the hERG K+ channel was predicted, and then simulated by docking to the CSM-TM model 732 protein. Location of pentamidines in the proximity of Leu622, Thr623, Ser649, Tyr652, Ala653, and Phe656, and the high energies of interactions were in accordance with probable blocking of the hERG channel. However, in the biochemical experiments, no significant changes in I-hERG densities and a minor effect on hERG maturation were observed. Predicted metabolic transformation of pentamidines with S atoms in the aliphatic linker leads to oxidation of one S atom, but those with the phenyl sulfanilide moiety can be oxidized to chinones. The tested pentamidines characterized by the presence of sulfur atoms or sulfanilide groups, have favorable drug-likeness parameters and are promising lead structures in the development of new potent chemotherapeutics against PJP.

TI "Slash and burn" or "weed and manure"? A modelling approach to explore

AB The record of prehistoric crop cultivation in central Europe dates as far back as 5500 bc. In the pile-dwellings of the north-western pre-alpine forelands, dating roughly from 4300 to 800 bc, favourable taphonomic conditions provide evidence for the ways of cereal cultivation and consumption in unmatched detail. Based on different sets of (bio-) archaeological and palynological evidence, different hypotheses of crop husbandry methods have been developed for the wetland settlements. During the late Neolithic, two partly antithetic ideas are discussed: On one hand Shifting Cultivation assumes frequently shifted crop fields and the use of fire to provide nitrogen for plant uptake; On the other hand Permanent Cultivation reconstructs longer-ranging use of the fields, to which nitrogen may have been provided by various means. From the Bronze Age onwards, most probably some form of extensive ard cultivation was applied. In this article, we explore the implications of the different hypotheses for the socio-ecological system of the wetland sites. We combine the capability of agent-based modelling to simulate dynamic processes with the benefits provided by geographical information systems and the possibilities provided by the use of modern agro-ecosystem modelling tools. First, we used a mechanistic crop growth model, MONICA, to evaluate the influence of important factors of prehistoric crop yield formation: the climatic conditions, the soil texture and the degree of nitrogen availability. Second, we applied an agent-based model (WELASSIMO_crops) to simulate the spatial and economic implications related to the different crop husbandry methods. Our results provide quantitative information on the extent of crop husbandry activities in the wetland sites and on the effect of natural and anthropogenic factors on prehistoric crop yields. Without manure application, initial average yields of 1.0 t ha(-1) a(-1) are shown to decrease rapidly to only 50 % after 10 years. A manuring rate of 10 t ha(-1) a(-1) allows for higher yields of 1.7 t ha(-1) a(-1) and a slower rate of fertility decrease, but requires high numbers of livestock per capita. In shifting cultivation, high yields of 2.7 t ha(-1) a(-1) are reasonable, while necessitating a very large area and high labour input. Using the model results and a case study, we argue that permanent cultivation is more likely to have been the standard method, while burning of the landscape may have had different objectives than crop husbandry. We find that the combination of agent-based social and process-based biophysical modelling is a powerful tool to study the complex interdependencies in human-environment systems in the past.

AB Virtual reality adequately stimulates senses to trick users into accepting the virtual environment. To create a sense of immersion, high-resolution images are required to satisfy human visual system, and low latency is essential for smooth operations, which put great demands on data processing and transmission. Actually, when exploring in the virtual environment, viewers only perceive the content in the current field of view. Therefore, if we can predict the head movements that are important behaviors of viewers, more processing resources can be allocated to the active field of view. In this article, we propose a model to predict the trajectory of head movement. Deep reinforcement learning is employed to mimic the decision making. In our framework, to characterize each state, features for viewport images are extracted by convolutional neural networks. In addition, the spherical coordinate maps and visited maps are generated for each viewport image, which facilitate the multiple dimensions of the state information by considering the impact of historical head movement and position information. To ensure the accurate simulation of visual behaviors during the watching of panoramas, we stipulate that the model imitates the behaviors of human demonstrators. To allow the model to generalize to more conditions, the intrinsic motivation is employed to guide the agent's action toward reducing uncertainty, which can enhance robustness during the exploration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed stepwise head movement predictor.

AB Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the causative agent of one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases, gonorrhea. Over the past two decades there has been an alarming increase of reported gonorrhea cases where the bacteria were resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics thus prompting for alternative antimicrobial treatment strategies. The crucial step in this and many other bacterial infections is the formation of microcolonies, agglomerates consisting of up to several thousands of cells. The attachment and motility of cells on solid substrates as well as the cell-cell interactions are primarily mediated by type IV pili, long polymeric filaments protruding from the surface of cells. While the crucial role of pili in the assembly of microcolonies has been well recognized, the exact mechanisms of how they govern the formation and dynamics of microcolonies are still poorly understood. Here, we present a computational model of individual cells with explicit pili dynamics, force generation and pili-pili interactions. Weemploy the model to study a wide range of biological processes, such as the motility of individual cells on a surface, the heterogeneous cell motility within the large cell aggregates, and the merging dynamics and the self-assembly of microcolonies. The results of numerical simulations highlight the central role of pili generated forces in the formation of bacterial colonies and are in agreement with the available experimental observations. The model can quantify the behavior of multicellular bacterial colonies on biologically relevant temporal and spatial scales and can be easily adjusted to include the geometry and pili characteristics of various bacterial species. Ultimately, the combination of the microbiological experimental approach with the in silico model of bacterial colonies might provide new qualitative and quantitative insights on the development of bacterial infections and thus pave the way to new antimicrobial treatments.

AB The advent of organic molecules as inhibitors in the field of corrosion monitoring has been exponentially expanding in the past few years which enhanced the scope for innovation in polymers as potential corrosion inhibitors. The current research focused on the development of azomethine functionalised benzothiazole moiety containing four phenol-formaldehyde resins designated as PF1, PF2, PF3, and PF4; with the aim to combat impending degradations due to corrosion of low carbon containing steel in corrosive acid medium. The present work comprises empirical gravimetric and electrochemical techniques for analysing corrosion inhibition behavior of the developed resins, followed by subsequent surface characterization employing different analytical procedures. The synthesized polymeric resins performed as efficient corrosion inhibiting additives. Its anti-corrosion performance was found in the order: PF4 > PF2 > PF1 > PF3, established fromall the experimental findings. It is revealed that the substitution in the benzene unit of benzothiazole moiety played crucial role in corrosion inhibitingmechanism. The activation energy steadily increased after addition of resins into the corrosivemedium suggested that this elevated barrier is required to be crossed for the occurrence of corrosion phenomenon, which leads towards declining of corrosion rate. The application of phenol-formaldehyde resins in acid media substantially prevented carbon steel fromdeterioration due to corrosion. This is attributed to the corrosion inhibiting nature of the adsorbed resin, whereas, the adsorption of resins was confirmed by surface analysing techniques like SEM-EDX, AFMand XPS. Furthermore, thesewet-chemical experimental outcomes arewell complemented from results analysed from ab initio DFT study and MD simulation. Additionally, MD simulation outcomes helped in visualization of the adsorbed configuration of themodeled resins in presence of different corrosive components. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Low reversion of lithium sulfide and defects causing irreversible capacity loss are the primary causes of low Coulombic efficiency in tin sulfide/graphene-based composites. Herein, we synthesized a SnS/graphene composite via a novel lithiation-assisted exfoliation and reduction method using SnS2, n-butyllithium, and graphene oxide as raw materials. The experimental results reveal that lithium from the insertion agent combine with the oxygen-containing groups on graphene oxide; this can help in the reduction of hexagonal SnS2 to orthorhombic SnS during calcination and simultaneous pre-occupancy of the edge and defect sites of graphene; thus, additional lithium ion consumption during the initial several lithiation processes is diminished. Microstructural characterizations indicate that the exfoliated SnS nanosheets with a dramatically decreased lateral size (50-100 nm) are uniformly decorated on the surface of lithium-integrated graphene sheets. Consequently, the as-prepared SnS/graphene composite exhibits a significantly high SnS ultilization with a 77.5% initial Coulombic efficiency, which is the highest value reported in the current literature. Moreover, an excellent reversibility of conversion reaction ( SnS + 2Li(+) + 2e(-) <-> Sn + Li2S) and a high reversible capacity of 1016.4 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles are expressed in this composite electrode, demonstrating its importance as an anode material for energy storage.

TI Sensitivity Analysis of an ENteric Immunity SImulator (ENISI)-Based
   Model of Immune Responses to Helicobacter pylori Infection
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID AGENT-BASED MODEL; IN-SILICO; INFLAMMATION; SYSTEMS
AB Agent-based models (ABM) are widely used to study immune systems, providing a procedural and interactive view of the underlying system. The interaction of components and the behavior of individual objects is described procedurally as a function of the internal states and the local interactions, which are often stochastic in nature. Such models typically have complex structures and consist of a large number of modeling parameters. Determining the key modeling parameters which govern the outcomes of the system is very challenging. Sensitivity analysis plays a vital role in quantifying the impact of modeling parameters in massively interacting systems, including large complex ABM. The high computational cost of executing simulations impedes running experiments with exhaustive parameter settings. Existing techniques of analyzing such a complex system typically focus on local sensitivity analysis, i.e. one parameter at a time, or a close "neighborhood" of particular parameter settings. However, such methods are not adequate to measure the uncertainty and sensitivity of parameters accurately because they overlook the global impacts of parameters on the system. In this article, we develop novel experimental design and analysis techniques to perform both global and local sensitivity analysis of large-scale ABMs. The proposed method can efficiently identify the most significant parameters and quantify their contributions to outcomes of the system. We demonstrate the proposed methodology for ENteric Immune SImulator (ENISI), a large-scale ABM environment, using a computational model of immune responses to Helicobacter pylori colonization of the gastric mucosa.

AB For environmental protection and to reduce costs, asphalt concrete manufacture incorporates reclaimed materials from the deconstruction of road surfaces under renovation in a process designed specifically to reduce the use of virgin materials (bitumen and aggregates). When the recycling rate is high (over 30% of reclaimed asphalt pavement -Rap-), it is essential to control the properties of the final binder -RacB-(mixture of reclaimed asphalt pavement binder -RapB- and virgin binder-VB-) to guarantee the mechanical performances of the reclaimed asphalt concrete. The aim of the present study was to consider the rheological characteristics of the virgin binder and the type of rejuvenating agent it contained and their effect on the conventional and rheological characteristics of the final binder; the reclaimed asphalt pavement binder used in all these tests was first defined in terms of its rheology and consistency. All the final binders were obtained using a methodology which ensured a common controlled consistency, whichever virgin binder was used. The effect of aging on these final binders in the course of manufacture and during the lifetime of the asphalt concrete on the road was simulated experimentally by the RTFOT (Rolling Thin Film Oven Test) and the PAV (Pressure Aging Vessel) procedure. A rheological study of all the binders was then carried out using traditional standard tests, and in addition a specifically adapted experimental procedure was used to assess the behaviour of the product at different operational temperatures.

AB Computational methods were used to design structure-based combinatorial libraries of antipicornaviral capsid-binding ligands. The multiple copy simultaneous search (MCSS) program was employed to calculate functionality maps for many diverse functional groups for both the poliovirus and rhinovirus capsid structures in the region of the known drug binding pocket. Based on the results of the MCSS calculations, small combinatorial libraries consisting of 10s or 100s of three-monomer compounds were designed and synthesized. Ligand binding was demonstrated by a noncell-based mass spectrometric assay, a functional immunoprecipitation assay, and crystallographic analysis of the complexes of the virus with two of the candidate ligands. The P1/Mahoney poliovirus strain was used in the experimental studies. A comparison showed that the MCSS calculations had correctly identified the observed binding site for all three monomer units in one ligand and for two out of three in the other ligand. The correct central monomer position in the second ligand was reproduced in calculations in which the several key residues lining the pocket were allowed to move. This study validates the computational methodology. It also illustrates that subtle changes in protein structure can lead to differences in docking results and points to the importance of including target flexibility, as well as ligand flexibility, in the design process.

TI KINETIC-STUDY ON SIMULTANEOUS INTERPENETRATING POLYMER NETWORK FORMATION
   OF EPOXY-RESIN AND UNSATURATED POLYESTER
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE

DT Article
ID AROMATIC DIAMINES; CURING REACTION; CURE
AB Simultaneous interpenetrating polymer networks (SIN) based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) and unsaturated polyester (UP) in weight ratios of 100/0, 50/50, and 0/100 were blended and cured simultaneously by using cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and m-xylenediamine (MXDA) as curing agents. A kinetic study during SIN formation was carried out at 43, 53, 58, and 64 degrees C. Concentration changes for both epoxide and C=C bond were monitored with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Rate expressions for epoxide polymerization were established with model reactions for phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) and benzylamine in dichloroethane containing benzyl alcohol. Experimental results revealed that a lower cure rate constant for the C=C bond during SIN formation was found, compared with pure UP network formation. A model of network interlock is proposed to account for this phenomenon. During simultaneous cure of DGEBA and UP, the network interlock should provide a sterically hindered environment, which subsequently retards cure rate for UP. On the other hand, epoxide cure during SIN formation indicates higher rate constants for both uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions, compared with those of pure DGEBA cure. Presumably the catalytic effect of hydroxyl end groups in UP overcomes the effect of network interlock. Kinetic parameters were calculated and are discussed. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB Land-use change results from the decisions of diverse actors in response to economic and political contexts. Identification of underlying decision-making processes is key to understanding land-use patterns, anticipating trends, and designing effective environmental governance mechanisms. Here, we use a scenario-based decision game to examine hypothetical land-use decisions among four groups of rural producers in the municipalities of Sinop, GuarantA do Norte and Novo Progresso in the Brazilian Amazon. We simulate changes in agricultural prices, production cost, and frequency of environmental monitoring (in situ inspections) to understand how land-use decisions are made and change with shifts in economic and governance incentives. Hypothetical land-use decisions vary across scenarios, but not across study sites; environmental law enforcement influence land decisions, but not to the extent of dominating market factors and not for all types of producers. Decision games cannot substitute approaches to explain behavioral responses from observational data. However, they can provide immediate feedback on behavioral hypotheses before comprehensive observational data becomes available and support the development of models for land-use policy planning at local and regional scales.

AB Mechanistic epidemiological modelling has a role in predicting the spatial and temporal spread of emerging disease outbreaks and purposeful application of control treatment in animal populations. Especially in the case of infectious diseases newly emerging in an ecological habitat, lack of knowledge may hamper direct parameterisation of model algorithms. Along with experimental studies observational data is usually based on case notifications. These data are widely acknowledged as having "biological precision" due to e.g. convenient sampling procedures, host or human activity patterns or diagnostic limitations under field conditions. Nevertheless, the data comprises the complex spatio-temporal distribution patterns of the infection. In the literature, this data value is non-systematically used to inform model development although the need for and value of the data is well recognised. Here we address the newly emerging epidemic of African swine fever spreading in Eurasian wild boar using an existing spatio-temporally explicit individual-based model of wild boar. The disease etiology required the implementation of a sub-model regarding transmission by carcasses left after infected individuals have died. However, the experimental evidence about the mechanism involved in carcass-mediated spread of the infection still has to be established. We propose a mechanistic quantitative procedure to optimise calibration of several uncertain parameters based on the spatio-temporal model output from the simulation environment and the spatio-temporal case data of infectious disease notifications. The best agreement with the spatio-temporal spreading pattern was achieved by parameterisation that suggests ubiquitous accessibility to carcasses but with marginal chance of being contacted by conspecifics e.g., avoidance behaviour. The parameter estimation procedure is fully general and applicable to problems where spatio-temporal explicit data recording and spatial-explicit dynamic modelling was performed.

AB Background: Obesity is well known multifactorial disorder towards the public health concern in front of the world. Increasing rates of obesity are characterized by liver diseases, chronic diseases, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and stroke, improper function of the heart, reproductive and gastrointestinal diseases, and gallstones. An essential enzyme pancreatic lipase recognized for the digestion and absorption of lipids can he a promising drug target towards the future development of anti obesity therapeutics in the cure of obesity disorders.
   Objective: The purpose of present study is to identify an effective potential therapeutic agent for the inhibition of pancreatic lipase.
   Methods: A trio of in-silico procedure of HTVS, SP and XP in Glide module, Schrodinger with default parameters, was applied on Specs databases to identify the best potential compound based on receptor grid. Finally, based on binding interaction, docking score and glide enemy, selected compounds were taken forward to the platform of IFD, ADME, MMGBSA, DFT, and MDS for analyzing the ligands behavior into the protein binding site.
   Results: Using in silico protocol of structure-based virtual screening on pancreatic lipase top two compounds AN-465/43369242 & AN-465/43384139 from Specs database were reported. The result suggested that both the compounds are competitive inhibitors with higher docking score and greatest binding affinity than the reported inhibitor.
   Conclusion: We anticipate that results could he future therapeutic agents and may present an idea toward the experimental studies against the inhibition of pancreatic lipase.

AB The spermatogenic cycle describes the periodic development of germ cells in the testicular tissue. The temporal-spatial dynamics of the cycle highlight the unique, complex, and interdependent interaction between germ and somatic cells, and are the key to continual sperm production. Although understanding the spermatogenic cycle has important clinical relevance for male fertility and contraception, there are a number of experimental obstacles. For example, the lengthy process cannot be visualized through dynamic imaging, and the precise action of germ cells that leads to the emergence of testicular morphology remains uncharacterized. Here, we report an agent-based model that simulates the mouse spermatogenic cycle on a cross-section of the seminiferous tubule over a time scale of hours to years, while considering feedback regulation, mitotic and meiotic division, differentiation, apoptosis, and movement. The computer model is able to elaborate the germ cell dynamics in a time-lapse movie format, allowing us to trace individual cells as they change state and location. More importantly, the model provides mechanistic understanding of the fundamentals of male fertility, namely how testicular morphology and sperm production are achieved. By manipulating cellular behaviors either individually or collectively in silico, the model predicts causal events for the altered arrangement of germ cells upon genetic or environmental perturbations. This in silico platform can serve as an interactive tool to perform long-term simulation and to identify optimal approaches for infertility treatment and contraceptive development.

AB The safety and efficacy of butoconazole nitrate 100-mg pessaries was compared with that of econazole nitrate 150-mg ovules in a three-day regimen in nonpregnant patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Follow-up visits occurred approximately 11 and 32 days after the completion of treatment. In microbiologic assessments of the elimination of the pathogenic Candida sp from vaginal secretions (wet-mount and culture), butoconazole was superior to econazole, both at visit 2 (89% versus 52%, respectively; P = 0.006) and at visit 3 (100% versus 67%, respectively; P = 0.014). Among patients treated with butoconazole who had a microbiologic cure at visit 2, no cases of relapse were detected a month after treatment ended. In contrast, 33.3% of econazole-treated patients experienced relapse. Clinical cures (absence of vulval and vaginal signs and/or symptoms) were comparable for the two treatment groups at visit 2 (69% for butoconazole and 82% for econazole) and also at visit 3 (80% for butoconazole and 83% for econazole). Therapeutic cures (simultaneous clinical and microbiologic cures) were numerically but not statistically superior for butoconazole at visit 2 (62% versus 48%) and at visit 3 (80% versus 58%). No serious adverse events were reported or observed with the use of either drug.

AB A novel adsorbent of mesoporous carbon with high specific surface area was successfully prepared by hydrothermal and template method, using sodium lignosulfonate (LSs) as a raw material and cetyltrimethylamrnonium bromide (CTAB) as a template agent. The mesoporous carbon was characterized by SEM, TEM, BET, FTIR, and XPS. The formation mechanism of the mesoporous carbon was analyzed. The adsorption of uranium(VI) on the mesoporous carbon from the simulated aqueous solution and actual radioactive wastewater was respectively investigated. The optimum conditions for U(VI) adsorption were determined by studying experimental variables including pH, contact time, sorbent dose, initial concentration, and temperature. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity of the mesoporous carbon for U(VI) in the simulated aqueous solution and actual radioactive wastewater was respectively 109.46 mg/g at pH 5.5 and 328.15 K and 195.6 mg/g at pH 5.5 and the initial U(VI) concentration of 189.75 mg/L. The adsorption data could be well described by the pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich isotherm model. The adsorption of U(VI) on the mesoporous carbon was an endothermic and spontaneous process. The adsorption mechanism may be a complex chemical reaction between uranium and the oxygen-containing functional groups on the mesoporous carbon.

AB Amphotericin B (AmB) is a potent but toxic drug commonly used to treat systemic mycoses. Its efficiency as a therapeutic agent depends on its ability to discriminate between mammalian and fungal cell membranes. The association of AmB monomers in an aqueous environment plays an important role in drug selectivity, as oligomers formed prior to membrane insertion-presumably dimers - are believed to act differently on fungal (ergosterol-rich) and mammalian (cholesterol-rich) membranes. In this work, we investigate the initial steps of AmB self-association by studying the structural, thermodynamic and spectral properties of AmB dimers in aqueous medium using molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that in water, the hydrophobic aggregation of AmB monomers yields almost equiprobable populations of parallel and antiparallel dimers that rapidly interconvert into each other, and the dipole-dipole interaction between zwitterionic head groups plays a minor role in determining the drug's tendency for self-aggregation. A simulation of circular dichroism (CD) spectra indicates that in experimental measurements, the signature CD spectrum of AmB aggregates should be attributed to higher-order oligomers rather than dimers. Finally, we suggest that oligomerization can impair the selectivity of AmB molecules for fungal membranes by increasing their hydrophobic drive for nonspecific membrane insertion.

AB Giardia lambia is a flagellated protozoan parasite that lives in the small intestine and is the causal agent of giardiasis. It has been reported that G. lamblia exhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Our group work demonstrated that the g6pd and 6pgl genes are present in the open frame that gives rise to the fused G6PD::6PGL protein; where the G6PD region is similar to the 3D structure of G6PD in Homo sapiens. The objective of the present work was to show the presence of the structural NADP(+) binding site on the fused G6PD::6PGL protein and evaluate the effect of the NADP(+) molecule on protein stability using biochemical and computational analysis. A protective effect was observed on the thermal inactivation, thermal stability, and trypsin digestions assays when the protein was incubated with NADP(+). By molecular docking, we determined the possible structural-NADP(+) binding site, which is located between the Rossmann fold of G6PD and 6PGL. Finally, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was used to test the stability of this complex; it was determined that the presence of both NADP(+) structural and cofactor increased the stability of the enzyme, which is in agreement with our experimental results.

AB The synthase, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate (KDO8P), is a key enzyme for the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis of gram-negative bacteria and a potential target for developing new antimicrobial agents. In this study, computational molecular modeling methods were used to determine the complete structure of the KDO8P synthase from Neisseria meningitidis and to investigate the molecular mechanism of its inhibition by three bisphosphate inhibitors: BPH1, BPH2, and BPH3. Our results showed that BPH1 presented a protein-ligand complex with the highest affinity, which is in agreement with experimental data. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed that BPH1 is more active due to the many effective interactions, most of which are derived from its phosphoenolpyruvate moiety. Conversely, BPH2 exhibited few hydrogen interactions during the MD simulations with key residues located at the active sites of the KDO8P synthase. In addition, we hydroxylated BPH2 to create the hypothetical molecule named BPH3, to investigate the influence of the hydroxyl groups on the affinity of the bisphosphate inhibitors toward the KDO8P synthase. Overall, we discuss the main interactions between the KDO8P synthase and the bisphosphate inhibitors that are potential starting points for the design of new molecules with significant antibiotic activities.

AB We consider a microscopic model (a system of self-propelled particles) to study the behaviour of a large group of pedestrians walking in a corridor. Our point of interest is the effect of anisotropic interactions on the global behaviour of the crowd. The anisotropy we have in mind reflects the fact that people do not perceive (i.e. see, hear, feel or smell) their environment equally well in all directions. The dynamics of the individuals in our model follow from a system of Newton-like equations in the overdamped limit. The instantaneous velocity is modelled in such a way that it accounts for the angle at which an individual perceives another individual.
   We investigate the effects of this perception anisotropy by means of simulations, very much in the spirit of molecular dynamics. We define a number of characteristic quantifiers (including the polarization index and Morisita index) that serve as measures, for example, for organization and clustering, and we use these indices to investigate the influence of anisotropy on the global behaviour of the crowd. The goal of the paper is to investigate the potential of this model; extensive statistical analysis of simulation data and reproducing any specific real-life situation are beyond its scope.

AB Polar organic contaminants in surface water for drinking water purposes are relevant if they are poorly degradable, and analyses of such compounds are challenging because they are extremely water soluble. The problem is enhanced with more polar and unknown metabolites such as Sarkosin-N-(phenylsulfonyl) (SPS) which was detected in the Rhine river constantly in concentrations between 0.5 and 2 mu g/L. The ubiquitous presence of SPS in the water was initially hypothesized to be due to the microbial degradation in sewage plants of 6-[methyl(phenylsulfonyl)amino]hexanoic acid (HPS) which is extensively used in Germany as a corrosion inhibiting agent. Soil suspension as well as closed-bottle degradation experiments with sewage water confirmed this hypothesis. Immobilized cell systems simulated the behavior in underground passage. HPS was totally degraded within hours; while SPS and other metabolites such as 4-[methyl(phenylsulfonyl)amino]butanoic acid (BPS) and methyl(phenylsulfonyI)amide (MPS) were identified. These studies revealed that phenylsulfonamides should be included in the group of drinking water relevant compounds because of their positive identification in drinking water itself. Even if the toxic effects of the investigated phenylsulfonamides have not yet been substantiated possibly also due to their inadequate biodegradability, their presence in the environment is a concern in general and therefore should be minimized.

AB Single crystals of (E)-N'-((4-fluorophenyl)(phenyl) methylene) isonicotinohydrazide dihydrate were grown by the slow evaporation solution growth technique. The structure was elucidated by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and the crystal belongs to the triclinic system with the space group P (1) over bar. The crystallinity of the material was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction which coincides well with the simulated pattern with varied intensities. The band gap energy is estimated by the application of the Kubelka-Munk algorithm. Theoretical calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT), to derive the optimized geometry, dipole moment, HOMO-LUMO energies and first-order molecular hyperpolarizability, beta (similar to 84 times that of urea). The energy and oscillator strengths calculated by TD-DFT results complement the experimental findings. The atomic charge distributions of the various atoms were obtained by Mulliken charge population analysis. The molecular stability and bond strength were investigated by applying natural bond orbital analysis. Investigation of the intermolecular interactions and crystal packing via Hirshfeld surface analysis, based on single-crystal XRD, reveals that the close contacts are associated with molecular interactions. Fingerprint plots of the Hirshfeld surfaces were used to locate and analyze the percentage of hydrogen-bonding interactions. The grown crystals were further characterized by FT-IR, FT-Raman and TG/DTA.

AB The simultaneous exposure of organisms to toxicants and disease causing agents poses a serious risk to important stocks. Worldwide, aquatic animal disease outbreaks have been increasing in both frequency and severity, and many have been associated with anthropogenic environmental change. Little is known about the complex interactions of the immune system and biotransformational pathways of vertebrates; however, urbanization and coastal development create a scenario in which a wide range of species are exposed to chemical pollutants in conjunction with a wide spectrum of ubiquitous, opportunistic pathogens. These interactions can severely compromise organismal health. Potential effects include decreased fitness, increased predation, decreased fecundity, reduced metabolic activity, suppressed immune function and mortality. Recent attention has been paid to immunomodulation in toxicant exposed fishes. In our current study we investigated the effects of the common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene in conjunction with Mycobacterium marinum infection in the zebrafish. Danio rerio. The goal of our study was to elucidate the interactions between stressors in the host organism. Fish were exposed to either a high or low dose of phenanthrene, infected with M. marinum or received a combination exposure of toxicant and bacteria. Results of our study were evaluated using survivorship analysis, toxicant body burden, and histology. Our data show an interaction between M. marinum infection and exposure to a high dose of phenanthrene in the zebrafish. Survivorship was significantly reduced for animals only exposed to the high dose of phenanthrene as compared to all other experimental groups. The increased survivorship for fish exposed to both Mycobacterium and a high dose of phenanthrene suggests an antagonistic interaction between stressors. Body burden data, which show significant differences in the ratio of phenanthrene: metabolites between experimental groups, suggests a disruption of the biotransformational pathway. We postulate that the inflammatory response, initiated by bacterial infection, is impeding the ability of the zebrafish to completely metabolize phenanthrene. In addition, the correlation between reduced metabolite production and increased survival indicates that phenanthrene metabolites are more toxic than the parent compound. Our study underscores the importance of investigating multiple stressor interactions as a way to better understand complex environmental interactions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of apron buses has become a common practice at many European airports. Previous studies related to airplane boarding rarely apply when apron buses are used, leaving airlines with no well-researched option except to use the random boarding method. In this paper, we test the time to complete boarding a two-door airplane using various boarding methods with two apron buses. These methods were inspired by the classical outside-in, back-to-front, and reverse-pyramid methods considering the limited number of boarding groups corresponding to the limited number of apron buses used for transporting passengers from the terminal to the aircraft. Unlike earlier publications, we test these methods under partial aircraft occupancy. Furthermore, we test the boarding methods under conditions involving: different passenger occupancy rates, different luggage situations, and with two types of seating assignments-random and based upon passenger seating preferences-by considering the advantages brought by the symmetric layout of the aircraft. Experimental results indicate that the best performing method can reduce the boarding time by up to 38.6% compared to the time resulting from the random boarding method. When the airplane is partially occupied, the best performing methods are reverse pyramid-A, hybrid-A, and hybrid-B, all with similar performances.

AB A new class of visuomotor neuron has been recently discovered in the monkey's premotor cortex: mirror neurons. These neurons respond both when a particular action is performed by the recorded monkey acid when the same action, performed by another individual, is observed. Mirror neurons appear to form a cortical system matching observation and execution of goal-related motor actions. Experimental evidence suggests that a similar matching system also exists in humans. What might be the functional role of this matching system? One possible function is to enable an organism to detect certain mental states of observed conspecifics. This function might be part of, or a precursor to, a more general mind-reading ability. Two different accounts of minding reading have been suggested. According to 'theory theory', mental states are represented as inferred posits of a naive theory. According to 'simulation theory', other people's mental states are represented by adopting their perspective: by tracking or matching their states with resonant states of one's own. The activity of mirror neurons, and the fact that observers undergo motor facilitation in the same muscular groups as those utilized by target agents, are findings that accord well with simulation theory but would not be predicted by theory theory.

AB Proflavine is a small molecule that intercalates into DNA and, thereby, acts as an anticancer agent. Intercalation of proflavine is shown to be a two-step process in which the first step is believed to be the formation of a pre-intercalative outside bound state. Experimental studies so far have been unable to capture the nature of the outside bound state. However, the sub-millisecond timescale observed in fluorescence kinetic experiments is often attributed to the binding of proflavine outside of DNA. Here, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations with multiple proflavine molecules to study the structure and dynamics of the formation of the outside bound state of DNA at different ion concentrations. We observed that the timescale of the outside bound state formation is, at least, five orders of magnitude faster (in nanoseconds) than the experimentally reported timescale (sub-milliseconds) attributed to binding outside DNA. Moreover, we also observed the stacked arrangement of proflavine all around DNA, which is different from the experimentally predicted stacking arrangement perpendicular to the helical axis of DNA in the close vicinity of the phosphate groups. This study, therefore, provides insight into the molecular structure and dynamics of the pre-intercalative outside bound state and will help in understanding the overall intercalation mechanism.

AB In order to improve the mechanical, adhesion and high-temperature performance of liquid asphalt, Epoxy resin (EP) was blended to the liquid asphalt as a modifier. A novel cold mix asphalt was prepared by implementation the high-performance Epoxy resin modified Reactive Liquid Asphalt (ERLA) technology, where reactive liquid served as its main component. The produced cold mix asphalt had presented excellent theological and mechanical properties (dynamic viscosity, plasticity, Marshall Stability, etc.), meeting or exceeding the requirements of pavement materials. The optimized composition for ideal comprehensive performance was studied by orthogonal designed experiments on the theological and mechanical properties of ERLA. Infrared Spectroscopy (IR), Simultaneous Thermogravimetry Differential Scanning Calorimetry (TG-DSC) and Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM)) were used to characterize the functional group changes during curing reaction, and subsequently to evaluate the thermal stability of the material at high temperature and the compatibility of ERLA. Experimental results indicated the optimum composition of ERLA (by weight percent) is 15% reactive liquid, 40% epoxy resin and 45% original asphalt with curing agent, achieving a grade at PG 82-22. This ERLA has superior theological and mechanical properties and therefore can be implemented for cold mix asphalt, leading to a more flexible and environment-friendly pavement construction.

AB Process byproducts of the fruit industry may represent an inexpensive and reliable source of green reducing and capping agents to be applied in current bio-nano synthesis. This study reports a novel method of one pot green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from the Citrus limetta peel extract (CPE). UV-vis spectrophotometry, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies confirmed synthesis of AgNPs of average size 18 nm, which were stable up to 120 days. FTIR study suggested that alcoholic groups of CPE mainly responsible for the stabilization of AgNPs. Theoretical simulation using Density Functional Theory (DFT) indicated that among different alcoholic compounds of CPE, 3-allyl-6-methoxy phenol showed the highest interaction energy (128.49 KJ/mole) with AgNPs, and is mainly responsible for stabilization of the latter. The synthesized AgNPs have both antibacterial (Micrococcus luteus, Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli) and antifungal (candida species) activities with potent anti-biofilm and cell membrane permeabilization ability. These nanoparticles have superior antimicrobial potency than earlier reports specially against topical pathogens. Therefore, these AgNPs can be an effective alternative in pharmaceutical industries against topical pathogens.

The corrosion inhibition efficiency of both oxadiazole derivatives tested onto mild steel in 1.0 M hydrochloric acid solution through weight loss measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization techniques. The weight loss measurement was conducted at different concentrations (50 ppm-300 ppm) and varying temperatures 298 K-318 K for immersion periods of 12.0 h. Weight loss results shown that 96.29% and 93.42% was maximized inhibition efficiency by B4NPAMOT and B2NPAMOT respectively at 300 ppm concentration at 298 K. EIS study defined that the charge transfer resistance shifted high at an enhanced concentration of each derivative. Polarization studies revealed a mixed type of inhibition and well obeyed through Langmuir adsorption isotherm by both the derivatives. Surface analysis of the steel sheet performed using a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) equipped with electron dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), respectively. Computational simulation (Fukui functions, DFT and molecular dynamics) was further analyzed to corroborate with the experimental techniques. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new facilitated transport model for CO2 through ion-exchange membranes containing a diamine complexing agent was developed. The diamine ion behaves as a mobile carrier for CO2. Although the morphology of the ion-exchange membrane affects carrier transport, the effect of morphology on ionic carrier transport is not clear. The Nernst-Planck equation and the penetration model were employed in this modeling study. The electrical double layer effect and friction effect in the ion-exchange membrane was also considered. In the membrane, there are two kinds of counter ions (NH3+-R-NH2 and NH3+-R-NH3+), CO2 and NH3+-R-NHCOO- (carbamate ion). The carbamate ion can be treated as a neutral molecule because it has both plus and minus charge. Commercial Nafion117 (N117) and heat treated Nafion117 (HN117) were used as ion-exchange membranes. The water content of N117 and HN117 was 16 and 45%, respectively. Nafion has cluster channels which were filled with water, and HN117 has a larger cluster channel size than N117. Monoprotonated ethylenediamine was used as a carrier. Mobile counter ion diffusivities were measured by membrane conductivity. Carbon dioxide diffusivity was determined from transport measurements in a nonreactive Nafion membrane. The diffusivity ratio of carbamate ion to CO2 was estimated by the group contribution method which is effective in aqueous solutions. We estimated a friction effect for the carbamate ion which reduces the carbamate ion diffusivity ratio in the cluster channel. For the HN117 membrane case, experimental results and simulations were in good agreement when we used the diffusivity ratio which was estimated from the group contribution method The counter ion diffusivities, which are restricted by electrical forces, are the rate limiting step for CO2 transport through large clusters. For the N117 case, we must consider the friction effect, and when we use a small carbamate diffusivity ratio, simulations and experimental results agreed well. The diffusivity of the carbamate ion, which is the largest molecule in the membrane, is the rate limiting step for transport through small cluster channels. This model can explain the permeate-side CO2 pressure effect as the permeate-side CO2 pressure seriously reduces the facilitation effect. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB Objective. The aim of this study was to measure dimensional changes due to hygroscopic expansion and the bioactivity of two experimental methacrylate-based dental adhesives either incorporating Bioglass (R) 45S5 (3-E&RA/BG) or MTA (3-E&RA/WMTA). Materials and methods. 3-E&RA/BG, 3-E&RA/WMTA and a control filler-free resin blend (3-E&RA) were formulated from commercially available monomers. Water sorption (WS) and solubility (SL) behaviour were evaluated by weighing material disks at noted intervals; the relationship between degree of hydration and the glass transition temperature (Tg) was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In vitro apatite-forming ability as a function of soaking time in phosphate-containing solutions was also determined. Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate differences between groups for maximum WS, SL, net water uptake and the percentage change in Tg values. Post-ANOVA pair-wise comparisons were conducted using Mann-Whitney-U tests. Results. 3-E&RA/BG and 3-E&RA/WMTA exhibited values of maximum WS and net water uptake that were significantly higher when compared to 3-E&RA. However, no statistically significant differences were observed in terms of SL between all the adhesives. The addition of the Bioglass (R) 45S5 and MTA to the 3-E&RA showed no reduction of the Tg after 60 days of storage in deionized water. ATR Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) of the filled resin disks soaked in DPBS for 60 days showed the presence of carbonate ions in different chemical phases. Conclusion. Dentine bonding agents comprising calcium-silicates are not inert materials in a simulated oral environment and apatite formation may occur in the intra-oral conditions. Clinical significance. A bioactive dental material which forms apatite on the surface would have several benefits including closure of gaps forming at the resin-dentine interface and potentially better bond strength over time (less degradation of bond).

AB A micro Planar high-Field Asymmetric waveform Ion Mobility Spectrometer (P-FAIMS) operating at ambient pressure and temperature has been simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics software. P-FAIMS is based on ion gas-phase separation due to the dependence of ion mobility with electric field. Ions are selected by a DC voltage characteristic of each ion kind. Physics of ion behaviour in high electric fields conditions is well known but not the chemistry behind ion reactions and kinetics. The aim of this work is the modelling of different kind of ions in a P-FAIMS having account of the main factors involved in their movement in the drift tube. Simulations of vapour phase ions of three compounds have been studied for different values of drift electric field amplitude to gas number density (E/N) ratio: protonated water clusters H+ (H2O)(n) and O-2(-)(H2O)(n) ions obtained in air, and a chemical warfare agent simulant DMMPH+ that emulates gas sarin. Ions were selected due to simulation needs of experimental data of the main quantities involved in the definition of ions mobilities. Results show that simulations of ions behaviour in a P-FAIMS are possible with COMSOL Multiphysics software and that the time and intensity at which ions are detected are in good agreement with experimental data from literature.

AB This paper focuses on the recovery of tellurium from high tellurium-bearing material with similar compositions to the anode slime of copper electrorefining, containing about 50% of copper and 34% of tellurium in several different phases. Based on the Pourbaix diagram (Eh-pH) of Cu-Te-Se-H2O in certain conditions, an alkaline pressure leaching process with NaOH as leaching agent was proposed to separate tellurium and selenium selectively from the raw material. Further heterogeneous thermodynamic simulation of the leaching was performed by Factsage 6.3 and the behavior of different species was predicted. The experimental results agree with the simulation results and prove that about 90% of the tellurium can be oxidized to soluble sodium tellurite, while the copper stays in the residue. It is found that selenium is difficult to dissolve with a leaching efficiency of only 20%, which needs more detailed research in the future. For the leaching of tellurium, the established optimal leaching conditions were as follows: US ratio of 6:1, free concentration of NaOH of 30-40 g/L, time of 6 h, total pressure of compressed air of 1.0 MPa, temperature of 120 +/- 5 degrees C, and agitation speed of 400 rpm.

AB A mathematical model based on mass transfer in plant tissues was developed with the aim of finding a simple predictive model which was easy to use and yet had a broad application scope in the osmotic dehydration of foods. The model takes into account the capacity of each constituent to diffuse within tissue by using a diffusion coefficient and a transmembrane mass transfer coefficient. The model also depends on the mass ratio of osmotic solution to product, on the initial chemical composition of the product and solution, and on the product shape. The application of the model to apple dehydration with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) solutions allowed us to quantitatively simulate the time evolution of cellular and extracellular volumes which was observed previously in histological sections under the microscope. By using experimental data obtained during potato dehydration in mixed solutions of sucrose and salt, mass transfer and apparent diffusion coefficients were fitted in order to evaluate product behavior under different process conditions. A good quantitative agreement was obtained between the experimental and calculated results. The model presented in this paper allows the main variables of osmotic dehydration to be estimated using a low number of fitting parameters, and interprets, through a simple algorithm, the complex phenomena of the main mass transfer mechanisms in plant tissues.

AB Our objective was to optimize the CA technique on mammal embryos.
   Materials and methods: 1000 frozen 2-cell embryos from B6CBA mice were used. Based on a literature review, and after checking post-thaw embryo viability, the main outcome measures included: 1) comparison of the embryo recovery rate between 2 CA protocols (2 agarose layers and 3 agarose layers); 2) comparison of DNA damage by the CA on embryos with (ZP +) and without (ZP -) zona pellucida; and 3) comparison of DNA damage in embryos exposed to 2 genotoxic agents (H2O2 and simulated sunlight irradiation (SSI)). DNA damage was quantified by the % tail DNA.
   Results: 1) The recovery rate was 3,3% (n = 5/150) with the 2 agarose layers protocol and 71,3% (n = 266/371) with the 3 agarose layers protocol. 2) DNA damage did not differ statistically significantly between ZP - and ZP + embryos (12.60 +/- 2.53% Tail DNA vs 11.04 +/- 1.50 (p = 0.583) for the control group and 49.23 +/- 4.16 vs 41.13 +/- 4.31 (p = 0.182) for the H2O2 group); 3) H2O2 and SSI induced a statistically significant increase in DNA damage compared with the control group (41.13 +/- 4.31% Tail DNA, 36.33 +/- 3.02 and 11.04 +/- 1.50 (p < 0.0001)).
   The CA on mammal embryos was optimized by using thawed embryos, by avoiding ZP removal and by the adjunction of a third agarose layer.

AB Chemical interaction processes among injected CO2, saline fluids and potential reservoir materials are experimentally simulated to derive dissolution rates of natural materials (minerals) that can be used as input parameters for modeling of CO2 storage in deep saline formations and risk analyses. In order to study dissolution processes, mineral aliquots were exposed to CO2-bearing brines at elevated temperature (60, 100, 150 degrees C) and pressure (85 bar) and at various run durations. Several potential reservoir rocks include carbonates as cement. Calcite and dolomite grains were therefore mainly used as solid starting material. Experiments with the two feldspar varieties alkali feldspar and almost pure anorthite were performed in addition. Grain sizes of the mineral starting materials varied between <63 mu m and 500 mu m with most experiments performed at grain size fractions of 160 - 250 mu m and 250 - 500 mu m. All experiments run with a complex synthetic brine (total dissolved solids: similar to 156 g/l) according to a natural upper cretaceous formation water. Dry ice was used as CO2-source. All experiments were done in closed batch reactors. These reactors allow mimicking reservoir conditions far from the injection site as well as reservoir conditions after finishing the CO2 injection. The concentration changes during the experiment were monitored by ICP-OES measurements of the initial and the post-run fluids. Dissolution rates were derived based on the concentration changes of the brine.
   Most of the studied experimental variables and parameters (temperature, run duration, grain size, brine composition - expressed as pH-value and ionic strength) impact alteration of the reacting agents, i.e. they change the chemical composition of the brine, change the surfaces of the mineral aliquots exposed to the CO2-bearing brine, and induce formation of secondary minerals. Hence, all influencing parameters on dissolution processes have to be considered and time-resolved changes of the dissolution behavior have to be implemented in numerical simulations of processes at CO2 injection sites and CO2 storage reservoirs.

AB OBJECTIVES: This paper presents our own rat model of the cellular brain edema, induced by water intoxication (WI). The basic principle of the model is an osmotic imbalance in the cell membrane followed by an intracellular flow of sodium and simultaneous accumulation of water leading to the subsequent increase of BBB permeability.
   METHODS: The usefulness of the model was tested in precisely specified conditions whose results were clearly expressed. The procedure determined both how WI induces cellular edema as well as the disturbances caused by cellular edema.
   RESULTS: The evidence of existing cellular edema with increased BBB permeability was proved by intracellular accumulation of intravital dye with a large molecular size; increased brain-water content was confirmed by using the dry/ wet weight method and by the decrease in CT density; the elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) due to the expanding volume was determined by continuous monitoring the ICP; the structural lesions were proved by identification of the myelin disintegration; and the impaired nervous functions was demonstrated by the of open field test method.
   CONCLUSION: Our experimental model can help the future studies of pathophysiology of cellular brain edema and is suitable for testing neuroprotective agents.

AB Since the amount of silanol units in the hydrolysis solution directly determines the interfacial adhesive strength and corrosion resisting property of self-assembled silane films, therefore, it is very essential to have a deep understanding of hydrolysis behaviors of SCAs (silane coupling agents). Conductivity measurement, RA-IR measurement and density functional theory (DFT) calculation was applied to the study of the hydrolysis and condensation kinetics of gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-GPS) under near-neutral and acidic conditions. The results indicated that a critical point existed at about 50 h, dividing the entire hydrolysis period into two stages: Stage 1 (S1) and Stage 2 (S2). In S1, the first step hydrolysis reaction prevailed, while the second and third step hydrolysis reactions only played minor roles. The pH value of the hydrolysis solution imposed little influence on the reactions occurring in the solution. However, in S2, pH value exerted a significant influence on the hydrolysis and condensation reactions, based on which there was an optimum pH value range. The results of DFT calculation were consistent with the experimental measurements. Hitherto, a validate method was proposed to simulate the reactions occurring in the hydrolysis solution.

AB The production of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) for commercial applications has greatly increased over the last years and consequently the potential risk for human health. There is a growing awareness of the need to understand the behavior and influence these nanoparticles exert on the environment. Bioaccumulation serves as a good integrator to assess chemical exposure in aquatic systems and is dependent on factors, such as the exposure routes, diet and the aqueous medium. We analyzed the experimental bioaccumulation capability of ionic titanium and TiO2 NPs by zebrafish (Danio rerio) eleutheroembryos through bioconcentration factors (BCFs), after 48 or 72 h of exposure. The stability of both chemical forms in an aquatic medium was fully characterized for further bioaccumulation studies. Several stabilizing agents (humic acids, soluble starch, polyethylene glycol, Na4P2O7 and Na2HPO4) for anatase and rutile, the two allotrophs of TiO2 NPs, were evaluated to check the evolution of the aggregation process. Around 60% of TiO2 NPs remained disaggregated under simulated environmental conditions with the addition of 50 mg L-1 of humic acids. However, the presence of eleutheroembryos in the exposure medium increased TiO2 NPs aggregation in the experimental tests. The BCFs values obtained in all cases were <100, which classifies ionic titanium and TiO2 NPs as non-bioaccumulative substances, under the REACH regulations.

AB Since the 1990s, the kerosene fuel (code: JP-8) had been applied in the ground equipment provided with direct injection compression ignition engines in the U.S. Army, resulting in increased occurrence of injection pump failures. Anti-wear additives must be used in the single fuel due to its poor lubricity. In the present work, lubricity improvers were selected on the basis of molecular simulation theoretically and these agents were evaluated to improve the lubricity of jet fuel using the high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR) apparatus and the ball-on-cylinder lubricity evaluator (BOCLE). It was revealed that dimer acid with higher value of adsorption energy on the Fe (110) plane surface had more efficient lubricity promoting properties than that of naphthenic acid. The experimental results suggested that the dimer acid had a better tribological behavior compared with that of naphthenic acid used as lubricity improver of jet fuel. And addition of anti-wear additives at a dosage of 15 mu g/g was able to promote the lubricity of jet fuel to a required level on BOCLE, while a higher concentration over 80 mu g/g was needed to improve the lubricity to a demanded value of diesel on HFRR.

ID FOLDING BEHAVIOR; CHITOSAN
AB We report the controlled reversible and irreversible folding behavior of a biopolymer film simply by tuning the solvent characteristics. Generally, solvent triggered folding of soft membranes or film is achieved by unfolding. Here, we show that this unfolding behavior can be suppressed/delayed or even completely eliminated by altering the intrinsic nature of the solvent. A reversible folding of biopolymer film is observed in response to water, whereas, an irreversible folding is observed in the presence of an aromatic alcohol (AA) solution of different molar concentrations. The folding and unfolding behavior originates from the coupled deformation-diffusion phenomena. Our study indicates that the presence of an AA influences the relaxation behavior of polymer chains, which in turn affects the release of stored strain energy during folding. Controlling the reversibility as well as the actuation time of the biopolymer film by tuning the solvent is explained in detail at the bulk scale by applying appropriate experimental techniques. The underlying mechanism for the observed phenomena is complemented by performing a simulation study for a single polymer chain at the molecular length scale. Due to the solvent-triggered hygromorphic response, biopolymer films exhibit huge potential as sensors, soft robots, drug delivery agents, morphing medical devices and in biomedical applications. We provide experimental evidence for the weight lifting capacity of permanently folded membranes, amounting to similar to 200 times their own weight.

AB The reduction of Np(VI) and Np(V) by Dihydroxyurea (DHU) was studied by spectrophotometry. The results show that the reduction of Np(VI) to Np(V) by DHU is particularly fast. The apparent rate constant is 1.86 s(-1) at 4 degrees C as [HNO(3)] = 0.44 M and [DHU] = 7.5 x 10(-2) M. While further reduction of Np(V) to Np(IV) is so slow that no Np(IV) is observed in 2 h. The reduction back-extraction behavior of Np(VI) in 30% tri-butyl phosphate/kerosene was firstly investigated under conditions of different temperature, different concentrations of DHU and HNO(3) and various phase contact time, respectively. The results show that 98% of Np(VI) in the organic phase can be stripped rapidly to the aqueous phase by DHU under the given experimental conditions. As the concentration of HNO(3) in the aqueous phase increases, the stripping efficiency decreases. While the stripping efficiency increases with the increase of the concentration of DHU. Simulating the 1B contactor of the PUREX process using DHU as the stripping agent, the SF(U)/Np equals to 183 under the given experimental conditions. It indicates that Np will follow with Pu in the U/Pu separation stage in the reprocessing of spent fuels.

AB This paper presents a new computational method for simulating polymer network formation. There are four separate procedures involved in the methodology for this multiscale simulation: (i) mapping of the polymerizing monomers onto a coarse-grained model, (ii) cross-linking the monomers by applying Monte Carlo simulation to the coarse-grained model, (iii) reverse mapping of the coarse-grained model to a fully atomistic representation, and (iv) simulation of the atomistic model through standard molecular dynamics technique. Molecular dynamics simulations and experimental studies are carried out to check the algorithm on the basis of the determination of the physical properties of the cycloaliphatic epoxy resin which is prepared from 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexanecarboxylate as resin monomers and 4-methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride as curing agents. Depending on the effective conversion and temperature, we determine the density, the glass transition temperature, and the thermal expansion coefficient of the cross-linked epoxy system. An increase in the degree of cross-linking is found to increase the glass transition temperature. Good agreement between computer simulation and experimental results is achieved for highly cross-linked networks, thereby showing that the simulation model is basically valid.

AB Background: In gene expression analysis, statistical tests for differential gene expression provide lists of candidate genes having, individually, a sufficiently low p-value. However, the interpretation of each single p-value within complex systems involving several interacting genes is problematic. In parallel, in the last sixty years, game theory has been applied to political and social problems to assess the power of interacting agents in forcing a decision and, more recently, to represent the relevance of genes in response to certain conditions.
   Results: In this paper we introduce a Bootstrap procedure to test the null hypothesis that each gene has the same relevance between two conditions, where the relevance is represented by the Shapley value of a particular coalitional game defined on a microarray data-set. This method, which is called Comparative Analysis of Shapley value (shortly, CASh), is applied to data concerning the gene expression in children differentially exposed to air pollution. The results provided by CASh are compared with the results from a parametric statistical test for testing differential gene expression. Both lists of genes provided by CASh and t-test are informative enough to discriminate exposed subjects on the basis of their gene expression profiles. While many genes are selected in common by CASh and the parametric test, it turns out that the biological interpretation of the differences between these two selections is more interesting, suggesting a different interpretation of the main biological pathways in gene expression regulation for exposed individuals. A simulation study suggests that CASh offers more power than t-test for the detection of differential gene expression variability.
   Conclusion: CASh is successfully applied to gene expression analysis of a data-set where the joint expression behavior of genes may be critical to characterize the expression response to air pollution. We demonstrate a synergistic effect between coalitional games and statistics that resulted in a selection of genes with a potential impact in the regulation of complex pathways.

AB Molecular dynamics simulation has been used to study the specific interactions between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and three drug molecules for which PEG is used to aid delivery: paclitaxel and piroxicam, where PEG is a carrier agent, and hematoporphyrin, where PEG is covalently attached to form a stealth shield. Simulating at physiological salt concentration, we found no evidence of any specific interaction between paclitaxel or piroxicam with PEG, but found a strong interaction for the case of hematoporphyrin. This interaction is lipophilic in nature, between the nonpolar (CH2)(2) groups of the PEG and the porphin ring of the hematoporphyrin. This interaction was found to be strong enough that the PEG aggregated to the hematoporphyrin, independent of whether or not it was covalently bound. Interestingly, when the simulation was repeated in absence of salt we found evidence of this interaction being weakened. This led us to hypothesize a previously unforeseen mechanism: interaction with salt cations cause the PEG to coil around the salt ions, each ion binding to many PEG oxygens, increasing the exposure of the nonpolar ethylene groups, thus increasing the effective hydrophobicity of PEG. The Hydrophobic ethylene groups of the PEG chains adhere strongly to the hydrophobic porphin ring. Experiments involving absorption spectra measurements were conducted, and these results also indicated that presence of salt at physiological level increases the effective attractive interaction between PEG and hematoporphyrin. Taken together, our results demonstrate that while PEG, due to its solubility in both polar and nonpolar solvents, may act as a dissolution aid for paclitaxel and piroxicam, of the three drug molecules studied it will only have a protective role for the case of the hematoporphyrin.

AB Mechanical prophylaxis with foot pumps provides an interesting alternative to chemical agents in the prevention of thromboembolic disease following major orthopaedic surgical procedures. Recent studies have suggested that the simultaneous use of graduated compression stockings (GCS) may hinder the pneumatic compression effect of foot pumps. The hypothesis of this prospective study was that the use of foot pumps without GCS does not affect the efficacy of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis and improves patient compliance. A total of 846 consecutive patients admitted at a single institution undergoing total hip (THR) or knee replacement (TKR) were included in the study. The A-V Impulse System foot-pump unit (Orthofix Vascular Novamedix, Andover, UK) was used in all patients. Of these 846 patients, 46 discontinued the use of foot pumps, leaving 400 patients who received foot pumps in combination with GCS and 400 patients with foot pumps alone. Eleven patients of the stocking group (2.7%) and nine patients of the no-stocking group (2.3%) developed postoperative symptomatic DVT (p=0.07). DVT was more frequent in TKR (10/364; 2.7%) than in THR (10/436; 2.3%). Non-fatal pulmonary embolism occurred in four of the 20 patients with symptomatic DVT, two patients each of the stocking and no-stocking groups. The foot-pump discontinuation rate of patients treated with stockings was 7% versus 4% of the patients treated without stockings (p < 0.05). In conclusion, management of patients with foot pumps without GCS does not reduce the efficacy of DVT prophylaxis after THR and TKR and improves patient compliance.

DT Article

ID GAIT
AB Human gait optimality has been investigated recently, with the development of detailed musculoskeletal models, through trajectory optimization approaches or deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Trajectory optimization studies are limited by the trajectory length and can only generate open-loop solutions. While existing DRL solutions provide closed-loop control policies without trajectory length limit, they either do not evaluate the naturalness of the behaviour, or directly impose experimental tracking data. In this letter, a DRL-based approach is proposed with a nature-inspired curriculum learning (CL) scheme and a neuromechanically-inspired reward function. This approach generates close-to-natural human walking without the aid of experimental data. Our CL scheme is realized by an evolving reward function, targeting simpler behaviours such as standing and stepping first, then gradually refining the gait. The emerged gait from the closed-loop stochastic policy demonstrated a strong correlation with human gait kinematics, with Pearson correlations of 0.95 and 0.83 at the hip and knee, respectively, and higher gait symmetry than two other DRL-based control policies without CL. Our approach was also found to have efficient convergence to walking-capable policy. This approach can facilitate the development of assistive robotic systems by providing a "human" controller, and could enable decentralized adaptation between the agent and the assistive robotic devices.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on hydrophobicity, thermal stability of dentin collagen, and the influence of EGCG preconditioning on resin-dentin bonds.
   Methods: Coronal dentin specimens were sectioned to 0.7 mm or 2.5 mm from the dental pulp horn to simulate deep and shallow dentin. Static contact angle measurements on 0.005%, 0.02%, 0.1%, 0.5%EGCG preconditioned demineralized dentin were performed by contact angle analyzer. The collagen thermal denaturation temperature was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Resin-bonded specimens with/without EGCG preconditioning as well as thermocycling were created for microtensile bond strength evaluation. Confocal laser microscopy (CLSM) was used to evaluate the ultra-morphology and micropermeability of the resin-dentin interface after thermocycling.
   Results: Contact angle of demineralized dentin substrate increased after 0.02%/0.1%/0.5%EGCG preconditioning. Statistical analysis revealed that the effect of EGCG on shallow dentin was more evident than on deep dentin. The results of DSC demonstrated that 0.1%/0.5%EGCG strengthened collagen's resistance to thermal denaturing. 0.1%EGCG preconditioning group showed highest bond strength after thennocyling aging and exhibited least nanoleakage under CLSM examination. 0.5%EGCG preconditioning resulted in thinner hybrid layers. Meanwhile, bonding interface presented more nanoleakage in 0.5%EGCG group than in 0.1% EGCG preconditioning group.
   Conclusions: 0.1%EGCG preconditioning improved the hydrophobicity of dentin substrate and thermal stability of dentin collagen, which could reduce nanoleakage and enhance resin-dentin bond durability.

AB Inadequate delivery of therapeutics into tumors has been suggested as a reason for poor response. We hypothesize that bevacizumab, an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), can improve cetuximab uptake in squamous cell carcinoma tumors. Athymic nude mice were implanted with OSC19 and SCC1 human cancer lines in a subcutaneous flank model. Mice were imaged daily for 14days after intravenous tail vein injections of the following groups: IgG-IRDye800 (Control), cetuximab-IRDye800 (CTX800 Only), bevacizumab-IRDye800 (BVZ800 Only), cetuximab-IRDye800 + bevacuzimuab-IRDye800 (Simultaneous), and unlabeled bevacizumab followed by cetuximab-IRDye800 3days later (Neoadjuvant). Within single-agent groups, the CTX800 Only tumor-specific uptake (TSU) was significantly higher than BVZ800 Only at Day 13 (TSU 8.6vs 2.8, P < 0.001). The Simultaneous treatment with BVZ800 and CTX800 demonstrated no increase in antibody delivery. However, administration of unlabeled bevacizumab 3days prior to CTX800 (Neoadjuvant group) resulted in significantly higher tumor specific delivery than administration of both antibodies at the same time (11.8vs Simultaneous 5.0, P < 0.001). This difference can be attributed to a slower decline in tumor fluorescence intensity (-6.8% vs. Simultaneous -11.5% per day, respectively). Structural changes in pericyte coverage and functional vessel changes demonstrating decreased proliferation and tumor growth corroborate these fluorescence results. Although simultaneous administration of bevacizumab with cetuximab failed to increase antibody delivery to the tumor, pretreatment with bevacizumab improved TSU reflecting an increase in tumor-specific uptake of cetuximab as a result of vessel normalization.

AB Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulate colon cancer growth and metastasis. Previous studies utilizing antibodies against the VEGF receptor (DC101) or EGF receptor (C225) have demonstrated independently that these agents can inhibit tumour growth and induce apoptosis in colon cancer in in vivo and in vitro systems. We hypothesized that simultaneous blockade of the VEGF and EGF receptors would enhance the therapy of colon cancer in a mouse model of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Nude mice were given intraperitoneal injection of KM12L4 human colon cancer cells to generate peritoneal metastases. Mice were then randomized into one of four treatment groups: control, anti-VEGFR (DC101), anti-EGFR (C225), or DC101 and C225. Relative to the control group, treatment with DC101 or with DC101+C225 decreased tumour vascularity, growth, proliferation, formation of ascites and increased apoptosis of both tumour cells and endothelial cells. Although C225 therapy did not change any of the above parameters, C225 combined with DC101 led to a significant decrease in tumour vascularity and increases in tumour cell and endothelial cell apoptosis (vs the DC101 group). These findings suggest that DC101 inhibits angiogenesis, endothelial cell survival, and VEGF-mediated ascites formation in a murine model of colon cancer carcinomatosis. The addition of C225 to DC101 appears to lead to a further decrease in angiogenesis and ascites formation. Combination anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR therapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of colon peritoneal carcinomatosis.

ID PERFORMANCE; EXERCISE
AB Objective: To quantitatively measure the effects of caffeine and propranolol, a nonselective beta-blocking agent, on surgeon hand tremor during simulated vitreoretinal microsurgery.
   Methods: Seventeen ophthalmic surgeons were tested on 3 separate days. On each day, subjects ingested 200 mg of caffeine, 10 mg of,propranolol hydrochloride, or gelatin placebo. The drugs were administered as part of a double-masked, placebo-controlled trial. Hand tremor was measured using the Microsurgery Advanced Design Laboratory Stability, Activation, and Maneuverability tester (MADSAM), a high-resolution, noncontact position tracking system.
   Results: The average percent magnitude changes from baseline tremor measurements were +15%, +31%, and -22% for placebo, caffeine, and propranolol groups, respectively. Analysis of variance techniques accounting for effects of individuals, drugs, and day order demonstrated that only drug effects on percent magnitude change of tremor were statistically significant (P=.01, F test). Detailed comparisons of the 2 drug groups with the placebo group revealed that, after adjusting for individual and order effects, only the mean decrease in tremor due to ingestion of propranolol was a statistically significant trend (P=.03, F test). Although caffeine caused a larger mean increase in percent magnitude change in tremor than placebo, this trend was not statistically significant (P=.34, F test). The evaluation of systemic physiologic measurements showed that there were statistically significant drug effects on percent change in systolic (P<.001, F test) and diastolic (P=.002, F test) blood pressure and pulse rate (P=.002, F test). Individual and day order effects were not significant. No adverse side effects were observed or reported in our test subjects.
   Conclusion: Physiologic surgeon hand tremor can be decreased by the oral intake of a low dose of propranolol.

TI Calcium Carbonate for Elemental Lead Ingestions: Effect of
   Alkalinization on Elemental Lead Solubility in a Simulated Gastric

AB Introduction Acute ingestion of elemental lead foreign bodies has resulted in multiple pediatric deaths. Elemental lead is relatively insoluble at alkaline pH. Furthermore, calcium decreases lead absorption by interfering with the lead absorptive receptor. We hypothesize that alkalinization of gastric fluid with an oral calcium-containing agent, such as calcium carbonate, will decrease lead solubility, thus reducing the potential for systemic lead absorption and toxicity. Methods This was an in vitro controlled study. One lead sphere (00 buckshot, cast 30 days prior) was randomly placed in each of ten tubes containing 20 mL simulated gastric fluid, with five tubes having 500 mg calcium carbonate added at 20 min and 140 min. We measured the fluid pH and the lead concentrations hourly for 4 h. We compared the median amount of total lead liberated after 4 h between the two groups using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results The pH of the gastric fluid only tubes remained 1 at every measurement, and the pH of the gastric fluid + calcium carbonate tubes was 6 at every measurement. At hour 4, the total amount of lead liberated in the soluble fraction in the control group vs the calcium carbonate group was 850 vs 12.4 mcg (95% CI for absolute difference: 605-964 mcg; p = 0.0079). Conclusions Calcium carbonate antacid alkalinizes gastric fluid pH and dramatically decreases the total amount of solubilized lead by 60-fold. This project lends foundational evidence to a low-cost, widely available, pre-hospital strategy to decrease lead absorption after acute elemental lead ingestions.

ID RADIAL ARTERIAL-PRESSURE
AB Background: Noninvasive (NIBP) and intraarterial (ABP) blood pressure monitoring are used under different circumstances and may yield different values. The authors endeavored to characterize these differences and hypothesized that there could be differences in interventions associated with the use of ABP alone ([ABP]) versus ABP in combination with NIBP ([ABP + NIBP]).
   Methods: Simultaneous measurements of ABP and NIBP made during noncardiac cases were extracted from electronic anesthesia records; the differences were subjected to regression analysis. Records of blood products, vasopressors, and antihypertensives administered were also extracted, and associations between the use of these therapies and monitoring strategy ([ABP] vs. [ABP + NIBP]) were tested using univariate, multivariate, and propensity score matched analyses.
   Results: Among 24,225 cases, 63% and 37% used [ABP + NIBP] and [ABP], respectively. Systolic NIBP was likely to be higher than ABP when ABP was less than 111 mm Hg and lower than ABP otherwise. Among patients with hypotension, transfusion occurred in 27% versus 43% of patients in the [ABP + NIBP] versus [ABP] group, respectively (odds ratio = 0.4; 95% CI 0.35-0.46), and 7% versus 18% of patients in the [ABP + NIBP] versus [ABP] group received vasopressor infusions, respectively (P < 0.01). Among hypertensive patients, 12% versus 44% of those in the [ABP + NIBP] versus [ABP] group received antihypertensive agents, respectively (P < 0.01).
   Conclusions: NIBP was generally higher than ABP during periods of hypotension and lower than ABP during periods of hypertension. The use of NIBP measurements to supplement ABP measurements was associated with decreased use of blood transfusions, vasopressor infusions, and antihypertensive medications compared with the use of ABP alone.

AB Various studies have shown that in vitro production of cytokines by leukocytes from the newborn are normal, decreased, or increased. We investigated the blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) simultaneously to assess the cytokine response to systemic infection during the neonatal period. One or more cytokine levels were elevated in all of the newborns with sepsis. Serum TNF levels in the newborns with sepsis were significantly higher than the two control groups (P<0.002). Serum IL-6 levels in the study group were also found to be significantly higher than the control groups (P<0.0004 for sepsis vs adult controls and P<0.03 for sepsis vs newborn controls). We could not find statistically significant correlation between any of the cytokine levels, C-reactive protein, white blood cells, and platelet counts and the outcome. Gram-negative bacteria were the main causative agents in these patients, although one of them was infected with gram-positive bacteria, besides one premature infant (29 weeks) with Candida sepsis also had significantly elevated TNF, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 levels. Our data show that both mature and premature neonates were able to produce and significantly increase the blood levels of the cytokines in response to sepsis. Because the biologic relevance of cytokine levels is not known, further prospective and sequential studies on cytokine levels simultaneously and correlation with clinical parameters are needed to clarify the biological role of this important component of the host defense system.

AB Objectives: To identify the entropy levels that would correspond to bispectral index (BIS) levels in general anesthesia (GA) induction in patients who will undergo elective lumbar disc surgery (LDS).
   Methods: Thirty cases who underwent LDS under GA were included in our study after obtaining patient consent and approval of the Ethics Committee of Afyon Kocatepe University Medical School, Afyonkarahisar, Turkey, between January 01, 2004 to December 31, 2005. Bispectral index and entropy electrodes were applied at the same time to 30 cases in the study group. In order to assess the level of sedation during anesthesia and recovery, 'Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation' (OAA/S) scale was used. Bispectral index, state-entropy (SE), response-entropy (RE), and OAA/S values were recorded simultaneously.
   Results: Induction OAA/S scores were in correlation with BIS and entropy values (RE-SE) in 30 cases. A significant difference was found between BIS and entropy induction values (p=0.0398). Induction mean arterial pressure and heart rate values at 30, 60, 90, and 120 seconds were lower than the values of the control, which was statistically significant (p=0.0412).
   Conclusion: During the induction of GA, we found entropy values to be more sensitive and they demonstrated a more rapid increase than BIS. Therefore, it would be safer to monitor entropy while using agents of induction that might cause severe hypotension. Induction agents that might cause severe hypotension could be more safely administered under entropy monitoring.

AB Complex problems can be analyzed by using model simulation but its use is not straight-forward since modelers must carefully calibrate and validate their models before using them. This is specially relevant for models considering multiple outputs as its calibration requires handling different criteria jointly. This can be achieved using automated calibration and evolutionary multiobjective optimization methods which are the state of the art in multiobjective optimization as they can find a set of representative Pareto solutions under these restrictions and in a single run. However, selecting the best algorithm for performing automated calibration can be overwhelming. We propose to deal with this issue by conducting an exhaustive analysis of the performance of several evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms when calibrating several instances of an agent-based model for marketing with multiple outputs. We analyze the calibration results using multiobjective performance indicators and attainment surfaces, including a statistical test for studying the significance of the indicator values, and benchmarking their performance with respect to a classical mathematical method. The results of our experimentation reflect that those algorithms based on decomposition perform significantly better than the remaining methods in most instances. Besides, we also identify how different properties of the problem instances (i.e., the shape of the feasible region, the shape of the Pareto front, and the increased dimensionality) erode the behavior of the algorithms to different degrees.

AB Ligand-based and structure-based methods were applied in combination to exploit the physicochemical properties of 2,3-dideoxy hex-2-enopyranosid-4-uloses against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. Statistically valid 3D-QSAR models with good correlation and predictive power were obtained with CoMFA steric and electrostatic fields (r(2) = 0.797, q(2) = 0.589) and CoMSIA with combined steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond acceptor fields (r(2) = 0.867, q(2) = 0.570) based on training set of 33 molecules with predictive r(2) of 0.808 and 0.890 for CoMFA and CoMSIA respectively. The results illustrate the requirement of optimal alkyl chain length at C-1 position and acceptor groups along hydroxy methyl substituent of C-6 to enhance the anti-tubercular activity of the 2,3-dideoxy hex-2-enopyranosid-4-uloses while any substitution at C-3 position exert diminishing effect on anti-tubercular activity of these enulosides. Further, homology modeling of Mycobacterium tuberculosis alpha-mannosidase followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations on co-complexed models were performed to gain insight into the rationale for binding affinity of selected inhibitors with the target of interest. The comprehensive information obtained from this study will help to better understand the structural basis of biological activity of this class of molecules and guide further design of more potent analogues as anti-tubercular agents.

AB A novel agent-based financial dynamics is established based on the percolation system on Sierpinski gasket lattice to reproduce the statistical characteristics of financial markets. Sierpinski gasket lattice is a fractal-like graph which corresponds to the fractal well-known Sierpinski gasket. Modeling a financial dynamics on Sierpinski gasket lattice is a new approach in financial micro-mechanism construction. In an attempt to investigate the statistical properties of returns and prove the feasibility of the proposed model, two new nonlinear statistics maximum and average monotonous volatility duration are introduced in this work for the first time, which describe the trend of volatility of return time series in financial markets. Furthermore, a new method CMCID is proposed to measure the synchronization and similarity behaviors of return volatility duration in multiscale, the results show that the pairs of real data and simulated data have synchronization, and the synchronization becomes stronger when the scale increases And the power-law distribution is employed to investigate the corresponding statistical properties, which shows that the proposed model shares a common power-law distribution with regard to monotonous volatility duration. The empirical results show that the simulated series from the financial model and the historical data share common statistical properties, which indicate that the proposed model is reasonable in terms of volatility behavior.

AB Purpose - The learning ability on critical bargaining information contributes to accelerating construction claim negotiations in the win-win situation. The purpose of this paper is to study how to apply Zeuthen strategy and Bayesian learning to simulate the dynamic bargaining process of claim negotiations with the consideration of discount factor and risk attitude.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors first adopted certainty equivalent method and curve fitting to build a party's own curve utility function. Taking the opponent's bottom line as the learning goal, the authors introduced Bayesian learning to refine former predicted linear utility function of the opponent according to every new counteroffer. Both parties' utility functions were revised by taking discount factors into consideration. Accordingly, the authors developed a bilateral learning model in construction claim negotiations based on Zeuthen strategy.
   Findings - The consistency of Zeuthen strategy and the Nash bargaining solution model guarantees the effectiveness of the bilateral learning model. Moreover, the illustrative example verifies the feasibility of this model.
   Research limitations/implications - As the authors developed the bilateral learning model by mathematical deduction, scholars are expected to collect empirical cases and compare actual solutions and model solutions in order to modify the model in future studies.
   Practical implications - Negotiators could refer to this model to make offers dynamically, which is favorable for the parties to reach an agreement quickly and to avoid the escalation of claims into disputes.
   Originality/value - The proposed model provides a supplement to the existing studies on dynamic construction claim negotiations.

AB Anisotropic colloidal hybrid nanoparticles exhibit superior optical and physical properties compared to their counterparts with regular architectures. We herein developed a controlled, stepwise strategy to build novel, anisotropic, branched, gold nanoarchitectures (Au-tripods) with predetermined composition and morphology for bioimaging. The resultant Au-tripods with size less than 20 nm showed great promise as contrast agents for in vivo photoacoustic imaging (PAT). We further identified Au-tripods with two possible configurations as high-absorbance nanomaterials from various gold multipods using a numerical simulation analysis. The PAT signals were linearly correlated with their concentrations after subcutaneous injection. The in vivo biodistribution of Au-tripods favorable for molecular imaging was confirmed using small animal positron emission tomography (PET). Intravenous administration of cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Phe-Cys (RGDfC) peptide conjugated Au-tripods (RGD-Au-tripods) to U87MG tumor-bearing mice showed PAL contrasts in tumors almost 3-fold higher than for the blocking group. PAT results correlated well with the corresponding PET images. Quantitative biodistribution data revealed that 7.9% ID/g of RGD-Au-tripods had accumulated in the U87MG tumor after 24 h post-injection. A pilot mouse toxicology study confirmed that no evidence of significant acute or systemic toxicity was observed in histopathological examination. Our study suggests that Au-tripods can be reliably synthesized through stringently controlled chemical synthesis and could serve as a new generation of platform with high selectivity and sensitivity for multimodality molecular imaging.

AB Multiple methods for investigating cell invasion behavior in vitro have proven useful in exploring the mechanisms behind the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and EMT-related tumor cell invasion, for example, by revealing that cell heterogeneity existed in EMT. However, several hypotheses and predictions regarding EMT heterogeneity have remained unproven because of the inability to quantitatively profile cell invasion at the single cell level. Here, we present a microfluidic chip that provides the capability of simultaneously investigating single cell invasion behavior, phenotypic diversity, and responsiveness to anti invasion drugs. By assessing single cell invasion behavior in separate wells, cell cell contacts and their corresponding interference in the invasion process could be excluded. The chip allowed for both precise quantitation of cell invasion and in situ phenotyping, such that any single cell heterogeneity could be detected and accurately quantified. This study has proven that the proposed hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal cell phenotype exists and is important in the EMT process. The invasion abilities of two cell lines were also assessed, either with or without EMT-promoting or EMT-inhibiting agents, proving that the chip can also be used to assess the effectiveness of antimetastatic agents. This study has demonstrated that the strategy of isolating single cells before studying their invasive properties is correct and that it provides an in vitro method for understanding cell heterogeneity during EMT. This approach also provides a mean of screening for anti-invasion agents that are focused on single cell invasion, a process known to be important for blood-borne metastasis to occur.

AB In this work, we have developed numerical simulations and weakly nonlinear analysis based on the multiple-scales perturbation technique for a coated microbubble that performs radial pulsations subject to an acoustic pressure disturbance in the far-field and whose encapsulated hyperelastic material obeys the Mooney-Rivlin equation. Departing from an elastic coating as a hyperelastic shell of finite thickness, we assume eventually that the shell is of very small thickness in comparison with the microbubble radius. Under this condition, we then perform weakly nonlinear analysis, to identify resonance conditions for small pressure disturbances of the acoustic field. In parallel and also for the limit of small thickness, we have carried out numerical simulations of the radial motion of the microbubble, identifying the onset of limit cycles via the construction of Poincare maps. Under both schemes, we have recognized the importance of two dimensionless hyperelastic parameters that dictate the main behavior of the oscillations: and. Decreasing the values of these parameters, the resonance conditions are drastically amplified, which is an expected result because of the weak rigidity of the hyperelastic solid, prevails. In this manner, we suggest that moderate values for these previous parameters can be widely advisable when, in medical diagnostic applications, we are applying microbubbles as contrast agents. Therefore, we recommend widely the use of shell softens, because in this case the amplitude of radial pulsation is always amplified.

AB Money is a fundamental and ubiquitous institution in modern economies. However, the question of its emergence remains a central one for economists. The monetary search-theoretic approach studies the conditions under which commodity money emerges as a solution to override frictions inherent to interindividual exchanges in a decentralized economy. Although among these conditions, agents' rationality is classically essential and a prerequisite to any theoretical monetary equilibrium, human subjects often fail to adopt optimal strategies in tasks implementing a search-theoretic paradigm when these strategies are speculative, i.e., involve the use of a costly medium of exchange to increase the probability of subsequent and successful trades. In the present work, we hypothesize that implementing such speculative behaviors relies on reinforcement learning instead of lifetime utility calculations, as supposed by classical economic theory. To test this hypothesis, we operationalized the Kiyotaki and Wright paradigm of money emergence in a multistep exchange task and fitted behavioral data regarding human subjects performing this task with two reinforcement learning models. Each of them implements a distinct cognitive hypothesis regarding the weight of future or counterfactual rewards in current decisions. We found that both models outperformed theoretical predictions about subjects' behaviors regarding the implementation of speculative strategies and that the latter relies on the degree of the opportunity costs consideration in the learning process. Speculating about the marketability advantage of money thus seems to depend on mental simulations of counterfactual events that agents are performing in exchange situations.

AB Humans are inherently social beings that benefit from their perceptional capability to embody another point of view, typically referred to as perspective taking. Perspective taking is an essential feature in our daily interactions and is pivotal for human development. However, much remains unknown about the precise mechanisms that underlie perspective taking. Here, we show that formalizing perspective taking in a computational model can detail the embodied mechanisms employed by humans in perspective taking. The model's main building block is a set of action primitives that are passed through a forward model. The model employs a process that selects a subset of action primitives to be passed through the forward model to reduce the response time. The model demonstrates the results that mimic those captured by human data, including response times differences caused by the angular disparity between the perspective-taker and the other agent, the impact of task-irrelevant body posture variations in perspective taking, and differences in the perspective taking strategy between individuals. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that perspective taking is a mental simulation of the physical movements that are required to match another person's visual viewpoint. Furthermore, the model provides several testable predictions, including the prediction that forced early responses lead to an egocentric bias and that a selection process introduces dependencies between two consecutive trials. Our results indicate potential links between perspective taking and other essential perceptional and cognitive mechanisms, such as active vision and autobiographical memories.

AB Adaptation to their environment is a fundamental capability for living agents, from which autonomous robots could also benefit. This work proposes a connectionist architecture, DRAMA, for dynamic control and learning of autonomous robots. DRAMA stands for dynamical recurrent associative memory architecture. It is a time-delay recurrent neural network, using Hebbian update rules. It allows learning of spatio-temporal regularities and time series in discrete sequences of inputs, in the face of an important amount of noise. The first part of this paper gives the mathematical description of the architecture and analyses theoretically and through numerical simulations its performance. The second part of this paper reports on the implementation of DRAMA in simulated and physical robotic experiments. Training and rehearsal of the DRAMA architecture is computationally fast and inexpensive, which makes the model particularly suitable for controlling 'computationally-challenged' robots. In the experiments, ave use a basic hardware system with very limited computational capability and show that our robot can carry out real time computation and on-line learning of relatively complex cognitive tasks. In these experiments, two autonomous robots wander randomly in a fixed environment, collecting information about its elements. By mutually associating information of their sensors and actuators, they learn about physical regularities underlying their experience of varying stimuli. The agents learn also from their mutual interactions. We use a teacher-learner scenario, based on mutual following of the two agents, to enable transmission of a vocabulary from one robot to the other.

AB In this paper we present a method to analyse data from observed population statistics in order to create a stylised location typology based on household profiles (microgeographic level). The household profiles are used to inform the development of rules for an agent-based model of residential population mobility. The method is demonstrated with the 2001 Population Census data for East Anglia, UK. Household profiles are derived from a principal components analysis to reduce dimensionality in the census data combined with a cluster analysis to aggregate the observations. We test whether a range of household archetypes that link specific locations to specific profiles can be identified simultaneously at both mesogeographic and macrogeographic levels. Results reaffirm conventional archetypes: single people concentrate in city centres, families mainly locate in the suburbs and periurban areas, and retirees are more prevalent in the suburbs and close to the coast. Surprisingly, however, there is a clear distinction between locations with cohabiting couples (located at the fringe of the periurban areas) and locations with married couples (located in the countryside). The observed spatial distributions reveal different location choices between different household profiles. Identification of these household profiles supports the development of residential mobility models that may be used to explore regional and local planning issues with respect to future population projections and environmental change.

CT 2nd Conference on Economics
CY JUN 23-24, 1997
CL BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA
AB This paper deals with an old theme in macroeconomic analysis: the link between aggregate fluctuations and intertemporal coordination problems. We start with the observation that. sometimes, economic growth processes show signs of discontinuity (in either direction), forcing agents to learn abet a new environment. In turn, changes in expectations about future growth influence current decisions on spending, production and the supply of credit. In some conditions, revisions of beliefs induced by news about growth prospects can bring about macroeconomic oscillations. This is illustrated with a simple model, with points in common with those typical in the literature on real cycles in intertemporally coordinated open economies. However, rye do not postulate that agents automatically know the processes generating the relevant variables. Instead, we try to represent the learning dynamics, through schemes where agents revise adaptively their estimates of the parameters of a functions describing the trend behavior of output. The simulations of the model show that, after a permanent upward shock to the productivity of the economy, the transitional dynamics can indeed be cyclical, and in some cases there can be an over-expansion in aggregate demand, which must eventually be corrected. We also discuss extensions that incorporate the evolution of the real exchange rate and the supply of credit. In an empirical section, we analyze a recursive estimation of the growth in the output of traded goods in Argentina, The results indicate that the forecasts of future output based on that estimation have changed considerably in recent years (with an upward shift in 1991), suggesting that large movements in wealth perceptions took place in the period.

TI Neighbourhood food, physical activity, and educational environments and

DE OBESITY; EDUCATION; PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY
ID SCHOOL QUALITY; ADULTS
AB Background Multiple approaches that can contribute to reducing obesity have been proposed. These policies may share overlapping pathways, and may have unanticipated consequences, creating considerable complexity. Aiming to illuminate the use of agent-based models to explore the consequences of key policies, this paper simulates the effects of increasing neighbourhood availability of good food stores, physical activity infrastructure and higher school quality on the reduction of black/white disparities in body mass index (BMI) in the USA.
   Methods We used an agent-based model, with parameters derived from the empirical literature, which included individual and neighbourhood characteristics over the life course as determinants of behaviours thought to impact BMI. We systematically varied the strength of the 3 policy interventions, examining the impact of 125 different policy scenarios on black/white BMI disparities.
   Results In the absence of any of these policies, black/white BMI disparities generally increased over time. However, we found that some combinations of these policies resulted in reductions in BMI, yielding decreases in the black/white BMI disparity as large as a 90%.
   Conclusions Within the structure of relationships captured in this simulation model, there is support for the further use of agent-based simulation models to explore upstream policies as plausible candidates for the reduction of black/white disparities in BMI. These results highlight the potential insights into important public health problems, such as obesity, that can come from uniting the systems science approach with policy analysis.

AB Variation in behaviour among group members often impacts collective outcomes. Individuals may vary both in the task that they perform and in the persistence with which they perform each task. Although both the distribution of individuals among tasks and differences among individuals in behavioural persistence can each impact collective behaviour, we do not know if and how they jointly affect collective outcomes. Here, we use a detailed computational model to examine the joint impact of colony-level distribution among tasks and behavioural persistence of individuals, specifically their fidelity to particular resource sites, on the collective trade-off between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar ones. We developed an agent-based model of foraging honeybees, parametrized by data from five colonies, in whichwe simulated scouts, who search the environment for new resources, and individuals who are recruited by the scouts to the newly found resources, i.e. recruits. We varied the persistence of returning to a particular food source of both scouts and recruits and found that, for each value of persistence, there is a different optimal ratio of scouts to recruits that maximizes resource collection by the colony. Furthermore, changes to the persistence of scouts induced opposite effects from changes to the persistence of recruits on the collective foraging of the colony. The proportion of scouts that resulted in the most resources collected by the colony decreased as the persistence of recruits increased. However, this optimal proportion of scouts increased as the persistence of scouts increased. Thus, behavioural persistence and task participation can interact to impact a colony's collective behaviour in orthogonal directions. Our work provides new insights and generates new hypotheses into how variations in behaviour at both the individual and colony levels jointly impact the trade-off between exploring for new resources and exploiting familiar ones.

AB Novel agroformulations for simultaneous delivery of chemical and biologically active agents to the plants were prepared by encapsulation of Trichoderma viride spores in calcium alginate microspheres. The impact of calcium ions concentration on the viability and sporulation of T. viride spores as well as on the microsphere important physicochemical properties were investigated. Intermolecular interactions in microspheres are complex including mainly hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. T. viride germination inside matrix and germ tubes penetration out of microspheres revealed calcium alginate microspheres provide a supportive environment for T. viride growth. Differences in physicochemical properties and bioactive agents release behaviour from microspheres were ascribed to the changes in microsphere structure. Fitting to KorsmeyerPeppas empirical model revealed the underlying T. viride release mechanism as anomalous transport kinetics (a combination of two diffusion mechanisms and the Type II transport (polymer swelling and relaxation of the polymeric matrix)). The increasing amount of T. viride spores in the surrounding medium is closely related to the release from microspheres and germination. The rate controlling mechanism of calcium release is Fickian diffusion. A decrease in the release rate with increasing calcium ion concentrations is in accordance with the calcium ions effect on the strength of the alginate network structure. T. viride germination inside microsphere diminished the amount of released calcium ions and slowed release kinetics in comparison with microspheres prepared without T. viride. The results indicated investigated agroformulations have a great potential to be used for plant protection and nutrition.

AB Hypothesis: Droplet size in microfluidic devices is affected by wettability of the microfluidic channels. Three-dimensional countercurrent flow focusing using assemblies of chemically inert glass capillaries is expected to minimize wetting of the channel walls by the organic solvent.
   Experiments: Monodispersed polycaprolactone and poly(lactic acid) particles with a diameter of 18-150 mu m were produced by evaporation of solvent (dichloromethane or 1:2 mixture of chloroform and toluene) from oil-in-water or water-in-oil-in-water emulsions produced in three-dimensional flow focusing glass capillary devices. The drop generation behaviour was simulated numerically using the volume of fluid method.
   Findings: The numerical results showed good agreement with high-speed video recordings. Monodispersed droplets were produced in the dripping regime when the ratio of the continuous phase flow rate to dispersed phase flow rate was 5-20 and the Weber number of the dispersed phase was less than 0.01. The porosity of polycaprolactone particles increased from 8 to 62% when 30 wt% of the water phase was incorporated in the organic phase prior to emulsification. The inner water phase was loaded with 0.156 wt% lidocaine hydrochloride to achieve a sustained drug release. 26% of lidocaine was released after 1 h and more than 93% of the drug was released after 130 h.

AB Purpose: To test the hypothesis that the type of cement used for fixation of cast dowel-and-cores might influence fracture resistance, fracture mode, and stress distribution of single-rooted teeth restored with this class of metallic dowels.
   Materials and Methods: The coronal portion was removed from 40 bovine incisors, leaving a 15 mm root. After endodontic treatment and standardized root canal relief at 10 mm, specimens were embedded in polystyrene resin, and the periodontal ligament was simulated with polyether impression material. The specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10), and restored with Cu-Al cast dowel-and-cores cemented with one of four options: conventional glass ionomer cement (GI); resin-modified glass ionomer cement (GR); dual-cure resin cement (RC); or zinc-phosphate cement (ZP). Sequentially, fracture resistance of the specimens was tested with a tangential load at a 135 degrees. angle with a 0.5 mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Fisher test. Two-dimensional finite element analysis (2D-FEA) was then performed with representative models of each group simulating a 100 mu m cement layer.
   Results were analyzed based on von Mises stress distribution criteria. Results: The mean fracture resistance values were (in N): RC, 838.2 +/- 135.9; GI, 772.4 +/- 169.8; GR, 613.4 +/- 157.5; ZP, 643.6 +/- 106.7. FEA revealed that RC and GR presented lower stress values than ZP and GI. The higher stress concentration was coincident with more catastrophic failures, and consequently, with lower fracture resistance values.
   Conclusions: The type of cement influenced fracture resistance, failure mode, and stress distribution on teeth restored with cast dowel-and-cores.

AB Residual shear strength is an essential parameter in evaluating the long-term stability of reactivated landslides in geotechnical engineering. According to previous studies, earthquake-induced landslides may occur on discontinuous planes, such as bedding planes, between weathered and unweathered mudstones having different cementation properties resulting from diagenesis. However, the shear behaviour at the contact surfaces between the cemented and the non-cemented soil layers has not yet been sufficiently investigated. The objective of this study is to elucidate the residual strength characteristics of artificial bedding planes that model the actual behaviour of slip surfaces occurring between two layers with different degrees of cementation. The experimental tests were conducted with a ring shear test apparatus. Additionally, in order to simulate the realistic mechanical behaviour of naturally cemented clay, artificial cementation bonds were created by adding a cementing agent at different ratios to clay slurry. A series of ring shear tests was performed under various conditions on one-layer non-cemented and cemented kaolin samples, respectively, as well as on two-layer specimens composed of one layer each of cemented kaolin and non-cemented kaolin. The test results showed that the residual friction angle of the two-layer combinations of non-cemented and cemented kaolin was approximately 33.6% lower than that of pure kaolin. In contrast, the residual friction angle of cemented kaolin may be as much as 6.2(0) greater than that of non-cementedkaolin. At cement ratios of up to 2%, the stress ratio of cemented kaolin increased as the shear displacement rate increased. As the cement content was increased beyond 2%, the degree of increase was not significant. These results suggest that the residual strength of cemented kaolin at cement contents greater than 2% is independent of the shear rate.

AB The modern blast furnace operation at integrated steel works in Japan has started in 1901 by the first blown-in of Higashida No. 1 blast furnace in Yawata Works, while a 150 years history of Japanese steel industry has dated back to the first western blast furnace built by T. Ohashi in 1857. The steel industry has been supporting the Japanese economy as a key industry which supplies base materials for social infrastructure and developments throughout the pre and post war periods.
   After the recovery period from the war destruction, Chiba Works of Kawasaki Steel Corp., were built and started its operation in 1953 as the first integrated steel works in Keiyo Industrial Region after the war. During the rapid growth period, many coastal steel works equipped with a large blast furnace more than 3000m(3) and some of 5000m(3) were built for the efficient marine transportation of raw materials and steel products. Most advanced technologies, high pressure equipment, stave cooler system and bell-less charging system etc., were introduced, improved and has risen to the top level in the world with low reducing agent ratio (RAP.), energy saving and long service life of a blast furnace and coke ovens.
   Energy shift from oil to coal by the oil crisis, cost oriented operation design and technology were tackled and the hot metal of about 80 million tons is manufactured with 27 blast furnaces including over 5000m(3) large scale blast furnaces in 2012. During this period, our industry has faced many economical and social pressures of high exchange rate of yen, oligopoly of mining market, global warming problem, and surge of iron ore and coal prices by the rapid growth of the BRICs. We have kept our competitive positions by developing advanced technologies on pulverized coal injection, extended use of low cost iron resources, recycling for environment and CO2 mitigation technologies.
   Prospects of ironmaking technologies for other decades are discussed by reviewing various papers published and looking back the history of ironmaking developments during the last 100 years.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of ultrasound-mediated analyte diffusion on permeability of normal, benign, and cancerous human lung tissue in vitro and to find more effective sonophoretic (SP) delivery in combination with the optical clearing agents (OCAs) method to distinguish normal and diseased lung tissues. The permeability coefficients of SP in combination with OCAs diffusion in lung tissue were measured with Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT). 30% glucose and SP with a frequency of 1 MHz and an intensity of 0.80 W/cm(2) over a 3 cm probe was simultaneously applied for 15 min. Experimental results show that the mean permeability coefficients of 30% glucose/SP were found to be (2.01 +/- 0.21) x 10(-5) cm/s from normal lung (NL) tissue, (2.75 +/- 0.28) x 10(-5) cm/s from lung benign granulomatosis (LBG) tissue, (4.53 +/- 0.49) x 10(-5) cm/s from lung adenocarcinoma tumor (LAT) tissue, and (5.81 +/- 0.62) x 10(-5) cm/s from lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) tissue, respectively. The permeability coefficients of 30% glucose/SP increase approximately 36.8%, 125.4%, and 189.1% for the LBG, LAT, and LSCC tissue compared with that for the NL tissue, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in permeability coefficients of 30% glucose/SP between LBG and NL tissue (p < 0.05), between LAT and NL tissue (p < 0.05), and between LSCC and NL tissue (p < 0.05). The results suggest that the OCT functional imaging technique to combine an ultrasound-OCAs combination method could become a powerful tool in early diagnosis and monitoring of changed microstructure of pathologic human lung tissue.

TI Learning action-oriented models through active inference
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE; PERCEPTION; ENACTIVISM; BRAIN
AB Author summary
   Within the popular framework of 'active inference', organisms learn internal models of their environments and use the models to guide goal-directed behaviour. A challenge for this framework is to explain how such models can be learned in practice, given (i) the rich complexity of natural environments, and (ii) the circular dependence of model learning and sensory sampling, which may lead to behaviourally suboptimal models being learned. Here, we develop an approach in which organisms selectively model those aspects of the environment that are relevant for acting in a goal-directed manner. Learning such 'action-oriented' models requires that agents balance information-seeking and goal-directed actions in a principled manner, such that both learning and information seeking are contextualised by goals. Using a combination of theory and simulation modelling, we show that this approach allows simple but effective models to be learned from relatively few interactions with the environment. Crucially, our results suggest that action-oriented models can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from accurate representations of the environment.
   Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, action-oriented models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a bad-bootstrap. Here, we exploit the normative framework of active inference to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (information-seeking) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.

AB N-alpha-t-Butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-amino acids (X-aa = Gly, Ala, or beta-Ala) were reacted with the cellulose hydroxyl groups (O-acylation) using N,N'-carbonyl diimidazole. The degrees of substitution toward the total hydroxyl groups (DS%(/OH)s) were 38% for O-(Boc-Gly)-Cellulose, 29% for O-(Boc-Ala)-Cellulose and 53% for O-(Boc-beta-Ala)-Cellulose. The one-by-one N-acylation between the O-(X-aa)-Celluloses and Boc-Ala-Gly using a water-soluble carbodiimide yielded the conjugates N-(Boc-Ala-Gly)-X-aa-Celluloses with DS%(/NH2) values of 25% (X-aa = Gly), 35% (Ala), and 48% (beta-Ala), respectively. The results were well correlated with Delta G and Delta E-strain profiles, which were predicted by semi-empirical thermochemical parameter calculation coupled with conformer search (R-2>0.90). N-Acylation of the O-(beta-Ala)-Cellulose using various length of oligo-peptides, Boc-(Ala-Gly)(n) and Boc-(Gly-Ala)(n) (where, n = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0), suggested that the DS%(/NH2) was dependent on the structural features of the symmetric anhydrides as the N-acylating agents, including conformer populations and their transition energy.

AB Spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia species are etiologic agents of a wide range of human infections from asymptomatic or mild infections to severe, life-threatening disease. In the United States, recent passive surveillance for SFG rickettsiosis shows an increased incidence and decreased severity of reported cases. The reasons for this are not well understood; however, we hypothesize that less pathogenic rickettsiae are causing more human infections, while the incidence of disease caused by more pathogenic rickettsiae, particularly Rickettsia rickettsii, is relatively stable. During the same period, the range of Amblyomma americanum has expanded. Amblyomma americanum is frequently infected with "Candidatus Rickettsia amblyommii", a SFG Rickettsia of unknown pathogenicity. We tested our hypothesis by modeling incidence rates from 1993 to 2013, hospitalization rates from 1981 to 2013, and case fatality rates from 1981 to 2013 regressed against the presence of A. americanum, the decade of onset of symptoms, and the county of residence. Our results support the hypothesis, and we show that the expanding range of A. americanum is associated with changes in epidemiology reported through passive surveillance. We believe epidemiological and acarological data collected on individual cases from enhanced surveillance may further elucidate the reasons for the changing epidemiology of SFG rickettsiosis.

AB A high percentage of people treated with a long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy suffer NSAID-induced gastrointestinal-tract-related side effects. A current hypothesis states that the side effects are related to the topical action of NSAID molecules on gastric mucus that lowers its resistance to luminal acid. The main lipids in human mucus are palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) and cholesterol (Chol). In this study, both X-ray diffraction and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation methods were employed to investigate the effects of selected NSAIDs in protonated and deprotonated states on the structural parameters of a POPC-Chol bilayer. The drugs were three commonly used NSAIDs with apparently different gastric toxicity: ketoprofen (KET), aspirin (ASP), and piroxicam (PXM). Both methods revealed that the effects of the NSAIDs on the POPC-Chol bilayer parameters were moderate and only slightly differentiated among the drugs. Much larger differences among the drugs were noticed in their interactions with interfacial water and Na+ as well as with the polar groups of POPC and Chol, mainly via H-bonds. Of the three NSAIDs, KET interacted with POPC and water the most extensively, whereas ASP interacted with Chol and Na+ more than did the other two. Interactions of PXM with POPC and Chol polar groups as well as with water and Na+ were limited.

AB Spatially synchronous population dynamics have been documented in many taxa. The prevailing view is that the most plausible candidates to explain this pattern are extrinsic disturbances (the Moran effect) and dispersal. In most cases disentangling these factors is difficult. Theoretical studies have shown that dispersal between subpopulations is more likely to produce a negative relationship between population synchrony and distance between the patches than perturbations. As analyses of empirical data frequently show this negative relationship between the level of synchrony and distance between populations, this has emphasized the: importance of dispersal as a synchronizing agent. However, several weather patterns show spatial autocorrelation, which could potentially produce patterns in population synchrony similar to those caused by dispersal. By using spatially extended versions of several population dynamic models, we show that this is indeed the case. Our results show that, especially when both factors (spatially autocorrelated perturbations and distance-dependent dispersal) act together, there may exist groups of local populations in synchrony together but fluctuating asynchronously with some other groups of local populations. We also show, by analysing 56 long-term population data sets, that patterns of population synchrony similar to those found in our simulations are found in natural populations as well. This finding highlights the subtlety in the interactions of dispersal and noise in organizing spatial patterns in population fluctuations.

AB Meropenem is a broad-spectrum carbapenem antibacterial agent. In order to optimize levels in plasma relative to the MICs, the ideal dose level and dosage regimen need to be determined. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem were studied in two groups, each comprising eight healthy volunteers who received the following doses: 500 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 min three times a day (t.i.d.) versus a 250-mg loading dose followed by a 1,500 mg continuous infusion over 24 h for group A and 1,000 mg as an intravenous infusion over 30 min t.i.d. versus a 500-mg loading dose followed by a 3,000-mg continuous infusion over 24 h for group B. Meropenem concentrations in plasma and urine were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection, respectively. Pharmacokinetic calculations were done by use of a two-compartment open model, and the data were extrapolated by Monte Carlo simulations for 10,000 simulated subjects for pharmacodynamic evaluation. There were no significant differences in total clearance and renal clearance between group A and group B or between the intermittent treatment and the continuous infusion. The analyses of the probability of target attainment by MIC for the high- and low-dose continuous infusions were robust up to MICs of 4 mg/liter and 2 mg/liter, respectively. The corresponding values for intermittent infusions were only 0.5 mg/liter and 0.25 mg/liter. When these observations were correlated with MICs obtained from the MYSTIC database, intermittent infusion results in adequate activity against two of the most common nosocomially acquired pathogens, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. However, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the evaluation shows a clear advantage of high-dose therapy administered as a continuous infusion. We believe that in the empirical therapy situation, the continuous-infusion mode of administration is most worth the extra efforts. We conclude that clinical trials for evaluation of the continuous infusions of meropenem in critically ill patients are warranted.

AB Stents are used in interventional cardiology to keep a diseased vessel open. New stents are coated with a medicinal agent to prevent early reclosure due to the proliferation of smooth muscle cells. It is recognized that it is the dose of the agent that effectively controls the cells in the wall of the vessel. This paper focuses on the effect of the number of struts and the ratio between the coated area of the struts and the targeted area of the vessel on the design problem under set therapeutic bounds on the dose. It introduces mathematical models of the dose for a zero-thickness periodic stent and an asymptotic stent that will play a central role in our analysis. Theoretical and numerical results are presented along with their impact on the design process.

AB Agriculture is a largely technical endeavour involving complicated managerial decision-making that affects crop performance. Farm-level modelling integrates crop models with agent behaviour to account for farmer decision-making and complete the representation of agricultural systems. To replicate an important part of agriculture in Central Europe a crop model was calibrated for a unique region's predominant crops: winter wheat, winter and spring barley, silage maize and winter rapeseed. Their cultivation was then simulated over multiple decades at daily resolution to test validity and stability, while adding the dimension of agent behaviour in relation to environmental and economic conditions. After validation against regional statistics, simulated future weather scenarios were used to forecast crop management and performance under anticipated global change. Farm management and crop genetics were treated as adaptive variables in the milieu of shifting climatic conditions to allow projections of agriculture in the study region into the coming decades.

AB The behavior of boundedly rational agents in two interacting markets is investigated. A discrete-time model of coupled financial and consumer markets is described. The integrated model consists of heterogenous consumers, financial traders, and production firms. The production firms operate in the consumer market, and offer their shares to be traded on the financial market. The model is validated by comparing its output to known empirical properties of real markets. In order to better explore the influence of model parameters on behavior, a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo method is introduced. This method allows for the efficient exploration of large parameter spaces, in order to find which parameter regimes lead to reproduction of empirical phenomena. It is shown that the integrated markets model can reproduce a number of empirical "stylized facts", including learning-by-doing effects, fundamental price effects, low autocorrelations, volatility clustering, high kurtosis, and volatility-volume correlations.

AB Oral mucositis is a frequent complication of radiochemotherapy. The origin of radiation-induced mucosal lesions is iatrogenic in nature, although further development of mucositis is essentially influenced by infection. It can be assumed that disinfection measures should decrease the severity of mucositis induced by radiochemotherapy, Therefore, in a prospective randomised study the efficacy of prophylactic oral rinsing with a disinfection agent was investigated. A randomised, prospective comparative trial was conducted with 40 patients undergoing radiochemotherapy of the head and neck region because of malignant disease. The treatment scheme consisted of irradiation to the tumour region and adjacent lymph nodes, with a total dose of 71.3 Gy, and simultaneous chemotherapy with carboplatin (60 mg/m(2)) on days 1-5 and 29-34. In all patients mucositis prophylaxis with nystatin, rutosides, panthenol and immunoglobulin was undertaken. In addition, 20 patients rinsed the oral cavity 4 times daily with povidone-iodine solution, while the group for comparison rinsed with sterile water, Clinical examination of the oral mucosa was performed weekly, Onset, grading and duration of mucositis were used as the main variables. Clinically manifest oral mucositis was observed in 14 patients in the iodine group (mean grading: 1.0) and in all 20 patients in the control group (mean grading: 3,0), The total duration (mean) of clinically observed mucositis was 2.75 weeks in treatment patients and 9.25 weeks in control patients. Median AUC (area under curve for grade vs duration) was 2.5 in the iodine rinsing patients and 15.75 in control patients. All differences found between the two groups were statistically significant, Increased iodine incorporation was not observed. A pathologic rise in thyroid hormone levels was not found in the iodine group. The results obtained indicate that in and duration of radiochemotherapy-induced mucositis can be significantly reduced by oral rinsing with povidone-iodine in addition to the standard prophylaxis scheme, It can be concluded that rinsing with povidone-iodine is an easy, cheap and safe prophylactic method and can be recommended as a supportive treatment during antineoplastic treatment of the head and neck region.

AB In this study we present a combined optical sizing and acoustical characterization technique for the study of the dynamics of single freely-floating ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles exposed to long burst ultrasound excitations up to the milliseconds range. A co-axial flow device was used to position individual microbubbles on a streamline within the confocal region of three ultrasound transducers and a high-resolution microscope objective. Bright-field images of microbubbles passing through the confocal region were captured using a high-speed camera synchronized to the acoustical data acquisition to assess the microbubble response to a 1-MHz ultrasound burst. Nonlinear bubble vibrations were identified at a driving pressure as low as 50 kPa. The results demonstrate good agreement with numerical simulations based on the shell-buckling model proposed by Marmottant et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 118, 3499-3505 (2005)]. The system demonstrates the potential for a high-throughput in vitro characterization of individual microbubbles. Published by AIP Publishing.

ID HURST EXPONENT; TIME
AB One of the pillars of the finance theory is the efficient-market hypothesis, which is used to analyze the stock market. However, in recent years, this hypothesis has been questioned by a number of studies showing evidence of unusual behaviors in the returns of financial assets ("anomalies") caused by behavioral aspects of the economic agents. Therefore, it is time to initiate a debate about the efficient-market hypothesis and the "behavioral finances." We here introduce a cellular automaton model to study the stock market complexity, considering different behaviors of the economical agents. From the analysis of the stationary standard of investment observed in the simulations and the Hurst exponents obtained for the term series of stock index, we draw conclusions concerning the complexity of the model compared to real markets. We also investigate which conditions of the investors are able to influence the efficient market hypothesis statements.

AB Although the behavior of a bubble in an acoustic field has been studied extensively, few theoretical treatments to date have been applied to simulate the acoustic response of a real population of variably sized microbubbles in a finite-width sound beam. In this paper, we present a modified Trilling equation for single bubble dynamics that has been solved numerically for different conditions. Radiated waveforms from a large number of such bubbles are combined, reflecting their size distribution and location and the shape of a real acoustic beam. The resulting time-domain pressure waveforms can be compared with those obtained experimentally. The dependence of second-harmonic radiation on incident focal amplitude at different frequencies is presented. This model is particularly suited to the study of interaction between a medical ultrasound beam and microbubble contrast agents in aqueous media.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the increase in temperature induced by various light sources during in-office bleaching treatment, under simulated blood microcirculation in pulp conditions. Ten freshly extracted human maxillary central incisors were used for the study. The roots of the teeth were removed from approximately 2 mm below the cementoenamel junction and fixed on an apparatus for the simulation of blood microcirculation in pulp. A J-type thermocouple wire was inserted into the pulp chamber through an artificial access at the lingual surfaces of the teeth, and another thermocouple wire was fixed on the labial surface of the teeth meanwhile. An in-office bleaching agent, intense red in color and with 30 % water content, was applied to the labial surfaces of the teeth, and repeating measurements were made for each tooth using three different light sources: Er:YAG laser (40 mJ, 10 Hz, 20 s), 810-nm diode laser (4 W, 20 s, CW), and high-intensity light-emitting diodes (LED) (1,100 mW/cm(2), 20 s) as the control. Temperature increase in the pulp chamber and within the bleaching gel during light application were recorded and statistically evaluated. The highest pulp temperature increases were recorded for the diode laser group (2.61 A degrees C), followed by the Er:YAG laser (1.86 A degrees C) and LED (1.02 A degrees C) groups (p < 0.05; analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD)). Contradictorily, the lowest gel temperature increases were recorded for diode laser (6.21 A degrees C) and followed by LED (12.38 A degrees C) and Er:YAG (20.11 A degrees C) groups (p < 0.05; ANOVA, Tukey's HSD). Despite the significant differences among the groups, the temperature increases recorded for all groups were below the critical value of 5.6 A degrees C that can cause irreversible harmful changes in pulp tissue. It can be concluded that, with regard to temperature increase, all the light sources evaluated in this study can be used safely for in-office bleaching treatment within the described parameters.

AB Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to investigate online viewers' preferences concerning the number and duration of video advertisements to watch during commercial breaks. The goal of the investigations was to assess whether online viewers preferred watching a fewer number of advertisements with longer durations or a greater number of advertisements with shorter durations.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Two studies used experimental research designs to assess viewers' preferences regarding advertisements. These designs used two independent variables and one dependent variable. The first independent variable manipulated the type of choice options given to online viewers (e.g. one 60 s or two 30 s advertisements). The second independent variable manipulated when the choice was given to online viewers (i.e. at the beginning of the viewing experience or in the middle of the experience). The dependent variable measured viewers' choices concerning their preferred advertisement option.
   Findings
   The results across both studies found that participants made choices that minimized total advertisement exposure time when possible. When minimizing total exposure time was not possible, participants made choices that minimized the number of exposures instead.
   Originality/value
   These investigations extend the literature on advertisement choice by examining online viewers' preferences about the format of their advertising experience rather than the content of the persuasive messages themselves. In addition, these investigations provide value by investigating viewers' responses to stimuli within realistic online simulations rather than abstract hypotheticals.

ID CONSENSUS
AB In the recent past, the Sepetiba Bay watershed, located in the Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil has experienced rapid industrial development and population growth, as well as an increase in water pollution and environmental degradation. To analyze the complex interrelationships among the agents affecting the Sepetibza Bay environment, a system dynamics model was developed. The model builds on extensive studies conducted for the watershed, and simulates different hypotheses of economic growth and of demographic expansion. Thus, it can be used as a decision support tool for the identification of investment priorities and policy analyses under various scenarios. In order to provide a comprehensive approach to the environmental management of the Sepetiba Bay watershed, the model had to consider only the most relevant aspects of the behavior and the key interactions among agents operating in the watershed. In this article, the model's structure is presented together with some of its main results.

AB This paper proposes a dynamic model for the futures market with three types of investors. The bounded rationality and heterogeneity of investors are taken into consideration. The equilibrium of the system and its stability conditions are derived with mathematical analysis. In the equilibrium, the futures price and the spot price converge to the equilibrium simultaneously. The equilibrium is determined by many factors, including the risk appetite and the rationality of investors, the trading costs, the arbitrage basis price and the fundamental price. When the stability conditions are violated, complex dynamics will emerge in the market. As shown by the simulations, the arbitrage is likely to destabilize the market. Moreover, when investors have the high degree of rationality, the equilibrium will become unstable and the futures market is inefficient. Statistical analysis indicates that the model can reproduce the stylized facts observed in the futures market, such as long memory, volatility clustering and fat tail of returns.

AB This article offers a formal account of curiosity and insight in terms of active (Bayesian) inference. It deals with the dual problem of inferring states of the world and learning its statistical structure. In contrast to current trends in machine learning (e.g., deep learning), we focus on how people attain insight and understanding using just a handful of observations, which are solicited through curious behavior. We use simulations of abstract rule learning and approximate Bayesian inference to show that minimizing (expected) variational free energy leads to active sampling of novel contingencies. This epistemic behavior closes explanatory gaps in generativemodels of the world, thereby reducing uncertainty and satisfying curiosity. We then move from epistemic learning to model selection or structure learning to show how abductive processes emerge when agents test plausible hypotheses about symmetries (i.e., invariances or rules) in their generative models. The ensuing Bayesian model reduction evinces mechanisms associated with sleep and has all the hallmarks of "aha" moments. This formulation moves toward a computational account of consciousness in the pre-Cartesian sense of sharable knowledge (i.e., con: "together"; scire: "to know").

AB The progressive statistics of forest fires in the world makes them a global problem for humankind; therefore, the issue of controlling such natural disasters is extremely urgent. This paper describes the application of fine-dispersed alumina nanoparticles in firefighting. Nanocolloids based on aluminum hydroxide are proposed as the extinguishing compositions for two purpose: fire prevention and fire suppression with alumina barrier formation. Aluminum sulfate and various hydrolyzing agents (ammonia solution or sodium bicarbonate) are used to produce hydrosols. A ceramic coating based on the gamma phase of aluminum oxide with a specific surface area up to 150 m(2)/g is formed as a result of heat treatment during combustion. Creation of this barrier prevents oxygen access and removes heat excess simultaneously. The preparation of low-cost fine-dispersed nanoparticles of inorganic oxides is possible directly at the fire location by the firefighters themselves. In addition, obtained ceramic foam performs stable, environmentally friendly properties and prevents reignition.

DT Article

ID VOLUNTEER WORK; ALTRUISM; REWARDS; MONEY; TIME
AB Economic theory explains the supply of volunteering alternatively as an ordinary consumer good or an investment good. This paper provides a simultaneous approach, considering both objectives, by using the psychological distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivations, in order to reconcile conflicting results reported in the literature. Following the simultaneity approach, the paper develops a theoretical model of unpaid labour supply within an agent's two-period utility maximization problem, taking into account the role of psychological motivation. The theoretical hypotheses are tested with a sample selection model for Italy, by using the 1997 Multipurpose Households Survey on everyday life issues carried out by the Italian National Statistical Office. A robustness analysis and endogeneity test for intrinsic motivation are also performed. Empirical analysis rejects the hypothesis that only a consumption or investment motive can explain Italian volunteers' behaviour, supporting the hypothesis that both motives interact in shaping regular unpaid labour supply, with a stronger impact of consumption motives. The relevant variables for frequently supplied unpaid labour are intrinsic motivation, age, household income, family responsibilities and activity sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   SCENARIOS
AB Land use models operating at regional to global scales are almost exclusively based on the single paradigm of economic optimisation. Models based on different paradigms are known to produce very different results, but these are not always equivalent or attributable to particular assumptions. In this study, we compare two pan-European integrated land use models that utilise the same climatic and socio-economic scenarios but which adopt fundamentally different modelling paradigms. One of these is a constrained optimising economic-equilibrium model, and the other is a stochastic agent-based model. We run both models for a range of scenario combinations and compare their projections of spatially aggregate and disaggregate land use changes and ecosystem service supply levels in food, forest and associated environmental systems. We find that the models produce very different results in some scenarios, with simulated food production varying by up to half of total demand and the extent of intensive agriculture varying by up to 25 % of the EU land area. The agent-based model projects more multifunctional and heterogeneous landscapes in most scenarios, providing a wider range of ecosystem services at landscape scales, as agents make individual, time-dependent decisions that reflect economic and non-economic motivations. This tendency also results in food shortages under certain scenario conditions. The optimisation model, in contrast, maintains food supply through intensification of agricultural production in the most profitable areas, sometimes at the expense of land abandonment in large parts of Europe. We relate the principal differences observed to underlying model assumptions and hypothesise that optimisation may be appropriate in scenarios that allow for coherent political and economic control of land systems, but not in scenarios in which economic and other scenario conditions prevent the changes in prices and responses required to approach economic equilibrium. In these circumstances, agent-based modelling allows explicit consideration of behavioural processes, but in doing so it provides a highly flexible account of land system development that is harder to link to underlying assumptions. We suggest that structured comparisons of parallel and transparent but paradigmatically distinct models are an important method for better understanding the potential scope and uncertainties of future land use change, particularly given the substantive differences that currently exist in the outcomes of such models.

AB This paper describes the conceptualization and implementation of an agent-based model to investigate how varying levels of human presence could affect elements of wolf behavior, including highway crossings; use of areas in proximity to roads and trails; size of home ranges; activities, such as hunting, patrolling, resting, and feeding pups; and survival of individuals in Banff and Kootenay National Parks, Canada. The model consists of a wolf module as the primary component with five packs represented as cognitive agents, and grizzly bear, elk, and human modules that represent dynamic components of the environment. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a friction model that serves as a base map representing the landscape over which wolves moved. A decision model was built to simulate the sequence of wolf activities. The model was implemented in a Java Programming Language using RePast, an agent-based modeling library. Six months of wolf activities were simulated from April 16 to October 15 (i.e., a season coherent with regard to known wolf behaviors), and calibrated with GPS data from wolf radiocollars (n = 15) deployed from 2002 to 2004. Results showed that the simulated trajectories of wolf movements were correlated with the observed trajectories (Spearman's rho 0.566. P < 0.001); other critical behaviors, such as time spent at the den and not traveling were also correlated. The simulations revealed that wolf movements and behaviors were noticeably affected by the intensity of human presence. The packs' home ranges shrank and wolves crossed highways less frequently with increased human presence. In an extreme example, a wolf pack whose home range is traversed by a high-traffic-volume highway was extirpated due to inability to hunt successfully under a scenario wherein human presence levels were increased 10-fold. The modeling prototype developed in this study may serve as a tool to test hypotheses about human effects on wolves and on other mammals, and guide decision-makers in designing management strategies that minimize impacts on wolves and on other species functionally related to wolves in the ecosystem.

ID ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS; GENERATION
AB Encapsulated microbubbles are considered to be microsensors for in vivo blood pressure measurements in the cardiovascular system. To study the potential of this method, we developed a simulation and an experimental set-up that relate various characteristics of radiated acoustic signals from the microbubbles to the varying ambient pressure. Both the simulation and the experiment show that the radiated pressure from microbubbles generates a significant subharmonic component, which is modulated by changes in the ambient pressure. A time-dependent decrease of the steady-state radii within a population of microbubbles causes a phase reversal phenomenon, which explains the observed time delay in the build-up of the subharmonic modulation response. Additionally, we identify a frequency-capturing effect that indicates the termination of the nonlinear behavior of the microbubbles. Our research suggests that these subharmonic signals can be used for in vivo blood pressure measurements and highlights some of the considerations that need to be addressed in developing such techniques.

DT Review
ID POTENTIAL HAZARD; BRODIFACOUM; RAPTORS; OWLS
AB Rodenticides have the potential to cause toxicity to nontarget animals that might become accidently exposed to such materials, and various experimental techniques have been developed to determine whether rodenticides cause nontarget hazard under various use conditions. Distinctions between toxicity and hazard are important. Determinations need to be made as to what nontarget animals are present near rodenticide applications and how potential exposure can occur. Various formulation and application parameters may be experimentally modified to reduce hazard, and to determine resultant effects upon both target and nontarget species. Aversive agents have been evaluated that may increase rodenticide selectivity to the target species. Wildlife hazard evaluations require basic toxicity testing, and primary hazard may be reduced through formulation and application modifications. Secondary hazard requires a knowledge of a nontarget species foraging behavior versus rodenticide application in terms of habitat used or affected, and prey preference versus pest species controlled. Simulated field studies or large scale field studies utilizing radiotelemetry techniques (concurrent with rodenticide applications) may provide the most realistic data on hazard.

AB The inhibiting properties of corrosion inhibitors of norfloxacin (NFA), ciprofloxacin (CFA), and ofloxacin (OFA) for steel in 1 M HCl solution had been studied, respectively. Their corrosion inhibiting property was performed in 1 mol/L hydrochloric acid by potentiodynamic polarization (PDP) and electrochemical spectroscopy (EIS) tests at different temperatures range. The order of their corrosion inhibition efficiency is as follows: CFA > NFA > OFA. Polarization data suggest that the corrosion inhibitors are predominantly mixed-type. The best fit for inhibitors adsorption is obey Langmuir isotherm model. The structure properties of corrosion inhibitors are correlated by means of a density-functional quantum-chemical approach. Moreover, the molecular dynamics calculation vividly simulates the adsorption behavior of CFA, NFA and OFA molecules on the surface of steel.

AB Drug polymer carriers usually have good sustained release character. In this study, epichlorohydrin was used as cross-linking agent for synthesizing the beta-cyclodextrin polymer microspheres (beta-CDPM) by adopting the method of inverse emulsion polymerization. The scanning electron microscope, infrared spectra, powder X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric, H-1 NMR and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance were utilized to characterize the structure, surface morphology, thermal stability and crystallinity of the obtained beta-CDPM. In vitro release experiment of ornidazole-beta-CDPM under preferred experimental condition was studied and the cumulative release curves at different pH values were obtained. The drug loading rate of beta-CDPM is 8.86% under preferred process. The release time of the synthesized microspheres was 9 h, which showed good sustained-release behavior. Antibacterial test result indicated that beta-CDPM did not affect the an-tibacterial activity of ornidazole.

AB We present atomistic Computer Simulation results in combination with high resolution electron microscopy (HREM) images that provide convincing evidence of the atomically resolved surface structure Of zeolites Beta C and L. The purpose of the surface Structure determination is two-fold: firstly, in solving the Surface structure, we gain insight into the crystal growth process, which allows us to propose mechanistic routes and agents for controlling crystal morphology. Secondly, knowledge of surface structure allows us to Study processes Such as transport and catalysis at the crystal Surface that are notoriously difficult to probe using experimental methods. The latter point is clearly important ill understanding how the external surface behaves in contrast to the internal surface, in order to rationalise and predict the behaviour of microporous membranes. In this work, we report how a combination of classical and periodic density functional theory calculations have been Utilised to predict structure, and to reveal fundamental insights into the intrinsic crystal growth mechanisms for zeolite Beta C and L.

AB We explored the utility of incorporating easily measured, biologically realistic movement rules into simple models of dispersal. We depart from traditional random walk models by designing an individual-based simulation model where we decompose animal movement into three separate processes: emigration, between-patch movement, and immigration behaviour. These processes were quantified using experiments on the omnivorous insect Dicyphus hesperus moving through a tomato greenhouse. We compare the predictions of the individual-based model, along with a series of biased random walk models, against an independent experimental release of D. hesperus. We find that in this system, the short-term dispersal of these insects is described well by our individual-based model, but can also be described by a 2D grid-based biased random walk model when mortality is accounted for.

AB In the present study a comprehensive model is employed to describe the dynamic behavior of an industrial scale reactor for the emulsion polymerization of vinylidene fluoride (VDF) under different initiator and chain transfer agent (CTA) addition policies. A comprehensive kinetic model combined with a thermodynamic and a particle population model were simultaneously solved to calculate the VDF addition rate, reactor pressure, molecular weight properties, and the particle size distribution of polyvinylidene fluoride produced in a semibatch emulsion polymerization reactor. The proposed emulsion polymerization model takes into account the gas liquid equilibrium of VDF to determine the aqueous phase VDF concentration and the changes in operating pressure. The effects of particle crystallinity on radical entry and coagulation rate were also considered. The computational model results (cumulative monomer feed and feed rate, reactor pressure, molecular weights, and particle size distribution) are found to be in agreement with available experimental data.

AB The isothermal crystallization and mechanical behavior of biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) composites with organic (oleic acid and glycerol monooleate) and inorganic (zinc oxide, organoclay, and hydroxy apatite) additives used alone or simultaneously were investigated. The effect of all additives on the degree of crystallinity percentage (DOC%), isothermal crystallization kinetics parameters, and mechanical test results of PCL composites was studied. The PCL composite films were prepared by solvent casting by using dichloromethane as the solvent. The films were characterized by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and tensile tests. DSC of the first melting and X-ray diffraction DOC% results (for composites by solvent casting) are compatible. The values by DSC of the second melting (for composites by extrusion method) are lower. Organoclay gives the highest crystallinity among the other inorganic additives used. Small amounts of inorganic additives act as a nucleating agent and increase the crystallinity; the higher amounts decrease. The organic additives act as the plasticizer. When used alone, it lowers the crystallinity, but when used with inorganic additives, it improves the dispersion of inorganic particles in the polymer matrix. The isothermal crystallization kinetics parameters by Avrami analysis showed that crystallization was controlled by nucleation and the crystals had spherical structure. The nucleation type changed between thermal and athermal nucleation. The Pukanzky model interaction parameter B indicated that the organic additives improved the dispersion of inorganic particles in the polymer matrix. Statistically significant, eight correlations (F>6) were obtained for the crystallinity, crystallization parameters, Young's modulus, and tensile strength as a function of concentration of additives.

AB We investigated CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 glass partially crystallized with molybdenum particles as nucleating agents. Microstructure of the material was characterized as a house-of-cards structure composed of plate-like crystals. Microcracks propagated along the crystal plane parallel to the double layer of SiO4/AlO4 tetrahedrons separated by layers of calcium atoms. To investigate the fracture behavior of the hexagonal CaAl2Si2O8 crystals, molecular dynamics simulations were performed, which demonstrated that a crack can be easily triggered by shear deformation along the calcium layer. Additionally, once a crack was generated in the calcium layer, it propagated rapidly, whereas the crack perpendicular to the calcium layer hardly propagated. This simulated behavior is consistent with the experimentally observed cleavage behavior of the hexagonal CaAl2Si2O8 crystal. The experimental and simulation results effectively explained the non-elastic fracture behavior of the material.

ID MODEL-COMPOUND APPROACH; RADIATION; DEGRADATION; CHEMISTRY
AB Ionizing radiation induces various changes in the molecular structure of elastomers; consequently, the macroscopic properties of the irradiated elastomers will be modified. The newly formed products and the alteration of the initial chemical structure are the result of free-radical reactions which provide the crosslinking and/or the depolymerization of the tested materials and destructive simultaneous processes involving diffused aggressive agents. This paper describes the behavior of butyl and chlorinated and brominated butyl elastomers under the action of gamma radiation for total doses up to 0.5 MGy. The experimental data provided by several procedures emphasize a complex chemistry circumstance consisting of the simultaneous crosslinking and scission of the macromolecular chains and consecutive processes involving free radicals. Evaluation of the studied changes was via gel content, oxidation level, unsaturation, and halogen distribution as dependent on the total radiation dose. The mechanism of the degradation and a relationship between the crosslinking/scission ratio and the absorbed dose are discussed. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Acute kidney injury causes significant morbidity and mortality. This experimental animal study investigated the simultaneous impact of iron and vitamin D on acute kidney injury induced by iohexol, an iodinated, non-ionic monomeric radiocontrast agent in Wistar rats. Out of 36 healthy male Wistar rats, saline was injected into six control rats (group 1) and iohexol into the remaining 30 experimental rats (groups 2 to 6 comprising six rats each). Biochemical, renal histological changes, and gene expression of iron-regulating proteins and 1 alpha-hydroxylase were analyzed. Urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), serum creatinine, urine protein, serum and urine catalytic iron, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and tissue lipid peroxidation were assayed. Rats injected with iohexol showed elevated urinary NGAL (11.94 +/- 6.79 ng/mL), serum creatinine (2.92 +/- 0.91 mg/dL), and urinary protein levels (11.03 +/- 9.68 mg/mg creatinine) together with histological evidence of tubular injury and iron accumulation. Gene expression of iron-regulating proteins and 1 alpha-hydroxylase was altered. Serum and urine catalytic iron levels were elevated (0.57 +/- 0.17; 48.95 +/- 29.13 mu mol/L) compared to controls (0.49 +/- 0.04; 20.7 +/- 2.62 mu mol/L,P < 0.001). Urine catalytic iron positively correlated with tissue peroxidation (r = 0.469, CI 0.122 to 0.667,P = 0.004) and urinary NGAL (r = 0.788, CI 0.620 to 0.887,P < 0.001). 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (61.58 +/- 9.60 ng/mL) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (50.44 +/- 19.76 pg/mL) levels increased simultaneously. In a multivariate linear regression analysis, serum iron, urine catalytic iron, and tissue lipid peroxidation independently and positively predicted urinary NGAL, an acute kidney injury biomarker. This study highlights the nephrotoxic potential of catalytic iron besides demonstrating a concurrent induction of vitamin D endogenously for possible renoprotection in acute kidney injury. Impact statement This work provides in-depth insights on catalytic iron-induced cytotoxicity and the resultant triggering of endogenous vitamin D synthesis in experimental acute kidney injury. Our results reveal significantly elevated levels of catalytic iron culminating in oxidant-mediated renal injury and a concomitant increase in 1,25-dihdyroxyvitamin D3 levels. Also, changes in other iron-related proteins including transferrin, ferritin, and hepcidin were observed both in the serum as well as in their mRNA expression. We consider all these findings vital since no connection between catalytic iron and vitamin D has been established so far. Furthermore, we believe that this work provides new and interesting results, with catalytic iron emerging as an important target in ameliorating renal cellular injury, possibly by timely administration of vitamin D. It also needs to be seen if these observations made in rats could be translated to humans by means of robust clinical trials.

AB K95 experimental lubricant being a product of fluorine reaction with a blend of mutually soluble poly(fluorine alcohols) and poly(fluorine esters) with molecular weight 240-900 g/mol was studied as an additive for rubber compounds based on blend of NR and BR. It was thermally stable till 270-300 degrees C. For comparison, it was tested simultaneously with homogenizing agent, Struktol MS40. Lubricant K95 added in a quantity of 0.5 wt% reduced the viscosity of rubber compound; it also improved compound flow in the mold. Mechanical properties of cured rubber not decrease while resistance to abrasion and fatigue increased. K95 participated in forming strong physical junctions (lower molecular weight between junctions of thermally stable network) while Struktol MS40 reduced the networking degree of rubber. As a result, it acts a multifunctional additive for NR/BR rubber. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A network thermodynamic model has been devised to describe the coupled movement of water and a permeable additive within a kidney during perfusion under the combined action of diffusive, hydrodynamic, and mechanical processes. The model has been validated by simulating perfusions with Me2SO, glycerol, and sucrose and comparing predicted weight and vascular resistance,vith experimental results obtained by Pegg (1993). The flows of CPA, water, colloid and cellular impermeants are governed by a combination of the individual osmotic potential and pressure differences between compartments of the kidney, the viscoelastic behavior of the tissue, and the momentum transferred between the flows. The model developed in this sturdy presents an analytical tool for understanding the dynamics of the perfused kidney system and for modifying perfusion protocols to minimize the changes in cell volume, internal pressure build-up, and increases in vascular resistance that currently present barriers to the successful perfusion of organs.

AB In Conflict Resolution situations where two parties with opposed preferences need to make a number of decisions simultaneously, we propose a simple mechanism that endows agents with a certain number of votes that can be distributed freely across issues. This mechanism allows parties to trade off their voting power across issues and extract gains from differences in the intensities of their preferences. The appealing properties of such a mechanism may be negated by strategic interactions among individuals. We test its properties using controlled laboratory experiments. We observe that equilibrium play increases over time and truthful/honest play decreases over time. The subjects almost reach the welfare predicted by the theory even when their behaviour is far from equilibrium. The fact that deviations from equilibrium do not do much damage to its welfare properties is a further argument in favour of the use of this mechanism in the real world. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB The analysis of the faunal remains from Middle Stone Age deposits of Magubike rockshelter was undertaken to contribute to the modern human behavior debate. Multivariate taphonomic analyses implicate hominins as the key taphonomic agent in the accumulation and modification of the faunal assemblage. Results also show they mainly foraged on large-sized animals as the key sources of meat and marrow. Small-sized animals were also exploited to maximize the foraging net return rates, but only in relatively small quantities. There is evidence that they transported and systematically processed fleshed or relatively complete carcasses. The majority of the cut-marked elements are the high-meat and marrow-bearing bones. The percentages of cut and percussion marks on long bone midshafts fall within the range of variations documented in experimental simulations that sought to replicate hominin primary (early) access to fully fleshed carcasses. There is also evidence that carnivores were scavenging bone fragments discarded by hominins.

AB A self-organizing and self-evolving agents (SOSENs) neural network is proposed. Each neuron of the SOSENs evolves itself with a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The self-evolving behavior of each neuron is a local improvement that results in speeding up the convergence. The chance of reaching the global optimum is increased because multiple SAs are run in a searching space. Optimum results obtained by the SOSENs are better in average than those obtained by a single SA. Experimental results show that the SOSENs have less temperature changes than the SA to reach the global minimum. Every neuron exhibits a self-organizing behavior, which is similar to those of the self-organizing map (SOM), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and self-organizing migrating algorithm (SOMA). At last, the computational time of parallel SOSENs can be less than the SA.

AB When designing secure information systems, a profound understanding of the threats that they are exposed to is indispensable. Today's most severe risks come from malicious threat agents exploiting a variety of attack vectors to achieve their goals, rather than from random opportunistic threats such as malware. Most security analyses, however, focus on fixing technical weaknesses, but do not account for sophisticated combinations of attack mechanisms and heterogeneity in adversaries' motivations, resources, capabilities, or points of access. In order to address these shortcomings and, thus, to provide security analysts with a tool that makes it possible to also identify emergent weaknesses that may arise from dynamic interactions of attacks, we have combined rich conceptual modeling of security knowledge with attack graph generation and discrete-event simulation techniques. This paper describes the prototypical implementation of the resulting security analysis tool and demonstrates how it can be used for an experimental evaluation of a system's resilience against various adversaries.

AB We present a model describing a generic process in which a finite resource is partitioned and distributed among agents. Through numerical simulation we show that the model considered is able to originate, within a unifying approach, a variety of broad distributions and provides an interpretation of empirical properties of distributions observed in the real world. In particular it allows to relate the exponent of the power-law part of the distributions to resource abundance and accessibility, while the left-end exponential behavior, observed in many distributions, is related to the presence of dissipative effects.

AB Non-uniform corrosion of reinforcement causes concrete cracking in chloride contaminated RC structures. Due to an interaction existed between the concrete cover cracking and the ingress of aggressive agents in chloride environments, chloride ingress is significantly enhanced by cracks. Thus the investigation on the cracking paths and cracking propagation process resulting from steel corrosion is very essential. This work proposed a numerical model to study the cracking of cover concrete. The physical model was focused on the middle-located rebar corrosion, and the effect of the neighboring longitudinal reinforcing bars on the cracking of cover concrete was mainly considered. A damaged plasticity model for the study on the failure behavior of concrete cover was built. The non-uniform radial displacement distribution was adopted to simulate the corrosion expansion behavior of the rebar. The cracking propagation process of Cover concrete with two neighboring longitudinal reinforcing bars embedded was simulated and monitored with the level of corrosion build-up. The present approach was verified by the available experimental observations. The influences of concrete cover thickness, rebar diameter and rebar spacing on the failure patterns of concrete cover and crack width propagation were examined. And limiting criteria for the cracking modes were established. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID SEGREGATION; SPINDLE; MOTORS
AB An appealing tool for study of the complex biological behaviors that can emerge from networks of simple molecular interactions is an agent-based, computational simulation that explicitly tracks small-scale local interactions - following thousands to millions of states through time. For many critical cell processes (e. g. cytokinetic furrow specification, nuclear centration, cytokinesis), the flexible nature of cytoskeletal filaments is likely to be critical. Any computer model that hopes to explain the complex emergent behaviors in these processes therefore needs to encode filament flexibility in a realistic manner. Here I present a numerically convenient and biophysically realistic method for modeling cytoskeletal filament flexibility in silico. Each cytoskeletal filament is represented by a series of rigid segments linked end-to-end in series with a variable attachment point for the translational elastic element. This connection scheme allows an empirically tuning, for a wide range of segment sizes, viscosities, and time-steps, that endows any filament species with the experimentally observed (or theoretically expected) static force deflection, relaxation time-constant, and thermal writhing motions. I additionally employ a unique pair of elastic elements-one representing the axial and the other the bending rigidity-that formulate the restoring force in terms of single time-step constraint resolution. This method is highly local -adjacent rigid segments of a filament only interact with one another through constraint forces-and is thus well-suited to simulations in which arbitrary additional forces (e. g. those representing interactions of a filament with other bodies or cross-links / entanglements between filaments) may be present. Implementation in code is straightforward; Java source code is available at www.celldynamics.org.

AB A longstanding awareness in generating resistance to common antimicrobial therapies by Gram-negative bacteria has made them a major threat to global health. The application of antimicrobial peptides as a therapeutic agent would be a great opportunity to combat bacterial diseases. Here, we introduce a new antimicrobial peptide (similar to 8.3 kDa) from probiotic strain Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, designated acidocin 4356 (ACD). This multifunctional peptide exerts its anti-infective ability against Pseudomonas aeruginosa through an inhibitory action on virulence factors, bacterial killing, and biofilm degradation. Reliable performance over tough physiological conditions and low hemolytic activity confirmed a new hope for the therapeutic setting. Antibacterial kinetic studies using flow cytometry technique showed that the ACD activity is related to the change in permeability of the membrane. The results obtained from molecular dynamic (MD) simulation were perfectly suited to the experimental data of ACD behavior. The structure-function relationship of this natural compound, along with the results of transmission electron microscopy analysis and MD simulation, confirmed the ability of the ACD aimed at enhancing bacterial membrane perturbation. The peptide was effective in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection in mouse model. The results support the therapeutic potential of ACD for the treatment of Pseudomonas infections.
   IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant bacteria are a major threat to global health, and the Pseudomonas bacterium with the ability to form biofilms is considered one of the main causative agents of nosocomial infections. Traditional antibiotics have failed because of increased resistance. Thus, finding new biocompatible antibacterial drugs is essential. Antimicrobial peptides are produced by various organisms as a natural defense mechanism against pathogens, inspiring the possible design of the next generation of antibiotics. In this study, a new antimicrobial peptide was isolated from Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356, counteracting both biofilm and planktonic cells of Pseudornonas aeruginosa. A detailed investigation was then conducted concerning the functional mechanism of this peptide by using fluorescence techniques, electron microscopy, and in silico methods. The antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of this peptide may be important in the treatment of PseudomPseudomonasonas infections.

AB The structure and the thermodynamic state of polymeric interfaces are important features in many materials of technological interest. This is especially true for multiconstituent systems such as blends of immiscible polymers, where the interface structure can affect greatly their morphology and, thus, their mechanical properties. In this article, we first present a review of the experimental and theoretical investigations of the interfacial tension in phase-separated homopolymer blends. We emphasize the effects of temperature and molecular weight on the behavior: interfacial tension g decreases with increasing temperature (for polymer systems exhibiting upper critical solution temperature behavior) with a temperature coefficient of the order of 10(-2) dyn/(cm degrees C), whereas it increases with increasing molecular weight. The increase follows a gamma = gamma(infinity)(1 - k(int)M(n)(-z)) dependence (with z approximate to 1 for high molecular weights), where gamma(infinity) is the limiting interfacial tension at infinite molecular weight and M-n the number average molecular weight. Suitably chosen block or graft copolymers are widely used in blends of immiscible polymers as compatibilizers for controlling the morphology (phase structure) and the interfacial adhesion between the phases. The compatabilitizing effect is due to their interfacial activity, i.e., to their affinity to selectively segregate to the interface between the phase-separated homopolymers, thus reducing the interfacial tension between the two macrophases. The experimental and theoretical works in this area are reviewed herein. The effects of concentration, molecular weight, composition, and macromolecular architecture of the copolymeric additives are discussed. An issue that can influence the efficient utilization of a copolymeric additive as an emulsifier is the possibility of micelle formation within the homopolymer matrices when the additive is mixed with one of the components. These micelles will compete with the interfacial region for copolymer chains. A second issue relates to the possible trapping of copolymer chains at the interface, which can lead to stationary states of partial equilibrium. The in-situ formation of copolymers by the interfacial reaction of functionalized homopolymers is also discussed.

AB Biomass gasification in fluidized bed system by using air-steam mixture as the gasifying agent is a promising way of utilizing biomass because it produces a gaseous fuel having relatively higher calorific value as well as higher hydrogen content with minimum or no heat addition to the gasifier. In the present work, a three dimensional numerical simulation of a bubbling fluidized bed biomass gasifier has been carried out. The numerical simulation is based on the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach where the fluid phase is solved by using a continuum approach and the solid is modeled by using Lagrangian computational particle model. The chemical reactions are coupled with the complex hydrodynamic calculation of gas-solid fluidized bed. The simulations are performed by varying the gasification temperature, equivalence ratio and steam-to-biomass ratio. Detail analyses of flow pattern, pressure distribution, and gas composition distribution have been presented. The complex three dimensional flow structures are revealed by plotting the results in different planes. The results provide a detail insight into the gasifier's behavior including fluidization, thermal and chemical characteristics. Simulated outlet gas compositions are compared with our own experimental data and a very good resemblance is observed. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Over the past decade, technological advances in experimental and animal tracking techniques have motivated a renewed theoretical interest in animal collective motion and, in particular, locust swarming. This review offers a comprehensive biological background followed by comparative analysis of recent models of locust collective motion, in particular locust marching, their settings, and underlying assumptions. We describe a wide range of recent modeling and simulation approaches, from discrete agent-based models of self-propelled particles to continuous models of integro-differential equations, aimed at describing and analyzing the fascinating phenomenon of locust collective motion. These modeling efforts have a dual role: The first views locusts as a quintessential example of animal collective motion. As such, they aim at abstraction and coarse-graining, often utilizing the tools of statistical physics. The second, which originates from a more biological perspective, views locust swarming as a scientific problem of its own exceptional merit. The main goal should, thus, be the analysis and prediction of natural swarm dynamics. We discuss the properties of swarm dynamics using the tools of statistical physics, as well as the implications for laboratory experiments and natural swarms. Finally, we stress the importance of a combined-interdisciplinary, biological-theoretical effort in successfully confronting the challenges that locusts pose at both the theoretical and practical levels.

AB The solubility of pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid in supercritical carbon dioxide was measured at 313-333 K and 10-20 MPa, using a flow-saturation technique. The influence of methanol on solubility behavior is investigated. The solubility in neat supercritical carbon dioxide ranged from 0.44 x 10-6 mol center dot moltot-1 to 3.4 x 10-6 mol center dot moltot-1 ,while its solubility in presence of methanol ranged from 0.17 x 10-5 mol center dot moltot-1 to 18.1 x 10-5 mol center dot moltot-1. The solubility data was modeled with Chrastil, Mendez-Teja, Garlapati equations and Peng-Robinson equation of state model. The solubility in the presence of methanol was correlated using modified Chrastil, modified Mendez-Teja and Thakur models. Among the models employed, Chrastil model (binary system) and modified Mendez-Teja model (ternary system) shown highest accordance with experimental data. Pyridine-2,6-dicarboxylic acid was employed as a chelating agent for development of a supercritical fluid extraction method for removal of Pb2+ and Ni2+ from simulated aqueous/soil matrices.

AB There are concerns that tooth bleaching agents may adversely affect dental materials. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that increasing concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (HP) are more effective than water at increasing metal ion release from two typical dental casting alloys during bleaching. Discs (n = 28 for each alloy) were prepared by casting and heat treated to simulate a typical porcelain-firing cycle. Discs (n = 7) of each alloy were immersed in either 0%, 3%, 10% or 30% (w/v) HP solutions for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Samples were taken for metal ion release determination using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and the data analysed using a two-way ANOVA followed by a one-way ANOVA. The surface roughness of each disc was measured using a Talysurf contact profilometer before and after bleaching and the data analysed using a paired t-test. With the exception of gold, the differences in metal ion concentration after treatment with 0% (control) and each of 3%, 10% and 30% HP (w/v) were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Metal ion release from the two alloys increased with increasing HP concentrations (over 3000% increase in Ni and 1400% increase in Pd ions were recorded when HP concentration increased from 0% to 30%). Surface roughness values of the samples before and after bleaching were not significantly different (P > 0.05) Exposure of the two dental casting alloys to HP solutions increased metal ion release of all the elements except gold.

AB The orientation of vascular cells can greatly influence the in vivo mechanical properties and functionality of soft vascular tissues. How cell orientation mediates the growth response of cells is of critical importance in understanding the response of soft tissues to mechanical stimuli or injury. To date, considerable evidence has shown that cells align with structural cues such as collagen fibers. However, in the presence of uniaxial cyclic strain on unstructured substrates, cells generally align themselves perpendicularly to the mechanical stimulus, such as strain, a phenomenon known as "strain avoidance." The cellular response to this interplay between structural cues and a mechanical stimulus is poorly understood. A recent in vitro experimental study in our lab has investigated both the individual and collective response of rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC) to structural (collagenous aligned constructs) and mechanical (cyclic strain) cues. In this study, a 2D agent-based model (ABM) is developed to simulate the collective response of RASMC to varying amplitudes of cyclic strain (0-10%, 2-8%, 4-6%) when seeded on unstructured (PDMS) and structured (decellularized collagenous tissue) constructs. An ABM is presented that is fit to the experimental outcomes in terms of cellular alignment and cell growth on PDMS substrates, under cyclic strain amplitudes of (4-6%, 2-8%, 0-10%) at 24 and 72 h timepoints. Furthermore, the ABM can predict RASMC alignment and change in cell number on a structured construct at a cyclic strain amplitude of 0-10% after 10 days. The ABM suggests that strain avoidance behavior observed in cells is dominated by selective cell proliferation and apoptosis at these early time points, as opposed to cell re-orientation, i.e., cells perpendicular to the strain increase their rate of proliferation, whilst the rate of apoptosis simultaneously increases in cells parallel to the strain direction. The development of in-silico modeling platforms, such as that presented here, allow for further understanding of the response of cells to changes in their mechanical environment. Such models offer an efficient and robust means to design and optimize the compliance and topological structure of implantable devices and could be used to aid the design of next-generation vascular grafts and stents.

ID PHASE-TRANSITION; DECISION-MAKING; INTEGRATION; SYSTEMS; SCHOOLS; AGENTS
AB In this paper, we study how a self-organized mobile robot flock can be steered toward a desired direction through externally guiding some of its members. Specifically, we propose a behavior by extending a previously developed flocking behavior to steer self-organized flocks in both physical and simulated mobile robots. We quantitatively measure the performance of the proposed behavior under different parameter settings using three metrics, namely, (1) the mutual information metric, adopted from Information Theory, to measure the information shared between the individuals during steering, (2) the accuracy metric from directional statistics to measure the angular deviation of the direction of the flock from the desired direction, and (3) the ratio of the largest aggregate to the whole flock and the ratio of informed individuals remaining with the largest aggregate, as a metric of flock cohesion. We conducted a systematic set of experiments using both physical and simulated robots, analyzed the transient and steady-state characteristics of steered flocking, and evaluate the parameter conditions under which a swarm can be successfully steered. We show that the experimental results are qualitatively in accordance with the ones that were predicted in Couzin et al. model (Nature, 433:513-516, 2005) and relate the quantitative differences to the differences between the models.

AB Foamed concrete has been widely used in infrastructure construction and poses new challenges to design and modelling. This paper investigates the behaviour of foamed concrete with the help of X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT), which is capable of characterising the microstructure of foamed concrete. An in situ compressive test-XCT scan is carried out to observe the failure mechanism of foamed concrete by XCT when subjected to compression load. A meso-scale simulation based on XCT images is conducted to simulate the behaviour of foamed concrete. An algorithm that directly reconstructs the meso-scale model from XCT images is developed. The experimental and numerical results show that foamed concrete exhibits a significant change in mechanical behaviour; it is less brittle compared to the response of dense samples. However, the reduction in the level of brittleness is accompanied by a significant decrease in compressive strength. Failure development inside samples is successfully captured by the XCT scan and the meso-scale modelling. The topology of foamed structures, in particular the chain of interconnected pores, influences the failure mechanism of foamed concrete. The combination of XCT scan and mesa-scale modelling provides a comprehensive framework to understand the mechanical behaviour of foamed concrete. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The effectiveness of phosphorus-containing compounds as gas-phase combustion inhibitors varies widely with flame type. To understand this behavior, experiments are performed with dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) added to the oxidizer stream of methane-air co-flow diffusion flames (cup-burner configuration). At low volume fraction, phosphorus (via DMMP addition) is shown to be about four times as effective as bromine (via Br-2 addition) at reducing the amount of CO2 required for extinguishment; however, above about 3000 mu L/L to 6000 mu L/L, the marginal effectiveness of DMMP is approximately zero. In contrast, the diminished effectiveness does not occur for Br2 addition. To explore the role of condensation of active phosphorus-containing compounds to the particles, laser-scattering measurements are performed. Finally, to examine the behavior of the flame stabilization region (which is responsible for extinguishment), premixed burning velocity simulations with detailed kinetics are performed for DMMP addition to methane-air flames. Analyses of the numerical results are performed to understand the variation in the inhibition mechanism with temperature, agent loading, and stoichiometry, to interpret the loss of effectiveness for DMMP in the present experiments.

AB Surfactants play an important role in various physiological and biomechanical applications. An example is the respiratory system, where pulmonary surfactants facilitate the breathing and reduce the possibility of airway blocking by lowering the surface tension when the lung volume decreases during exhalation. This function is due to the dynamic surface tension of pulmonary surfactants, which depends on the concentration of surfactants spread on the liquid layer lining the interior surface of the airways and alveoli. Here, a finite membrane element formulation for liquids is introduced that allows for the dynamics of concentration-dependent surface tension, as is the particular case for pulmonary surfactants. A straightforward approach is suggested to model the contact line between liquid drops/menisci and planar solid substrates, which allows the presented framework to be easily used for drop shape analysis. It is further shown how line tension can be taken into account. Following an isogeometric approach, NURBS-based finite elements are used for the discretization of the membrane surface. The capabilities of the presented computational model is demonstrated by different numerical examples - such as the simulation of liquid films, constrained and unconstrained sessile drops, pendant drops and liquid bridges-and the results are compared with experimental data.

AB Dispersing small helium bubbles in the liquid mercury target of the high-power spallation neutron sources was proposed to add compressibility to the target made of liquid mercury. The pressure rise from proton beam deposition is reduced due to added compressibility, which in turn mitigates cavitation damage to the target boundary. A gas volume fraction of similar to 0.5% with a nominal bubble diameter of similar to 30 mu m is desired for optimal pressure pulse relaxation at the beam power of >1 MW. Initial gas injection experiments performed in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory encountered difficulty in obtaining the required volume fraction in mercury. Gas dissolution and diffusion in mercury were candidate mechanisms for this behavior. To clarify this, the solubility of helium in mercury is evaluated in this study and compared to the available experimental data. The results indicate that helium has very small solubility in mercury and that the solubility increases with system temperature. Based on the predicted solubility values, bubble size evolution due to mass diffusion is simulated numerically. Mass diffusion induced bubble size evolution does not significantly affect bubble behavior for conditions expected in high power spallation targets. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), adsorption/desorption of N-2 at 77 K, electron diffraction diffuse scattering, chemical analysis by energy-dispersive X-rays and acidity assessment by step-wise temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3. The percentage of intergrowth was determined by comparison of the experimental diffraction pattern with simulated patterns using DIFFaX software. Well-crystallized samples were obtained from gels with nominal Si/Al ratios of 11 and 25; for Si/Al = 10, the samples were less crystalline. The Si/Al ratios obtained were in most cases lower than that of the starting gel and the intergrowth percentages obtained were lower than expected based on the relative amounts of structure directing agents in the gel; the highest degree of intergrowth achieved was 85% MFI/15% MEL. The effects of intergrowth structures on the activity and selectivity of the n-decane cracking reaction was studied at 400 degrees C and atmospheric pressure. The catalyst activity was a linear function of the concentration of strong acid sites. The selectivity showed that although the pentasil zeolite pore structure limits isomerization and hydrogen transfer reactions, MFI has a more open structure than MEL and intergrowth shows intermediate behavior between these two structures.

TI ACOUSTIC BEHAVIOR OF HALOBACTERIUM SALINARUM GAS VESICLES IN THE

AB Gas vesicles (GVs) are a new and unique class of biologically derived ultrasound contrast agents with sub-micron size whose acoustic properties have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the acoustic collapse pressure and behavior of Halobacterium salinarum gas vesicles at transmit center frequencies ranging from 12.5 to 27.5 MHz. The acoustic collapse pressure was found to be above 550 kPa at all frequencies, ninefold higher than the critical pressure observed under hydrostatic conditions. We illustrate that gas vesicles behave non-linearly when exposed to ultrasound at incident pressure ranging from 160 kPa to the collapse pressure and generate second harmonic amplitudes of 22 to 26 dB below the fundamental in media with viscosities ranging from 0.89 to 8 mPa.s. Simulations performed using a Rayleigh-Plesset-type model accounting for buckling and a dynamic finite-element analysis suggest that buckling is the mechanism behind the generation of harmonics. We found good agreement between the level of second harmonic relative to the fundamental measured at 20 MHz and the Rayleigh-Plesset model predictions. Finite-element simulations extended these findings to a non-spherical geometry, confirmed that the acoustic buckling pressure corresponds to the critical pressure under hydrostatic conditions and support the hypothesis of limited gas flow across the GV shell during the compression phase in the frequency range investigated. From simulations, estimates of GV bandwidth-limited scattering indicate that a single GV has a scattering cross section comparable to that of a red blood cell. These findings will inform the development of GV-based contrast agents and pulse sequences to optimize their detection with ultrasound. (C) 2017 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

TI Understanding How Short-Termism and a Dynamic Investor Network Affects
   Investor Returns: An Agent-Based Perspective
SO COMPLEXITY
LA English
DT Article
ID COMPLEX-SYSTEMS; MARKETS; FLUCTUATIONS; PERFORMANCE; INFORMATION;
   BEHAVIOR
AB The unexplained and inconsistent behavior of financial markets provides the motivation to engage interdisciplinary approaches to understand its intricacies better. A proven approach is to consider investors as heterogeneous interacting agents who form information networks to inform their investment decisions. The rationale is that the topology of these networks has contributed to a better understanding of the erratic behavior of financial markets. Introducing investor heterogeneity also allows researchers to identify the characteristics of higher performing investors and the implications of investors exhibiting short-termism, a feature recognized by some as detrimental to the performance of the economy. To address these topics, an agent-based artificial stock market is implemented, where investors utilize various information sources, including advice from investors in their network, to inform their investment decisions. Over time investors update their trust in their information sources and evolve their network by connecting to outperforming investors-Oracles-and discarding poor advisers, thereby simulating the evolution of an investor network. The model's most significant finding is uncovering how the market's behavior is materially affected by the time-horizon of investors, with short-term behavior resulting in greater volatility in the market. Another finding is the reason why short-term investors generally outperform their long-term counterparts, particularly in more volatile environments. By providing significant insights into the formation of an investor network and its ramifications for market volatility and wealth creation (destruction), this paper provides crucial clues regarding the empirical data that needs to be collected, assessed, and tracked to ensure policymakers and investors better understand the dynamics of financial markets.

AB On the eve of the large-scale introduction of electric vehicles, policy makers have to decide on how to organise a significant growth in charging infrastructure to meet demand. There is uncertainty about which charging deployment tactic to follow. The main issue is how many of charging stations, of which type, should be installed and where. Early roll-out has been successful in many places, but knowledge on how to plan a large-scale charging network in urban areas is missing. Little is known about return to scale effects, reciprocal effects of charger availability on sales, and the impact of fast charging or more clustered charging hubs on charging preferences of EV owners. This paper explores the effects of various roll-out strategies for charging infrastructure that facilitate the large-scale introduction of EVs, using agent-based simulation. In contrast to previously proposed models, our model is rooted in empirically observed charging patterns from EVs instead of travel patterns of fossil fuelled cars. In addition, the simulation incorporates different user types (inhabitants, visitors, taxis and shared vehicles) to model the diversity of charging behaviours in an urban environment. Different scenarios are explored along the lines of the type of charging infrastructure (level 2, clustered level 2, fast charging) and the intensity of rollout (EV to charging point ratio). The simulation predicts both the success rate of charging attempts and the additional discomfort when searching for a charging station. Results suggest that return to scale and reciprocal effects in charging infrastructure are considerable, resulting in a lower EV to charging station ratio on the longer term.

AB It is of significance to examine the factors impacting individual water-saving behavior and their mechanism of action for water demand management, especially for domestic water demand management. To provide a solution to the issues of individual water-saving behavior research with unclear influence mechanisms and subjective modeling decisions, this study provides a novel idea of combining social survey and model study for research on domestic water conservation, introduces complex adaptive system theory to describe the mechanism of action between individuals as well as between individuals and external stimuli, and proposes a general framework for the model establishment and analysis of individual water-saving response research under external stimuli. This study uses Beijing as an empirical city. Based on the analysis results of the survey on Beijing residents' domestic water use combined with the problems in Beijing's domestic water-saving efforts, this study constructs water-saving regulation scenarios and corresponding individual water-saving response rules; systematically simulates the change process of individual water use considering the aspects of water price formulation, water use information, and water-saving publicity and education; quantitatively analyzes the influence of these three types of external stimuli on individual water saving; proposes individual water-saving promotion measures; and suggests the three aspects of water price formulation, water use information feedback, water-saving publicity and education.

AB Standard antituberculosis (anti-TB) therapy requires the use of multiple drugs for a minimum of 6 months, with variable outcomes that are influenced by a number of microbiological, pathological, and clinical factors. This is despite the availability of antibiotics that have good activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in plasma. However, little is known about the distribution of widely used antituberculous agents in the pulmonary lesions where the pathogen resides. The rabbit model of TB infection was used to explore the hypothesis that standard drugs have various abilities to penetrate lung tissue and lesions and that adequate drug levels are not consistently reached at the site of infection. Using noncompartmental and population pharmacokinetic approaches, we modeled the rate and extent of distribution of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and moxifloxacin in rabbit lung and lesions. Moxifloxacin reproducibly showed favorable partitioning into lung and granulomas, while the exposure of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in lesions was markedly lower than in plasma. The extent of penetration in lung and lesions followed different trends for each drug. All four agents distributed rapidly from plasma to tissue with equilibration half-lives of less than 1 min to an hour. The models adequately described the plasma concentrations and reasonably captured actual lesion concentrations. Though further refinement is needed to accurately predict the behavior of these drugs in human subjects, our results enable the integration of lesion-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) indices in clinical trial simulations and in in vitro PK-PD studies with M. tuberculosis.

AB This study investigates the origins of variation in the structures of interorganizational networks across industries. We combine empirical analyses of existing interorganizational networks in six industries with an agent-based simulation model of network emergence. Using data on technology partnerships from 1983 to 1999 between firms in the automotive, biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, microelectronics, new materials, and telecommunications industries, we find that differences in technological dynamism across industries and the concomitant demands for value creation engender variations in firms' collaborative behaviors. On average, firms in technologically dynamic industries pursue more-open ego networks, which fosters access to new and diverse resources that help sustain continuous innovation. In contrast, firms in technologically stable industries on average pursue more-closed ego networks, which fosters reliable collaboration and helps preserve existing resources. We show that because of the observed cross-industry differences in firms' collaborative behaviors, the emergent industry-wide networks take on distinct structural forms. Technologically stable industries feature clan networks, characterized by low network connectedness and rather strong community structures. Technologically dynamic industries feature community networks, characterized by high network connectedness and medium-to-strong community structures. Convention networks, which feature high network connectedness and weak community structures, were not evident among the empirical networks we examined. Taken together, our findings advance an environmental contingency theory of network formation, which proposes a close association between the characteristics of actors' environment and the processes of network formation among actors.

AB Increasing attention to regime shifts, critical transitions, non-marginal changes, and systemic shocks calls for the development of models that are able to reproduce or grow structural changes that occur over time periods perceived as abrupt. This paper highlights specific modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled socio-environmental systems experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reflect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identification. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems are outlined. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Subterranean termites form colonies containing thousands of individuals, and maintain these colonies by consuming wood and other materials containing cellulose. In this consumption process, they cause serious damage to wooden structures. Information on the population size of termites is an important factor in developing strategies aimed at controlling termites. In this study, we provide a reasonable possibility of estimating the population of an incipient nest dug by a colony that has not yet discovered any food source. We build an agent-based model to simulate termite tunnel patterns in which the behavior of simulated termites (agents) is governed by simple rules based on empirical data. The simulated termites do not communicate with each other using pheromones. They move towards the ends of tunnels, excavate when their progress in that direction is blocked, and transport the excavated soil. Using simulations, we determine termite tunnel patterns according to three parameters: the number of simulated termites (N), the passing probability of two encountering termites (P), and the distance moved by termites to deposit soil parcels during tunneling activity (D). We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using 80% of the tunnel patterns and apply the CNN to the remaining patterns to estimate the value of N. The application results show that the validation accuracy is approximately 41% and the training accuracy of the CNN is approximately 51%. Although the validation accuracy is not high, the estimation failures occur near the correct N values.

AB Much of Artificial Intelligence studies agent perception by exploring architectures for Linking (often abstract) sensors and actuators so as to give rise to particular behaviour. By contrast, the approach presented here proposes that perceptual investigations should begin with a characterisation of the underlying physical laws which govern the specific interaction of a sensor (or actuator) with its environment throughout the execution of a task. Moreover, it demonstrates that, through an understanding of task and environment physics, problems for which architectural solutions or explanations are often proposed may be solved more simply at the sensory interface - thereby minimising subsequent computation.
   As an example of this approach, we isolate the relevant physics governing an agent-environment interaction by reverse-engineering an echolocation system from existing ethological descriptions. The biological reference for this work includes several species of tone emitting insectivorous bats which hunt moving targets (i.e. fluttering insects) in acoustically cluttered environments (e.g. under the forest canopy). The simple perceptual mechanism that we hypothesise underlies this behaviour involves a binaural comparison of the spectral sideband energy contained in echoes reflected by targets with periodic motion. This perceptual mechanism can be exploited by any echolocator (with sufficiently narrow acoustical filters) to disambiguate the location of moving targets in the presence of strong stationary reflectors. When this localisation strategy is made to operate on energy in the particular sidebands reflected by targets with particular motions, target selective localisation behaviour emerges.
   The echolocation sensor designed to investigate this hypothesis is demonstrated via computer simulation and tested aboard a mobile robot. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Multipurpose water systems are usually operated on a tradeoff of conflicting operating objectives. Under steady state climatic and socioeconomic conditions, such tradeoff is supposed to represent a fair and/or efficient preference. Extreme variability in external forcing might affect water operators' risk aversion and force a change in her/his preference. Properly accounting for these shifts is key to any rigorous retrospective assessment of the operator's behaviors, and to build descriptive models for projecting the future system evolution. In this study, we explore how the selection of different preferences is linked to variations in the external forcing. We argue that preference selection evolves according to recent, extreme variations in system performance: underperforming in one of the objectives pushes the preference toward the harmed objective. To test this assumption, we developed a rational procedure to simulate the operator's preference selection. We map this selection onto a multilateral negotiation, where multiple virtual agents independently optimize different objectives. The agents periodically negotiate a compromise policy for the operation of the system. Agents' attitudes in each negotiation step are determined by the recent system performance measured by the specific objective they maximize. We then propose a numerical model of preference dynamics that implements a concept from cognitive psychology, the availability bias. We test our modeling framework on a synthetic lake operated for flood control and water supply. Results show that our model successfully captures the operator's preference selection and dynamic evolution driven by extreme wet and dry situations.

AB BackgroundThe majority of Americans consume alcoholic beverages. Alcohol interacts negatively with numerous commonly prescribed medications. Yet, on a population level, little is known about use of alcohol-interactive (AI) prescription medications among drinkers. The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of AI prescription medication use among current drinkers in the U.S. population.
   MethodsData were from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1999 to 2010); 26,657 adults aged 20years had data on past year alcohol consumption and past month prescription medication use. Analyses were adjusted for covariates: age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and smoking. Statistical procedures accounted for survey stratification, clustering, and nonresponse. Analyses were weighted to be nationally representative.
   ResultsThe unadjusted total prevalence of AI medication use was 42.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41.5 to 44.0). Among current drinkers, adjusted prevalence was 41.5% (CI 40.3 to 42.7). Among participants aged 65 total prevalence of AI medication use was 78.6% (CI 77.3 to 79.9) and adjusted prevalence among current drinkers was 77.8% (CI 75.7 to 79.7). The AI medications most commonly used by current drinkers were cardiovascular agents, central nervous system agents, and metabolic agents.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest that there could be substantial simultaneous exposure to alcohol and AI prescription medications in the U.S. population. Given the adverse health risks of combining alcohol with AI prescription medications, future efforts are needed to collect data to determine actual simultaneous prevalence.

AB There are few published examples of comprehensively validated large-scale land-use agent-based models (ABMs). We present guidelines for doing so, and provide an example in the context of the Pampas Model (PM), an ABM aimed to explore the dynamics of structural and land use changes in the agricultural systems of the Argentine Pampas. Many complementary strategies are proposed for validation of ABM's. We adopted a validation framework that relies on two main streams: (a) validation of model processes and components during model development, which involved a literature survey, design based on similar models, involvement of stakeholders, and focused test scenarios and (b) empirical validation, which involved comparisons of model outputs from multiple realistic simulations against real world data. The design process ensured a realistic model ontology and representative behavioral rules. As result, we obtained reasonable outcomes from a set of initial and simplified scenarios: the PM successfully reproduced the direction of the primary observed structural and land tenure patterns, even before calibration. The empirical validation process lead to tuning and further development of the PM. After this, the PM was able to reproduce not only the direction but also the magnitude of the observed changes. The main lesson from our validation process is the need for multiple validation strategies, including empirical validation. Approaches intended to validate model processes and components may lead to structurally realistic models. However, some kind of subsequent empirical validation is needed to assess the model's ability to reproduce observed results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Combining experimental data with computational modeling, we illustrate the capacity of selective gas-phase interactions using neutral gas vapors to yield an additional dimension of gas-phase ion mobility separation. Not only are the mobility shifts as a function of neutral gas vapor concentration reproducible, but also the selective alteration of mobility separation factors is closely linked to existing chemical functional groups. Such information may prove advantageous in elucidating chemical class and resolving interferences. Using a set of chemical warfare agent simulants with nominally the same reduced mobility values as a test case, we illustrate the ability of the drift-gas doping approach to achieve separation of these analytes. In nitrogen, protonated forms of dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) and methyl phosphonic acid (MPA) exhibit the reduced mobility values of 1.99 +/- 0.01 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) at 175 degrees C. However, when the counter current drift gas of the system is doped with 2-propanol at 20 mu L/h, full baseline resolution of the two species is possible. By varying the concentration of the neutral modifier, the separation factor of the respective clusters can be adjusted. For the two species examined and at a 2-propanol flow rate of 160 mu L/h, MPA demonstrated the greatest shift in mobility (1.58 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)) compared the DMMP monomer (1.63 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). Meanwhile, the DMMP dimer experienced no change in mobility (1.45 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)). The enhancement of separation factors appears to be brought about by the differential clustering of neutral modifiers onto different ions and can be explained by a model which considers the transient binding of a single 2-propanol molecule during mobility measurements. Furthermore, the application of the binding models not only provides a thermodynamic foundation for the results obtained but also creates a predictive tool toward a quantitative approach.

AB Given the numerous unknowns and uncertainties in sediment systems, understanding of the mechanisms of U(VI) reduction is still at the stage of improvement. Recent studies have shown that reductive immobilization of U(VI) in the subsurface is not caused by purely biological or purely abiotic reactions but rather a group of interconnected abiotic-biotic pathways (e. g. via mackinawite and biomass). These new findings necessitate an update of the existing mathematical models that make simplifications typically involving a single reducing agent (e. g. indigenous bacteria) for in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated groundwater. In this study, a comprehensive model was constructed based on new experimental observations, including mixed U(VI) reduction by chemical and enzymatic reactions. Thermodynamic analysis was done to predict the feasibility of the potential pathways that affect mackinawite formation under field conditions. Model simulations indicate that low concentrations of the reactant species make the reaction of homogeneous Fe(II) oxidation coupled to U(VI) reduction unfavorable in the field. Instead, FeS precipitation is an important Fe(II) sequestration reaction once sulfate metabolism dominates. The subsequent reduction of U(VI) by FeS (mackinawite) contributes to the total U(VI) removal under a variety of U(VI) concentrations encountered at field sites, which is in accordance with experimental observations. The model suggests the potential for both competition and coordination between chemical and biological pathways on the cell surface, providing a possible explanation as to why U(VI) can be efficiently reduced at either low or high sulfate concentration during the process of in situ bioremediation. Further increase in the resolution of the model (e. g. across multiple scales such as genome-, micron- and pore-sale) is necessary for better understanding of the interactions between biotic and abiotic pathways.

AB The pathogenesis of scrapie in sheep after natural or oral exposure to the infectious agent generally involves the early accumulation of disease-associated prion protein (PrPd) in the lymphoreticular system (LRS). This phase is followed by neuroinvasion, for which two routes, ascending neural and haematogenous, have been postulated. The present study reports the use of immunohistochemistry to track the tissue progression of PrPd deposition in sheep of a single, highly scrapie-susceptible PrP genotype administered by the oral or conjunctival routes. Regardless of the route of infection, the earliest detection of PrPd was in gut- and pharynx-associated LRS tissues. Subsequently, the brain became PrPd positive simultaneously with other LRS tissues, but before the spinal cord and peripheral nervous tissues of the enteric, parasympathetic and sympathetic systems. The sites of initial PrPd accumulation in the brain were the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the hypothalamus and their related circumventricular organs (the area postrema and the median eminence, respectively). These were the same for both routes of infection. Rapid progression to clinical disease was observed in sheep infected orally or conjunctivally, with definite signs of scrapie recorded at around 6 and 8 months after infection, respectively. Longer incubation periods in sheep infected by the conjunctival route were probably due to them receiving a lower dose than those infected orally. Irrespective of the route of infection, clinically affected sheep showed the same pathological phenotype (PrPd profile) and PrPd distribution throughout the brain. The identical peripheral and central pathogenesis observed in sheep of both groups suggests early dissemination of the infectious agent in the bloodstream and a common neuroinvasion pathway. The late involvement of the enteric and autonomic nervous system supports a haematogenous route of infection to the brain. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mechanistic modelling is an engineering approach to simulate reasonable physical and chemical processes to develop a model to describe the behaviour of a system. Mathematical models are commonly adopted to explore the physical limits of a process, and are applied to process development, optimization and control. In this work, the population balance model and the moment technique have been utilized to model a suspension polymerization reactor and predict the dynamic evolution of particle size and molecular weight distributions. These distributions are two important factors that affect the physical, rheological and mechanical properties of a polymer, and its final product quality. The cell average technique has been applied to solve the population balance equation, and demonstrate the model predictive capability by comparing its predictions with those obtained from experimental data published in the literature. In addition, the effects of initiator, chain transfer agent, stabilizer concentrations, temperature, and agitation rate on the final particle size and molecular weight distributions have been investigated. An optimal control strategy has been used to obtain the desired molecular weight distribution by manipulating the initiator concentration, concentration of the chain transfer agent and its addition time, and controlling the reactor temperature. Also, the impeller speed and initial value of the stabilizer have been utilized to achieve the desired final particle size distribution. The simulation results indicate that the control objectives have been achieved, and show that the proposed controllers are robust to a mismatched model.

AB The aim of this work was to microencapsulate vitamin B1 by spray-drying using different encapsulating agents (arabic gum, carrageenan, chitosan, maltodextrin, modified chitosan, modified starch, pectin, sodium alginate, and xanthan) and to characterize the microcapsules and study their release. Microcapsules with a 0.25% (w/w) content of vitamin B1 were produced. The product yield results ranged from 17%-52% and the encapsulation efficiency from 66%-100%. Three categories of morphology, regular spherical shape, irregular spherical shape with rough surface, and irregular shape, were identified. Their sizes, determined by laser granulometry, ranged from 0.11-1.32 mu m, in terms of number distribution, and from 3.76-34.43 mu m, in volume distribution. Controlled release studies were performed by spectrophotometric analysis, in deionized water (20 degrees C) and simulated gastric fluid (37 degrees C). Different release behaviours were observed from just 10 seconds (modified starch) up to more than 24 hours (xanthan). Kinetic models such as zero-order, first-order, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas, and Weibull were applied. The Weibull model showed the best fitting with the experimental data. All release tests were repeated after 4 months and showed good stability over time. A mass loss of vitamin B1 lower than 20% was detected. This study demonstrates the possibility of encapsulating vitamin B1 using different encapsulating agents by a spray-drying technique. Depending on the intended applications, for fast release, adequate results were obtained for maltodextrin, arabic gum, modified chitosan, and sodium alginate, and for slow release, adequate results were only obtained for chitosan and pectin.

ID HUMAN-BEHAVIOR; RECOGNITION; SIMULATION; DEMENTIA
AB Older adults with early-stage dementia (ED) can experience confusion or lack clarity when performing routine activities of daily living (ADLs). These circumstances predispose the older adult to safety-critical and often risky situations. A safety-critical risky situation is one that constitutes a hazard. To support independent living, a sensor-laden smart environment can be employed to mitigate such hazards. In this paper, we propose a situation-centered goal reinforcement framework that supports older adults with ED in their decision making, and guides them through their ADL in order to fulfill their goal or intention and avoid hazards. First, we employ an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to infer the current goal of the resident, using their previously observed normal ADL patterns. Secondly, we identify potentially risky situations in their currently observed goal path. We then incorporate a situ-learning agent (SLA) that helps an inhabitant to make the right decision, thus preventing adverse events while guiding her through the task sequence that leads to her goal state. In addition, we use a naive agent to simulate episodes of confusion similar to those that might be experienced by older adults with ED. We validated our method against an open-source dementia dataset (Quesada et al., 2015) by considering four types of ADLs as case studies. We achieved an accuracy of 90.1% for our goal inference model, higher than the accuracies reported by related studies. We also reported other metrics including precision, recall and f1-score for goal inference model. Finally, SLA's action recommendations relevance was evaluated accordingly.

AB The recovery of whale species at risk requires the implementation of protection measures designed to mitigate the risks posed by various stressors. In the St. Lawrence Estuary (Canada), several whale species are threatened by navigation activities in various ways. Since 2013, seasonal voluntary ship strike mitigation measures, including a speed reduction area (SRA) and a no-go area, were implemented annually and largely adopted by the maritime industry to reduce the risks of lethal collisions with four species of baleen whales. While the endangered St. Lawrence beluga population is unlikely to be subject to collisions with large merchant ships, it is known to be negatively affected by vessel-generated underwater noise. To assess how these protection measures modify the beluga's soundscape throughout their critical habitat, we implemented an underwater acoustic module within an existing agent-based model (3MTSim) of ship-whale movements and interactions in the St. Lawrence Estuary. We ran multiple simulations for two scenarios 1) without and 2) with the protection measures to compare the level of noise received by belugas before and after 2013. Overall, the simulations showed a statistically-significant 1.6% decrease in the total amount of noise received by belugas in their critical habitat following the implementation of the protection measures. Although slowing down ships reduces instantaneous radiated noise, it also increases the total amount of acoustic energy released in the environment by extending the time spent in the SRA. Accordingly, our simulations showed a 2.4% increase in the cumulative noise from shipping received by beluga in the SRA. Conversely, belugas located in the Upper Estuary, mostly females and calves, i.e., the most valuable individuals experienced a 5.4% reduction in the cumulative received level of shipping noise. Although refinements are required to improve the modelling of noise sources and propagation for finer scale projections in this complex nearshore environment, this agent -based modelling paradigm of 3MTSim proved informative for underwater acoustic impact assessments.

AB For efficient blast furnace ironmaking, it is desired to have low reducing agent rate, primarily coke rate. Developing technology to improve reaction efficiency of the blast furnace is extremely important as it has the potential to allow a decrease in the reducing agent rate as well as CO2 emissions. The reaction efficiency of blast furnace can be improved by lowering the Thermal Reserve Zone (TRZ) temperature; which is also the starting temperature of coke gasification reaction. In present study, nut-coke has been coated with in-plant waste, consisting mainly of iron oxide and calcium oxide, as catalyst. There was a clear increase of 10 points in the reactivity of coated nut-coke. The coated nut-coke have been subjected to non-standard high temperature experiments simulating blast furnace conditions with reducing gas consisting of CO, CO2 and N-2 to capture the effect of catalytic coating on the onset of gasification reaction. The high temperature experiments carried out advise the following: i) A drop of 100 degrees C in the reaction beginning temperature of catalyst coated nut-coke as compared to non-coated one ii) A typical calculation shows that the lowering of reaction beginning temperature corresponds to a potential carbon rate savings of about 2.5kg/ton of hot metal (thm). Furthermore, in a trial conducted at blast furnace with charging catalyst coated nut-coke, it has been observed that the carbon rate during the trial period was 3kg/thm lower than the base period. The findings of blast furnace trial agree with that of the experimental one.

AB This paper reports the simultaneous preconcentration and separation of trace amounts of V species in synthetic solutions and seawater with palmitoyl quinolin-8-ol bonded amberlite XAD 2 copolymer resin column prior to simultaneous speciation analysis. Both V(IV) and V(V) species could be sorbed and preconcentrated by the resin. Both vanadium species were quantitatively eluted together from the resin column using HCl as stripping agent and used for speciation studies. For the speciation analysis of eluted V species, the selected route involved spectrophotometric determination of total vanadium with 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol (PAR) and vanadate estimation by masking vanadyl with 1,2 cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid (CDTA). The preconcentrated V species were assayed spectrophotometrically with PAR at 542 nm, and the results were compared with those of FAAS. The detection limits of V(V) with spectrophotometry and FAAS were 1.6 and 0.9 mug l(-1), respectively. The optimal experimental parameters such as pH, sample flow rate, desorption flow rate, redox behaviour of V(IV) and V(V) in resin and volume of eluent and sample were investigated. The values obtained for the preconcentration factor by the two methods were nearly consistent, and were in the range 150-fold. Analysis of certified reference material (IAEA-405) by the proposed method showed good agreement with the certified value. The established procedure was employed for preconcentrating the vanadium species from artificial and real seawater. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The development of high throughput genomic and bioinformatic analysis tools, coupled with established molecular techniques, has allowed new insights into the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. In humans, coxasackievirus B3 (CVB3) is the primary etiological agent of viral myocarditis, an inflammatory disease process involving the heart muscle. Early host cellular survival and apoptotic mechanisms during viral infections, as well as immune events, affect myocarditis progression and outcome. Therefore, our laboratory has been keenly interested in infectomics, defined here as the transcriptional events of both virus and host. We first elucidated up- or downregulated transcriptional activities in CVB3-infected hearts by mRNA differential display. Further characterization of these regulated genes including Nip21, IP10, and IGTPase, and study of their role in CVB3-infection are underway. In further dissection of the stages of myocarditis-peak viremia, inflammatory infiltration and tissue repair-we used cDNA microarrays to probe differential gene expression in the myocardium following virus infection. Following virus infection, there are global decreases in metabolic and mitochondrial genes, increases in signaling genes and distinctive patterns in other functional groups. To,establish early gene expression profiles in infected cells by themselves, we also used oligonucleotide arrays in an in vitro model of CVB3 infection. Notably, we have found increased expression of transcription factors c-fos and c-jun downstream of extracellular signal-related kinase, a pathway which is crucial for virus replication and pathogenesis. Our investigations based on gene profiling following CVB3 infection have thus far been fruitful in providing new experimental leads. High throughput genetic analysis has allowed us to simultaneously try on greater, than 12,000 potential genetic "glass slippers." Our in vitro experimental plan has enabled us to chart prominent patterns of gene expression, analyzed by novel bioinformatic approaches, and to separate varied and potentially significant gene expression events.

TI Formaldehyde-induced alkylation of a 2 '-aminoglucose rebeccamycin

AB Rebeccamycin derivatives represent a promising class of antitumor agents. In this series, two glycosylated indolocarbazoles, NB-506 and NSC-655649, are currently undergoing clinical trials. Their anticancer activities are associated with their capacities to interact with DNA and to inhibit DNA topoisomerases. Previous studies revealed that the planar indolocarbazole chromophore can intercalate into DNA, locating the appended carbohydrate residue in one of the two helical grooves, probably the minor groove as is the case with the anthracyclines and other DNA-binding antibiotics. The sugar residue contributes significantly to the DNP; binding free energy of NB-506. However, the exact positioning of the glycosyl residue of rebeccamycin derivatives in the drug-DNA complex remains poorly understood. To better understand how glycosylated indolocarbazoles interact with DNA, we investigated the interaction of a rebeccamycin derivative (85) bearing a 2'-amino group on the sugar residue. We show that the presence of the 2'-amino function permits the formation of covalent drug-DNA complexes in the presence of formaldehyde. Complementary biochemical and spectroscopic measurements attest that 85 reacts covalently with the 2-amino group of guanines exposed in the minor groove of the double helix, as is the case with daunomycin. In contrast to daunomycin, 85 also forms cross-links with an oligonucleotide containing only A.T base pairs. The covalent binding to A.T base pairs was detected using a gel mobility shift assay and was independently confirmed by thermal denaturation studies and by fluorescence measurements using a series of synthetic polynucleotides. The HCHO-mediated alkylation reaction of the drug with A.T base pairs apparently involves the 6-amino group of adenines exposed in the major groove whereas the covalent attachment to G.C base pairs implicates the 2-amino group of guanines situated in the opposite minor groove. Therefore, the results suggest that either the drug is able to switch grooves in response to sequence or it can simultaneously bind to both the minor and major grooves of the double helix. This study will help to guide the rational design of new DNA-binding antitumor indolocarbazole drugs and also provides a general experimental approach for probing minor versus major groove interactions between small molecules and DNA.

AB Triethyl phosphate (TEP) is an organophosphorus compound used as a simulant for highly toxic nerve agents such as sarin GB. A high temperature decomposition pathway during TEP pyrolysis has been proposed previously and takes place via seven concerted elimination reactions. A computational study to investigate the kinetics of these seven reactions was carried out at the CBS-QB3 level of theory. The transition state optimization was done at the B3LYP/6-311G(2d,d,p) theory level, and CanTherm was used to derive the Arrhenius coefficients. The pre-exponential factors of the rate constant of these reactions were found to be up to SO times lower than the estimated values from the literature. In addition, kinetics of reaction of the trioxidophosphorus radical (PO3) with H-2 (H-2 + PO3 -> HOPO2 + H), which is one of the important reactions in predicting CO formation during TEP decomposition, was also investigated computationally at the same theory level. The new kinetic parameters derived from the computational study were used with the TEP kinetic model proposed recently by our group. In addition, an alternative decomposition pathway for TEP decomposition via H-abstraction, radical decomposition, and recombination reactions was added. The proposed mechanism was validated with the literature's experimental data, that is, intermediate CO time-history data from pyrolysis and oxidation experiments and ignition delay times. Fairly good agreement with experiments was obtained for pyrolysis and oxidation CO yield within 1200-1700 K. The model was able to predict the ignition times of the rich TEP mixture (psi = 2) within 25% of the experimental results, while the discrepancies for stoichiometric and rich mixtures were larger. Discussions on results of sensitivity and reaction pathway analysis are presented to identify the important phosphorus reactions and to understand the effect of addition of the alternative TEP decomposition pathway.

AB A new pyridine-containing ligand, N,N'-bis(6-carboxy-2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'- diacetic acid (H4L), has been designed for the complexation of lanthanide ions. H-1 and C-13 NMR studies in D2O solutions show octadentate binding of the ligand to the Ln(III). ions through the nitrogen atoms of two amine groups, the oxygen atoms of four carboxylates, and the two nitrogen atoms of the pyridine rings. Luminescence measurements demonstrate that both Eu-III. and Tb-III complexes are nine-coordinate, whereby a water molecule completes the Ln(III). coordination sphere. Ligand L can sensitize both the Eu-III and Tb-III luminescence; however, the quantum yields of the Eu-III- and Tb-III-centered luminescence remain modest. This is explained in terms of energy differences between the singlet and triplet states on the one hand, and between the 0-phonon transition of the triplet state and the excited metal ion states on the other. The anionic [Ln(L)(H2O)](-) complexes (Ln=La, Pr, and Gd) were also characterized by theoretical calculations both in vacuo and in aqueous solution (PCM model) at the HF level by means of the 3-21G* basis set for the ligand atoms and a 46+4f(n) effective core potential for the lanthanides. The structures obtained from these theoretical calculations are in very good agreement with the experimental solution structures, as demonstrated by paramagnetic NMR measurements (lanthanide-induced shifts and relaxation-rate enhancements). Data sets obtained from variable-temperature O-17 NMR at 7.05 T and variable-temperature H-1 nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion (NMRD) on the Gd-III. complex were fitted simultaneously to give insight into the parameters that govern the water H-1 relaxivity. The water exchange rate (k(ex)(298) = 5.0 x 10(6) s(-1)) is slightly faster than in [Gd(dota)- (H2O)](-) (DOTA=1,4,7,10-tetrakis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclodode- cane). Fast rotation limits the relaxivity under the usual MRI conditions.

AB This paper examines the role of coalition formation in the empirically observed negative correlation between employment protection and unemployment benefit. We study an economy composed of four groups of agents (capitalists, unemployed people, low- and high-skilled workers), each one represented by a politician. Politicians first form political parties and then compete in a winner-takes-all election by simultaneously proposing policy bundles composed of an employment protection level and an unemployment benefit. We first show that, in the absence of parties (i.e., in a citizen-candidate model), low-skilled workers are decisive and support a maximum employment protection level together with some unemployment benefit. We then obtain that, under some conditions, allowing for party formation results in all policy equilibria belonging to the Pareto set of the coalition formed by high-skilled workers together with unemployed people. Policies in this Pareto set exhibit a negative correlation between employment protection and unemployment benefit.

AB Nuclear receptor REV-ERB beta is an overexpressed oncoprotein that has been used as a target for cancer treatment. The metal-complex nature of its ligand, iron protoporphyrin IX (Heme), enables the REV-ERB beta to be used for multiple therapeutic modalities as a photonuclease, a photosensitizer, or a fluorescence imaging agent. The replacement of iron with cobalt as the metal center of protoporphyrin IX changes the ligand from an agonist to an antagonist of REV-ERB beta. The mechanism behind that phenomenon is still unclear, despite the availability of crystal structures of REV-ERB beta in complex with Heme and cobalt protoporphyrin IX (CoPP). This study used molecular dynamic simulations to compare the effects of REV-ERB beta binding to Heme and CoPP, respectively. The initial poses of Heme and CoPP in complex with agonist and antagonist forms of REV-ERB beta were predicted using molecular docking. The binding energies of each ligand were calculated using the MM/PBSA method. The computed binding affinity of Heme to REV-ERB beta was stronger than that of CoPP, in agreement with experimental results. CoPP altered the conformation of the ligand-binding site of REV-ERB beta, disrupting the binding site for nuclear receptor corepressor, which is required for REV-ERB beta to regulate the transcription of downstream target genes. Those results suggest that a subtle change in the metal center of porphyrin can change the behavior of porphyrin in cancer cell signaling. Therefore, modification of porphyrin-based agents for cancer therapy should be conducted carefully to avoid triggering unfavorable effects.

AB The ability of large macromolecules to exhibit nontrivial deviations in colligative properties of their aqueous solutions is well-appreciated in polymer physics. Here, we show that this colligative nonideality subjects giant lipid vesicles containing inert macromolecular crowding agents to osmotic pressure differentials when bathed in small-molecule osmolytes at comparable concentrations. The ensuing influx of water across the semipermeable membrane induces characteristic swell-burst cycles: here, cyclical and damped oscillations in size, tension, and membrane phase separation occur en route to equilibration. Mediated by synchronized formation of transient pores, these cycles orchestrate pulsewise ejection of macromolecules from the vesicular interior reducing the osmotic differential in a stepwise manner. These experimental findings are fully corroborated by a theoretical model derived by explicitly incorporating the contributions of the solution viscosity, solute diffusivity, and the colligative nonideality of the osmotic pressure in a previously reported continuum description. Simulations based on this model account for the differences in the details of the noncolligatively induced swell-burst cycles, including numbers and periods of the repeating cycles, as well as pore lifetimes. Taken together, our observations recapitulate behaviors of vesicles and red blood cells experiencing sudden osmotic shocks due to large (hundreds of osmolars) differences in the concentrations of small molecule osmolytes and link intravesicular macromolecular crowding with membrane remodeling. They further suggest that any tendency for spontaneous overcrowding in single giant vesicles is opposed by osmotic stresses and requires independent specific interactions, such as associative chemical interactions or those between the crowders and the membrane boundary.

AB The microstructure of acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) was shown to be dependent on the polymerization conditions. The NBR investigated in the current study was obtained via radical copolymerization under azeotropic conditions (AN/BD = 38/62) in organic solution in the presence of either a conventional chain transfer agent or a reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent. The variation in the polymer microstructure was proven to originate from different radical environments during the polymerizations with initial radical initiator concentrations in the polymerizations studied ranging from 1.0 mM to 34.1 mM. The variation of the polymer microstructure was evidenced by triple SEC measurements, making use of the simultaneous determination of molecular weights with two independent methods, namely on-line viscometry and on-line light scattering. It is additionally evidenced that the microstructure shows a gradual variation during the course of a polymerization, a behaviour observed when the polymerizations were performed in the presence of an elevated initial radical initiator concentration. Furthermore, experimental evidence for the variation of the NBR microstructure during RAFT polymerizations is provided. At low conversions, a rather uniform polymer is obtained. With increasing conversion, a loss of the controlled character is observed and the microstructures approach those of nitrile rubber obtained by conventionally controlled free radical copolymerizations employing mercaptane transfer agents. Despite the differences in the polymer microstructure, it is possible to report a single set of MHKS parameters for the prepared NBR with azeotropic composition. A linear regression of the Mark-Houwink plots of the samples polymerized under different conditions gives values of K = (49.5 +/- 5.5) x 10(-5) dL g(-1) and alpha = 0.689 +/- 0.010 with a low error margin for SEC separation in THF at 25 degrees C. Weight average molecular weights of the investigated NBR samples were in the range of 40 000 to 155 000 g mol(-1). The molecular weights of the copolymers determined via universal calibration with the MHKS parameters presented in the current study show a good agreement with molecular weights obtained from light scattering, underpinning the veracity of the obtained parameters.

AB In this contribution we studied how different rendering styles of a virtual human impacted users' visual attention in an interactive medical training simulator. In a mixed design experiment, 78 participants interacted with a virtual human representing a sample from the non-photorealistic (NPR) to the photorealistic (PR) rendering continuity. We presented five rendering style samples scenarios, namely All Pencil Shaded (APS), Pencil Shaded (PS), All Cartoon Shaded (ACT), Cartoon Shaded (CT), and Human-Like (HL), and compared how visual attention differed between groups of users. For this study, we employed an eye tracking system for collecting and analyzing users' gaze during interaction with the virtual human in a failure to rescue medical training simulation. Results shows that users spent more total time in the APS and ACT conditions but users visually attended more to virtual humans in the PS, CT and HL appearance conditions.

AB The problem of the leader-following formation control of nonholonomic mobile robots is addressed in this paper. A distributed formation control strategy using explicitly the coordination errors among robots is proposed without assuming that each follower robot knows the full state of the leader. First, a distributed estimation law is proposed for each follower robot to estimate the states, including the position, orientation, and linear velocity of the leader. The distributed formation control law is then designed based on the estimated states of the leader, and the neighborhood formation tracking error. Under some mild assumptions on the interaction graph among the leader and the follower robots, and the velocity of the leader, asymptotic convergence of formation tracking errors to zero can be achieved. Finally, some numerical simulations and experiments on a group of nonholonomic mobile robots are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

TI Understanding contagion dynamics through microscopic processes in active
   Brownian particles
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID EPIDEMIC; SYSTEM; MODEL
AB Together with the universally recognized SIR model, several approaches have been employed to understand the contagion dynamics of interacting particles. Here, Active Brownian particles (ABP) are introduced to model the contagion dynamics of living agents that perform a horizontal transmission of an infectious disease in space and time. By performing an ensemble average description of the ABP simulations, we statistically describe susceptible, infected, and recovered groups in terms of particle densities, activity, contagious rates, and random recovery times. Our results show that ABP reproduces the time dependence observed in traditional compartmental models such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovery (SIR) models and allows us to explore the critical densities and the contagious radius that facilitates the virus spread. Furthermore, we derive a first-principles analytical expression for the contagion rate in terms of microscopic parameters, without considering free parameters as the classical SIR-based models. This approach offers a novel alternative to incorporate microscopic processes into analyzing SIR-based models with applications in a wide range of biological systems.

AB Male-haploidy has independently evolved several times in different phylogenetic groups and has led to various extant lineages in the insects, Arachnida and Rotifera. Although the stability of male-haploidy as an evolutionary strategy is not well understood, various theories address the invasion of male-haploidy in diploid populations. Here two of these theories: (i) the maternal transmission hypothesis (MTH) and (ii) the deleterious mutation hypothesis (DMH), are re-investigated with an agent-based model to understand the role of genetic drift as a mechanism facilitating the spread of male-haploidy. These two hypotheses are analysed separately and comparatively, and the results suggest dominance of the MTH. In addition, comparison of the stochastic results to deterministic results using the same model structure shows how genetic drift can enhance the parameter space where male-haploidy can be expected to invade.

AB Background Increasingly complex models have been developed to characterize the transmission dynamics of malaria. The multiplicity of malaria transmission factors calls for a realistic modelling approach that incorporates various complex factors such as the effect of control measures, behavioural impacts of the parasites to the vector, or socio-economic variables. Indeed, the crucial impact of household size in eliminating malaria has been emphasized in previous studies. However, increasing complexity also increases the difficulty of calibrating model parameters. Moreover, despite the availability of much field data, a common pitfall in malaria transmission modelling is to obtain data that could be directly used for model calibration. Methods In this work, an approach that provides a way to combine in situ field data with the parameters of malaria transmission models is presented. This is achieved by agent-based stochastic simulations, initially calibrated with hut-level experimental data. The simulation results provide synthetic data for regression analysis that enable the calibration of key parameters of classical models, such as biting rates and vector mortality. In lieu of developing complex dynamical models, the approach is demonstrated using most classical malaria models, but with the model parameters calibrated to account for such complex factors. The performance of the approach is tested against a wide range of field data for Entomological Inoculation Rate (EIR) values. Results The overall transmission characteristics can be estimated by including various features that impact EIR and malaria incidence, for instance by reducing the mosquito-human contact rates and increasing the mortality through control measures or socio-economic factors. Conclusion Complex phenomena such as the impact of the coverage of the population with long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), changes in behaviour of the infected vector and the impact of socio-economic factors can be included in continuous level modelling. Though the present work should be interpreted as a proof of concept, based on one set of field data only, certain interesting conclusions can already be drawn. While the present work focuses on malaria, the computational approach is generic, and can be applied to other cases where suitable in situ data is available.

AB We examined the effect of the A(3) adenosine receptor (AR) agonist IB-MECA on infarct size in an open-chest anesthetized dog model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Dogs were subjected to 60 min of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion and 3 h of reperfusion. Infarct size and regional myocardial blood flow were assessed by macrohistochemical staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride and radioactive microspheres, respectively. Four experimental groups were studied: vehicle control (50% DMSO in normal saline), IB-MECA (100 mug/kg iv bolus) given 10 min before the coronary occlusion, IB-MECA (100 mug/kg iv bolus) given 5 min before initiation of reperfusion, and IB-MECA (100 mug/kg iv bolus) given 10 min before coronary occlusion in dogs pretreated 15 min earlier with the ATP-dependent potassium channel antagonist glibenclamide (0.3 mg/kg iv bolus). Administration of IB-MECA had no effect on any hemodynamic parameter measured including heart rate, first derivative of left ventricular pressure, aortic pressure, LAD coronary blood flow, or coronary collateral blood flow. Nevertheless, pretreatment with IB-MECA before coronary occlusion produced a marked reduction in infarct size (similar to40% reduction) compared with the control group (13.0 +/- 3.2% vs. 25.2 +/- 3.7% of the area at risk, respectively). This effect of IB-MECA was blocked completely in dogs pretreated with glibenclamide. An equivalent reduction in infarct size was observed when IB-MECA was administered immediately before reperfusion (13.1 +/- 3.9%). These results are the first to demonstrate efficacy of an A(3)AR agonist in a large animal model of myocardial infarction by mechanisms that are unrelated to changes in hemodynamic parameters and coronary blood flow. These data also demonstrate in an in vivo model that IB-MECA is effective as a cardioprotective agent when administered at the time of reperfusion.

AB Diffusion plays a key role in many biochemical reaction systems seen in nature. Scenarios where diffusion behavior is critical can be seen in the cell and subcellular compartments where molecular crowding limits the interaction between particles. We investigate the application of a computational method for modeling the diffusion of molecules and macromolecules in three-dimensional solutions using agent based modeling. This method allows for realistic modeling of a system of particles with different properties such as size, diffusion coefficients, and affinity as well as the environment properties such as viscosity and geometry. Simulations using these movement probabilities yield behavior that mimics natural diffusion. Using this modeling framework, we simulate the effects of molecular crowding on effective diffusion and have validated the results of our model using Langevin dynamics simulations and note that they are in good agreement with previous experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate an extension of this framework where single discrete cells can contain multiple particles of varying size in an effort to highlight errors that can arise from discretization that lead to the unnatural behavior of particles undergoing diffusion. Subsequently, we explore various algorithms that differ in how they handle the movement of multiple particles per cell and suggest an algorithm that properly accommodates multiple particles of various sizes per cell that can replicate the natural behavior of these particles diffusing. Finally, we use the present modeling framework to investigate the effect of structural geometry on the directionality of diffusion in the cell cytoskeleton with the observation that parallel orientation in the structural geometry of actin filaments of filopodia and the branched structure of lamellipodia can give directionality to diffusion at the filopodia-lamellipodia interface.

AB Objective: Unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) oligodeoxynucleotides are highly frequent motifs in bacterial DNA and rare in the mammalian genome. They are potent inducers of inflammatory cytokines and act synergistically with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for the induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) production in vivo. It has therefore been suggested that innate immune reaction to bacterial unmethylated CpG motifs might contribute to the development of septic shock. We designed this study to assess the sensitization role of CpG motifs in LPS-induced shock using the D-galactosamine (D-GalN)-sensitized mouse model. Design: A prospective, randomized in vivo animal laboratory study. Setting: Experimental research laboratory. Intervention: We performed experiments in which CpG, LPS and D-GalN were administrated sequentially in various orders or simultaneously in 8week-old BALB/c mice. Measurements and results: Cytosine-phosphate-guanine treatment potentiated LPS action only if injected prior to LPS. A combination of predefined sublethal doses of CpG (1 nmol/mouse) and LPS (1 ng/mouse) not only had a synergetic effect on TNF-alpha production (20.3 +/- 9.2 IU/ml versus 2.5 +/- 1.4 IU/ml and 5.6 +/- 3.4 IU/ml for CpG and LPS C, groups, respectively, p < 0.05), but also led to animal death (5/5). An CpG effect requires de novo mRNA synthesis, since the sensitizing effect was inhibited by co-administration of mRNA transcription inhibitors such as D-GalN and pentoxifylline, which is a specific TNF-alpha transcription inhibitor. Furthermore, CpG treatment provoked a strong TNF-alpha mRNA production in the liver that was dramatically reduced by pre-treatment with D-GalN. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that CpG motifs act synergistically with LPS by initializing the synthesis of TNF-alpha and/or TNF-alpha regulating factors, thereby acting as a sensitizing agent.

AB This work is devoted to reduce spontaneous sublimation of ammonium azide at ambient and elevated temperatures by means of two microencapsulation techniques involving solvent/non-solvent and solvent evaporation methods in which stearic acid, Viton and nitrocellulose (NC) have been tested as coating agents. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to examine the coating morphology. The thermal behavior of pure and coated ammonium azide samples have been studied by using simultaneous thermogravimetery-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results showed that ammonium azide microparticle could be effectively coated with nitrocellulose through a solvent/non-solvent experiment in which the coating quality depends on some experimental factors such as coating agent to NH4N3 weight ratio and volume and addition time of non-solvent. The effect of these factors on coating quality and thermal properties of NH4N3 has been revealed by results of SEM and thermal experiments. The most stabilized coated ammonium azide was achieved by using 4.5% (w/w) of NC as stabilizer, and by addition of 30 ml n-hexane as non-solvent within 75 min, where the maximum sublimation temperature increases about 30 degrees C with respect to uncoated sample and reaches to 145.5 degrees C. The influence of the heating rate (5, 10, 15 and 20 degrees C/min) on the DSC behavior of the pure and coated ammonium azide particles at the optimum condition was verified, whereas sublimation temperature of the NH4N3 was increased as the heating rate was increased. Also, the kinetic parameters such as the activation energy and frequency factor of the sublimation processes for pure and coated ammonium azide were obtained from the DSC data by non-isothermal methods proposed by Kissinger and Ozawa. The results showed that, activation energy for sublimation of completely coated NH4N3 particles is considerably higher than (nearly 1.5 times) that of the pure one. Also, the first order rate constant of sublimation of completely coated sample is noticeably lower than that of pure sample (k(coat)/k(pure); = 3 x 10(-4)). The kinetic results led us to conclude that the applied microencapsulation technique caused efficient stabilization of volatile NH4N3. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB A new class of potent DNA binding agents is presented. Dimeric calix[4]arenes with cationic groups at their upper rims and flexible alkyl bridges can be synthesized from triply acyl-protected calix[4]arene tetramines in relatively short synthetic sequences (35 steps). The compounds attach themselves to double-stranded nucleic acids in a noncovalent fashion, with micro- to nanomolar affinities. Guanidinium headgroups with their extended hydrogen-bonding fingers are more powerful than ammonium groups, and the benzylamine series is superior to the anilinium series (see below). The new ligands easily distinguish between RNA and various DNA types, and produce characteristic changes in UV/Vis, fluorescence, CD, as well as NMR spectra. Especially extended oligonucleotides of more than 100 base pairs are bound with affinities increasing from RNA (10 mu M Kd)<AT-rich (1 mu M)<GC-rich DNA double strands (10010 nM). Ethidium bromide displacement studies confirm this order. CE50 values are remarkably low (14 mu M), and are more than 300 times lower than that of spermine, which is a typical backbone binder. Stoichiometries are rather high (one calixarene dimer per two BP), suggesting a potential aggregation of bound ligands inside the major groove. Most UV/Vis melting curves display an inverted shape, and start from drastically enhanced absorption intensities for the DNA complexes. DAPI displacement studies prove that up to one equivalent of calixarene dimer can be accommodated in the dye-loaded DNA. RNA complexation by calixarene dimers is accompanied by a drastic CD spectral transition from the typical A-form to a perfect B-signature, providing further experimental evidence for major-groove binding. The orientation of the ligands can be deduced from NMR titrations and is reproduced in Monte-Carlo simulations on 1:1 complexes in water.

AB Background Mechanical stimulation of the stretch receptors of the gastric wall can simulate the presence of indigested food leading to reduced food intake. We report the preliminary experimental results of an innovative concept of localized mechanical gastric stimulation. Methods In a first survival study, a biocompatible bulking agent was injected either in the greater curvature (n = 8) or in the cardia wall (n = 8) of Wistar rats. Six animals served as sham. Changes of bulking volume, leptin levels and weight gain were monitored for 3 months. In a second acute study, a micro-motor (n = 10; MM) or a size-paired inactive device (n = 10; ID) where applied on the cardia, while 10 additional rats served as sham. Serum ghrelin and leptin were measured at baseline and every hour (T0-T1-T2-T3), during 3 h. In a third study, 24 implants of various shapes and sizes were introduced into the gastric subserosa of 6 Yucatan pigs. Monthly CT scans and gastroscopies were done for 6 months. Results Weight gain in the CW group was significant lower after 2 weeks and 3 months when compared to the shame and GC (p = 0.01/p = 0.01 andp = 0.048/p = 0.038 respectively). Significant lower increase of leptin production occurred at 2 weeks (p = 0.01) and 3 months (p = 0.008) in CW vs. SG. In the MM groupsignificant reduction of the serum ghrelin was seen after 3 h. Leptin was significantly increased in both MM and ID groups after 3 h, while it was significantly reduced in sham rats. The global device retention was 43.5%. Devices with lower profile and with a biocompatible coating remained more likely in place without complications. Conclusions Gastric mechanical stimulation induced a reduced weight gain and hormonal changes. Low profile and coated devices inserted within the gastric wall are more likely to be integrated.

AB The Kluyveromyces lactis lac4 mutants, lacking the beta-galactosidase gene, cannot assimilate lactose, but grow normally on many other carbon sources. However, when these carbon sources and lactose were simultaneously present in the growth media, the mutants were unable to grow. The effect of lactose was cytotoxic since the addition of lactose to an exponentially-growing culture resulted in 90% loss of viability of the lac4 cells. An osmotic stabilizing agent prevented cells killing, supporting the hypothesis that the lactose toxicity could be mainly due to intracellular osmotic pressure. Deletion of the lactose permease gene, LAC12, abolished the inhibitory effect of lactose and allowed the cell to assimilate other carbon substrates. The lac4 strains gave rise, with unusually high frequency, to spontaneous mutants tolerant to lactose (larI mutation: lactose resistant). These mutants were unable to take up lactose. Indeed, larI mutation turned out to be allelic to LAC12. The high mutability of the LAC12 locus may be an advantage for survival of K lactis whose main habitat is lactose-containing niches.

TI Amidoximation of cross-linked polyacrylonitrile fiber and its highly

SO POLYMER BULLETIN

ID CHELATING RESINS; EXTRACTION; NANOFIBERS
AB Fibrous adsorbent functionalized with amidoxime group has been recognized as the most potentially adsorbing material for recovering gallium from Bayer liquors, but the practical process has not been so attractive owing to the performance decreasing in strongly alkaline conditions. The purpose of this research aims to enhance the Ga/V selectivity and efficiency of extraction and retain the mechanical stability of the adsorbent by cross-linking the polyacrylonitrile fiber before amidoximation. In this study, cross-linking amidoxime-functionalized PAN fiber (C-PAO) was prepared by cross-linking polyacrylonitrile fiber through triethylene tetramine. Subsequently, the cross-linked PAN fiber was reacted with hydroxylamine at 70 degrees C and the C-PAO fiber was obtained. C-PAN and C-PAO were characterized with Fourier transmission infrared spectrometer, scanning electron microscope and single-fiber electronic tensile strength tester, respectively. The performance of C-PAO for gallium adsorption was measured by batch and multilevel adsorption experiments. Experimental data showed that the maximum static adsorption capacity of Ga in simulating Bayer liquor was 26.9mg/g, and the equilibrium adsorption time was 60min which indicated that the shorter exposure time equated to the less degradation of the amidoxime groups and the reduction of mechanical performance. The extraction efficiency of gallium was more than 85% using hydrochloric acid (1mol/L) as stripping agent. The maximum static adsorption capacity in Bayer liquor was 17.6mg/g, and the saturated adsorption time was 140min, which are both better than that of commodity gallium-recycled resin. In addition, after four-stage adsorption by C-PAO, gallium was entirely adsorbed while a reduction of vanadium is no more than 20%, which showed a good selective adsorption of gallium. In conclusion, the C-PAO fiber is a highly effective adsorbent for enrichment and separation of gallium in the presence of competitive ions such as V5+ and Al3+ in strongly alkaline Bayer liquid.

AB In this work, simultaneous inferential control of particle size distribution (PSD) and molecular weight distribution (MWD) in a semi-batch emulsion polymerization reactor of styrene has been addressed. Using a comprehensive dynamic model for PSD and MWD predictions and performing a sensitivity analysis, it has been revealed that free surfactant and chain transfer agent (CTA) concentrations in the reactor are the most suitable candidates for inferential control of PSD and MWD, respectively. To control concentrations of these species in the reactor, their inlet feed flow rates are used as manipulated variables. It is assumed that the concentration of CIA is measured infrequently and therefore an open-looped observer, based on the reaction calorimetry, has been designed to estimate the CIA concentration. The infrequent measurements of CIA concentration are used to correct its estimation. As the online measuring of the ionic free surfactant concentration is also difficult, solution conductivity which is a good indication of free surfactant concentration is used for control purposes. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed control scheme is satisfactory even in the presence of model mismatch. POLYM. ENG. SCI., 50:2306-2320, 2010.

AB To develop a more potent NF kappa B inhibitor from salicylic acid which is known to inhibit activity of NF kappa B, a transcription factor regulating genes involved in immunity, inflammation and tumorigenesis, derivatives of salicylic acid (SA) where the 5 position, carboxyl or hydroxyl group was modified were treated in HCT116 cells transfected with an NF kappa B dependent luciferase gene and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. Amidation of the carboxylic group or substitution of chlorine at the 5 position increased the ability of SA to suppress the expression of NF kappa B dependent luciferase and inducible nitric oxide synthase, a product of an NF kappa B target gene. Moreover, simultaneous amidation and chlorination of SA (5-chlorosalicylamide; 5-CSAM) conferred an additive NF kappa B inhibitory activity on SA. To further enhance the inhibitory activity. N-modification was imposed on 5-CSAM. N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)phenethylamine (5-CSPA), N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)3-phenylpropylamine (5-CSPPA) and N-(5-chlorosalicyloyl)4-hydroxyphenylethylamine (5-CSHPA) showed greater potencies for inhibiting NF kappa B activity than other derivatives. Their IC(50)s' in the luciferase assay measured 15 mu M (5-CSPA), 17 mu M (5-CSPPA) and 91 mu M (5-CSHPA). Rectal administration of 5-CSPA ameliorated TNBS-induced rat colitis, which was more effective than a conventional drug, 5-aminosalicylic acid. These data may provide useful information for development of a therapeutic agent for treatment of diseases where NF kappa B plays a critical role in the pathogenic progresses.

AB The diffusion effects on chain-extension reactions using carboxyl-terminated polyamide-12 as a model reactant with bisoxazolines were investigated by the stochastic Monte Carlo method. Thus, complicated direct modeling and numerical calculations were avoided. The chain-length dependence and detailed diffusive behavior were discussed in depth. The diffusion effects retarded the progress of chain-extension reactions and led to lower coupling efficiency. The simulated results indicated that the diffusion effects could make the final molecular weight distributions wider. In the presence of diffusion and with the progress of the coupling efficiency, peaks in the evolution curves of the weight-average molecular weight and valleys in the evolution curves of the polydispersity index were observed, respectively, when the coupling efficiency was low enough. These phenomena were different from those without diffusion effects and were analyzed in detail. The critical entanglement chain length had strong effects on the simulated results of the diffusion effects, especially when its value was near the average chain length. The results also showed that the effects of the reactant degradation made the molecular weight distribution of the reaction system wider and weakened the diffusion effects on the coupling reaction.

AB DNA is constantly damaged through endogenous processes and by exogenous agents, such as ionizing radiation. Base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) help maintain the stability of the genome by removing many different types of DNA damage. We present a Monte Carlo excision repair (MCER) model that simulates key steps in the short-patch and long-patch BER pathways and the NER pathway. The repair of both single and clustered damages, except double-strand breaks (DSBs), is simulated in the MCER model. Output from the model includes estimates of the probability that a cluster is repaired correctly, the fraction of the clusters converted into DSBs through the action of excision repair enzymes, the fraction of the clusters repaired with mutations, and the expected number of repair cycles needed to completely remove a clustered damage site. The quantitative implications of alternative hypotheses regarding the postulated repair mechanisms are investigated through a series of parameter sensitivity studies. These sensitivity studies are also used to help define the putative repair characteristics of clustered damage sites other than DSBs. (c) 2005 by Radiation Research Society.

AB A novel method is explored for comprehensive design/optimization of organophosphorus sensing material, which is loaded on mass-type microcantilever sensor. Conventionally, by directly observing the gas sensing response, it is difficult to build quantitative relationship with the intrinsic structure of the material. To break through this difficulty, resonant cantilever is employed as gravimetric tool to implement molecule adsorption experiment. Based on the sensing data, key kinetic/thermodynamic parameters of the material to the molecule, including adsorption heat -Delta H degrees, adsorption/desorption rate constants K-a and K-d, active-site number per unit mass N' and surface coverage theta, can be quantitatively extracted according to physical-chemistry theories. With gaseous DMMP simulant of organophosphorus agents) as sensing target, the optimization route for three sensing materials is successfully demonstrated. Firstly, a hyper-branched polymer is evaluated. Though suffering low sensitivity due to insufficient N', the bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-hexafluoropropane (BHPF) sensing-group exhibits satisfactory reproducibility due to appropriate -Delta H degrees. To achieve more sensing-sites, KIT-5 mesoporous-silica with higher surface-area is assessed, resulting in good sensitivity but too high -Delta H degrees that brings poor repeatability. After comprehensive consideration, the confirmed BHPF sensing-group is grafted on the KIT-5 carrier to form an optimized DMMP sensing nanomaterial. Experimental results indicate that, featuring appropriate kinetic/thermodynamic parameters of -Delta H degrees, K-a, K-d, N' and theta, the BHPF-functionalized KIT-5 mesoporous silica exhibits synergistic improvement among reproducibility, sensitivity and response/recovery speed. The optimized material shows complete signal recovery, 55% sensitivity improvement than the hyper-branched polymer and 2 similar to 3 folds faster response/recovery speed than the KIT-5 mesoporous silica.

AB Investigations focusing on devising rapid and accurate methods for developing signatures for microorganisms that could be used as biological warfare agents' detection, identification, and discrimination have recently increased significantly. Quantum cascade laser (QCL)-based spectroscopic systems have revolutionized many areas of defense and security including this area of research. In this contribution, infrared spectroscopy detection based on QCL was used to obtain the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral signatures of Bacillus thuringiensis, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. These bacteria were used as microorganisms that simulate biothreats (biosimulants) very truthfully. The experiments were conducted in reflection mode with biosimulants deposited on various substrates including cardboard, glass, travel bags, wood, and stainless steel. Chemometrics multivariate statistical routines, such as principal component analysis regression and partial least squares coupled to discriminant analysis, were used to analyze the MIR spectra. Overall, the investigated infrared vibrational techniques were useful for detecting target microorganisms on the studied substrates, and the multivariate data analysis techniques proved to be very efficient for classifying the bacteria and discriminating them in the presence of highly IR-interfering media.

AB The cytotoxicity of 19 N-aryl-substituted hydroxamic acids has been tested in vitro towards human breast cancer MCF-7 cell lines by MTT assay. The IC(50) values were found to be in the range from 61.94 to 337.54 mu M. A total of 18 out of 19 molecules had higher inhibitory activities than hydroxyurea against MCF-7 cell. Five compounds with IC(50) values in micromolar range were 3- to 5-folds more potent than hydroxyurea (IC(50)= 307.15 mu M). By partial least squares (PLS) regression, 2D-QSAR model reported herein provide interesting insight in understanding hydrophobic, electronic, and structural requirements of antitumor activity among these set of the compounds. The cross-validated Q(cum)(2) values for optimal PLS model of hydroxamic acids is above 0.638 (remarkably higher 0.50), indicating good predictive abilities for log 1/IC(50) values of hydroxamic acids (HAS). The k-nearest neighbor molecular field analysis (kNN-MFA) approach was used to generate three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models for these sets of molecules. Statistically stepwise variable selection k-nearest neighbor molecular field analysis (SW-kNN-MFA) model is comparatively better as compared to the other two (i.e. simulated annealing k-nearest neighbor molecular field analysis, SA-kNN-MFA, and genetic algorithm k-nearest neighbor molecular field analysis, GA-kNN-MFA) with respect to both the internal (q(2)=0.7461) as well as external (pred_r(2)=0.6107) model validation and correctly predicts activity of ca. 74.61% and ca. 61.07% for the training and test set, respectively. It uses one steric and one electrostatic fields along with its 3k nearest neighbor (k=3) to evaluate the activity of new molecules. The developed SW-kNN-MFA model field plot indicated that the positive steric and electric potential are favorable for the increase in the activity and hence more bulky substituent at 5-position of phenyl ring connected at amide group and less electronegative substituent at 3-position of phenyl ring connected to carboxyl group are favourable for the increase in the potency of the molecules.

AB Achieving strong filler/matrix interactions is essential in the design and manufacturing of composite systems. Molecular dynamics simulation has played a vital role in the investigation of interfacial behavior by predicting the mechanical properties of polymer-based composites. There has been, however, a big gap for clearly estab-lishing a correlation between simulations and experiments because of limitations in size and time scale. Herein, a comparative analysis on the interfacial adhesion behavior of the short glass fiber and dental resin matrix is performed combining the atomistic simulations and single fiber/microdroplet pull-out tests in micro-scale. The interfacial shear strength is measured at the molecular level by applying the scale factor on the glass fiber, and the simulations are compared with the experimental results of the pull-out tests. The enhanced reinforcement effects induced by the surface modification via silane coupling agents grafting on the glass fibers are verified in both studies. Moreover, the mechanical properties and dynamic behavior of the dental composites under the longitudinal and transverse tension loadings are examined with quantifying the free volume changes. The findings of this research provide the optimized design guidelines to precisely predict the mechanical performances of the short fiber reinforced dental composites via molecular dynamics simulations and experiments.

AB As one of the most promising biodegradable material, poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is widely used for 3D printing bone scaffolds. However, the inflammation resulted by the intermediate product (lactic acid) of PLA degradation and poor cell affinity still pose a challenge. Blending PLA with o-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) is a proven method to achieve a better cell affinity and mechanical behavior material. This study applied a molecular dynamics simulation combining experimental method to investigate the microstructures and mechanical properties of PLA/CMC composites. Composites were prepared by fused mixing process and extruded into filaments for FDM printing. Results show that the addition of CMC largely reduces the fractional free volume and the molecular chain motion capability, and results a higher density and better hydrophilic system. Interestingly, the tensile modulus increases as the concentration of CMC increases, indicating the introduction of CMC could enhance the stiffness of PLA. While, the tensile strength first increases and then decreases with the increase of CMC content, and 8PLA/2CMC owns the largest tensile strength. Finally, the root reason for these phenomena was found to be attributed to the stronger intermolecular interaction of CMC, the stronger interaction would result the aggregation behavior of CMC.

AB In this paper we propose and study a hybrid discrete-continuous mathematical model of collective motion under alignment and chemotaxis effect. Starting from paper [23], in which the Cucker-Smale model [22] was coupled with other cell mechanisms, to describe the cell migration and self-organization in the zebrafish lateral line primordium, we introduce a simplified model in which the coupling between an alignment and chemotaxis mechanism acts on a system of interacting particles. In particular we rely on a hybrid description in which the agents are discrete entities, while the chemoattractant is considered as a continuous signal. The proposed model is then studied both from an analytical and a numerical point of view. From the analytic point of view we prove, globally in time, existence and uniqueness of the solution. Then, the asymptotic behaviour of a linearised version of the system is investigated. Through a suitable Lyapunov functional we show that for t -> +infinity, the migrating aggregate exponentially converges to a state in which all the particles have a same position with zero velocity. Finally, we present a comparison between the analytical findings and some numerical results, concerning the behaviour of the full nonlinear system.

AB This work aims at studying the efficacy of a series of novel biocompatible, serine-based surfactants as chemical permeation enhancers for two different local anesthetics, tetracaine and ropivacaine, combining an experimental and computational approach. The surfactants consist of gemini molecules structurally related, but with variations in headgroup charge (nonionic vs. cationic) and in the hydrocarbon chain lengths (main and spacer chains). In vitro permeation and molecular dynamics studies combined with cytotoxicity profiles were performed to investigate the permeation of both drugs, probe skin integrity, and rationalize the interactions at molecular level. Results show that these enhancers do not have significant deleterious effects on the skin structure and do not cause relevant changes on cell viability. Permeation across the skin is clearly improved using some of the selected serine-based gemini surfactants, namely the cationic ones with long alkyl chains and shorter spacer. This is noteworthy in the case of ropivacaine hydrochloride, which is not easily administered through the stratum corneum. Molecular dynamics results provide a mechanistic view of the surfactant action on lipid membranes that essentially corroborate the experimental observations. Overall, this study suggests the viability of these serine-based surfactants as suitable and promising delivery agents in pharmaceutical formulations. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.

DE Evacuation modelling; Human behaviour in fire; Emergency evacuation;
   Visibility; Evacuation simulation
AB This paper addresses the problem of reproducing the effect of different visibility conditions on people's walking speed when using evacuation models. In particular, different strategies regarding the use of default settings and embedded data-sets are investigated. Currently, the correlation between smoke and walking speed is typically based on two different sets of experimental data produced by (1) Jin and (2) Frantzich and Nilsson. The two data-sets present different experimental conditions, but are often applied as if equivalent. In addition, models may implement the same data-sets in different ways. To test the impact of this representation within evacuation tools, the authors have employed six evacuation models, making different assumptions and employing different data-sets (FDS+EVAC, Gridflow, buildingEXODUS, STEPS, Pathfinder and Simulex). A simple case-study is simulated in order to investigate the sensitivity of the representation of two key variables: (1) initial occupant speeds in clear conditions, (2) extinction coefficients. Results show that (1) evacuation times appear to be consistent if models use the same data-sets and interpret the smoke vs speed correlation in the same manner (2) the same model may provide different results if applying different data-sets or interpretations for configuring the inputs; i.e. default settings are crucial for the calculation of the model results (3) models using embedded data-sets/assumptions require user expertise, experience and understanding to be employed appropriately and the results evaluated in a credible manner.

AB Choice behavior is typically evaluated by assuming that the data is generated by one latent decision-making process or another. What if there are two (or more) latent decision-making processes generating the observed choices? Some choices might then be better characterized as being generated by one process, and other choices by the other process. A finite mixture model can be used to estimate the parameters of each decision process while simultaneously estimating the probability that each process applies to the sample. We consider the canonical case of lottery choices in a laboratory experiment and assume that the data is generated by expected utility theory and prospect theory decision rules. We jointly estimate the parameters of each theory as well as the fraction of choices characterized by each. The methodology provides the wedding invitation, and the data consummates the ceremony followed by a decent funeral for the representative agent model that assumes only one type of decision process. The evidence suggests support for each theory, and goes further to identify under what demographic domains one can expect to see one theory perform better than the other. We therefore propose a reconciliation of the debate over two of the dominant theories of choice under risk, at least for the tasks and samples we consider. The methodology is broadly applicable to a range of debates over competing theories generated by experimental and non-experimental data.

ID FREE-RADICAL POLYMERIZATION
AB The bulk polymerization of MMA at high temperature (120-180 degreesC) in a continuous pilot-plant reactor has been studied. The polymerization is initiated by diterbutyle peroxide and the chain transfer agent is 1-butanethiol. A simulation program has been developed to predict the steady state behavior of the reactor. The particular features of the kinetic at above-T-g temperature are included in the model, especially the thermal initiation of the reation and the attenuation of the autoacceleration effect. For the flow and mixing model, the actual vessel cannot be approximated to a single ideal reactor because of its design and of the moderate agitation imposed by the high viscosity of the reacting fluid. A tanks in series model with a recycle stream between tanks is proposed to evaluate the backmixing caused by the special design of the agitator. The parameters of the model are determined with the help of the experimental residence time distribution measured on the reactor. The data collected on the actual reactor, i.e., operation, conversion, molecular weight, temperature, are compared to the calculated one. The agreement is satisfactory but the tendencies are slightly underestimated. The program is a tool to evaluate the effect of modifications of the design of the reactor or changes on the operation parameters like input rate, temperature, and agitation on its behavior.

AB The solid tumor is an abnormal environment that is resistant to systemically delivered drugs. Increased plasma leakiness and extracellular matrix density along with poor lymphatic function can result in interstitial flow that attenuates the effectiveness of therapeutics. This study expands upon a previously presented magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-based porous media model by investigating low permeability tumors, where interstitial flow may have increased effect on systemically delivered solutes. The solute transport of the porous media model is compared to that of experiment and the two-compartment model. Small non-necrotic tumors (n=3) were MR-imaged, serially, for 90 min after a bolus injection of Gd-based contrast agent (CA). These data provided for the calculation of experimental CA concentration over 90 min, while only early time points (15 min) were used to create vascular permeability, K-trans, maps for the porous media model. A K-trans scale factor (range = 1.3-2.5) in the porous media model was found to account for the reduction of permeability (measured by two-compartment model) due to interstitial flow. The optimized porous media simulations showed: 1) better dynamic CA behavior agreement with the experimental data than the two-compartment model (>33% reduction of RMS error); 2) similar spatial CA distribution trends across tumor with increased uptake at the tumor boundary.

AB Background and Objectives: It can be assumed that PGK1 is involved in metastatic spread of gastric carcinomas. Furthermore PGK1 has a proven influence on the characteristics of tumor stem cells. The presence of malignant stem cells, regarding treatment resistance and recurrence, is of considerable importance. We hypothesized that inhibition of PGK1 makes these cells more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents and therefore mediates an overcome of the existing therapy resistance.
   Methods: All investigations were performed with human gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. Small hairpin RNA knockdown of PGK1 via adenovirus-shPGK1 was used for PGK1-inhibition. Chemotherapeutic agents were 5-FU and mitomycin. FACS, qRT-PCR, and xCELLigence were performed.
   Results: Using the medium-sole-control indicating the highest cell viability and Triton indicating the lowest, mitomycin and 5-FU alone showed a significant decrease in cell viability. The treatment with AdvshPGK1 alone already showed a better decrease. The simultaneous application of chemotherapeutics and adenovirus showed the strongest effect and is comparable to the effect of Triton.
   Conclusions: We showed a significant decrease in cell viability after the simultaneous application of chemotherapeutics and adenovirus. These results suggest that PGK1-inhibition is able to increase the vulnerability of gastric cancer cells and tumor stem cells to overcome the chemotherapeutic therapy resistance.

AB Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) bacteria are rapidly becoming one of the most detrimental drug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. Doripenem is the newest FDA-approved carbapenem that has the greatest in vitro potency against a wide range of Gram-negative organisms, including multidrug-resistant organisms. Previous work in an animal model has shown efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs above the current breakpoints of susceptibility. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of 1-g and 2-g dose prolonged infusions of doripenem against KPC isolates in both an immunocompetent and neutropenic murine thigh model. Seven clinical KPC isolates (broth microdilution [BMD] MIC range, 4 to 32 mu g/ml; Etest MIC range, 3 to >32 mu g/ml) were used. After infection, groups of mice were administered doripenem doses previously shown to simulate the exposures observed in humans after the administration of 1 or 2 g every 8 h as a 4-h infusion. In immunocompromised mice, 1- and 2-g doses of doripenem achieved bacteriostasis against isolates with MICs up to and including 8 mu g/ml and 16 mu g/ml, respectively. In immunocompetent animals, statistically significant reductions in the number of CFU were observed with overall decreases of approximately 1 log (P < 0.05). While carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae continues to decrease our meager supply of active agents, the ability of doripenem to produce CFU reductions in the presence of white blood cells (WBCs) using humanized exposures suggests the potential utility of this agent in combination against this increasingly problematic pathogen.

AB We report a versatile synthetic method for the in situ self-assembly of magnetic-nanoparticle-fimctionalized polymeric nanomorphologies, including spherical micelles and rod-like and worm-like micelles and vesicles. Poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate)-block-(methacrylic acid)-block-poly(styrene) (POEGMA-b-PMAA-b-PST) triblock copolymer chains were simultaneously propagated and self-assembled via a polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) approach. Subsequently, the carboxylic acid groups in the copolymers were used to complex an iron ion (Fe-II/Fe-III) mixture. Iron oxide nanoparticles were then formed in the central block, within the polymeric nanoparticles, via alkaline coprecipitation of the iron(II) and (III) salts. Nanoparticle morphologies, particle sizes, molecular weights, and chemical structures were then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), size exclusion chromatography (SEC), and H-1 NMR measurements. TEM micrographs showed that the average size of the magnetic nanoparticles was similar to 7 nm at the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nexus contained within the nanoparticles. In addition, XRD was used to confirm the formation of iron oxide nanoparticles. Importantly, the polymeric nanoparticle morphologies were not affected by the coprecipitation of the magnetic nanoparticles. The hybrid nanoparticles were then evaluated as negative MRI contrast agents, displaying remarkably high transverse relaxivities (r(2), greater than 550 mM(-1) s(-1) at 9.4 T); a result, that we hypothesize, ensues from iron oxide nanoparticle clustering at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. This simple synthetic procedure is highly versatile and produces nanocarriers of tunable size and shape with high efficacy as MRI contrast agents and potential utility as theranostic delivery vectors.

TI Pharmacoeconomic analysis of liposomal amphotericin B versus
   voriconazole for empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia
SO CLINICAL DRUG INVESTIGATION
LA English
DT Article
ID ANTIFUNGAL THERAPY; SAFETY; FEVER
AB Background: Liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) has demonstrated similar efficacy to conventional amphotericin B for antifungal treatment in patients with febrile neutropenia; however, it is not without toxicities and is associated with a high acquisition cost. Despite this high cost, LAmB has been shown to have a pharmacoeconomic advantage over less expensive agents. Voriconazole is a potential alternative for empirical antifungal treatment of febrile neutropenia. The objective of this study was to assess the economic outcomes of voriconazole versus LAmB in patients with fever and neutropenia.
   Methods: A decision analytical model was developed from a hospital perspective based on a 2-year (2002-2003) review of outcomes and prescribing practices in febrile neutropenic patients at a tertiary care medical centre. Literature reports and expert opinion were used to further populate the model. Sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulation enhanced the robustness of the model through variation of all probabilities and costs that populated the model.
   Results: Sixty-three cases were evaluated in the retrospective review. Thirty-two were initially given voriconazole and 31 were given LAmB. Patient demographic data were similar in each group. In the base case, patients initially given voriconazole displayed a 27% reduction in overall treatment cost over patients initially given LAmB ($US 14 950 vs $US20 59 1). Sensitivity analysis determined that the cost advantage in the voriconazole arm was maintained over a wide range of costs and probabilities. Variance in the cost of nephrotoxicity and medication cost did not significantly alter results. Monte Carlo simulation determined the voriconazole arm to be the optimal path in 65% of cases.
   Conclusion: The decision model indicated that use of voriconazole as the preferred antifungal agent in adult haematology patients with febrile neutropenia should result in lower overall treatment costs relative to LAmB.

AB This work proposed the use of methanol (CH3OH) and ionic liquid (IL) mixture, which integrates the advantages of methanol (high solubility and low viscosity) and IL (non-volatility), for CO2 capture at low temperatures (down to 228.2 K). The solubility of CO2 in pure methanol, IL ([OMIM](+)[Tf2N](-)) and their mixture (80 wt% CH3OH + 20 wt% IL, 50 wt% CH3OH + 50 wt% IL, and 20 wt% CH3OH + 80 wt% IL) was measured at 273.2, 258.2, 243.2 and 228.2 K and pressures up to 3.0 MPa. The UNIFAC model for ILs was extended to the methanol-CO2 and methanol-IL-CO2 systems. The comparison between the predicted and experimental results indicated that the UNIFAC model can well predict the CO2 solubility in pure methanol and in the (methanol + IL) binary mixture at low temperatures. Based on the thermodynamic experimental and modeling studies, the conceptual process design was developed for CO2 removal from syngas using the mixed agent at a low temperature. It was found that the volatile loss of methanol in the absorption column and solvent flash tanks decreases significantly in the case of the mixture of methanol and IL used as an absorbent.

AB Mobility networks facilitate the growth of populations, the success of invasive species, and the spread of communicable diseases among social animals, including humans. Disease control and elimination efforts, especially during an outbreak, can be optimized by numerical modeling of disease dynamics on transport networks. This is especially true when incidence data from an emerging epidemic is sparse and unreliable. However, mobility networks can be complex, challenging to characterize, and expensive to simulate with agent-based models. We therefore studied a parsimonious model for spatiotemporal disease dynamics based on a fractional diffusion equation. We implemented new stochastic simulations of a prototypical influenza-like infection spreading through the United States' highly-connected air travel network. We found that the national-averaged infected fraction during an outbreak is accurately reproduced by a space-fractional diffusion equation consistent with the connectivity of airports. Fractional diffusion therefore seems to be a better model of network outbreak dynamics than a diffusive model. Our fractional reaction-diffusion method and the result could be extended to other mobility networks in a variety of applications for population dynamics.

DT Article
DE radioiodine; thyroid cancer; dosimetry; lesion uptake
ID THERAPY
AB Since 1962, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has used an individually optimized dosimetry method for patients with thyroid carcinoma undergoing radioiodine therapy. This traditional dosimetry method involves a determination of the maximum tolerated activity or the activity that will deliver 2 Gy to the blood (A,,), and the corresponding ablative lesion dose (D-lesion) However, the traditional calculations of A,,, and Dlesion were based on empirical assumptions. The objective of this work was to develop a dosimetry method that eliminates these assumptions by incorporating patient kinetics and that is not restricted to I-131 as a tracer and therapeutic agent. Methods: Patient kinetics were incorporated into the dosimetry algorithm by fitting parameters to patient clearance measurements. The radioiodines I-123, I-124, I-125, and I-131 were accommodated as tracers and therapeutic agents by incorporating their physical half lives and by precalculating photon-absorbed fractions for these radionuclides for several thousand patient geometries using Monte Carlo simulations. Results: A(max) and D-lesion have been calculated using the traditional and new method for a group of patients, and errors associated with each of the above assumptions were examined. Assuming that the initial blood activity is distributed instantaneously in 5 L was found to introduce an error in A(max) of up to 30%, whereas assuming physical decay beyond the last data point introduced an error of up to 50%. Conclusion: individualized fitting of clearance data is a practical method to accurately account for inter-patient kinetics variations. The substitution of standard kinetics beyond measured data might lead to substantial errors in estimating A(max) and D-lesion. in addition, gamma camera images, rather than neck probe readings, should be used to determine lesion uptakes for thyroid cancer patients.

AB Drift is an important phenomenon of capacitive humidity sensor, the most vital device in the commercial dew point meter. Due to drift in the output, most of the meters for critical applications require costly and time-consuming recalibration. Modeling of drift phenomenon for RH humidity sensors was reported in various literature. But to the best of our knowledge, there is no work reported so far about the drift of the sensors utilized for trace level moisture detection. This paper presents the mathematical model, the electrical equivalent circuits, and long-term drift analysis of the aged capacitive sensors for trace moisture sensing. The sensors were fabricated using porous alumina oxide thin film for detecting moisture in the range of 3 to 100 ppm. To study the long-term drift, experiments were performed under different operating conditions over a period of nearly one year. The response behaviors of the sensors were simulated with the help of the model. Comparing the model response with the experimental results, the proposed model can be used for drift analysis for an aged sensor, determination of hydration level and moisture condensation inside the pores. Experimental results showed that when a sensor was kept in drying agent, a maximum average drift of only 1.50% was observed but when a similar sensor was kept in open high humidity atmosphere, the maximum long-term drift was found to be similar to 11.20%.

AB Azole-containing compounds are a kind of chemical entities of natural and synthetic origin having a wide-range of activities. They are therefore considered as important moieties for fungicide development, mostly due to the possible action on several enzyme-based targets. As part of our research on fungicidal agents, the relationship between the ligand-enzyme affinities of several synthetic azole-containing compounds against a set of fungal enzyme-based targets was in silico evaluated through molecular docking. The affinity values of the test compounds were mostly higher than those of the respective test controls. Binding modes between enzymes and test compounds were firstly investigated through Vina scores and ligand-residue interactions. Furthermore, statistically relationships among docking scores were successfully found by multivariate analysis. They were mostly correlated with reported MIC80 values, so it denoted an evident discrimination of the test compounds. Strong electron withdrawing groups on phenylacrylamide moiety were responsible for establishing stronger complexes with the enzyme targets, being trichodiene synthase and -l-fucosidase the most important ones. Moreover, stability of a set of representative protein/ligand complexes was also analyzed by 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations (MD). Significant differences into the MD runs were detected and directly correlated to docking performances. Finally, docking affinity scores and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps resulted well predicted by comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) models, demonstrating the structure type is particularly associated with those calculated properties and these results were thus consistent with the respective validation parameters.

AB Treatment of hepatic microsomes with Fe3+/ascorbate activates UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UGT), a phenomenon totally prevented and reversed by reducing agents. At mu M concentrations, iron and copper ions catalyze the formation of ROS through Fenton and/or Haber-Weiss reactions. Unlike iron ions, indiscriminate binding of copper ions to thiol groups of proteins different from the specialized copper-binding proteins may occur. Thus, we hypothesize that incubation of hepatic microsomes with the Cu2+/ascorbate system will lead to both UGT oxidative activation and Cu2+-binding induced inhibition, simultaneously. We studied the effects of Cu2+ alone and in the presence of ascorbate on rat liver microsomal UGT activity. Our results show that the effects of both copper alone and in the presence of ascorbate were copper ion concentration- and incubation time-dependent. At very low Cu2+ (25 nM), this ion did not modify UGT activity. In the presence of ascorbate, however, UGT activity was increased. At higher copper concentrations (10 and 50 mu M), this ion led to UGT activity inhibition. In the presence of ascorbate, 10 mu M Cu2+ activated UGT at short incubation periods but inhibited this enzyme at longer incubation times; 50 mu M Cu2+ only inhibited UGT activity. Thiol reducing agent 2,4-dithiothreitol prevented and reversed UGT activation while EDTA prevented both, UGT activation and inhibition. Our results are consistent with a model in which Cu2+-induced oxidation of UGT leads to the activation of the enzyme, while Cu2+-binding leads to its inhibition. We discuss physiological and pathological implications of these findings. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Solvent sorption into polymeric membranes may be analysed by equilibrating the polymer sample either with the liquid or with the gaseous solvent. For a number of polymer/solvent systems, however, measurements at the point of saturation have revealed differences in solvent uptake from the liquid versus the corresponding vapour phase (Schroeder's paradox). Attempts at explanation are numerous, but still far from comprehensive. Yet, insight into the sorption behaviour is of crucial importance as it not only controls membrane performance, but further affects the development of accurate mass transfer models, especially when applications such as membrane pervaporation or solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells are concerned where a selective membrane is simultaneously exposed to a gaseous and a liquid phase.
   Using Nafion (R) ionomer membranes as the most prominent example of Schroeder's paradox, the present study aims at the comparative examination of water sorption for samples equilibrated with the gaseous and the liquid solvent respectively, covering a wide range of solvent activities. For the determination of liquid-phase sorption isotherms, a versatile method was developed, employing a suitably pretreated polymeric deswelling agent which is barred from penetration into the sample network. Sorption data obtained for both equilibration modes suggests that, strictly identical experimental conditions provided, Schroeder's paradox is resolved. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, we analyze statistical properties of a communication network constructed from the records of a mobile phone company. The network consists of 2.5 million customers that have placed 810 million communications (phone calls and text messages) over a period of 6 months and for whom we have geographical home localization information. It is shown that the degree distribution in this network has a power-law degree distribution k(-5) and that the probability that two customers are connected by a link follows a gravity model, i.e. decreases as d(-1). where d is the distance between the customers. We also consider the geographical extension of communication triangles and we show that communication triangles are not only composed of geographically adjacent nodes but that they may extend over large distances. This last property is not captured by the existing models of geographical networks and in a last section we propose a new model that reproduces the observed property. Our model, which is based on the migration and on the local adaptation of agents, is then studied analytically and the resulting predictions are confirmed by computer simulations.

AB We provide a mean-field description for a leader-follower dynamics with mass transfer among the two populations. This model allows the transition from followers to leaders and vice versa, with scalar-valued transition rates depending nonlinearly on the global state of the system at each time. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the leader-follower dynamics, under suitable assumptions. We then establish, for an appropriate choice of the initial datum, the equivalence of the system with a PDE-ODE system, that consists of a continuity equation over the state space and an ODE for the transition from leader to follower or vice versa. We further introduce a stochastic process approximating the PDE, together with a jump process that models the switch between the two populations. Using a propagation of chaos argument, we show that the particle system generated by these two processes converges in probability to a solution of the PDE-ODE system. Finally, several numerical simulations of social interactions dynamics modeled by our system are discussed.

AB Objective. We present the first generic theoretical formulation of the co-adaptive learning problem and give a simple example of two interacting linear learning systems, a human and a machine. Approach. After the description of the training protocol of the two learning systems, we define a simple linear model where the two learning agents are coupled by a joint loss function. The simplicity of the model allows us to find learning rules for both human and machine that permit computing theoretical simulations. Main results. As seen in simulations, an astonishingly rich structure is found for this eco-system of learners. While the co-adaptive learners are shown to easily stall or get out of sync for some parameter settings, we can find a broad sweet spot of parameters where the learning system can converge quickly. It is defined by mid-range learning rates on the side of the learning machine, quite independent of the human in the loop. Despite its simplistic assumptions the theoretical study could be confirmed by a real-world experimental study where human and machine co-adapt to perform cursor control under distortion. Also in this practical setting the mid-range learning rates yield the best performance and behavioral ratings. Significance. The results presented in this mathematical study allow the computation of simple theoretical simulations and performance of real experimental paradigms. Additionally, they are nicely in line with previous results in the BCI literature.

AB Base flipping is widely observed in a number of important biological processes. The genetic codes deposited inside the DNA duplex become accessible to external agents upon base flipping. The sulfur substitution of guanine leads to thioguanine, which alters the thermodynamic stability of the GC base pairs and the GT mismatches. Experimental studies conclude that the sulfur substitution decreases the lifetime of the GC base pair. In this work, under three AMBER force fields for nucleotide systems, we firstly performed equilibrium and nonequilibrium free energy simulations to investigate the variation of the thermodynamic profiles in base flipping upon sulfur substitution. It is found that the bsc0 modification, the bsc1 modification and the OL15 modification of AMBER force fields are able to qualitatively describe the sulfur-substitution dependent behavior of the thermodynamics. However, only the two last-generation AMBER force fields are able to provide quantitatively correct predictions. The second computational study on the sulfur substitutions focused on the relative stability of the S6G-C base pair and the S6G-T mismatch. Two conflicting experimental observations were reported by the same authors. One suggested that the S6G-C base pair was more stable, while the other concludes that the S6G-T mismatch was more stable. We answered this question by constructing the free energy profiles along the base flipping pathway computationally.

Here we develop an alternative argument that connects the evolution of human pair bonds to the male-biased mating sex ratios that accompanied the evolution of human life history. We simulate an agent-based model of the grandmother hypothesis, compare simulated sex ratios to data on great apes and human hunter-gatherers, and note associations between a preponderance of males and mate guarding across taxa. Then we explore a recent model that highlights the importance of mating sex ratios for differences between birds and mammals and conclude that lessons for human evolution cannot ignore mammalian reproductive constraints. In contradiction to our claim that male-biased sex ratios are characteristically human, female-biased ratios are reported in some populations. We consider the likelihood that fertile men are undercounted and conclude that the mate-guarding hypothesis for human pair bonds gains strength from explicit links with our grandmothering life history.

AB Background: Many drugs (belonging to different chemical groups) have the potential for QT interval prolongation associated with ionic channel blockade in the cardiomyocyte membrane. Due to the fact that this phenomenon is linked to a higher risk of TdP, the ability to predict its scale is one of the most important outcomes of cardiotoxicity assessment of new agents.
   Methods: With use of the Cardiac Safety Simulator (CSS), the effect of six antipsychotic drugs was predicted in silica. Separate simulations were carried out for each studied population taking the drug. The aim of this study was to predict both the mean values of delta QTc and the results range. To be able to observe individual variability after drug administration, each patient was randomly assigned to the individual drug concentration. Also, appropriate diversity in heart rate, plasma electrolytes concentrations, morphometric parameters of ventricular myocytes, and one common hERG polymorphism frequency in population were added.
   Results: Analyzing the results of simulation with Student's t-test, in five of six cases, there were no statistically significant differences between observed and predicted mean values. The diversity of results in all populations studied, however, was not fully reconstructed.
   Discussion: The model was able to accurately reproduce the average effect of the drug on the length when the phenomenon is associated purely with blocking of ionic channels. Nevertheless, the problem of variability in the population and its effect on the QT interval requires further study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There are several technologies and techniques available when developing indoor positioning systems (IPS). Recently, the development of positioning systems based on optical signals has aroused great interest, mainly those using visible light from the lighting infrastructure. In this work, we analyze which techniques give better results to lay the foundations for the development of a Visible Light Positioning system (VLP). Working only with a receiver, it is analyzed what the result of determining the position of different emitters is when they emit simultaneously and without any synchronism. The results obtained by Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) (with digital bandpass filters, I/Q demodulation, and FFT) and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) are compared. The interference between signals when emitted simultaneously from multiple emitters is analyzed as well as the errors they cause and how these effects can be mitigated. As a result of the research, the advantages and disadvantages using different multiple-access determination techniques are determined. In addition, advantages and disadvantages of using FDMA and CDMA techniques as well as hardware requirements that make one more feasible than the other are presented. The system behavior, in terms of errors, is established using FDMA and different configurations such as: I/Q, RMS, or FFT. The work also determines the error rates that can be obtained with the different FDMA and CDMA configurations, considering different error scenarios and integration time. Synthetic emulations and empirical tests were performed, which concluded that IPS systems based on optical signals and PSD sensors can achieve very high measurement accuracies and a high measurement rate. Obtained positioning errors in a room of 3 m height are less than 1 cm when working in noisy environments.

ID MELT EXTRUSION
AB In this study the viscosity behavior of the polymer-based drug delivery system (Soluplus-Fenofibrate) at high shear rates was investigated using (i) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methods and (ii) experimental data acquired with a high-pressure capillary rheometer. The barrel and capillary were rebuilt in the virtual domain by means of finite-volume methods and used for fluid dynamic simulations. Our primary focus was on validating the Carreau-Winter and Yasuda material models in the Open Field Operation and Manipulation program (OpenFOAM) and investigating their usefulness in this type of simulation.
   First, the models were fitted to experimental data from a well-known system - polystyrene type (145D, BASF). The results showed that the Yasuda model fit must be applied to obtain the correct material properties when simulating a non-Newtonian melt flow in a wide range of shear rates. The Carreau-Winter model was found to be valid only in the zero shear-rate viscosity region. On the basis of these findings, the Soluplus-Fenofibrate system was subsequently characterized and simulated. We observed that Fenofibrate (lipid-regulating agent) acts as a plasticizer in this polymer system and decreases system viscosity at lower shear rates compared to pure the Soluplus (polyvinyl caprolactam-polyvinyl acetate-polyethylene glycol graft copolymer) at the same temperatures.
   Our results show that the viscosity models can be implemented accurately even for processes with high shear rates, which also involve high temperatures.

AB This study deals with the local management and biodiversity preservation of cereal varieties in Mali. The State is unable to provide adequate seeds to the farmers who rely mainly on seed exchanges within existing social networks. This informal seed system operates a collective management of many traditional varieties. Our research aims at improving the knowledge of this traditional seed system. We are particularly interested in identifying the potential and existing roles of the different stakeholders in preserving biodiversity. We use a methodology based on the concept of companion modeling. On the basis of initial hypotheses extracted from an extensive set of surveys, we have produced several successive models using Role-Playing Games and Agent-Based Systems. The process has evolved through the rendering and questioning of these models in specific workshops, As a result, these models have proven useful in formalizing knowledge, in testing hypotheses with the stakeholders and building a shared representation of their system with them. in the future, this representation will be used as a basis for prospective simulation of new rules for the collective management of cereal biodiversity.

AB Electrostatic fields generated on and within biological membranes play a fundamental role in key processes in cell functions. The role of the membrane dipole potential is of particular interest because of its powerful impact on membrane permeability and lipid-protein interactions, including protein insertion, oligomerization, and function. The membrane dipole potential is defined by the orientation of electric dipoles of lipid headgroups, fatty acid carbonyl groups, and membrane-adsorbed water. As a result, the membrane interior is several hundred millivolts more positive than the external aqueous phase. This potential decrease depends on the lipid, and especially sterol, composition of the membrane. The adsorption of certain electroneutral molecules known as dipole modifiers may also lead to significant changes in the magnitude of the potential decrease. These agents are widely used to study the effects of the dipole potential on membrane transport. This review presents a critical analysis of a variety of data from studies dedicated to ion channel formation and functioning in membranes with different dipole potentials. The types of ion channels found in cellular membranes and pores formed by antimicrobial agents and toxins in artificial lipid membranes are summarized. The mechanisms underlying the influence of the membrane dipole potential on ion channel activity, including dipole-dipole and charge-dipole interactions in the pores and in membranes, are discussed. A hypothesis, in which lipid rafts in both model and cellular membranes also modulate ion channel activity by virtue of an increased or decreased dipole potential, is also considered.

AB OPTISON, an agent being developed as an intravenous (IV) ultrasound contrast agent, consists of a suspension of octafluoropropane (OFP)-containing albumin microspheres. The distribution and elimination of the albumin component and the elimination kinetics of the OFF component of OPTISON (FS069) were studied in the conscious rat and anesthetized canine models, respectively. Radioiodinated OPTISON at 0.25 ml/kg (average dose 5.4 x 10(7) DPM/rat) and nonradioactive OPTISON, at dosages of 0.3, 0.6, and 1.0 ml/kg, was administered intravenously to conscious rats or to sodium pentobarbital-anesthetized and ventilated canines, respectively, A separate group of rats was housed in metabolism cages for 24 hours to capture excreted radioactivity. The tissue distribution data for the radiolabeled albumin in rats showed that the I-125 activity recovered in the liver was the highest of all the tissues at each timepoint (peak liver radioactivity at 5 minutes with 50.4 % of the dose), suggesting that the major route of uptake and metabolism of the radiolabeled albumin shell and its fragments occurred in the liver. The I-125 activity was excreted in the urine, where most of the recovered radioactivity (58.3%) was found at the end of 24 hours. In the anesthetized canine study, simultaneous venous blood samples and exhaled air samples plus additional exhaled air samples were analyzed by gas chromatography, OFF was rapidly exhaled through the lungs after an IV injection such that a maximum of less than 10% of the total dose appeared in the venous blood samples. Statistical moment analysis showed rapid OFF elimination with mean residence times of 46, 41, and 38 seconds for the three dosages, and mean total recoveries for the exhaled OFP were 111%,100.5%,and 121.6%, respectively. OFF was rapidly exhaled through the lungs after OPTISON injection with short mean residence times from statistical moment analysis. Exhaled OFF displayed one-compartment model kinetics with a measurable distribution phase in the blood using classical pharmacokinetic modeling. The albumin component appeared to be cleared primarily by the liver and radioactivity was excreted in the urine.

AB AimColesevelam, a second-generation bile acid sequestrant, may be beneficial in controlling both glycaemia and lipids simultaneously. Our goal was to evaluate the systemic effects of colesevelam on Type2 diabetes mellitus.
   MethodThe original Cochrane review was conducted using the methodology for the systematic review of interventions of the Cochrane Collaboration in RevMan5.2. We comprehensively searched the literature in several databases up to January 2012. Two reviewing authors independently selected and extracted the data, and then evaluated the quality of the randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria.
   ResultsSix randomized controlled trials were selected, which ranged from 8 to 26weeks in duration. A total of 1450 participants were divided into two groups: those treated with colesevelam and no other anti-diabetic drug treatments/placebo, or with colesevelam added on to anti-diabetic drug treatments. The colesevelam added on to anti-diabetic agents demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in the fasting blood glucose (mean difference of -0.82mmol/l, 95%CI -1.2 to -0.44), HbA(1c) (mean difference -0.5%, 95%CI -0.6 to -0.4) and LDL cholesterol (mean difference -0.34mmol/l, 95%CI -0.44 to -0.23). There were no reported data on weight. Non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes were infrequently observed.
   ConclusionThe limited number of studies concerning the treatment with colesevelam added to anti-diabetic agents showed significant effects on glycaemic control; however, more research on the reduction of cardiovascular risks is required. Furthermore, long-term data on the health-related quality of life and all-cause mortality also need to be investigated.

AB Propolis has been reported to display a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antibiotic and antifungal properties, among others. There is great interest not only in the determination of the chemical composition of propolis but also in the understanding of the mechanisms related to its therapeutic actions. In this respect, the aim of the present investigation was to study the influence of both simultaneous (6, 12 and 24mg/kg b.w.) and subacute (12 mg/kg b.w.) treatment with a crude hydroalcoholic extract of propolis on the frequency of chromosome aberrations induced by the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DXR) in Wistar rat bone marrow cells. HPLC analysis of the crude extract allowed the quantification of the phenolic compounds: caffeic acid, pcoumaric acid, aromadendrin 4'-methyl ether, 3-prenyl-p-coumaric acid (drupanin), isosakuranetin, kaempferide, 3,5-dipre-nyl-p-coumaric acid (artepellin C), baccharin and 2,2-dimethyl-6-carboxyethenyl-2H-1-benzopyran. A total of 100 metaphase cells/animal were analyzed for chromosome aberration frequency and 1000 cells/animal were counted to obtain the mitotic index. The results showed that the dose of 12 mg propolis/kg b.w., administered either as a single dose or as subacute treatment, caused a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of chromosome damage induced by DXR compared to the group treated only with DXR. This reduction might be, in part, due to the presence of phenolic compounds in the studied propolis, which are able to capture free radicals produced by chemotherapeutic agents such as DXR.

AB Background Daily transport is associated with mental health. A free bus policy (FBP) may be effective in promoting the use of public transit in older adults and be associated with reductions in depressive symptoms.
   Methods We developed an agent-based model and grounded it using empirical data from England to examine the impact of an FBP on public transit use and depression among older adults. We also used the model to explore whether the impact of the FBP bus use and depression is modified by the type of income segregation or by simultaneous efforts to improve attitudes towards the bus, to reduce waiting times or to increase the cost of driving via parking fees or fuel price.
   Results Our model suggests that improving attitudes towards the bus (eg, campaigns that promote bus use) could enhance the effect of the FBP, especially for those in proximity to public transit. Reducing wait times could also significantly magnify FPB impacts, especially in those who live in proximity to public transit. Contrary to expectation, neither fuel costs nor parking fees significantly enhanced the impact of the FBP. The impact of improving attitudes towards the bus and increasing bus frequency was more pronounced in the lower-income groups in an income segregation scenario in which destination and public transit are denser in the city centre.
   Conclusion Our results suggest that the beneficial mental health effects of an FBP for older adults can be magnified when combined with initiatives that reduce bus waiting times and increased spatial access to transit.

ID GINZBURG-LANDAU APPROACH; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; HYDRODYNAMICS; DYNAMICS;
   SYSTEMS; MOTION
AB We study the orientational ordering in systems of self-propelled particles with selective interactions. To introduce the selectivity we augment the standard Vicsek model with a bounded-confidence collision rule: a given particle only aligns to neighbors who have directions quite similar to its own. Neighbors whose directions deviate more than a fixed restriction angle alpha are ignored. The collective dynamics of this system is studied by agent-based simulations and kinetic mean-field theory. We demonstrate that the reduction of the restriction angle leads to a critical noise amplitude decreasing monotonically with that angle, turning into a power law with exponent 3/2 for small angles. Moreover, for small system sizes we show that upon decreasing the restriction angle, the kind of the transition to polar collective motion changes from continuous to discontinuous. Thus, an apparent tricritical point with different scaling laws is identified and calculated analytically. We investigate the shifting and vanishing of this point due to the formation of density bands as the system size is increased. Agent-based simulations in small systems with large particle velocities show excellent agreement with the kinetic theory predictions. We also find that at very small interaction angles, the polar ordered phase becomes unstable with respect to the apolar phase. We derive analytical expressions for the dependence of the threshold noise on the restriction angle. We show that the mean-field kinetic theory also permits stationary nematic states below a restriction angle of 0.681 pi. We calculate the critical noise, at which the disordered state bifurcates to a nematic state, and find that it is always smaller than the threshold noise for the transition from disorder to polar order. The disordered-nematic transition features two tricritical points: At low and high restriction angle, the transition is discontinuous but continuous at intermediate alpha. We generalize our results to systems that show fragmentation into more than two groups and obtain scaling laws for the transition lines and the corresponding tricritical points. A numerical method to evaluate the nonlinear Fredholm integral equation for the stationary distribution function is also presented. This method is shown to give excellent agreement with agent-based simulations, even in strongly ordered systems at noise values close to zero.

AB Solar thermal storage system has strict requirements on the problems of hydrated salt phase change materials (PCMs) such as supercooling, phase separation, low thermal conductivity and cyclic stability. In addition, the long-term storage/release heat cycle of PCMs lead to the loss of crystallization water and shorten the service life. Herein, we demonstrate an improved model to predict the thermal conductivity of modified carbon-based matrix form-stable PCMs based on the relationship between porosity (s) and modified expanded graphite (MEG) content. The proposed new model may predict the thermal conductivity of carbon-based matrix composites with relatively high precision. Furthermore, the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups on the surface of EG sheet have been rearranged via titanate coupling agent, and then MEG is introduced as high thermal conductivity porous matrix. The modified aluminum potassium sulfate dodecahydrate (MAPSD) is used as the PCM. Five different EG contents of MEG/APSD composite PCM samples with the same density have been prepared by the method of "melting blend-solidification and form-stable". In addition, 80 times storage/release heat experiments are carried out on the samples and the heat transfer process of the three-dimensional (3D) model is numerically simulated. It results show that the weight loss of the composites with MEG samples decreased by only 7.85%. The simulation results suggest that the temperature field and phase change interface vary uniformly. Moreover, the composites samples with MEG has the superior heat transfer performance and much higher heat storage/release rate. With sample density 900 kg/m(3) and the MEG content of 20 wt%, the MEG/APSD composites has relatively good thermal performance and high cost performance. Therefore, it can be applied for industrial waste heat energy recovery applications, the solar domestic hot water system and mid-temperature thermal energy storage system.

AB Purpose Arsenic is a toxic metalloid that is present in the environment as arsenate and arsenite anions. Exposure to arsenic anions caused skin problems, degenerative diseases, kidney, liver, and lung cancer. The synthesized iron nanoparticles (NPs) were examined as a green low-cost adsorbent for the removal of arsenite anions from aqueous solution via batch adsorption procedure. Methods Iron NPs were prepared in a single step by the reaction of Fe+3 0.01 M solution with a fresh aqueous solution of 2% w/v pomegranate peel extract (PPE) as both reducing and capping agents. The physicochemical properties of peel were investigated by some experiments and functional groups were determined by the FT-IR spectrum. The electrochemical behavior of PPE was studied using cyclic voltammetry on a glassy carbon electrode as produced a cathodic peak at range 120-400 mV. The progress of nZVI production was monitored by a decrease of 372 nm wavelength UV-Vis spectra of PPE. The 27 adsorption experiments were carried out as a function of solution pH, initial arsenite concentration, mass adsorbent, and contact time according to DOE. Results The rapid rate of adsorption was observed at 20-60 min, indicating that the principal mechanism dominating the sorption process was reduction and chemical adsorption. The arsenite removal efficiency was found to be dependent on the solution pH, adsorbent dose, and initial concentration, respectively. Conclusion The experimental data show the ability of the synthesized iron NPs to remove arsenate from solution in both synthetic and polluted natural water. The thermodynamic study suggested the spontaneous and endothermic nature of adsorption of arsenite by green synthesized iron NPs. The iron NPs synthesized with PPE increased the removal of arsenite with an increase in the active surface, indicating some chemical interactions between the adsorbent and oxoanions.

AB In this work, density functional theory and vibrational spectroscopic studies are carried out to elucidate the structure, physiochemical parameters and biological behaviors of 4-phenylbutyrophenone. By using energy minimization, the optimized structure of 4-phenylbutyrophenone (4PBP) is obtained. The functional group present in the compound and its properties are obtained by FT-IR, FT-Raman and NMR methods, and it is compared with simulated scaled values along with assignments by potential energy distribution. The inter- and intramolecular charge transfer and stability of the molecule are obtained by natural bond orbital analysis. The reactive areas of the molecule are studied quantitatively and qualitatively by Fukui function analysis and molecular electrostatic potential diagram, respectively. By using frontier molecular orbital theory, the highest occupied molecular orbital, lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and other various parameters are calculated and compared with the known antipsychotic drug melperone. The electronic transition is obtained by experimental UV-Vis spectrum, and it is compared with the time-dependent DFT method with various solvents. The effect of temperature on the molecule is discussed to know the thermal stability of the molecule. The drug-likeness values of 4PBP are compared with known human drugs to confirm the same neuroleptic activities, and it confirms the drug nature of 4PBP. In addition, comparative molecular docking was analyzed with this ligand and melperone (an a typical antipsychotic) with the suitable target protein. Lipophilicity studies compared with other drugs show that this has good transport well inside the human lipid system. Molecular docking supports the neurological activity of the compound with a low binding energy value of -7.55 kcal/mol to bound easily without additional energy with the target proteins confirms 4PBP is a good neuroleptics potential candidate.

AB Phospholipases are important probes for understanding structure-function relationships of membrane proteins. Many neurotoxins have phospholipase activity, and they have been recognized to be potential therapeutic agents for biological warfare. Understanding the modes of action of these enzymes is important for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Human secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA(2)) interact with cellular membranes and catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphate ester bonds of phospholipids. The activity of these enzymes increases tremendously upon binding to a hydrophobic interface. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in implicit solvent and membrane environments, we investigated alterations in structure and conformation of human sPLA(2)upon its interaction with a membrane that may be associated with the activation of the enzyme. In 50 ns MD simulations, starting from six different initial orientations of the protein relative to the membrane surface, the enzyme consistently adopted a membrane-bound configuration in close agreement with the known experimental data. The simulations also reproduced the experimentally determined distribution of hydrophobic and polar side chains on the interfacial binding surface. Differences in the dynamic behavior of the enzyme between the solvent and membrane-bound states were observed. In nonpolar media, the enzyme underwent major conformational rearrangements, which exposed the active site to the membrane. The increased mobility of the surface loop and the beta-wing regions is required for the conformational change, which is essentially induced by the movement of N-terminal helix. Several active site residues underwent structural changes that reorganize the binding site for substrate catalysis. Overall, the results provided a valuable insight into the interfacial behavior of sPLA(2)enzyme and suggested that membrane binding is essential but insufficient for sPLA(2)activation.

AB Objective - To review the mechanisms of platelet activation and options for diagnosing and treating platelet hyperactivity in relation to thrombosis in dogs and cats.
   Data Sources - Prospective, retrospective, and review articles, as well as textbook chapters in both human and veterinary medicine. Articles were primarily, but not exclusively, retrieved via Medline.
   Human Data Synthesis - In people, platelets are known to play a key role in the development of arterial thrombosis in numerous disease states and antiplatelet drugs are the cornerstone in the treatment of acute events and for prevention in patients at risk. For many years, aspirin was used as the sole antiplatelet drug in people, but the introduction of adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonists and integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) inhibitors has significantly improved outcome in selective groups of patients.
   Veterinary Data Synthesis - The understanding of platelet activation in disease states has increased dramatically over the past decade. Simultaneously, a host of new methods for evaluating platelet function have been developed, which enable primarily researchers, but also clinicians to monitor the activity of platelets. Many of these methods have been validated for research purposes, but few have found their way to the clinics. Not a single correctly randomized clinical trial has been carried out with any antiplatelet drug for any indication in dogs or cats, and consequently, treatment is empiric and largely based on expert opinion or data from experimental studies.
   Conclusions - The pathogenesis of thromboembolic disease is complex and multifactorial and the role of hyperactive platelets in this etiology remains to be clarified in most of the diseases associated with thrombosis in dogs and cats. Until efficacy data from well-designed studies are available, antithrombotic therapy should consist of close monitoring, good supportive care, and judicious empirical use of antiplatelet agents.

AB Fluidized beds are conventional components of many industrial processes, such as coal gasification for energy generation and syngas production. Numerical simulations help to properly design and understand the complex multiphase flows occurring in these reactors. Two modeling approaches are usually adopted to simulate multiphase flows: the two fluids Eulerian-Eulerian model and the continuous/discrete Eulerian-Lagrangian model. Since fluidized beds account for an extremely large number of particles, tracking each of them could not assure to get results within a reasonable computational time. The Computational Particle-Fluid Dynamics (CPFD) approach, which belongs to the Eulerian-Lagrangian models class, groups together particles with similar key parameters (e.g. composition, size) into computational units (parcels). Parcel collisions are modeled by an isotropic solid stress function, depending on solid volume fraction. In this paper, the bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) upstream gasifier of the EU research infrastructure ZECOMIX (Zero Emissions of Carbon with Mixed technologies) has been simulated using a CPFD approach via Barracuda (R) software. The effect of different fluidizing agent injection strategies on bed bubbling and mixing, for non-reacting cases, has been studied. The numerical results for a reacting case have been compared to the available experimental data, gathered during the coal gasification campaign. The model has proved to be very useful in the choice of the more efficient injection configuration that assures a more effective contact of the gas with the solid bed and a good bubbling fluidization regime, together with a satisfactory prediction of the outlet gas composition. The numerical approach has turned out to be robust and time-saving and allowed to dramatically reduce the computational cost with respect the classical two fluids Eulerian-Eulerian models.

AB Some researchers claim that simulations of the emergence of communication in populations of autonomous agents provide empirical support for 'use' theories of meaning. I argue that this claim faces at least two major challenges. First, the empirical adequacy of such simulations must be justified, or the inference from simulation results to real-world linguistic behavior must be dropped; and second, the proffered simulations are in fact compatible with all of the competing theories of meaning surveyed, suggesting that theories of meaning are not the kinds of theories for which simulations provide evidence. To conclude, I consider what impact this has on the project of developing a naturalized theory of language.

AB Selective solvent extraction of molybdenum over rhenium from molybdenite (MoS2) flue dust leaching solution was studied. In the present work, thermodynamic calculations of the chemical equilibria in aqueous solution were first performed, and the potential-pH diagram for the Mo-Re-SO42--H2O system was constructed. With the gained insight on the system, 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-(2-ethylhexyl)-ester (PC88A) diluted in kerosene was used as the extractant agent. Keeping constant the reaction temperature and aqueous-to-organic phase ratio (1:1), organic phase concentration and pH were the studied experimental variables. It was observed that by increasing the acidity of the solution and extractant concentration, selectivity towards Mo extraction increased, while the opposite was true for Re extraction. Selective Mo removal (+95%) from leach solution containing ca. 9 g/L Mo and 0.5 g/L Re was achieved when using an organic phase of 5% PC88A at pH = 0. No rhenium was coextracted during 10 min of extraction time at room temperature. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed in order to study the interactions of organic extractants with Mo and Re ions, permitting a direct comparison of calculation results with the experimental data to estimate selectivity factors in Mo-Re separation. For this aim, PC88A and D2EHPA (di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid) were simulated. The interaction energies of D2EHPA were shown to be higher than those of PC88A, which could be due to its stronger capability for complex formation. Besides, it was found that the interaction energies of both extractants follow this trend considering Mo species: MoO22+ > MoO42-. It was also demonstrated through DFT calculations that the interaction energies of D2EHPA and PC88A with species are based on these trends, respectively: MoO22+ > MoO42- > ReO4- and MoO22+ > ReO4- > MoO42-, in qualitative agreement with the experimental findings.

AB This paper is a contribution to the literature on the explanatory power and calibration of heterogeneous asset pricing models. We set out a new stochastic market-fraction asset pricing model of fundamentalists and trend followers under a market maker. Our model explains key features of financial market behaviour such as market dominance, convergence to the fundamental price and under- and over-reaction. We use the dynamics of the underlying deterministic system to characterize these features and statistical properties, including convergence of the limiting distribution and autocorrelation structure. We confirm these properties using Monte Carlo simulations.

AB In the literature, there are some data which indicate that benzodiazepines and other chemical compounds with the same mechanism of action (Diazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Lorazepam, Zopiclone, etc.) also have other effects. We investigated the effects of experimental chronic inflammation under the administration of some tranquilizers and hypnotics on peripheral algesia induced in rats by "writhing test". Chronic inflammation was induced by "cotton wool granuloma" technique. The "writhing test" consisted in intraperitoneal injection of an irritant agent (acetic acid 0.0025%, 0.4 mL). The animal reacts with a characteristic stretching behavior called writhing. A writhe is indicated by stretching of the abdomen with simultaneous stretching of at least one hind limb. Then, the animals were placed individually into glass beakers and 5 minutes were allowed to elapse. The rats were then observed for a period of 10 minutes and the number of writhes is recorded for each animal. Three drugs were administered by gastric probe: Alprazolam 1 mg/kg, Zolpidem 10 mg/kg and Zopiclone 10 mg/kg. Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative used as a tranquilizer. Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine with marked sedative-hypnotic effect and it has the same mechanism of action like benzodiazepines. Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone with sedative-hypnotic effect used as hypnotic and acts like benzodiazepines. After that, the animals were sacrificed and the weight of cotton wool granuloma was determined. In the same time, the histopatological aspect of granulomatous inflammation was studied. It was found that experimental proliferative inflammation under the action of these drugs was accompanied by a peripheral analgesic activity in "writhing test". The mechanisms of these effects are not fully elucidated. Some explanations are: they act as agonists or antagonists on algesia and inflammation mediators and they have a stimulating effect on peripheral omega(3)-benzodiazepine receptors ("peripheral-type" receptors).

AB We investigate the relationship between productivity and unemployment with an ABM approach. In particular, we use the framework of Riccetti et al. (J Econ Interact Coord 10(2):305-332, 2015) to run computer simulations considering different levels of productivity and analyse the corresponding effects on unemployment. The simulation results show the emergence of a fluctuating pattern of the unemployment rate, the public deficit and the inflation rate as functions of productivity. The marked pattern of the unemployment rate in the model is empirically validated by the OECD database. This unexpected oscillating behaviour remains in subsequent simplifications of the baseline model. Thus, our approach allows us to explain the productivity-employment linkage as an emergent macroeconomic property of a complex system. We conclude that economic policies aimed at increasing labour productivity could have unintended side effects on the unemployment rate, the government deficit and the inflation rate, which should be explored and taken into account before the policy is implemented.

AB For the sake of reduction of reducing agent in blast furnace and making use of low-quality iron ore and coals, the use of ferro coke containing metallic iron as a catalyst was proposed to control the thermal reserve zone temperature. In the production of ferro coke, a vertical shaft furnace is used to realize the optimum carbonizing and pre-reduction process. To optimize the heating process of the shaft furnace, visualization of the temperature distributions inside the shaft furnace is important. In this study, a new simulation technology is developed to visualize the gas flow and the temperature distribution of the briquettes inside the shaft furnace. In the simulation method, both gas flows and solid flows are modeled by the finite volume method so that we can obtain simulation results within a reasonable computation time. Simulation results show that we achieved a good temperature profile in the shaft furnace in the final test campaigns in Keihin works.

AB Lead(II) ion is a very toxic element known to cause detrimental effects to human health even at very low concentrations. An adsorbent prepared using mucilaginous leaves from Diceriocaryum eriocarpum plant (DEP) was used for the adsorption of lead(II) ion from aqueous solution. Batch experiments were performed on simulated aqueous solutions under optimized conditions of adsorbent dosage, contact time, pH and initial lead(II) ion concentration at 298 K. The Langmuir isotherm model more suitably described the adsorption process than the Freundlich model with linearized coefficients of 0.9661 and 0.9547, respectively. Pseudo-second order kinetic equation best described the kinetics of the reaction. Fourier transform infra-red analysis confirmed the presence of amino (-NH), carbonyl (-C=O) and hydroxyl (-OH) functional groups. Application of the prepared adsorbent to wastewater samples of 10 mg/L and 12 mg/L of lead(II) ion concentration taken from a waste stabilization pond showed removal efficiencies of 95.8% and 96.4%, respectively. Futhermore, 0.1 M HCl was a better desorbing agent than 0.1 M NaOH and de-ionized water. The experimental data obtained demonstrated that mucilaginous leaves from DEP can be used as a suitable adsorbent for lead(II) ion removal from wastewater.

AB Thermally expandable microcapsules, often called microspheres or microballoons, are utilized in compression, injection molding and extrusion processes to foam different types of polymers. Microballoons consist of a polymer shell and a liquid hydrocarbon core. Hydrocarbons are used as a physical blowing agent. In this study, a mathematical model was developed to describe the expansion behavior of a microballoon in air and in a polymer matrix. The model was used to determine the key factors in improving the expandability of the balloon at designated temperatures. The viscoelastic properties of the polymer shell, evaporation of hydrocarbons in the balloon and diffusion behavior of the blowing agent through the polymer shell were taken into account in the model. The results of the developed model showed quite good agreement with the experimentally observed thermal expansion behavior of a microballoon. A sensitivity analysis of the expansion behavior with respect to the properties of the microballoon was also conducted to devise an optimal design strategy for high-expansion microballoons.

AB This paper introduces a hybrid automata model for testing ideas and hypotheses relating to urban gentrification dynamics. We focus on the agency of relocating households in dynamic property markets as the theoretical basis for construction of the model. The methodology employed makes use of hybridized cellular- and agent-automata that allow for representation of co-interaction among fixed and mobile entities in urban settings across multiple scales. Simulations run with the model are based on various hypotheses from gentrification theory and these hypotheses are tested in simulation by running the model through theory-informed scenarios. The usefulness of this scheme is demonstrated through application of the model to a historically under-invested area of Salt Lake City in Utah that is undergoing recent transformation. Our results show that the hybrid approach is useful in representing human behavior in complex adaptive urban systems. Moreover, our model proves to be a useful test-bed for studying gentrification.

AB Local anesthetics promote analgesia by interacting with excitable membranes. Articaine (ATC) has a unique composition among local anesthetics as it possesses a thiophene instead of the typical phenyl ring. Aiming to characterize the interaction of neutral articaine (nATC) with phospholipid membranes, we have employed a synergistic approach of experimental and computational techniques. Fluorescence measurements supported nATC partitioning into the membranes, since its intrinsic fluorescence anisotropy increased from 0.03 in water to 0.29 in the presence of egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) liposomes, and the fluorescence of AHBA, a probe that monitors the water-membrane interface, was quenched by nATC. H-1 NMR experiments revealed changes in the chemical shifts of articaine and EPC hydrogens after partitioning, and shorter T-1 values of nATC hydrogens when inserted into the EPC vesicles. Contacts of nATC and the phospholipid polar head group were inferred from 2D-NOE. Taken together, these results indicate a superficial insertion of the nATC molecules inside EPC bilayers. This conclusion was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulations, which allowed the identification of the key interactions underlying the preferential location of nATC in the bilayer. Contrary to what is often stated (that articaine is a high lipophilic local anesthetic agent) our results place ATC among the hydrophilic ones, such as lidocaine, prilocaine, and mepivacaine, for which the water/membrane interface is the preferred location.

AB Cardiomyopathies are an important and diverse group of heart muscle diseases in which the heart muscle itself is structurally or functionally abnormal and in which coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular and congenital heart disease are absent or do not sufficiently explain the observed myocardial abnormality. This often results in severe heart failure accompanied by arrhythmias and/or sudden death. Clinical and morphological diversity of cardiomyopathies can reflect the broad spectrum of distinct underlying molecular causes or genetic hethanerogeneity. In many cases the disease is inherited and is termed familial dilated cardiomyopathy (FDC), which may account for up to 30% of dilated cardiomyopathies (DCM). FDC is principally caused by genetic mutations in FDC genes that encode for cytoskeletal, nuclear and sarcomeric proteins in the cardiac myocyte. In addition, modifying genes, lifestyle and additional factors were reported to influence onset of disease, disease progression, and prognosis. The individual patient's phenotype may reflect a summation and/or interaction of the underlying mutation(s) with other genetic or environmental factors. During the last years major advances have been made in the understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of this type of disease. Nevertheless, much more progress in the identification of underlying mutations, susceptibility genes and modifier genes is important and indispensable for the development of new etiology-orientated forms of therapy. A pivotal role for autoimmunity in a substantial proportion of patients with DCM is supported by the presence of organ-specific autoantibodies, inflammatory infiltrates and pro-inflammatory cytotoxic cytokines. Furthermore, familial occurrence of DCM goes ahead with the presence of autoantibodies and abnormal cytokine profiles in first-degree relatives with asymptomatic left ventricular enlargement. These relatives suffer from a higher risk for the development of DCM after years. This suggests the involvement of a disrupted humoral and cellular immunity early in the development of the disease.
   There is reasonable clinical and experimental evidence, that DCM in addition may occur as late stage of cardiac infection and inflammation. The large spectrum of clinical forms depends on several factors such as genetic determinants of the infective agent, the genetics, age and gender of the host, and the host immunocompetence. In general, infectious agents, including viruses such as entero-, cytomegalo-, and adenoviruses, bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi or Chlamydia pneumoniae, protozoa and even fungi can cause inflammatory heart disease leading to DCM. The infectious agents most often identified in DCM nowadays are parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus 3, and Epstein-Barr virus. Persistence of these viruses within the myocardium is associated with reduction of ejection fraction after 6 months. For patients with suspected inflammatory heart disease the immunohistochemical detection of inflammatory infiltrates is related to poor outcome. Many faces of inflammatory heart disease coexist where different phases of the disease progress simultaneously: phase 1 is dominated by viral infection itself, phase 2 by the onset of (probably) multiple autoimmune reactions, and phase 3 by the progression to cardiac dilatation.
   Further investigations with regard to the etiology of structural heart diseases should include an intensive clinical investigation of the given patient. A possible family history including a pedigree should be ascertained and with regard to a possible inflammatory or viral heart disease, endomyocardial biopsies should be investigated by polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry.

AB This paper demonstrates the synthesis of highly efficient activated porous biocarbons through chemical activation of Lotus seed for pre- and postcombustion CO2 capture. The activation was performed at three different temperatures using four different KOH/biomass impregnation ratios. The synthesized materials are ultramicroporous and display bimodal porosity which can be easily controlled by varying the experimental conditions. The specific surface area can be tuned from 1079 m(2) g(-1) to 2230 by adjusting the amount of activating agent and the carbonization temperature. The optimized material with the highest surface area (2230 m(2) g(-1)) and pore volume (0.96 cm(3) g(-1)) showed a simultaneous high promise for both low pressure (6.8 mmol g(-1) at 1 bar/0 degrees C) and high pressure (26.4 mmol g(-1) at 30 bar/0 degrees C) CO2 capture, which is extremely difficult to achieve for any CO2 sorbent and has never been reported before. This exceptional performance is attributed to ultramicroporosity, high surface area, and surface-oxygenated functional groups. Heat of adsorption (30.4 kJ mol(-1)) value suggests that adsorption is physical in nature and accounts for easier material regeneration. These multiple merits underline the importance of synthesized materials in the field of CO2 capture and potential for various other environmental applications.

AB In host and natural environments, microbes often exist in complex multispecies communities. The molecular mechanisms through which such communities develop and persist, despite significant antagonistic interactions between species, are not well understood. The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a lethal weapon commonly employed by Gram-negative bacteria to inhibit neighboring species through the delivery of toxic effectors. It is well established that intraspecies protection is conferred by immunity proteins that neutralize effector toxicities. In contrast, the mechanisms for interspecies protection are not clear. Here we use two T6SS-active antagonistic bacterial species, Aeromonas hydrophila and Vibrio cholerae, to demonstrate that interspecies protection is dependent on effectors. A. hydrophila and V. cholerae do not share conserved immunity genes but could coexist equally in a mixture. However, mutants lacking the T6SS or effectors were effectively eliminated by the competing wild-type strain. Time-lapse microscopic analyses showed that mutually lethal interactions drive the segregation of mixed species into distinct single-species clusters by eliminating interspersed single cells. Cluster formation provides herd protection by abolishing lethal interactions inside each cluster and restricting the interactions to the boundary. Using an agent-based modeling approach, we simulated the antagonistic interactions of two hypothetical species. The resulting simulations recapitulated our experimental observations. These results provide mechanistic insights regarding the general role of microbial weapons in determining the structures of complex multispecies communities.
   IMPORTANCE
   Investigating the warfare of microbes allows us to better understand the ecological relationships in complex microbial communities such as the human microbiota. Here we use the T6SS, a deadly bacterial weapon, as a model to demonstrate the importance of lethal interactions in determining community structures and the exchange of genetic materials. This simplified model elucidates a mechanism of microbial herd protection by which competing antagonistic species can coexist in the same niche, despite their diverse mutually destructive activities. Our results also suggest that antagonistic interactions impose strong selection that could promote multicellular organism-like social behaviors and contribute to the transition to multicellularity during evolution.

AB A parsimonious set of mechanisms explains how and under which conditions behavioral deviations build into cascades that reshape institutional frameworks from the bottom up, even if institutional innovations initially conflict with the legally codified rules of the game. Specifically, we argue that this type of endogenous institutional change emerges from an interplay between three factors: the utility gain agents associate with decoupling from institutional equilibria, positive externalities derived from similar decoupling among one's neighbors, and accommodation by state actors. Where endogenous institutional change driven by societal action is sufficiently robust, it can induce political actors to accommodate and eventually to legitimize institutional innovations from below. We provide empirical illustrations of our theory in two disparate institutional contextsthe rise of private manufacturing in the Yangzi delta region of China since 1978, focusing on two municipalities in that region, and the diffusion of gay bars in San Francisco in the 1960s and 1970s. We validate our theory with an agent-based simulation.

AB Objectives. We examined the impact of access to paid sick days (PSDs) and stay-at-home behavior on the influenza attack rate in workplaces.
   Methods. We used an agent-based model of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, with PSD data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, standard influenza epidemic parameters, and the probability of staying home when ill. We compared the influenza attack rate among employees resulting from workplace transmission, focusing on the effects of presenteeism (going to work when ill).
   Results. In a simulated influenza epidemic (R-0 = 1.4), the attack rate among employees owing to workplace transmission was 11.54%. A large proportion (72.00%) of this attack rate resulted from exposure to employees engaging in presenteeism. Universal PSDs reduced workplace infections by 5.86%. Providing 1 or 2 "flu days" -allowing employees with influenza to stay home-reduced workplace infections by 25.33% and 39.22%, respectively.
   Conclusions. PSDs reduce influenza transmission owing to presenteeism and, hence, the burden of influenza illness in workplaces.

DE unemployment; start-up; search; simulation
AB An urn-ball probabilistic model of the labor market is developed. Agents can be employed (voluntarily or involuntarily) unemployed, or entrepreneurs. The analytical long-run equilibrium probabilities for each state and the matching function are derived. In equilibrium, a higher reservation wage increases the number of start-ups, but has an overall negative impact on the unemployment rate. A more buoyant economy (higher average growth rate and higher average wages) is shown to be associated with a lower unemployment rate. Higher start-up costs discourage entrepreneurship and increase unemployment. More active search behavior leads first to a decrease in the unemployment rate, and then to a small increase, due to increased coordination failure induced by the higher number of applications sent by job seekers. The out-of-equilibrium dynamics axe investigated through an agent-based simulation, which also provides results on firm demography. Important empirical regularities such as the Beveridge and the Okun curve are recovered. Finally, the simulation model is used to investigate departures from maximizing individual behavior and the effects of more realistic assumptions about profits and the business cycle.

AB Malignant melanoma of the oral mucosa is common in Japan. The effects on metastasis of puncturing the tumor before Surgery or using chemotherapy after extirpation of the tumor were Studied using animal models. G-361 cells were transplanted subcutaneously into mice. In half the animals, the Subcutaneous tumor was punctured with an 18G needle twice a week from 2 weeks after transplantation until death. In the other mice, the subcutaneous tumor was extirpated 6 weeks after transplantation; the animals were killed 2 weeks later. Dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) or cisplatin (CDDP) were injected into the peritoneal cavity 3 days before extirpation or during extirpation. Metastases to the axilla lymph node and the lung were examined in both groups. The animals that received puncturing developed lymph node and pulmonary metastasis earlier and more frequently than those Without puncturing. 50% of mice that received no anticancer agent, had lymph node and pulmonary metastases after tumor extirpation. Preoperative DTIC or CDDP reduced the frequency of metastasis to 25-35%. DTIC or CDDP administration during extirpation, significantly reduced the metastasis rate to 7-10%. Prognosis for oral melanoma patients may be better when surgery and postoperative chemotherapy are performed simultaneously without preoperative surgical procedures.

TI Motion planning for Nonlinear symmetric distributed robotic formations
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE distributed robot systems; nonholonomic motion planning; path planning;
   multiple mobile robot systems
AB This paper develops a motion planning algorithm which exploits symmetries in distributed systems to reduce motion planning computation complexity. Symmetries allow for algebraic manipulations that are computationally costly, which normally must be carried out for each component in a distributed system, to be related among various symmetric components in a distributed system by a simple algebraic relationship. This leads to a large reduction in the complexity of the overall motion planning problem for a group of distributed mobile robotic agents. In particular, due to the manner in which a symmetric system is defined, the structure of the Chen-Fliess-Sussmann differential equations has a simple relationship among various symmetric components of a distributed system. Essentially, symmetries are defined in a manner which preserves the Lie algebraic structure of each component. In a system with distributed computational capability, the motion planning computations may be distributed throughout formation in such a way that the objectives of the formation are satisfied and collision avoidance is guaranteed. The algorithm maintains a rigid body formation at the beginning and end of the trajectory, as well as possibly specified intermediate points. Due to the generally nonholonomic nature of mobile robots, guaranteeing a rigid body formation during the intermediate motion is impossible. However, it is possible to bound the magnitude of the deviation from the rigid body formation at any point along the trajectory. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the utility of the algorithm.

AB We present a combined experimental and theoretical study dedicated to analyzing the surface-enhanced Raman spectra of solutions of citrate-covered silver nanoparticles (NPs) in the presence of acetil-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). The Raman signals from Neu5Ac (particularly the bands located at 1002 and 1237 cm(-1)) can easily be detected for concentrations as low as 1 mg/dl, providing outstanding molecular sensing properties for our synthesized Ag-NPs. When compared to its solid phase, Neu5Ac adsorption on citrate-covered Ag particles leads to enhanced Raman intensities; many vibrational frequencies are shifted; and relative intensities undergo significant changes. These variations in the spectra complicate molecular identification, especially in mixed overlayers as the ones considered in this work. Consequently, experimental results are discussed on the basis of extensive density functional theory (DFT) calculations on model citrate-covered silver clusters with coadsorbed Neu5Ac species. Several citrate-Neu5Ac-cluster complexes are optimized, and the Raman spectra of every stable structure are calculated. The theoretical data reveal a complex interplay between the chemical nature and distribution of the adsorbates. Citrate molecules prefer to aggregate on the silver surface, leaving thus sizable regions of the Ag cluster exposed for Neu5Ac adsorption. The simulated Raman spectra of citrate-Neu5AcAg complexes show acceptable similarities with experimental SERS measurements, allowing for a clear identification of the different vibrational bands. By changing the functional groups attached to the Ag cluster it is possible to modulate the adsorption properties and Raman response of Neu5Ac. DFT calculations reveal that propanethiol adsorption on model Ag clusters allows the formation of a more uniform molecular overlayer, effectively protecting the silver surface from the surrounding media. We predict that Ag-NPs functionalized with propanethiol species are not efficient substrates for Raman detection of Neu5Ac. The previous predictions are corroborated by performing SERS measurements on propanethiol-covered Ag-NPs exposed to different concentrations of Neu5Ac from which the absence of Neu5Ac spectral features is observed. The here-used DFT scheme provides an adequate theoretical frame to predict and understand the physical origin of the Raman response of adsorbed molecules in Ag-NPs, and we expect that this predictability may extend to other metallic NPs.

ID DESIGNING AUTOMATION; PERFORMANCE; AWARENESS; ERRORS
AB Analyses of aviation safety reports reveal that human-machine conflicts induced by poor automation design are remarkable precursors of accidents. A review of different crew-automation conflicting scenarios shows that they have a common denominator: the autopilot behaviour interferes with the pilot's goal regarding the flight guidance via hidden' mode transitions. Considering both the human operator and the machine (i.e. the autopilot or the decision functions) as agents, we propose a Petri net model of those conflicting interactions, which allows them to be detected as deadlocks in the Petri net. In order to test our Petri net model, we designed an autoflight system that was formally analysed to detect conflicting situations. We identified three conflicting situations that were integrated in an experimental scenario in a flight simulator with 10 general aviation pilots. The results showed that the conflicts that we had a-priori identified as critical had impacted the pilots' performance. Indeed, the first conflict remained unnoticed by eight participants and led to a potential collision with another aircraft. The second conflict was detected by all the participants but three of them did not manage the situation correctly. The last conflict was also detected by all the participants but provoked typical automation surprise situation as only one declared that he had understood the autopilot behaviour. These behavioural results are discussed in terms of workload and number of fired hidden' transitions. Eventually, this study reveals that both formal and experimental approaches are complementary to identify and assess the criticality of human-automation conflicts.Practitioner Summary: We propose a Petri net model of human-automation conflicts. An experiment was conducted with general aviation pilots performing a scenario involving three conflicting situations to test the soundness of our formal approach. This study reveals that both formal and experimental approaches are complementary to identify and assess the criticality conflicts.

AB This work demonstrates the enhancement of the adsorption properties of polyethersulfone (PES) microfiltration membranes for 17 beta-estradiol (E2) from water. This compound represents a highly potent endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC). The PES membranes were modified with a hydrophilic coating functionalized by amide groups. The modification was performed by the interfacial reaction between hexamethylenediamine (HMD) or piperazine (PIP) as the amine monomer and trimesoyl chloride (TMC) or adipoyl chloride (ADC) as the acid monomer on the surface of the membrane using electron beam irradiation. The modified membranes and the untreated PES membrane were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), water permeance measurements, water contact angle measurements, and adsorption experiments. Furthermore, the effects of simultaneous changes in four modification parameters: amine monomer types (HMD or PIP), acid monomer types (TMC or ADC), irradiation dosage (150 or 200 kGy), and the addition of toluene as a swelling agent, on the E2 adsorption capacity were investigated. The results showed that the adsorption capacities of modified PES membranes toward E2 are >60%, while the unmodified PES membrane had an adsorption capacity up to 30% for E2 under similar experimental conditions, i.e., an enhancement of a factor of 2. Next to the superior adsorption properties, the modified PES membranes maintain high water permeability and no pore blockage was observed. The highlighted results pave the way to develop efficient low-cost, stable, and high-performance adsorber membranes.

AB Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) is one of the primary OPs used as an initiator, curing agent, or medicine. Some of the plastic processes use BPO without air for maintaining the efficiency of the entire reaction. However, there have been numerous accidents involving BPO in petrochemical plants, especially those related to fire and explosion, that are due to its unstable thermal properties and peroxy bond (-O-O-). BPO can be identified as a typical substance with autocatalytic reaction characteristics. Therefore, the related processes and their products are critical to prevent these kinds of chemical contingencies. This research was based on two types of instruments (nonisothermal and isothermal calorimetry), and theoretical methods to further determine the thermal hazard level. From the experimental results for BPO and BPO mixed with its by-products, the heat of decomposition was much higher (from 800 to 1235 J/g), the time to maximum rate under isothermal conditions was much shorter (from 99.1 to 17.4 h at 75.0 degrees C), and the apparent activation energy was much lower (from 118 to 91 kJ/mol) after BPO was mixed with its by-products. Therefore, the hazard level of BPO mixed with its by-products from the reaction process was much higher than that of pure BPO.

AB The selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with C3H6 in the presence of O-2 on silica sub-microtubes with platinum nanoparticles was studied in order to establish a possible reaction mechanism at different experimental conditions. This catalyst showed a high NO conversion with very high selectivity to N-2 at mild conditions in the presence of excess oxygen when using C3H6 as reducing agent.
   The influence of both NO and C3H6 concentrations on their conversions was analyzed at different space times. The obtained results suggest that the three reactants (C3H6, NO, and O-2) are adsorbed on Pt sites. The kinetic model proposed considers that both dissociative adsorption of NO and activation of the hydrocarbon can take place simultaneously. Nevertheless, the value of the parameters obtained by the resolution of the model equations indicates that the first one presents a major relevance. These results are in concordance with the high selectivity to N-2 observed, because the preponderance presence of dissociated NO avoids the formation of N2O by the reaction of molecular NO with N dissociated from NO. Furthermore, both NO reduction and C3H6 oxidation conversions are represented reasonably well by the model presented. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Augmentation of antileishmanial efficacy of miltefosine in combination

SO PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH

AB Current drugs for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis are inadequate, and their efficacies are also compromised due to suppression of immune function during the course of infection. Miltefosine is the only promising orally active antileishmanial drug, but due to its long half-life, there is risk of development of resistance. To overcome these problems, efforts are needed to develop combination therapy of miltefosine with effective immunostimulating agents where a decrease of parasitic burden and simultaneous enhancement of adaptive immunity can be achieved. In the present study, we have explored the antileishmanial efficacy of a subcurative dose of miltefosine in combination with free as well as liposomal palmitoyl tuftsin (p-tuftsin) using a Leishmania donovani/BALB/c mouse model. When miltefosine (2.5 mg/kg for 5 days) was given with free p-tuftsin, the inhibitory effect was significantly increased from 49.6% to 66% (P < 0.01), which was further enhanced up to 81% (P < 0.001) when given after liposomal encapsulation of p-tuftsin. Significant enhancement in parasitic inhibition (93%, P < 0.01) was witnessed when animals were co-administered with liposomal p-tuftsin + 5 mg/kg x 5 days dose of miltefosine (72.1%). Enhancement in the production of Th1 cytokines (IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma), reactive oxygen, and nitrogen metabolites was witnessed in the combination group. A remarkable increase in phagocytosis index was also observed indicating overall immunological enhancement to antileishmanial activity of miltefosine by p-tuftsin.

AB Drugs delaying cardiac repolarization by blockade of hERG K+ channel generally prolong the QT interval of the electrocardiogram, an effect regarded as a cardiac risk factor with the potential to cause 'torsade des pointes'-type arrhythmias in humans. The present study applied a homology building technique and molecular dynamics simulations to model the pore of hERG K+ channel. A docking analysis was then performed on selected ligands which were classified as QT-prolonging or non-prolonging after experimental measurements in in vivo anesthetized guinea pig. The results of this structural analysis provided a "toxicophoric" model that was further exploited to inspect a dataset of known QT-prolonging/non-prolonging molecules. The emerging major chemical features to be avoided, in order to obtain cardiac safe therapeutic agents, comprise the simultaneous presence of (i) a protonated nitrogen atom within an observed range of distances from a heteroatom; (ii) aromatic groups capable of interacting within an area defined by Gly657 residues of the pore or within an area located at the top of the longitudinal axis of the pore. Moreover, additional hydrophobic moieties interacting with one of the equatorial cavities located in the area near-by Tyr652 residues and/or with a hydrophobic fing defined by Phe656 residues should be avoided.

AB Small-angle neutron scattering experiments were performed on dilute solutions of a high molecular weight protein (fibronectin, M= 580 kg/mol) in four cases: native conditions; unfolded state obtained by a denaturing agent (urea); and two badly refolded (or collapsed) states obtained by progressive elimination of the denaturing agent in salt-containing or salt-free solutions. Our main result is concerned by the conformation of the protein as the attempt for refolding is driven with or without salt. In salt-containing solution, we observe unambiguously that the protein chain collapses at large length scales but still obeys to a Gaussian statistics at short length scales. In other words, the globule embodies a large quantity of solvent compared to the compact situation. In salt-free solutions, the badly refolded protein is not globular but displays both a coil-like and an open conformation at large length scales and a local high density area. This behavior is discussed with respect to the scaling theories for polymers and polyampholytes.

AB Cancer can be viewed as the loss of cooperative cell behaviors that normally facilitate multicellularity; including the formation of tissues and organs. Hanahan and Weinberg describe the phenotypic differences between healthy and cancerous cells in an article titled "The Hallmarks of Cancer" (Cell, 100, 57-70, 2000). Here the authors propose six phenotypic changes at the cellular level as the essential hallmarks of cancer. They investigate the dynamics and interactions of these hallmarks in a model known as CancerSim. They describe how CancerSim implements the hallmarks in an agent-based simulation which can help test the hypotheses put forth by Hanahan and Weinberg. Experiments with CancerSim are described that study the interactions of cell phenotype alterations, and in particular, the likely sequences of precancerous mutations, known as pathways. The experiments show that sequencing is an important factor in tumorigenesis, as some mutations have preconditions-they are selectively advantageous only in combination with other mutations. CancerSim enables a modeler to Study the dynamics of a developing tumor and simulate how progression can be altered by tuning model parameters.

AB Background: Macrophages cover a major role in the immune system, being the most plastic cell yielding several key immune functions.
   Methods: Here we derived a minimalistic gene regulatory network model for the differentiation of macrophages into the two phenotypes M1 (pro-) and M2 (anti-inflammatory).
   Results: To test the model, we simulated a large number of such networks as in a statistical ensemble. In other words, to enable the inter-cellular crosstalk required to obtain an immune activation in which the macrophage plays its role, the simulated networks are not taken in isolation but combined with other cellular agents, thus setting up a discrete minimalistic model of the immune system at the microscopic/intracellular (i.e., genetic regulation) and mesoscopic/intercellular scale.
   Conclusions: We show that within the mesoscopic level description of cellular interaction and cooperation, the gene regulatory logic is coherent and contributes to the overall dynamics of the ensembles that shows, statistically, the expected behaviour.

AB Chaos is present in non-linear systems that describe temporal phenomena in the physical and life sciences. Well-known instances of chaos include the logistic map, the Lorenz equations, and forced non-linear oscillators. The regular and chaotic dynamics of free gas bubbles and gas-encapsulated microbubbles (contrast agents) are of immense importance in the efficient implementation of ultrasonic contrast imaging. A modification of the Keller-Herring model, which takes into account the elastic properties of the encapsulating shell, is investigated with respect to the bifurcation structure of the time-dependent microbubble radius. Numerical simulations show that the radial oscillations can be periodic as well as chaotic in appropriate parameter domains. Several investigations on chaotic aspects of dynamics presented here are new and highlighted appropriately. The influence of the acoustic field and shell parameters are investigated to identify values where the oscillations undergo bifurcations and the bubble response becomes chaotic. An analysis of chaotic behaviour in multiple-bubble systems completes the investigation and reveals the significant influence the free gas bubbles have on the acoustic response of their encapsulated counterparts.

AB Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are metal-dependent enzymes and considered as important targets for cell functioning. Particularly, higher expression of class I HDACs is common in the onset of multiple malignancies which results in deregulation of many target genes involved in cell growth, differentiation and survival. Although substantial attempts have been made to control the irregular functioning of HDACs by employing various inhibitors with high sensitivity towards transformed cells, limited success has been achieved in epigenetic cancer therapy. Here in this study, we used ligand-based pharmacophore and 2-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) modeling approaches for targeting class I HDAC isoforms. Pharmacophore models were generated by taking into account the known IC50 values and experimental energy scores with extensive validations. The QSAR model having an external R-2 value of 0.93 was employed for virtual screening of compound libraries. 10 potential lead compounds (C1-C10) were short-listed having strong binding affinities for HDACs, out of which 2 compounds (C8 and C9) were able to interact with all members of class I HDACs. The potential binding modes of HDAC2 and HDAC8 to C8 were explored through molecular dynamics simulations. Overall, bioactivity and ligand efficiency (binding energy/non-hydrogen atoms) profiles suggested that proposed hits may be more effective inhibitors for cancer therapy.

AB No question, one of the leading causal factors for early atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease (CHD) is the abundance of LDL-cholesterol in the blood, exceeding limits of loo mg/dl. Thus, recommendations for therapy focus on LDL-levels less than loo mg/dl. With the introduction of the statins - a very potent family of lipid lowering agents - such target levels can be achieved in most of the patients, resulting in a drastic decrease of LDL, CHID incidences, as well as in a reduction of cardiac and total mortality.
   There is, however, a remaining small group of patients, who is more or less resistant to an adequate combination of dietary and drug therapy. For these patients, various techniques of apheresis are available for over 15 years. Some of them have been approved by the FDA in the US and comparable regulatory offices in Europe. The most extensive experimental and clinical experience was gathered with the H.E.L.P. system of B. Braun Melsungen, which differs from other apheresis techniques by its efficiency to eliminate LDL, Lp(a), Fibrinogen and CRP simultaneously. The clinical results obtained up to day with the apheresis clearly demonstrate a significant reduction of risk factors and clinical events, as well as an excellent long-term tolerance.

TI Assisting redundant employees in the framework of the Occupational
   Transition Contract program : expertise and experience.
SO REVUE FRANCAISE DE SOCIOLOGIE

DT Article
AB This article, part of a collective research study on the role of expertise in implementing employment policy programs, focuses on the activities - specifically, making judgments and interacting with others - of public-sector personnel working in the framework of one of France's many experimental employment programs, the Occupational Transition Contract. This unique, innovative project is in many respects in the spotlight of French current events. The special expertise of public agents working to assist redundant employees may be observed in how they successively or simultaneously use empathy, understanding and an ability to objectify throughout their interactions with persons "enrolled" in the program. After detailing the program's potential opportunities, we apply Christian Bessy and Francis Chateauraynaud's sociology of perception to study the dominant type of expertise used in it. We then bring in components of disposition sociology to bring to light the segmentation distinguishing actors from one other, the point being to explain regularities in types of expertise and how those may oscillate depending on the conditions in which the expertise is proffered and the varied, polymorphous profiles and experience of members of the small groups in charge of establishing and implementing the Occupational Transition Contract in particular areas of France. Attention to these activities and to interaction between program "referents" and participants brings to light how labor norms and accords have been profoundly transformed in the shift from the "lifelong job" notion to that of "sustainable employability".

AB Synthetic routes to highly functionalized 1,4-thiazepinones 2 and 3 have been developed. S-Ac-N-Boc-L-Cys-D(L)-ThrOMe 7a,b have been prepared and, after transformation into the corresponding mesylates, used as the cyclization substrates. Treatment of these compounds with LiAlH(OMe)(3) in THF results in mesylate elimination and thiolacetate reduction, giving rise to both a Michael acceptor (a,P-unsaturated ester) and Michael donor (thiol anion), which undergo in situ intramolecular conjugate addition leading to the stereoselective formation of only two of the four possible stereoisomers of 2. On the other hand, PCC/CaCO3 oxidation of 7a gave in 80% yield the corresponding ketone 11, which was in turn transformed into the enol triflate 15. Cleavage of the thiolacetate moiety, simultaneous elimination of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid to generate an allene system, and addition of the thiol group to the central carbon of the allene to provide the enantiomerically pure cyclic compound 3 in 85% yield was effected via a one-pot reaction by means of MeONa/MeOH. Thiazepinone 3 is an interesting intermediate for the preparation of conformationally restricted dipeptide mime tics, and its elaboration into the dual ACE/NEP inhibitor 4 is reported.

AB The VirtualBelgium project aims at developing an understanding of the evolution of the Belgian population using agent-based simulations and considering various aspects of this evolution such as demographics, residential choices, activity patterns, mobility, etc. This simulation is based on a validated synthetic population consisting of approximately 10,000,000 individuals and 4,350,000 households located in the 589 municipalities of Belgium. The work presented in this paper focuses only on the mobility behaviour of such large populations and this is simulated using an activity-based approach in which the travel demand is derived from the activities performed by the individuals. The proposed model is distribution-based and requires only minimal information, but is designed to easily take advantage of any additional network-related data available. The proposed activity-based approach has been applied to the Belgian synthetic population. The quality of the agent behaviour is discussed using statistical criteria extracted from the literature and results show that VirtualBelgium produces satisfactory results.

AB The outcome of two different alternating regimens of chemotherapy was investigated in a prospective controlled trial in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).  Both regimens comprised cyclophosphamide, lomustine, vincristine, methotrexate, doxorubicin and etoposide administered in different schedules.  The investigative regimen (B) included simultaneous administration of cyclophosphamide + lomustine alternating with cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin, and with doxorubicin + lomustine.  The hypothetical superiority of this regimen was based on data from experimental animal tumors suggesting potentiated efficacy of the three specific combinations.  A total of 234 patients were included, and 113 vs 108 patients were eligible.  Median survival in both groups was 48 weeks (p = 0.89).  Complete remissions were observed in 36/101 and in 42/99 patients evaluable for response.  There was no significant difference in response duration.  At restaging after 18 months of chemotherapy 27 patients (16%) and 22 patients (16%), respectively, were free of disease.  Six patients, three in each arm, are still alive, 8+ to 10.5+ years after diagnosis.  Scheduled doses of the six agents were the same in the two regimens except for a 30% reduction of every second dose of cyclophosphamide in regimen B.  Nevertheless, regimen B resulted in significantly more leukopenic patients, septicemic episodes, and blood transfusions, and the dosage of etoposide was more often reduced in arm B than in arm A.  The increased toxicity was not associated with improved treatment results.

AB Water-mists are emerging as an effective agent for the suppression of fires. However, the mechanisms of suppression are complex and the behaviour of individual water droplets in a smoke layer generated by fires must be quantified. This study investigates the behaviour of individual droplets injected from a nozzle into a hot air environment induced by a room fire. A semi-empirical model has been developed based on the conservation of mass, momentum and energy to evaluate the heat and mass transfer phenomena in an air-water droplet system. The model has considered the effect of change of momentum of an evaporating droplet. A forward finite difference approach is applied to solve the governing time dependent ordinary differential equations. The droplets are considered to be lumped mass' and variable thermo-physical properties of water and air and the change of Reynolds number of the droplets, due to the change of their diameter and velocity are considered. The effect of high evaporation rate on the mass and heat transfer coefficient and the contribution of radiation emanating by a flame and the surrounding boundary walls are also considered in the model which were not taken into account in the previous studies. Experimental data on terminal velocity and adiabatic saturation temperature are used to validate and verify the model. The validation and verification indicate that the proposed model predicted the terminal velocity within 4% of the experimental data and predicted the saturation temperature within 5% of the adiabatic saturation temperature. This semi-empirical model is also used as a tool to validate a more comprehensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based tool, Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). It is found that FDS results agree well with the results of the proposed model. Furthermore, the proposed model can be used to evaluate the temperature, velocity, diameter and other physical properties of a droplet travelling through a layer of hot air.

AB Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is a phosphate transferase present in bacteria and eukaryotes. In previous studies, we have shown that AP is able to dephosphorylate lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at physiological pH levels. Because LPS is the causative agent of gram-negative sepsis, we hypothesize that AP might be used as a medication during early stages of LPS-induced septic shock. We have demonstrated protective effects of AP when this enzyme was administered simultaneously with LPS. However, a major question of anti-LPS therapies is whether they are also effective after systemic infiltration of whole bacteria and if they also act in later stages of the disease. To test this, we explored the protective effects of AP from human placenta (pIAP) in a bacterial challenge model in Balb/c mice. AP was intravenously administered 20 min after a bacterial intraperitoneal inoculation of 2 to 5 x 10(7) CFU of Escherichia coli suspended in a 100-muL volume of saline. It was shown that AP attenuated the systemic host response upon E. coli. Body temperature was normalized as compared with untreated septic mice. Also, serum nitric oxide levels 24 h after the injection of bacteria were reduced almost to control levels in mice that received AP. Moreover, survival after 24 h was significantly higher in the AP-treated group compared with the nontreated control group.

AB Defense modeling and simulation (DM&S) has brought insights into how to efficiently operate combat entities, such as soldiers and weapon systems. Most DM&S works have been developed to reflect accurate descriptions of military doctrines, yet these doctrines provide only guidelines of military operations, not details about how the combat entities should behave. Because such vague parts are often fulfilled with the appropriate behavior of combat entities in a battlefield, one part argues that DM&S should consider individual combat behaviors as well. However, it is known as an infeasible problem discovering best individual actions from infinite searching space, such as the battlefield. This paper proposes a layered behavior modeling to practically resolve this issue. The proposed method applies descriptive modeling to reduce the searching space by employing domain-specific knowledge; and prescriptive modeling to discover best individual actions in the reduced space. For the generalization, the proposed method adapts both modeling methods being modularized, and then the proposed method suggested an interface between them that is based on their semantic analogies. Both modeling methods are modularized, so they are interacted through an interface defined in the proposed method. This paper presents a realization of the proposed method through a case study of infantry company-level operations. In the case study, the proposed method is implemented with discrete event system specification formalism as the descriptive part and Markov decision process as the prescriptive part. The experimental results illustrated that the combat effectiveness resulted from the proposed method is statistically better than that from the descriptive-only modeling, and the difference would be guided by the objective of the combat behavior. Through the presented experimental results and the discussion, this paper argues that future DM&S should consider a broad spectrum from the battlefield incorporating the rational behavior of military individuals.

AB The process of welding has a direct influence on the integrity of the structural components and their mechanical response during service. Welding is an inherently multiphysics problem, encompassing a large array of physical phenomena-fluid flow in the weld pool, heat flow in the structure, microstructural evolution/phase transformations, thermal stress development, and distortion of the welded structure. The mathematical model to simulate the coupled fields of the welding process has been outlined in Part I of the present study. In Part I, the developed model have been validated with experimental results and the depth/width (D/W) predictions agree well. Part II documents the effects of welding parameters (welding current/speed, electrode gap, and electrode angle) on the weld D/W ratio, for both low (<= 40 ppm) and high (>= 150 ppm) surface active agent (oxygen) content. The parametric characterization of the weld D/W ratio is validated with published experimental data. They agree well. Results show that increasing the oxygen content beyond 150 ppm does not increase the weld D/W ratio. At high oxygen content of 150 ppm and under current variation, the weld D/W ratio increases and remains constant beyond 160 A. However, when the welding speed is varied, the weld D/W ratio decreases with increasing speed. Similarly, increasing the electrode gap under high oxygen content decreases the weld D/W ratio. The weld D/W ratio shows weak variation with electrode tip angle. The results from the present simulations have also been used to predict the modes of weld solidification. With increase in welding speed, finer dendritic microstructures are expected to be formed near the weld centerline. The variation of weld D/W with heat input per unit length of weld is also presented elaborately. The workpiece deformation and stress distributions are also highlighted. The present study shows the pertinence of coupled welding process simulation to delineate the underlying physical processes and thereby better predict the behavior of welded structures.

AB Spatio-temporal patterns of melanocytic proliferations observed in vivo are important for diagnosis but the mechanisms that produce them are poorly understood. Here we present an agent-based model for simulating the emergence of the main biologic patterns found in melanocytic proliferations. Our model portrays the extracellular matrix of the dermo-epidermal junction as a two-dimensional manifold and we simulate cellular migration in terms of geometric translations driven by adhesive, repulsive and random forces. Abstracted cellular functions and melanocyte-matrix interactions are modeled as stochastic events. For identification and validation we use visual renderings of simulated cell populations in a horizontal perspective that reproduce growth patterns observed in vivo by sequential dermatoscopy and corresponding vertical views that reproduce the arrangement of melanocytes observed in histopathologic sections. Our results show that a balanced interplay of proliferation and migration produces the typical reticular pattern of nevi, whereas the globular pattern involves additional cellular mechanisms. We further demonstrate that slight variations in the three basic cellular properties proliferation, migration, and adhesion are sufficient to produce a large variety of morphological appearances of nevi. We anticipate our model to be a starting point for the reproduction of more complex scenarios that will help to establish functional connections between abstracted microscopic behavior and macroscopic patterns in all types of melanocytic proliferations including melanoma.
   Author summary
   Clinicians and pathologists use pigmentation patterns to classify melanocytic nevi into subgroups and to differentiate nevi from melanoma. The mechanisms that produce these patterns are poorly understood. Here, we reproduce the main patterns of nevi in computer simulations using an abstracted model of individual cell behavior. We developed a novel geometric approach for reconstructing the microanatomy of the epidermis in silico and to model the interaction of cell-agents with the physiological environment. We generated visual representations of simulated populations of melanocytes and demonstrate that the interplay of the collective behavior of individual cells and the physiologic microenvironment is responsible for the typical patterns of melanocytic lesions. Further, we show that the variations of nevi observed in vivo can be reproduced by simple agent-based models that depend on a few key parameters that reflect basic cellular functions such as proliferation, migration, and adhesion. Our simulations confirm existing assumptions about nest formation in melanocytic lesions and offer new insights and testable hypotheses for important biologic phenomena such as senescence and tumor progression. Furthermore, synthetic nevi created by our model may serve as training cases for machine learning algorithms.

AB After the subprime crisis, governments all over the world have gradually attached great importance to prevent excess volatility of house prices. This paper addresses the problem of house price volatility from the perspective of investors in the real estate market and constructs a demand function by maximizing the investor's wealth utility. Combined with the price adjustment rule of excess demand of the discounted dynamic behavior of suppliers, we propose a model for heterogeneous agents in the housing market. In the model we show how heterogeneous expectation and beliefs evolution affect the house price volatility. Meanwhile, the comparative static analysis on the difference between heterogeneous expectation and the rate of beliefs evolution is provided by numerical simulation. These results show that the change of fundamentalists' expectation on the house price will influence the frequency of the house price volatility, while the change of chartists' expectation which increases with the acceleration of beliefs in evolution will influence the range of the volatility.

AB Statistical and diblock copolymers of bis(trimethylsiloxy)methylsilyl methacrylate (MATM2), a hydrolyzable monomer containing a silylester and a siloxane group, and methyl methacrylate (MMA) were synthesized by the RAFT process. The controlled character of the MATM2 RAFT polymerization using 2-cyanoprop-2- yl-dithiobenzoate (CPDB) or S-(2-cyanoprop-2-yl)-S-dodecyltrithiocarbonate as chain transfer agents was assessed by linear pseudo-first-order kinetics, linear molar mass growth with monomer conversion and low molar-mass dispersity. The hydrolysis kinetics of pMATM2 homopolymers was investigated by in situ H-1-NMR and compared to several methacrylic homopolymers bearing hydrolyzable tri-alkylsilylester side groups. pMATM2-block-pMMA diblock copolymers were synthesized by in situ chain extension with methyl methacrylate, using pMATM2-CPDB as a macro-CTA. p(MATM2-stat-MMA) statistical copolymers were synthesized by simultaneous polymerization of MATM2 and MMA by the RAFT process. The monomer reactivity ratios for MATM2 (r(1) = 1.29) and MMA (r(2) = 0.62) were obtained from the Mayo Lewis equation using the least-squares method. All the copolymers synthesized by the RAFT process had molar masses close to the targeted values and low dispersities (D-M < 1.15). DSC analysis and contact angle measurements revealed the influence of the copolymer microstructure (statistical or diblock) on their glass transition temperature and surface energy.

AB Chitin, the most abundant aminopolysaccharide in nature, is a rigid and resistant structural component that contributes to the mechanical strength of chitin-containing organisms. Chemically, it is a linear cationic heteropolysaccharide composed of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucosamine units. The enzymatic degradation of chitin is performed by a chitinolytic system with synergistic and consecutive action. Diverse organisms (containing chitin or not) produce a great variety of chitinolytic enzymes with different specificities and catalytic properties. Their physiological roles involve nutrition, parasitism, chitin recycling, morphogenesis, and/or defense. Microorganisms, as the main environmental chitin degraders, constitute a very important natural source of chitinolytic enzymes. Nowadays, the most used method for pest and plant diseases control is the utilization of chemical agents, causative of significant environmental pollution. Social concern has generated the search for alternative control systems (i.e., biological control), which contribute to the generation of sustainable agricultural development. Interactions among the different organisms are the natural bases of biological control. Interest in chitinolytic enzymes in the field of biological control has arisen due to their possible involvement in antagonistic activity against pathogenic chitin-containing organisms. The absence of chitin in plants and vertebrate animals allows the consideration of safe and selective "target" molecules for control of chitin-containing pathogenic organisms. Fungi show appropriate characteristics as potential biological control agents of insects, fungi, and nematodes due to the production of fungal enzymes with antagonistic action. The antagonistic interactions between fungi and plant nematode parasites are among the most studied experimental models because of the high economic relevance. Fungi which target nematodes are known as nematophagous fungi. The nematode egg is the only structural element where the presence of chitin has been demonstrated. In spite of being one of the most resistant biological structures, eggs are susceptible to being attacked by egg-parasitic fungi. A combination of physical and chemical phenomena result in their complete destruction. The contribution of fungal chitinases to the in vitro rupture of the eggshell confirms their role as a pathogenic factor. Chitinases have been produced by traditional fermentation methods, which have been improved by optimizing the culture conditions for industrial processes. Although wild-type microorganisms constitute an alternative source of chitinolytic enzymes, the advances in molecular biology are allowing the genetic transformation of fungi to obtain strains with high capability as biocontrol agents. Simultaneously, a better understanding of rhizosphere interactions, additional to the discovery of new molecular biology tools, will allow the choosing of better alternatives for the biological control of nematodes in order to achieve an integrated management of the soil ecosystem.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the compatibility between aged siloranes and methacrylate-based composites by simulating a common repair-technique.
   Methods: Twenty substrates were constructed using silorane (Filtek Silorane, 3M ESPE) and methacrylate composites (Filtek Supreme XT, 3M ESPE). Substrates were aged in 0.9% NaCl solution at 37 degrees C for 72 hours. Silorane build-ups were constructed on silorane substrates without any intermediate layer (IL). Methacrylate build-ups were constructed on silorane substrates without any IL, with a methacrylate IL (Heliobond, Ivoclar Vivadent), or with a phosphate-methacrylate IL (Silorane System Adhesive Bond, 3M ESPE). Methacrylate build-ups were also constructed on methacrylate substrates without any IL. The micro-shear bond strength test was carried out after thermocycling. Bond strength data were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey post hoc tests. Failure modes were assessed by means of scanning electron microscopy observations.
   Results: The silorane-methacrylate group without any IL showed the lowest bond strength values (0.4 +/- 0.1 MPa). The use of a methacrylate-based IL (1.6 +/- 1.7 MPa) led to a slight increase in bond strength, whereas the use of phosphate-methacrylate IL (9.1 +/- 5.4 MPa) significantly increased bond strength. There was no statistically significant difference in bond strength between silorane-silorane (7.9 +/- 3.6 MPa) and methacrylate-methacrylate (9.5 +/- 4.1 MPa) groups without any IL.

AB Aromatic isocyanides including isocyanonaphthalene derivatives have been proven to be very effective fluorescent sensors for the quantification of Hg(II) ions in water. Thus, the reaction of 1,5-isocyanoaminonaphthalene (1,5-ICAN), which is one of the most important members of this family, with water and HgCl(2)as the oxidation agents, was studied by fluorescence spectroscopy and mass spectrometry in order to get deeper insight into the kinetics and mechanistic details of this complex reaction. The reactions of 1,5-ICAN with water and HgCl(2)were performed in various water/co-solvent mixtures of different compositions. The co-solvents used in this study were both aprotic solvents including tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile and N,N-dimethylformamide and protic solvents, such as ethanol and 2-propanol. It was found that in aprotic solvents the conversion of the isocyano group to amino moiety takes place, while in protic solvents the corresponding carbamate (urethane) group is formed in addition to the amino moiety. The variation of the resulting fluorescence intensities versus time curves were described using an irreversible, consecutive reaction model, in which the formation of isocyanate and carbamic acid intermediates, as well as diamino and carbamate (in the case of protic solvents) products were assumed. The formation of these intermediates and products was unambiguously confirmed by mass spectrometric measurements. Furthermore, by fitting the model to the experimental fluorescence versus time curves, the corresponding rate coefficients were determined. It was observed that the overall rate of transformation of the isocyano group to amino moiety increased with the water concentration and the polarity of the co-solvent. It was also supported that formation of diamino and carbamate derivatives in protic solvents takes place simultaneously and that the ratio of the amino to the carbamate function increased with the increasing water concentration. In addition, with an extension, the model presented herein proved to be capable of describing the kinetics of the transformation of 1,5-diisocyanonaphthalene (1,5-DIN) into 1,5-diaminonaphthalene (1,5-DAN) in the mixtures of water/aprotic solvents.

AB Purpose: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) shows high sensitivity in detecting breast cancer. However, its performance could be affected by patient motion during the imaging. To overcome this problem, it is necessary to correct patient motion by deformable registration, before using the DCE-MRI to detect breast cancer. However, deformable registration of DCE-MR images is challenging due to the dramatic contrast change over time (especially between the precontrast and postcontrast images). Most existing methods typically register each postcontrast image onto the precontrast image independently, without considering the dynamic contrast change after agent uptake. This could lead to the inconsistency among the aligned postcontrast images in the precontrast image space, which will eventually result in worse performance in cancer detection. In this paper, the authors present a novel hierarchical registration framework to address this problem.
   Methods: First, the authors propose a hierarchical registration framework to deploy the groupwise registration for simultaneous registration of all postcontrast images onto their group-mean image and further aligning the group-mean image of postcontrast images onto the precontrast image space for final alignment of all precontrast and postcontrast images. In this way, the postcontrast images (with similar intensity patterns) can be jointly aligned onto the precontrast image for increasing their overall consistency after registration. Second, in order to improve the registration between the precontrast image and the group-mean image of the postcontrast images, the authors propose using the contrast-invariant attribute vectors to guide the robust feature matching during the registration.
   Results: Our proposed hierarchical registration framework has been comprehensively evaluated and compared with affine registration and widely used deformable registration methods in both pairwise and groupwise registration formulation. The experimental results on both real and simulated images show that our method can obtain not only more accurate but also more consistent registration results than any of all other registration algorithms.
   Conclusions: The authors have proposed a novel groupwise registration method to achieve accurate and consistent alignment for breast DCE-MR images. In the future, the authors will further evaluate our proposed method with more clinical datasets. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. [DOI: 10.1118/1.3665705]

AB Background: Acute diarrhea continues to be an important cause of hospitalization in young children, and deaths still occur as a result. We reviewed a large cohort of hospitalized children affected by gastroenteritis. The hypothesis of our study was that clinical characteristics and a limited set of laboratory data can differentiate between the different causative pathogens of diarrhea.
   Methods: A chart review was performed of 650 patients with pathogen-proven diarrhea treated between April 2005 and May 2008 in the children's hospital of the University of Wurzburg. Clinical presentation at the time of admission and during hospital stay, laboratory findings, stool pathogen results, and epidemiological data were collected and compared. A severity score was generated.
   Results: Rotavirus was the most common gastroenteritis pathogen identified, followed by norovirus, adenovirus and Salmonella spp. Nosocomial infections were caused most commonly by norovirus. Rotavirus was the most common agent when there was simultaneous detection of two or more viruses. Rotavirus infections were significantly more severe, with a higher frequency of diarrhea and elevated liver enzymes. Infections due to Salmonella spp showed significantly higher values for C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and body temperature. A seasonal distribution was noted, with the peak for rotaviruses/noroviruses in winter/spring, the peak for adenoviruses in November/December, and the peak for Salmonella spp in the summer months. Younger children and toddlers had significantly higher gastroenteritis and airway inflammation scores. Of note, respiratory symptoms and parameters of systemic inflammation differed between the different pathogens.
   Conclusions: Gastroenteritis is a common reason for hospital admission in previously healthy children during the first years of life. Rotaviruses were found to be the most common pathogens in our cohort. On the basis of clinical and laboratory parameters it appears possible to distinguish between the different causative agents. This may have implications for hospital hygiene management and for the identification of predictive markers of a severe course. (C) 2011 International Society for Infectious Diseases.

The computer simulation results show that the preferential behavior can lead to power laws on distributions over both holding time and amount of money held by agents. However, some constraints are needed in generation mechanism to ensure the robustness of power-law distributions.

AB Robots, as well as software agents, can be of use in biology as implementations of a theory rather than as simulations of specific real world target systems. Such implementations generate hypotheses rather than representing them. Their behavior is not predicted, but rather observed, and is not expected to duplicate that of a target system. Scientific knowledge is gained through the testing of generated hypotheses.

AB The validation process for biomarkers to be used for monitoring the efficacy of preventive interventions in humans includes assessments of whether levels of the biomarker can be modulated in experimental models. From this perspective, the influence of two intervention protocols with the chemopreventive agent oltipraz on rates of formation and disappearance of aflatoxin-albumin adducts has been evaluated in rats chronically exposed to aflatoxin B-1. Male F344 rats were treated daily with 20 mu g aflatoxin B-1, p.o. for 35 days. The first strategy employed a standard, long-term intervention in which basal AIN-76A diet was supplemented with 0.05% oltipraz beginning one week before AFB(1) treatment and continuing throughout the period of carcinogen exposure. In this setting, treatment with oltipraz reduced the rate of formation of aflatoxin-albumin adducts such that steady-state levels were lowered by >50% from control values of 400 pmol aflatoxin adducts/mg albumin. The time-course for reaching respective steady-state levels was unchanged, with or without oltipraz intervention. The second intervention strategy utilized a delayed, transient protocol in which oltipraz was fed for 2 weeks beginning 1 week after AFB(1) dosing began and ending 2 weeks before AFB(1) dosing was completed. This second strategy, which models clinical interventions in chronically exposed individuals, produced a steady decline in aflatoxin-albumin adduct levels that approached a 50% reduction by the end of the AFB(1) exposure period. Development of smooth curve functions allowed for the estimation of the ratio of effects between the non-intervention and intervention groups as well as the simultaneous 90% confidence intervals for the aflatoxin-albumin adduct levels. These analyses indicated that long-term intervention with oltipraz produced a statistically significant reduction in levels of the aflatoxin-albumin biomarker at all times throughout aflatoxin exposure. By contrast, a statistically significant decrease in biomarker levels was not seen in the delayed, transient intervention protocol until the ninth day of the intervention. However, once achieved, significant differences from the control group were maintained for the remainder of the aflatoxin exposure period. These changes in aflatoxin biomarker levels are consistent with the cancer chemopreventive outcomes of these intervention protocols in rats. Collectively, these results support the utility of measuring this biomarker as a means for assessing the efficacy of chemopreventive interventions in individuals at high risk for aflatoxin exposure and development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB Purpose With the explosive growth of the Internet, online travel agents (OTAs) have gained an increasing market share in the online booking market. However, OTAs are facing fierce competition from hotels' direct booking channels, as well as competition among themselves. Therefore, there is a need for an understanding of the evolution of the OTA market from a dynamic perspective. The purpose of this study is to investigate the long-term effect of OTAs on the hospitality industry and to find whether an equilibrium of this effect exists in the context of e-commerce. Design/methodology/approach To gain a better understanding of the OTA market process, a mathematical framework is constructed on the basis of four assumptions. NetLogo 5.1.0 is used to perform a series of numerical simulations. Findings The results indicate the following: (1) the development of the OTA market helps to improve net social welfare, but hotels (especially economy hotels) have suffered as a result; (2) clever exploitation of both online and offline channels that are based on hotels' historical data may improve hotels' performance; (3) a scale-priority strategy can be more helpful than a profit-priority strategy for enabling OTAs to maintain their long-term competitiveness; (4) the timing of participation in online-channel competition is a crucial factor in determining whether OTAs can achieve business success. Social implications In this study, it is shown how consumer habits have changed since the development of OTAs. The online channels provided by OTAs create a convenient, low-cost user experience, and they consequently improve the net welfare of customers. OTAs should be encouraged appropriately, although some economy hotels may suffer from the rise of OTAs. Originality/value In this empirical study, a mathematical framework is developed to describe the process of evolution in the OTA market, and it uses simulations as a means to validate prior research findings. Unlike previous studies, a dynamic perspective is used in this investigation to interpret the emergence of OTAs and to analyze their enormous impact on the hospitality industry. Thus, the findings of this study capture the competitive characteristics of online and offline channels in a network context and indicate potential strategies for the development of OTAs and which hotels may use OTAs to achieve better performance. In addition, the study findings could be easily extended to explain many of the classical economic phenomena regarding firms with intangible products.

AB Weak and reversible inhibitors of cholinesterase, when co-administered in large doses, can act in a protective manner against more potent inhibitors such as organophosphates. The clinically widely used histamine type 2 (H-2) receptor blocker ranitidine is among H-2 blockers the most potent inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase but roughly three to four orders of magnitude less potent than paraoxon (an irreversible organophosphate esterase inhibitor) or pyridostigmine (a reversible carbamate esterase inhibitor). We have previously shown that in vitro ranitidine confers some protection against inhibition of cholinesterases by paraoxon and that in vivo it both increases the number of rats surviving an acute paraoxon exposure and also protects to some degree the cholinesterases from organophosphate inhibition. The purpose of the study was to compare in a prospective non-blinded study, in a rat model of acute high-dose paraoxon exposure, ranitidine with pyridostigmine either administered simultaneously or 30 min. before exposure. There were 36 rats in each of the 5 groups. All substances were applied intraperitoneally. Additional analysis included data from a similar experiment carried out in 2005, in which 54 rats were exposed to paraoxon only (G(1)) and 54 to paraoxon+ranitidine simultaneously (G(2)). All groups (except controls; G(6) & G(7)) received 1 mu Mol paraoxon (approximate to LD75); groups 2-5 received in addition to paraoxon: G(2): 50 mu Mol ranitidine within 1 min. of paraoxon, G(3): 1 mu Mol pyridostigmine within 1 min. of paraoxon, G(4): 50 mu Mol ranitidine 30 min. before paraoxon, G(5): 1 mu Mol pyridostigmine 30 min. before paraoxon. Groups 6 & 7 received only ranitidine and pyridostigmine respectively, group G(1) received only paraoxon. Mortality was recorded at 30 min., 1, 2, 3, 4, 24 and 48 hr. Mortality data were compared using Kaplan-Meier plots and logrank tests. No Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied and an alpha <= 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS 12.0 statistical software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Simultaneous administration of ranitidine or pyridostigmine with paraoxon does not significantly affect mortality. Pretreatment (30 min. before) with both ranitidine or pyridostigmine statistically and significantly reduced mortality. When administered before paraoxon, pyridostigmine is statistically significantly superior to ranitidine. Both ranitidine and pyridostigmine are protective against acute paraoxon toxicity provided they are administered before paraoxon. Pyridostigmine results are statistically significantly superior to ranitidine (<= 0.05).

AB Balancing the exploration and exploitation in any nature-inspired optimization algorithm is an essential task, while solving the real-world global optimization problems. Therefore, the search agents of an algorithm always try to explore the unvisited domains of a search space in a balanced manner. The sine cosine algorithm (SCA) is a recent addition to the field of metaheuristics that finds the solution of an optimization problem using the behavior of sine and cosine functions. However, in some cases, the SCA skips the true solutions and trapped at sub-optimal solutions. These problems lead to the premature convergence, which is harmful in determining the global optima. Therefore, in order to alleviate the above-mentioned issues, the present study aims to establish a comparatively better synergy between exploration and exploitation in the SCA. In this direction, firstly, the exploration ability of the SCA is improved by integrating the social and cognitive component, and secondly, the balance between exploration and exploitation is maintained through the grey wolf optimizer (GWO). The proposed algorithm is named as SC-GWO. For the performance evaluation, a well-known set of benchmark problems and engineering test problems are taken. The dimension of benchmark test problems is varied from 30 to 100 to observe the robustness of the SC-GWO on scalability of problems. In the paper, the SC-GWO is also used to determine the optimal setting for overcurrent relays. The analysis of obtained numerical results and its comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms demonstrate the superior ability of the proposed SC-GWO.

AB This paper introduces a bivariate version of the generalized accelerated failure time model. It allows for simultaneity in the econometric sense that the two realized outcomes depend structurally on each other. Another feature of the proposed model is that it will generate equal durations with positive probability. Our approach takes a stylized economic model that leads to a univariate generalized accelerated failure time model as a starting point. In this model, agents decide when to transition from an initial state to a new one, and the covariates influence the difference in the utility flow in the two states. We introduce simultaneity by allowing the utility flow to depend on the status of the other person. The econometric model is then completed by assuming that the observed outcome is the Nash bargaining solution in that simple economic model. The advantage of this approach is that it includes independent realizations from the generalized accelerated failure time model as a special case, and deviations from this special case can be given an economic interpretation. We established identification under assumptions that are similar to those in the literature on nonparametric estimation of duration models. We illustrate the model by studying the joint retirement decisions in married couples using the Health and Retirement Study. In that example, it seems reasonable to allow for the possibility that each partner's optimal retirement time depends on the retirement time of the spouse. Moreover, the data suggest that the wife and the husband retire at the same time for a nonnegligible fraction of couples. The main empirical finding is that the simultaneity is economically important. In our preferred specification, the indirect utility associated with being retired increases by approximately 5% when one's spouse retires.

AB Realistic population models have interactions between individuals. Such interactions cause populations to behave as systems with nonlinear dynamics. Much population data analysis is done using linear models assuming no interactions between individuals. Such analyses miss strong influences on population behavior and can lead to serious errors-especially for infectious diseases. To promote more effective population system analyses, we present a flexible and intuitive modeling framework for infection transmission systems. This framework will help population scientists gain insight into population dynamics, develop theory about population processes, better analyze and interpret population data, design more powerful and informative studies, and better inform policy decisions. Our framework uses a hierarchy of infection transmission system models. Four levels are presented here: deterministic compartmental models using ordinary differential equations (DE); stochastic compartmental (SC) models that relax assumptions about population size and include stochastic effects; individual event history models (IEH) that relax the SC compartmental structure assumptions by allowing each individual to be unique. IEH models also track each individual's history, and thus, allow the simulation of field studies. Finally, dynamic network (DNW) models relax the assumption of the previous models that contacts between individuals are instantaneous events that do not affect subsequent contacts. Eventually it should be possible to transit between these model forms at the click of a mouse. An example is presented dealing with Cryptosporidium. It illustrates how transiting model forms helps assess water contamination effects, evaluate control options, and design studies of infection transmission systems using nucleotide sequences of infectious agents.

AB Selye defined stress as the nonspecific response of the body to any demand and thus an inherent element of all diseases. He reported that rats show adrenal hypertrophy, thymicolymphatic atrophy, and gastrointestinal ulceration, referred to as the stress triad, upon repeated exposure to nocuous agents. However, Selye's stress triad as well as its extended version including reduced body weight gain, increased plasma glucocorticoid (GC) concentrations, and GC resistance of target cells do not represent reliable discriminatory biomarkers for chronic stress. To address this, we collected multivariate biological data from male mice exposed either to the preclinically validated chronic subordinate colony housing (CSC) paradigm or to single-housed control (SHC) condition. We then used principal component analysis (PCA), top scoring pairs (tsp) and support vector machines (SVM) analyses to identify markers that discriminate between chronically stressed and non-stressed mice. PCA segregated stressed and non-stressed mice, with high loading for some of Selye's stress triad parameters. The tsp analysis, a simple and highly interpretable statistical approach, identified left adrenal weight and relative thymus weight as the pair with the highest discrimination score and prediction accuracy validated by a blinded dataset (92% p-value < 0.0001; SVM model = 83% accuracy and p-value < 0.0001). This finding clearly shows that simultaneous consideration of these two parameters can be used as a reliable biomarker of chronic stress status. Furthermore, our analysis highlights that the tsp approach is a very powerful method whose application extends beyond what has previously been reported.

AB New Big Data sources such as mobile phone call data records, smart card data and geo-coded social media records allow to observe and understand mobility behaviour on an unprecedented level of detail. Despite the availability of such new Big Data sources, transport demand models used in planning practice still, almost exclusively, are based on conventional data such as travel diary surveys and population census. This literature review brings together recent advances in harnessing Big Data sources to understand travel behaviour and inform travel demand models that allow transport planners to compute what-if scenarios. From trip identification to activity inference, we review and analyse the existing data-mining methods that enable these opportunistically collected mobility traces inform transport demand models. We identify that future research should tap on the potential of probabilistic models and machine learning techniques as commonly used in data science. Those data-mining approaches are designed to handle the uncertainty of sparse and noisy data as it is the case for mobility traces derived from mobile phone data. In addition, they are suitable to integrate different related data sets in a data fusion scheme so as to enrich Big Data with information from travel diaries. In any case, we also acknowledge that sophisticated modelling knowledge has developed in the domain of transport planning and therefore we strongly advise that still, domain expert knowledge should build the fundament when applying data-driven approaches in transport planning. These new challenges call for a multidisciplinary collaboration between transport modellers and data scientists.

AB Purpose: We compared the effectiveness of targeted prophylaxis to the effectiveness of empirical prophylaxis for preventing sepsis after transrectal prostate biopsy using a retrospective multicenter quality improvement study.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 13 Kaiser Permanente urology departments participated in a 1-year retrospective analysis of a quality improvement study. In the targeted prophylaxis group rectal cultures were performed before transrectal prostate biopsy and antibiotic sensitivities of Escherichia coli were used to guide the selection of a single agent antibiotic for prophylaxis. Cultures were plated on 10 mg/ml ciprofloxacin infused MacConkey agar at a central laboratory. Urologists using empirical prophylaxis continued the usual regimen of ciprofloxacin monotherapy prophylaxis but sometimes added an additional prophylactic antibiotic. The primary outcome of post-biopsy sepsis was compiled by a search of the electronic medical record for the appropriate ICD-9 codes.
   Results: A total of 5,355 prostate biopsy procedures were performed between May 1, 2013 and April 30, 2014. Targeted prophylaxis was used in 1,802 procedures (34%) and empirical prophylaxis was used in 3,553 (66%). The overall incidence of post-biopsy sepsis was 0.52% (28 of 5,355 cases). The incidence of sepsis was 0.44% (8 of 1,802 cases) in the targeted prophylaxis group and 0.56% (20 of 3,553) in the empirical prophylaxis group (p = 0.568). The prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistant E. coli on rectal culture was 25% (444 of 1,802 cases). Seven of the 8 patients (88%) on targeted prophylaxis in whom sepsis developed used a prophylactic antibiotic to which the bacteria causing post-biopsy sepsis were sensitive.
   Conclusions: The targeted prophylaxis protocol enabled physicians to avoid using more than 1 broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic while simultaneously achieving an overall rate of sepsis similar to the rate seen with empirical prophylaxis.

AB A small amount (1 wt%) of organoclay-modified thermotropic liquid crystalline polymer (TLCP) acting as a viscosity reduction agent in high molecular mass polyethylene (HMMPE) was characterized and compared with purified TLCP (I wt%) in HMMPE at 190 degrees C and 230 degrees C, respectively, where the TLCP displayed nematic and nematic-isotropic biphase structures. In the TLCP/PE blend at 190 degrees C and 230 degrees C, dramatic reductions in viscosity were observed with significant improvement in extrudate surface smoothness and an enlarged processing window. For the organoclay-modified TLCP in PE, the viscosity reduction ability of TLCP was further enhanced with viscosity dropped by up to >98.5% and >97.4% at 190 degrees C and 230 degrees C and processing window enlarged to >700 s(-1) and >900 s(-1) respectively in comparison to that of PE. Moreover, yielding stress, initial transition shear rate and transition region decreased to lower magnitudes than those of the TLCP/PE blend. A phenomenological model was applied to elucidate the mechanism of organoclay, TLCP and PE conformation before and after yielding in the confined capillary environment. A binary flow pattern model was applied to successfully predict the rheological behavior of the blends at 190 degrees C. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Pharmacology has provided efficient tools to improve insulin effect/secretion but the decrease in beta-cell mass remains elusive. INGAP-PP could provide a therapeutic alternative to meet that challenge.
   Aim: To further understand the mechanism that links INGAP-PP effects upon beta-cell mass and function with islet angiogenesis.
   Methodology: Normal male Wistar rats were divided into 2 groups and injected with a single dose of 100 mg/Kg suramin or saline. Both groups were divided into 2 subgroups that received daily doses of 2 mg/kg INGAP-PP or saline for ten days. Plasma glucose, triacylglycerol, TBARS, and insulin levels were measured. Pancreas immunomorphometric analyses were also performed. Pancreatic islets were isolated to measure glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). Specific islet mRNA levels were studied by qRT-PCR. Statistical analysis was done using ANOVA.
   Results: No differences were recorded in body weight, food intake, or any other plasma parameter measured in all groups. Islets from INGAP-PP-treated rats significantly increased GSIS, beta-cell mass, and mRNA levels of Bcl-2, Ngn-3, VEGF-A, VEGF-R2, CD31, Ang1 and Ang2, Laminin beta-1, and Integrin beta-1, and decreased mRNA levels of Caspase-8, Bad, and Bax. Islets from suramin-treated rats showed significant opposite effects, but INGAPP-PP administration rescued most of the suramin effects in animals treated with both compounds.
   Conclusion: Our results reinforce the concept that INGAP-PP enhances insulin secretion and beta-cell mass, acting through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and simultaneously activating angiogenesis through HIF-1 alpha-mediated VEGF-A secretion. Therefore, INGAP-PP might be a suitable antidiabetic agent able to overcome two major alterations present in T2D.

To reduce polymerization-induced shrinkage stress while maintaining mechanical properties, reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT)-capable functional groups were incorporated into a photopolymerizable dimethacrylate-based dental composite. We hypothesize that the incorporation of trithiocarbonate-based RAFT functional groups into conventional dimethacrylate dental resins will reduce polymerization stress.
   Methods. A trithiocarbonate dimethacrylate (TTCDMA) monomer, capable of undergoing radical-mediated RAFT, is mixed with 70 wt% BisGMA (bisphenylglycidyl dimethacrylate) and compared to a conventional dental resin comprised of TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and 70 wt% BisGMA. The shrinkage stress and methacrylate conversion were simultaneously measured during polymerization. The fracture toughness and elastic modulus were measured to evaluate the effect of the TTCDMA monomer on the mechanical properties. All the materials used herein were evaluated as a composite, including 75 wt% silica fillers. ANOVA (CI 95%) was conducted to assess the differences between the means.
   Results. The TTCDMA composite exhibited a 65% stress reduction compared with TEGDMA-BisGMA though the reaction rate was slower than the conventional dental composite, owing to the additional RAFT reaction. The fracture toughness and elastic modulus of the TTCDMA-based composite were not significantly different than in the TEGDMA-based composite, while the T-g was decreased by 30 degrees C to 155 +/- 2 degrees C.
   Significance. Despite only replacing the reactive-diluent, significant and dramatic stress reduction was observed while maintaining the elastic modulus and fracture toughness. This new RAFT-capable monomer shows great promise to replace the reactive diluent in BisGMA-based dental materials. Formulation optimization and further exploration of other RAFT-capable functional groups will provide further stress reduction in dental materials. (C) 2012 Academy of Dental Materials.

AB Population-level measurements of phenotypic behaviour in biological systems may not necessarily reflect individual cell behaviour. To assess qualitative changes in the behaviour of a single cell, when alone and when part of a community, we developed an agent-based model describing the metabolic states of a population of quorum-coupled cells. The modelling is motivated by published experimental work of a synthetic genetic regulatory network (GRN) used in Escherichia coli cells that exhibit oscillatory behaviour across the population. To decipher the mechanisms underlying oscillations in the system, we investigate the behaviour of the model via numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis. In particular, we study the effect of an increase in population size as well as the spatio-temporal behaviour of the model. Our results demonstrate that oscillations are possible only in the presence of a high concentration of the coupling chemical and are due to a time scale separation in key regulatory components of the system. The model suggests that the population establishes oscillatory behaviour as the system's preferred stable state. This is achieved via an effective increase in coupling across the population. We conclude that population effects in GRN design need to be taken into consideration and be part of the design process. This is important in planning intervention strategies or designing specific cell behaviours.

AB Organic food has important environmental and health benefits, decreasing the toxicity of agricultural production, improving soil quality, and overall resilience of farming. Increasing consumers' demand for organic food reinforces the rate of organic farming adoption and the level of farmers' risk acceptance. Despite the recorded 20% growth in organically managed farmland, its global land area is still far less than expected, only 1.4%. Increasing demand for organic food is an important pathway towards sustainable food systems. We explore this consumer-centric approach by developing a theoretically- and empirically-grounded agent-based model. Three behavioral theories - theory of planned behavior, alphabet theory, and goal-framing - describe individual food purchasing decisions in response to policies. We take wine sector as an example to calibrate and validate the model for the case study of Sydney, Australia. The discrepancy between consumer intention and purchasing behavior for organic wine can be explained by a locked-in vicious cycle. We assess the effectiveness of different policies such as wine taxation, and informational-education campaigns to influence consumer choices. The model shows that these interventions are non-additive: raising consumer awareness and increasing tax on less environmentally friendly wines simultaneously is more successful in promoting organic wine than the sum of the two policies introduced separately. The phenomenon of undercover altruism amplifies the preference for organic wine, and the upping point occurs at around 35% diffusion rate in the population. This research suggests policy implications to help decision-makers in the food sector make informed decisions about organic markets.

TI FRACTURE RESISTANCE OF METAL CERAMIC RESTORATIONS WITH TWO DIFFERENT

SO JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID CROWN SYSTEMS; DIE SPACERS; STRENGTH; LOAD
AB Statement of problem. Although the esthetic outcome of a collarless metal ceramic restoration is superior to that of a restoration with a metal margin, its mechanical strength has not been evaluated.
   Purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the fracture resistance of metal ceramic restorations with metal margins to that of metal ceramic restorations with circumferential porcelain margins, after exposure to masticatory simulation.
   Material and methods. Twenty-four metal ceramic restorations were fabricated and paired with 24 cobalt-chrome tooth analogs. Twelve of the specimens had metal margins, while the remainder had circumferential porcelain margins. The restorations were cemented on the metal tooth analogs with a resin-modified glass ionomer luting agent (FujiCEM). All specimens were subjected to cyclic loading by a texture analyzer. A total of 600,000 loading cycles in an aqueous environment was performed, with a minimum load of 0 N and a maximum load of 200 N. Controlled loads were then applied to the teeth until fracture, using a stainless steel rod with a 2-mm-wide, rounded end, mounted in a universal testing machine. The specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope to determine failure mode. Descriptive statistics and the independent t test (alpha=.05) were used to determine the effect of failure loads among the tested groups.
   Results. The independent t test revealed statistically significant differences among the 2 tested groups (P<.001), The 2 groups presented different failure modes. Metal ceramic restorations with metal margins presented cohesive failures starting from the point of load application. Metal ceramic restorations with circumferential porcelain margins demonstrated a combination of adhesive and cohesive failures, starting from the point of load application and extending to the highest point of the proximal margins.
   Conclusions. Metal ceramic restorations with metal margins required significantly greater loads (P<.001) to fracture than metal ceramic restorations with circumferential porcelain margins. (J Prosthet Dent 2009;102:172-178)

AB Objective. Investigate antimicrobial properties and surface texture of model composites with different concentration and alkyl chain length of quaternary ammonium monomers (QAS).
   Methods. Monomers derived from QAS salts with alkyl chain lengths of 12 carbons ((dimethylaminododecyl methacrylate) DMADDM) and 16 carbons (dimethylaminohexadecyl methacrylate-DMAHDM) were obtained from the reactions of their respective organo-halides with the tertiary amine 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA). DMADDM and DMAHDM were incorporated into model composite in concentrations of 5 or 10%, resulting the following groups: G12.5 (DMADDM 5%), G12.10 (DMADDM 10%), G16.5 (DMAHDM 5%), G16.10 (DMAHDM 10%) and GC (control). Biofilm viability, lactic acid production and surface roughness were analysed 24 h after samples preparation (initial), repeated after toothbrush abrasion and after polishing simulation. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Tukey's test (p <= 0.05).
   Results. The longer the molecular chain size of QAS and the higher its concentration (G16.10), the lower was the viability and the production of lactic acid by the biofilm. No differences were detected in initial roughness' measurements among groups. However, after abrasion, there was an increase of biofilm viability and lactic acid production. Composites containing QAS presented rougher surfaces compared to the CG. After polishing, biofilm viability and surface roughness were statistically similar for all groups. Nevertheless, DMAHDM at 10% showed reduction in lactic acid production.
   Signcance. Chain length and concentration of QAS influenced biofilm development and production of lactic acid. Longer chains and higher concentrations of QAS promoted better antimicrobial properties. Changes in surface texture caused by abrasion, decreased antibiofilm properties.

AB Background. Rapid resuscitation with oxygen-carrying fluids is critically important in hemorrhagic shock (HS) combat casualties in remote areas where blood is not available. Hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier-201 (HBOC-201) has been shown to increase survival and reduce immune activation following HS in animal models. Recombinant factor VIIa (rfVIIa), a systemic hemostatic agent, is Food and Drug Administration approved for use in acute hemorrhage in hemophilic patients. The combination of HBOC-201 and rfVIIa may form the basis of a prospective multifunctional blood substitute and provide benefits in the rapid restoration of hemostasis, decreased inflammation and improved survival of HS combat casualties. In the present study, we evaluated innate immune responses in a swine model of uncontrolled HS following resuscitation with HBOC-201 +/- rfVIIa.
   Materials. Thirty-two pigs underwent uncontrolled hemorrhage/liver crush injury, followed by resuscitation with five doses of HBOC-201 or HBOC + rfVIIa (90 mu g/kg, or 180 mu g/kg, or 360 mu g/kg) and simulated 4 hours hospital arrival. Immune parameters were evaluated by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Results: Survival differences to 72 hours of animals resuscitated with HBOC, HBOC + rfVIIa (90), (180), and (360) were not statistically significant and resulted in survival of 25%, 63%, 63% and 50%, respectively. At the prehospital phase all groups exhibited minimal immunomodulation, characterized by stable CD4/CD8 ratio, marginal increase of apoptosis and insignificant fluctuations of adhesion markers; increase of plasma cytokines was comparable across all groups, except tumor necrosis factor-alpha, that was significantly elevated in the HBOC group.
   Conclusion: HBOC-201 + rfVIIa triggered minimum immune activation in an uncontrolled HS swine and there was a nonsignificant survival benefit.

AB The multifactorial neurological condition called Alzheimer?s disease (AD) primarily affects elderly individuals. Despite the calamitous consequences of AD, curative strategies for a regimen to apply remain inadequate as several factors contribute to AD etiology. Drug repurposing is an advance strategy prior to drug discovery as various effective drugs perform through alteration of multiple targets, and the present ?poly-pharmacology? can be a curative approach to complex disorders. AD?s multifactorial behavior actively encourages the hypothesis for a drug design approach focused on drug repurposing. In this study, we discovered that an antifungal drug, Caspofungin (CAS) is a potent A? aggregation inhibitor that displays significantly reduced toxicity associated with AD. Drug reprofiling and REMD simulations demonstrated that CAS interacts with the ?-sheet section, known as A? amyloid fibrils hotspot. CAS leads to destabilization of ?-sheet and, conclusively, in its devaluation. Later, in vitro experiments were acquired in which the fibrillar volume was reduced for CAS-treated A? peptide. For the first time ever, this study has determined an antifungal agent as the A? amyloid aggregation?s potent inhibitor. Several efficient sequence-reliant potent inhibitors can be developed in future against the amyloid aggregation for different amyloid peptide by the processing and conformational optimization of CAS.

AB Application of discrete element method (DEM) to blast furnace attracts special interest, because the accurate solid motion analysis in the blast furnace is feasible by DEM. In the previous studies in this area, although the descending velocity and physical parameters of particle in DEM were important factors for accurate solid motion analysis, a priori assumptions were frequently introduced to the calculations. In this study, the sensitivities of these parameters were cautiously examined oil the basis of cold model experiments. The favorable combination of contact and rolling frictions was introduced to represent the shape of particles. A scale-down three-dimensional cold model of blast furnace Was used for analyzing motion of polyethylene and coke particle to confirm the influence of these coefficients. Accordingly, the relationship between the descending behavior of particle and the rolling friction coefficient became clear by comparison of model experiments and DEM simulation. Basically, the rolling friction coefficient is dependent oil diameter of particle. In these experimental results, the reduced descending velocity in the packed bed had little influence oil the burden descending behavior. It was estimated that the calculated results by DEM in the reduced time scale could quantitatively show the burden behavior in the actual blast furnace. DEM calculation with the appropriate parameters is profitable for the macro flow and local particle behavior analyses in the blast furnace.

AB Directed cell migration often involves at least two types of cell motility that include multicellular streaming and chain migration. However, what is unclear is how cell contact dynamics and the distinct microenvironments through which cells travel influence the selection of one migratory mode or the other. The embryonic and highly invasive neural crest (NC) are an excellent model system to study this question since NC cells have been observed in vivo to display both of these types of cell motility. Here, we present data from tissue transplantation experiments in chick and in silico modeling that test our hypothesis that cell contact dynamics with each other and the microenvironment promote and sustain either multicellular stream or chain migration. We show that when premigratory cranial NC cells (at the pre-otic level) are transplanted into a more caudal region in the head (at the post-otic level), cells alter their characteristic stream behavior and migrate in chains. Similarly, post-otic NC cells migrate in streams after transplantation into the pre-otic hindbrain, suggesting that local microenvironmental signals dictate the mode of NC cell migration. Simulations of an agent-based model (ABM) that integrates the NC cell behavioral data predict that chain migration critically depends on the interplay of biased cell-cell contact and local microenvironment signals. Together, this integrated modeling and experimental approach suggests new experiments and offers a powerful tool to examine mechanisms that underlie complex cell migration patterns.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure-activity relationships ( QSARs) of 36 apoptosis inducers, substituted 4-aryl/heteroaryl-4H-chromenes with anticancer activity against human breast cancer cell lines T47D, have been studied by using methods of comparative molecular field analysis ( CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity analysis (CoMSIA). The established 3D-QSAR models in training set show not only significant statistical quality, but also predictive ability, with high correlation coefficient (R-2) values and cross-validation coefficient (q(2)) values: CoMFA (R-2, q(2): 0.944, 0.747), CoMSIA (R-2, q(2): 0.944, 0.704). Moreover, the predictive abilities of the CoMFA and CoMSIA models were further confirmed by a test set, giving the predictive correlation coefficients (R-2 pred values) of 0.845 and 0.851, respectively. Based on the CoMFA and CoMSIA contour map analyses, some key factors responsible for anticancer activity of this series of compounds have been found as follows: the steric interaction plays a decisive role in determining the anticancer activities of these compounds; bulky groups as substituent R-1 are not tolerated; in addition to a steric moderation, higher degree of electropositivity and hydrophobicity on the terminal alkyl of substituent R-2 might be favorable to the activity; the substituent R-3 should be hydrophobic; bulky and strong electron withdrawing groups for the substituent R-4 are not advantageous to the activity; simultaneously introducing large electronegative atoms as hydrogen-acceptors to the first atoms of the substituents R-5 and R-6 may increase the activity, but substituents R-5 and R-6 with a linking group -OCH2O- may decrease the activity. Such results can offer some useful theoretical references for understanding the action mechanism, designing more potent derivatives, and predicting their activities prior to synthesis.

AB Ephemeral aggregations of bacteria are ubiquitous in the environment, where they serve as hotbeds of metabolic activity, nutrient cycling, and horizontal gene transfer. In many cases, these regions of high bacterial concentration are thought to form when motile cells use chemotaxis to navigate to chemical hotspots. However, what governs the dynamics of bacterial aggregations is unclear. Here, we use an experimental platform to create realistic submillimeter-scale nutrient pulses with controlled nutrient concentrations. By combining experiments, mathematical theory, and agent-based simulations, we show that individual Vibrio ordalii bacteria begin chemotaxis toward hotspots of dissolved organic matter (DOM) when the magnitude of the chemical gradient rises sufficiently far above the sensory noise that is generated by stochastic encounters with chemoattractant molecules. Each DOM hotspot is surrounded by a dynamic ring of chemotaxing cells, which congregate in regions of high DOM concentration before dispersing as DOM diffuses and gradients become too noisy for cells to respond to. We demonstrate that V. ordalii operates close to the theoretical limits on chemotactic precision. Numerical simulations of chemotactic bacteria, in which molecule counting noise is explicitly taken into account, point at a tradeoff between nutrient acquisition and the cost of chemotactic precision. More generally, our results illustrate how limits on sensory precision can be used to understand the location, spatial extent, and lifespan of bacterial behavioral responses in ecologically relevant environments.

AB As a method for reducing CO2 in blast furnaces, low-reducing agent ratio and large amount of pulverized coal is being carried out to reduce the amount of coke used and reduce the carbon input to the blast furnace and its operation cost. However, these operating methods increase the deposit amount of coke powder and unburned char generated in the blast furnace and decrease process efficiency. A three-dimensional numerical model is built and observed by the coupling system of DEM-CFD, performed to understand the principal factors that affected fine and gas permeability. Simulation is carried out in, where fine particles are injected simultaneously from the bottom of cylindrical packed bed, mimicking the experimental approach. The fine to packed diameter ration is given by 0.133 <= Dp/dp <= 0.162. At a larger diameter ratio, fine particles tend to concentrate at the bottom of the packed bed. In the case of lower particle diameter ratio, updraft gas will easy to permeate along with fine particles because of the existing of large open flow channels relative to fine diameter. Furthermore, no significant change in fine fraction transported to the upper area due to the change of gas velocities. In this present study, the effect of continuous fine particles injection and its effect on gas flow can be observed, where the gas flow avoiding the heavily concentrated area.

AB Classical economic models assume that people are fully rational and selfish, while experiments often point to different conclusions. A canonical example is the Ultimatum Game: one player proposes a division of a sum of money between herself and a second player, who either accepts or rejects. Based on rational self-interest, responders should accept any nonzero offer and proposers should offer the smallest possible amount. Traditional, deterministic models of evolutionary game theory agree: in the one-shot anonymous Ultimatum Game, natural selection favors low offers and demands. Experiments instead show a preference for fairness: often responders reject low offers and proposers make higher offers than needed to avoid rejection. Here we show that using stochastic evolutionary game theory, where agents make mistakes when judging the pay-offs and strategies of others, natural selection favors fairness. Across a range of parameters, the average strategy matches the observed behavior: proposers offer between 30% and 50%, and responders demand between 25% and 40%. Rejecting low offers increases relative payoff in pairwise competition between two strategies and is favored when selection is sufficiently weak. Offering more than you demand increases payoff when many strategies are present simultaneously and is favored when mutation is sufficiently high. We also perform a behavioral experiment and find empirical support for these theoretical findings: uncertainty about the success of others is associated with higher demands and offers; and inconsistency in the behavior of others is associated with higher offers but not predictive of demands. In an uncertain world, fairness finishes first.

SO INFORMATION SCIENCES
LA English
DT Article
DE Genetic programming; Epigenesis; Learning; Histone code
AB We present the results of our work in simulating the recently discovered findings in molecular biology regarding the significant role which histones play in regulating the gene expression in eukaryotes. Extending the notion of inheritable genotype in evolutionary computation from the commonly considered model of DNA to chromatin (DNA and histones), we present epigenetic programming as an approach, incorporating an explicitly controlled gene expression through modification of histones in strongly-typed genetic programming (STGP). We propose a double cell representation of the simulated individuals, comprising somatic cell and germ cell, both represented by their respective chromatin structures. Following biologically plausible concepts, we regard the plastic phenotype of the somatic cell, achieved via controlled gene expression owing to modifications to histones (epigenetic learning, EL) as relevant for fitness evaluation, while the genotype of the germ cell corresponds to the phylogenesis of the individuals. The beneficial effect of EL on the performance characteristics of STGP is verified on evolution of social behavior of a team of predator agents in the predator-prey pursuit problem. Empirically obtained performance evaluation results indicate that EL contributes to about 2-fold improvement of computational effort of STGP. We trace the cause for that to the Cumulative effect of polyphenism and epigenetic stability, both contributed by EL. The former allows for phenotypic diversity of genotypically similar individuals, while the latter robustly preserves the individuals from the destructive effects of crossover by silencing certain genotypic combinations and explicitly activating them only when they are most likely to be expressed in corresponding beneficial phenotypic traits.

AB We recently reported that chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) induced left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) in rats, which was inhibited by the cardioprotective agent quercetin. Based on these findings and because majority of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) can develop LVD and heart failure, we sought to produce an animal model of MI and LVD in rats and use this model to test the hypothesis that quercetin is able to prevent the potential MI induction by CUS. Rats were exposed to CUS using a variety of stressors in the presence and absence of quercetin (50 mg/kg body weight/day) for 21 days. Blood pressure and electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded in all rat groups together with the examination of left ventricle (LV) tissue homogenates and sections to confirm the production of the animal model. We further extend on our recent findings on the role of apoptosis in the pathology of LVD and eventually MI. Blood pressure measurements and ECG recording confirmed the development of systemic hypertension and MI in the model group of rats exposed to CUS. In addition, histological staining confirmed that LV damages occurred in the same group. Furthermore, the proapoptotic gene Bax and the inflammatory biomarkers, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were augmented in LV homogenates by CUS. Simultaneous quercetin treatment lowered blood pressure and substantially prevented MI since it blocked the elevation of ST segment on the ECG and maintained a normal ECG reading. Quercetin suppressed the expression of Bax RNA messages, and significantly (p<0.05) blocked CUS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 upregulation. Thus, CUS induced MI in rats associated with augmentation of tissue injury biomarkers were prevented by quercetin, which further endorses our recent findings of a potential therapeutic role for quercetin in CUS induced cardiac dysfunction.

ID COATINGS
AB With the ambition for improved efficiency of energy and resources the light weight construction in engineering and vehicle construction and therefore also the usage of light but high strength aluminum alloys gains importance. Components made from new composite materials and combinations of materials offer the ability of considerable decrease in size and weight compared with conventional materials. But in the forming machining of such materials the mechanical and thermal demand on the tools is much higher. Especially the higher affinity towards adhesion and the abrasive impact of embedded reinforcement particles is critical. Simultaneously the usage of lubricants and release agents shall be reduced due to antipollution reasons. Therefore an improved wear resistance of the tool surfaces by coatings or modification of the surface layer is necessary. Generally it is not enough just to coat the existing tools but tool geometry, coating-substrate-matching and coating thickness has to be adjusted to the loading. For that purpose the method of finite elements (FEM) is a good choice. In the subproject B1 of the SFB 692 numerical models for analyzing and optimizing of coated tools for high strength aluminum alloys are to be developed. A main part of this work is the determination of model parameters. Even here the FEM in combination with experimental analysis is used. The article describes the approach via selected examples of DLC coatings. Preliminary studies pointed out the suitability of DLC coatings despite the high carbon affinity of the aluminum.

DE stroke; magnetic resonance imaging; diffusion imaging; region-growing

AB Rationale and Objectives. We introduce a new approach to the prediction of final infarct growth in human acute ischemic stroke based on image analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps obtained from magnetic resonance imaging. Evidence from multiple previous studies indicate that ADC maps are likely to reveal brain regions belonging to the ischemic penumbra, that is, areas that may be at risk of infarction in the few hours following stroke onset.
   Materials and Methods. In a context where "time is brain," and contrarily to the altemative-and still-debated-perfusion-diffusion weighted image (PWI/DWI) mismatch approach, the DWI magnetic resonance sequences are standardized, fast to acquire, and do not necessitate injection of a contrast agent. The image analysis approach presented here consists of the segmentation of the ischemic penumbra using a fast three-dimensional region-growing technique that mimics the growth of the infarct lesion during acute stroke.
   Results. The method was evaluated with both numerical simulations and on two groups of 20 ischemic stroke patients (40 patients total). The first group of patient data was used to adjust the parameters of the model ruling the region-growing procedure. The second group of patient data was dedicated to evaluation purposes only, with no subsequent adjustment of the free parameters of the image-analysis procedure. Results indicate that the predicted final infarct volumes are significantly correlated with the true final lesion volumes as revealed by follow-up measurements from DWI sequences.
   Conclusion. The DWI-ADC mismatch method is an encouraging fast alternative to the PWI-DWI mismatch approach to evaluate the likeliness of infarct growth during the acute stage of ischemic stroke.

AB The aim of this study was to verify the influence of NaOCl irrigation and water-storage time-WST on the degradation and microstructure of the resin-dentin interface bonded with different adhesive systems using Microtensile Bond Strength test-MTBS and scanning electron microscopy-SEM observations. In the present research, we used ninety sound third molars, divides into eighteen groups. The groups were set by adhesive systems (Adper Single Bond 2:SB, Clearfil Protect Bond:CP, Adper Prompt L-Pop:APL), with or without NaOCl irrigation,for simulate endodontic irrigation, and water-storage time (24 h, 45 d, 90 d). The adhesive procedure was performed at the middle dentin previously exposed. The data were analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey tests (p < 0.05). The failure modes, presence or absence of resin tags, and the resin/dentin interface were evaluated by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and data were analyzed with the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel Statistics (p < 0.05). The results show that there were no significant interactions between water-storage time, adhesive systems and irrigation. There were significant interactions between irrigation and the storage time, and irrigation and the adhesive system, but not between the adhesive system and the storage time. A significant decrease in MTBS values was noted in the non-NaOCl irrigation groups during WST evaluations. Compared with CP and SB, APL showed a decrease in MTBS values when NaOCl was used. After 90 days of storage, resin tags partially disappeared. Obtained results suggest that NaOCl irrigation did not affect the bond strength for up to 90 days, and when it was used with APL, there was a negative effect on bond strength, which was not found with CP and SB.

DT Article
DE surprise; reward prediction error; reinforcement learning; risk;
   decision making; outcome value
AB Surprise occurs because of differences between a decision outcome and its predicted outcome (prediction error), regardless of whether the error is positive or negative. It has recently been postulated that surprise affects the reward value of the action outcome; studies have indicated that increasing surprise as an absolute value of prediction error decreases the value of the outcome. However, how surprise affects the value of the outcome and subsequent decision making is unclear. We suggest that, on the assumption that surprise decreases the outcome value, agents will increase their risk-averse choices when an outcome is often surprising. Here, we propose the surprise-sensitive utility model, a reinforcement learning model that states that surprise decreases the outcome value, to explain how surprise affects subsequent decision making. To investigate the properties of the proposed model, we compare the model with previous reinforcement learning models on two probabilistic learning tasks by simulations. As a result, the proposed model explains the risk-averse choices like the previous models, and the risk-averse choices increase as the surprise-based modulation parameter of outcome value increases. We also performed statistical model selection by using two experimental datasets with different tasks. The proposed model fits these datasets better than the other models with the same number of free parameters, indicating that the model can better capture the trial-by-trial dynamics of choice behavior.

AB We present a novel computational model that detects temporal configurations of a given human neuronal pathway and constructs its artificial replication. This poses a great challenge since direct recordings from individual neurons are impossible in the human central nervous system and therefore the underlying neuronal pathway has to be considered as a black box. For tackling this challenge, we used a branch of complex systems modeling called artificial self-organization in which large sets of software entities interacting locally give rise to bottom-up collective behaviors. The result is an emergent model where each software entity represents an integrate-and-fire neuron. We then applied the model to the reflex responses of single motor units obtained from conscious human subjects. Experimental results show that the model recovers functionality of real human neuronal pathways by comparing it to appropriate surrogate data. What makes the model promising is the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first realistic model to self-wire an artificial neuronal network by efficiently combining neuroscience with artificial self-organization. Although there is no evidence yet of the model's connectivity mapping onto the human connectivity, we anticipate this model will help neuroscientists to learn much more about human neuronal networks, and could also be used for predicting hypotheses to lead future experiments.

AB Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques and a 1:7.5 physical model of an RH degasser have been used to evaluate the flow of gas and metal inside an RH reactor for vacuum degassing of liquid steel. The effect of gas injection on the gas spatial distribution, steel circulation rate and flow field inside the ladle, snorkels and vacuum chamber have been assessed. N-pentane oil was employed to evaluate the average residence time as well as the slag droplet size distribution. The predicted radial gas distribution and liquid circulation rate have been validated against experimental data from a physical model. The results with incorporation of the virtual mass force coefficient of 0.25 and the turbulence dispersion force showed better predictions of gas distribution in the up-snorkel as well as circulation rate. Full-scale simulations were performed, and the predicted circulation rate was significantly affected by the argon bubble expansion. Data from these simulations were used to analyze the degree of desulfurization performed by the addition of desulfurizing agents inside the vacuum chamber. A model of the kinetics of desulfurization based on the results from the physical model and CFD simulation and on slag dispersion inside liquid steel yields degrees of desulfurization similar to the industrial trials reported in the literature.

AB Theory: A conditional model of committee behavior is proposed to explain variation in committee responsiveness to chamber and party principals.
   Hypotheses: Committee member behavior is consistent with the preferences of both the floor and the party caucuses; variation in salience explains differences in committee responsiveness to noncommittee colleagues.
   Methods: Committee-specific votes are scaled to produce spatial locations for committee, floor, party caucuses, and party committee delegations; a Monte Carlo simulation is used to assess the statistical significance of voting alignments.
   Results: Postreform House committees generally act in a manner acceptable to both the chamber and majority party; the Democratic caucus is frequently represented by extreme committee delegations; members of salient committees are more loyal agents of the chamber and majority party than are members of low salient committees.

AB In this paper, we disclose the statistical behavior of the max-product algorithm configured to solve a maximum a posteriori estimation problem in a network of distributed agents. Specifically, we first build a distributed hypothesis test conducted by a max-product iteration over a binary-valued pairwise Markov random field and show that the decision variables obtained are linear combinations of the local log-likelihood ratios observed in the network. Then, we use these linear combinations to formulate the system performance in terms of the false-alarm and detection probabilities. Our findings indicate that, in the hypothesis test concerned, the optimal performance of the max-product algorithm is obtained by an optimal linear data-fusion scheme and the behavior of the max-product algorithm is very similar to the behavior of the sum-product algorithm. Consequently, we demonstrate that the optimal performance of the max-product iteration is closely achieved via a linear version of the sum-product algorithm, which is optimized based on statistics received at each node from its one-hop neighbors. Finally, we verify our observations via computer simulations.

AB 1. Using experimental streams, we studied the impact of the crayfish Orconectes limosus on (i) the transport of gravel and sand at baseflow; (ii) the sediment surface (bedform, particle consolidation, proportion of sand, algal and gravel cover); and (iii) the critical shear stress (tau(C)) causing incipient gravel and sand motion during simulated floods. We examined ( i) and ( ii) in experimental outdoor flumes that replicated riffle-pool sequences and ( iii) in a larger laboratory flume, in which we exposed sediments retrieved from the outdoor flumes to a progressively increasing discharge.
   2. Habitat changes induced by crayfish, such as bedform alterations in riffles ( downstream displacement of riffle heads) and the increase of gravel on sand dunes in pools, had major impacts on the spatial and temporal patterns of the baseflow transport of gravel and sand.
   3. In addition to their impact on bedform in riffles and on gravel cover in pools, crayfish prevented the physical consolidation of particles in riffles and reduced the algal cover and the proportion of sand in the surface layer in both riffles and pools. These crayfish impacts on sediment surface variables had complex, interacting effects on the mobilisation of gravel and sand during subsequent flood simulations. For sand, crayfish progressively decreased the tau(C) ( i. e. the sum of bedform drag and skin friction) by about 50% along the entire biomass gradient in pools, whereas the presence of crayfish abruptly decreased the tau(C) by about 75% in riffles. For gravel, the discharge causing motion in riffles produced a shear stress ( in terms of skin friction) on an even bedform that was about 75% lower in all flumes with crayfish compared with the flumes without crayfish. Crayfish had no impact on tau(C) for gravel in pools.
   4. Scaling-up these experimental results to real streams suggests that crayfish could affect the patch dynamics of major sediment transport events and habitat suitability for other organisms that, at larger spatial scales, could increase the overall spatio-temporal habitat diversity and thus the overall structural and functional biodiversity of lotic communities.

AB The conformational behavior of four [Ln(DOTA)(H2O)](-) systems (Ln = La, Gd, Ho, and Lu) has been characterized by means of ab initio calculations performed in vacuo and in aqueous solution, the latter by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Calculated molecular geometries and conformational energies of the [Ln(DOTA)(H2O)](-) systems, and interconversion mechanisms, barriers, and C-13 NMR spectra of the [Lu(DOTA)](-) complex are compared with experimental values. For each system, geometry optimizations, performed in vacuo and in solution at the HF/3-21G level and using a 46+4f(n) core electron effective core potential (ECP) for lanthanides, provide two minima corresponding to a square antiprismatic (A) and an inverted antiprismatic (IA) coordination geometry. All the systems are nonacoordinated, with the exception of the IA isomer of the Lu complex that, from in solution calculations, is octacoordinated, in agreement with experimental data. On comparing the in vacuo relative free energies calculated at different theory levels it can be seen that the nonacoordinated species dominates at the beginning of the lanthanide series while the octacoordinated one does so at the end. Furthermore, on passing along the series the IA isomer becomes less and less favored with respect to A and for the Lu complex a stabilization of the IA isomer is observed in solution (but not in vacuo), in agreement with the experimental data. Investigation of the A<---->IA isomerization process in the [Lu(DOTA)](-) system provides two different interconversion mechanisms: a single-step process, involving the simultaneous rotation of the acetate arms, and a multistep path, involving the inversion of the cyclen cycle configuration. While in vacuo the energy barrier for the acetate arm rotation is higher than that involved in the ring inversion (23.1 and 13.1 kcal mol(-1) at the B3LYP/6-311G** level, respectively), in solution the two mechanisms present comparable barriers (14.7 and 13.5 kcal mol(-1)), in fairly good agreement with the experimental values. The NMR shielding constants for the two isomers of the [Lu(DOTA)](-) complex have been calculated by means of the ab initio GIAO and CSGT methods, and using a 46-core-electron ECP for Lu. The calculated C-13 NMR chemical shifts are in close agreement with the experimental values (rms 3.3 ppm, at the HF/6-311G** level) and confirm the structural assignment of the two isomers based on experimental NMR spectra in solution. The results demonstrate that our computational approach is able to predict several physicochemical properties of lanthanide complexes, allowing a better characterization of this class of compounds for their application as contrast agents in medical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

AB In order to simulate the in vivo stress alterations of diabetic skin in an in vitro model, we examined the viscoelastic properties of long-term glycated human skin samples. Since skin is subjected to biaxial tension, we used two-dimensional multiaxial testing which better reflects the in vivo situation than the uniaxial testing mode. For native skin samples from the abdominal region we found a direction-dependent elastic stress-strain behavior. The viscous stress component was separated from the elastic stress component by relaxation tests at consecutive incremental steps of radial strains. We hypothesize that glycation-induced changes in the tissue stiffness are generated in a direction-dependent mode. A marked increase of the direction-dependent stiffness was found upon long-term incubation with glucose-6-phosphate. This increase was statistically significant for the maximum principal elastic stress component which was highly correlated with the degree of non-enzymatic collagen modification. The viscous fractions obtained from two-dimensional relaxation tests at consecutive radial strains were inversely correlated with non-enzymatic modification. Only at 30% radial strain a significant decrease of the viscous fraction engendered by glucose-6-phosphate was observed together with a direction-dependent significant increase of the expectation value of the time constant. The biomechanical and biochemical effects of long-term glycation could be partially reversed by aminoguanidine, a potential therapeutic agent for patients with diabetes mellitus. Our findings suggest that additional cross-links generated by long-term glycation cause two-dimensional biomechanical alterations in human skin, which can be unequivocally detected by multiaxial testing.

AB A well-based reactive barrier system using controlled-release KMnO4 has been recently developed as a long-term in situ treatment option for plumes of dense and non-aqueous phase liquids in groundwater. In order to take advantage of the merits of controlled release systems (CRS) in environmental remediation, the release behavior needs to be optimized for the hydrologic and environmental conditions of target treatment zone. Where release systems are expected to be operated over long times, like for the reactive barriers, it may only be practical to describe the long-term behavior numerically.
   We developed a numerical model capable of describing release characteristics associated with variable forms and structures of long-term CRS. Sensitivity analyses and illustrative simulations showed that the release kinetics and durations would be constrained by changes in agent solubility, bulk diffusion coefficients, or structures of the release devices. The generality of the numerical model was demonstrated through simulations for CRS with monolithic and double-layered matrices. The generalized model was then used for actual design and analyses of an encapsulated-matrix CRS, which can yield constant release kinetics for several years. A well-based reactive barrier system (4.05 x 10(3) m(3)) using the encapsulated-matrix CRS can release similar to 1.65 kg of active agent (here MnO4-) daily over the next 6.6 yr, creating prolonged reaction zone in the subsurface. The generalized model-based, target-specific approach using the long-term CRS could provide practical tool for improving the efficacy of advanced in situ remediation schemes such as in situ chemical oxidation, bioremediation, or in situ redox manipulation. Development of techniques for adjusting the bulk diffusion coefficients of the release matrices and facilitating the lateral spreading of the released agent is warranted. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We introduce a model called Host-Pathogen game for studying biological competitions. Notably, we focus on the invasive dynamics of external agents, like bacteria, within a host organism. The former are mapped to a population of defectors that aim to spread in the extracellular medium of the host. In turn, the latter is composed of cells, mapped to a population of cooperators, that aim to kill pathogens. The cooperative behavior of cells is fundamental for the emergence of the living functions of the whole organism, since each one contributes to a specific set of tasks. So, broadly speaking, their contribution can be viewed as a form of energy. When bacteria are spatially close to a cell, the latter can use a fraction of its energy to remove them. On the other hand, when bacteria survive an attack, they absorb the received energy, becoming stronger and more resistant to further attacks. In addition, since bacteria play as defectors, their unique target is to increase their wealth, without supporting their own kind. As in many living organisms, the host temperature plays a relevant role in the host-pathogen equilibrium. For instance, in animals like human beings, a neural mechanism triggers the increasing of the body temperature in order to activate the immune system. Here, cooperators succeed once bacteria are completely removed while, in the opposite scenario, the host undergoes a deep invasive process, like a blood poisoning. Results of numerical simulations show that the dynamics of the proposed model allow to reach a variety of states. At a very high level of abstraction, some of these states seem to be similar to those that can be observed in some living systems. Therefore, to conclude, we deem that our model might be exploited for studying further biological phenomena.

AB The passenger flow guidance is an effective demand management strategy to alleviate the excessive congestion in the urban rail transit network. In order to determine the scope and the timing, a simulation-based optimization model is proposed to optimize the release of passenger flow guidance information in the rail transit network in this paper. In the optimization model, we mainly focus on three aspects namely; where, when and what type of the guidance information should be released to the passengers. In the simulation model, the passenger choice behavior is captured by the agent-based simulation method, which responses to the congestion and the guidance information. Based on this, the dynamic passenger flow distribution can be derived. Furthermore, the adoption rate of the displayed guidance information on passenger information system as well as its impact on passenger travel behavior are also considered in the model. A hybrid heuristic solution algorithm, integrated with passenger simulator and genetic algorithm, is developed to solve the proposed simulation-based optimization model. Finally, a case study of Beijing subway is carried out with the large-scale smart card data. The numerical study shows that the passenger flow demand affects the guidance effect significantly and the best guidance effect can be met with sufficiently high passenger flow demand. And the guidance rate is also found to affect the guidance results. The results also show that the proposed model can provide a detailed guidance scheme for every station at selected time intervals. The results show that the dynamic releasing scheme can save up to a total of 46,319 min in passenger travel time during a single guidance period. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Physicians play multiple roles in a health system. They typically serve simultaneously as the agent for patients, for insurers, for their own medical practices, and for the hospital facilities where they practice. Theoretical and empirical results have demonstrated that financial relations among these different stakeholders can affect clinical outcomes as well as the efficiency and quality of care. What are the physicians' roles as the agents of Chinese patients? The marketization approach of China's economic reforms since 1978 has made hospitals and physicians profit-driven. Such profit-driven behavior and the financial tie between hospitals and physicians have in turn made physicians more the agents of hospitals rather than of their patients. While this commentary acknowledges physicians' ethics and their dedication to their patients, it argues that the current physician agency relation in China has created barriers to achieving some of the central goals of current provider-side health care reform efforts. In addition to eliminating existing perverse financial incentives for both hospitals and physicians, the need for which is already agreed upon by numerous scholars, we argue that the success of the ongoing Chinese public hospital reform and of overall health care reform also relies on establishing appropriate physician-hospital agency relations. This commentary proposes 2 essential steps to establish such physician-hospital agency relations: (1) minimize financial ties between senior physicians and tertiary-level public hospitals by establishing a separate reimbursement system for senior physicians, and (2) establishing a comprehensive physician professionalism system underwritten by the Chinese government, professional physician associations, and major health care facilities as well as by physician leadership representatives. Neither of these suggestions is addressed adequately in current health care reform activities.

AB Adhesive polymer is a common and important material used for packaging of microelectronics and microsystem by attaching dies onto packaging shell, and its mechanical property plays a vital role in isolating dies from the thermal stress of substrate. Therefore, it is extremely significant to evaluate the polymer property in a specific packaging process. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is conducted in this article to investigate the material properties of the cross-linked epoxy resin formed by epoxy resin component diglycidyl ether bisphenol A (DGEBA) and curing agent 1,6-Diaminohexane. The polymer network with conversion up to 87.5% is successfully generated and simulated by constant pressure-constant temperature ensemble (NPT) and canonical ensemble (NVT) at different temperatures of curing process. Glass transition temperature (T-g) and Young's modulus are extracted and the predicted material properties are in great agreement with the experimental data. The conclusion provides a guideline to design the special curing process for different adhesive requirements.

AB CO2 emissions caused by private motorized traffic for the city of Graz, a typical European inland city with about 320 000 citizens, are investigated. The main methodology is a newly developed agent-based model that incorporates empirical data about the mobility behavior of the citizens in order to calculate the traveled routes, the resulting traffic and subsequent emissions. To assess the impact of different policies on CO2 emissions, different scenarios are simulated and their results are compared to a base line scenario. The model features a local and temporal resolution, effects like congestion and stop-and-go traffic as well as commuters to and from other regions. In addition to the evaluation of certain policies (like a focus on electric cars, telecommuting or an improvement of the road infrastructure), a method is provided, that makes it possible to compare many diverse scenarios, featuring technological changes, societal changes or changes in the road network, all within the same framework. The findings suggest that one of the most promising strategies to decrease urban CO2 emissions is to focus on the use of electric cars, especially if it is combined with offering alternatives to private car traffic and incentives for telecommuting. Banning the use of old cars only yields a significant result if a large amount of cars is affected, which would make such a policy difficult to implement. Expanding the road network has no significant positive effect and may even encourage using cars, therefore leading to even more CO2 emissions. Due to its flexible structure the presented model can be used to evaluate policies beyond what is presented in this study. It can easily be adapted to other conditions and geographical regions.

AB Human behavior and the environment's characteristics have proven to play an important role within the evacuation process as they can facilitate a shorter evacuation time. The collaborative classrooms represent a now-a-days architectural trend as, when compared to the classical classrooms, they provide a friendlier space for learning, allowing students to easily exchange information and knowledge among them and to increase their ability of working as a team in completing the assigned tasks during a class. In this context, the evacuation process from this type of classrooms is discussed. A simulated evacuation has been conducted using 18 students, having ages between 19 and 21 years old, in a classical and in a collaborative classroom, and several aspects related to the evacuation process, such as: speed, dealing with obstacles, ad-hoc guided intervention, have been empirically measured. Considering the observations from the field, an agent-based model has been created, calibrated and used for simulations. The model is highly configurable and be adapted to various classroom configurations. Five types of collaborative classroom configurations have been used and hierarchized base on their evacuation time efficiency when the exit doors' position is given. The presence of jumped and bypassed obstacles and the volunteer guidance have been analyzed. Their impact on the evacuation time is discussed within the paper, along with the study's limitations. Based on the simulations, it has been observed that, the evacuation time in the case of the collaborative classroom in the presence of one exit door has been, on average, with 6.02% smaller than in the case of a non-collaborative classroom. Also, the presence of two evacuation doors in a collaborative classroom and a proper desk placement can reduce, on average, the evacuation time with up to 36.51% when compared to one-door evacuation situation.

AB The study of the pathogenesis of breast cancer is challenged by the long time-course of the disease process and the multifactorial nature of generating oncogenic insults. The characterization of the longitudinal pathogenesis of malignant transformation from baseline normal breast duct epithelial dynamics may provide vital insight into the cascading systems failure that leads to breast cancer. To this end, extensive information on the baseline behavior of normal mammary epithelium and breast cancer oncogenesis was integrated into a computational model termed the Ductal Epithelium Agent-Based Model (DEABM). The DEABM is composed of computational agents that behave according to rules established from published cellular and molecular mechanisms concerning breast duct epithelial dynamics and oncogenesis. The DEABM implements DNA damage and repair, cell division, genetic inheritance and simulates the local tissue environment with hormone excretion and receptor signaling. Unrepaired DNA damage impacts the integrity of the genome within individual cells, including a set of eight representative oncogenes and tumor suppressors previously implicated in breast cancer, with subsequent consequences on successive generations of cells. The DEABM reproduced cellular population dynamics seen during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, and demonstrated the oncogenic effect of known genetic factors associated with breast cancer, namely TP53 and Myc, in simulations spanning similar to 40 years of simulated time. Simulations comparing normal to BRCA1-mutant breast tissue demonstrated rates of invasive cancer development similar to published epidemiologic data with respect to both cumulative incidence over time and estrogen-receptor status. Investigation of the modeling of ER alpha-positive (ER+) tumorigenesis led to a novel hypothesis implicating the transcription factor and tumor suppressor RUNX3. These data suggest that the DEABM can serve as a potentially valuable framework to augment the traditional investigatory workflow for future hypothesis generation and testing of the mechanisms of breast cancer oncogenesis.

AB This paper reports an experimental study on hexavalent chromium leaching from cement samples and cement composites containing silica fume and zeolite additions that were subjected to various leaching agents. The water-soluble Cr(VI) concentrations in cements ranged from 0.2 to 3.2 mg/kg and represented only 1.8% of the total chromium content. The presence of chromium compounds with both chromium oxidation states of III and VI was detected in the cement samples by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Leaching tests were performed in a Britton-Robinson buffer to simulate natural conditions and showed increased dissolution of Cr(VI) up to 6 mg/kg. The highest amount of leached hexavalent chromium was detected after leaching in HC1. The findings revealed that the leaching of chromium from cements was higher by 55-80% than that from the cement composites. A minimum concentration was observed for all cement samples when studying the relationship between the soluble Cr(VI) and the cement storage time.

AB We develop a stochastic, agent-based model to study how genetic traits and experiential changes in the state of agents and available resources influence individuals' foraging and movement behaviors. These behaviors are manifest as decisions on when to stay and exploit a current resource patch or move to a particular neighboring patch, based on information of the resource qualities of the patches and the anticipated level of intraspecific competition within patches. We use a genetic algorithm approach and an individual's biomass as a fitness surrogate to explore the foraging strategy diversity of evolving guilds under clonal versus hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. We first present the resource exploitation processes, movement on cellular arrays, and genetic algorithm components of the model. We then discuss their implementation on the Nova software platform. This platform seamlessly combines the dynamical systems modeling of consumer-resource interactions with agent-based modeling of individuals moving over a landscapes, using an architecture that lays transparent the following four hierarchical simulation levels: 1.) within-patch consumer-resource dynamics, 2.) within-generation movement and competition mitigation processes, 3.) across-generation evolutionary processes, and 4.) multiple runs to generate the statistics needed for comparative analyses. The focus of our analysis is on the question of how the biomass production efficiency and the diversity of guilds of foraging strategy types, exploiting resources over a patchy landscape, evolve under clonal versus random hermaphroditic sexual reproduction. Our results indicate greater biomass production efficiency under clonal reproduction only at higher population densities, and demonstrate that polymorphisms evolve and are maintained under random mating systems. The latter result questions the notion that some type of associative mating structure is needed to maintain genetic polymorphisms among individuals exploiting a common patchy resource on an otherwise spatially homogeneous landscape.

AB Magmatic-hydrothermal ore deposits are a major resource of gold. Volatiles exsolving from magmas rising through the Earth's crust are the key agent for enrichment of gold in these deposits. We report the first experimental determination of gold solubilities in the magmatic volatile phases at conditions typical of most magmas associated with gold deposits (T = 1000 degrees C, P = 150 MPa). We show that gold hydrosulfide complexes supersede gold chloride complexes, and more importantly, that the stability of gold hydrosulfide complexes is greatly increased by the presence of minute concentrations of KC or NaCl (0.1-0.5 mol/kg H2O). The amplifying effect of alkali chlorides on the solubility of gold in H2S bearing volatiles may explain the preferential association of many giant hydrothermal gold deposits with high-potassium alkaline mafic to intermediate igneous rocks, which exsolve volatiles that simultaneously contain both H2S and alkali chlorides in significant concentrations.

AB gamma-Ti3O5 is one kind of prominent non-stoichiometric metal oxide due to its intriguing ability in electric and electrochemical behaviors. This work reports another attractive property of gamma-Ti3O5 hierarchical porous microspheres, the extremely effective photothermal property with a high photothermal conversion efficiency. Theory and experimental results indicate that gamma-Ti3O5 hierarchical porous microspheres possess metallic features and display very strong localized surface plasma resonance effects over the visible and near-infrared region. Under simulated sunlight or near infrared light, the metallic gamma-Ti3O5 exhibits a photothermal conversion efficiency of up to 65.29%. Under irradiation by a near-infrared laser with a wavelength of 808 nm, the gamma-Ti3O5 hierarchical porous microspheres can significantly inhibit cancer cell viability in vitro and disrupt tumor tissue growth in vivo in a short period. In vitro and in vivo toxicity experiments demonstrate that it has good biocompatibility. The ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency and biocompatibility make the gamma-Ti3O5 very attractive for technological uses in photothermal therapy, solar energy utilization, and infrared light detection and so on.

AB D-Mannitol, a common bulking agent used in the pharmaceutical. and food industries, is known to crystallize in three anhydrous polymorphs (alpha, beta, and delta) and a hemihydrate form. In this work, solid-state density functional theory simulations and experimental teraherm spectroscopy were used to evaluate the stabilities, thermodynamic relationships, and spectral signatures of these various solids. The thermodynamic analyses of the anhydrous polymorphs identified enantiotropic transitions for beta-delta at approximately room temperature and alpha-delta near the a melting point, but showed alpha and beta to be monotropically related. Computational refinement of the D-mannitol hemihydrate crystal structure and comparison of its Gibbs free energy to the anhydrous forms showed the hemihydrate to be stable only at low temperatures (<253 K), in agreement with experiment, and reveals its conversion to the delta polymorph upon dehydration. Quantification of the intramolecular and intermolecular energies within these solids highlights the competition that exists between molecular conformation and cohesion energies and how a balance of these forces dictates the observed behaviors.

AB We introduce the taxicab game, related to the ultimatum game and Gehrig et al.'s (2007) yes/no game. The proposer makes an offer, and simultaneously sends a cheap talk message indicating (possibly falsely) the amount of the offer. The responder observes the message with certainty and the offer with probability p before accepting or rejecting the offer. We investigate versions with p = 0 and p = 0.5 along with the ultimatum game as a baseline. Intuition and a model comprising both standard economic agents and others who dislike inequity, lies and lying provide clear predictions that our experimental results support. As the likelihood increases of offers being seen, the offers themselves increase, messages overstate them less, and responders are more likely to accept (even when the offer is unseen). Also, responders are more likely to accept after truthful messages than after lies or when no message is sent. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Review; Book Chapter
ID SPATIAL MODEL; CANCER; SIMULATION
AB The complexity of biological systems creates challenges for fully understanding their behaviour. This is particularly true for cell migration which requires the co-ordinated activity of hundreds of individual components within cells. Mathematical modelling can help understand these complex systems by breaking the system into discrete steps which can then be interrogated in silico. In this review, we highlight scenarios in cell migration where mathematical modelling can be applied and discuss what types of modelling are most suited. Almost any aspect of cell migration is amenable to mathematical modelling from the modelling of intracellular processes such as chemokine receptor signalling and actin filament branching to larger scale processes such as the movement of individual cells or populations of cells through their environment. Two common ways of approaching this modelling are the use of models based on differential equations or agent-based modelling. The application of both these approaches to cell migration are discussed with specific examples along with common software tools to facilitate the process for non-mathematicians. We also highlight the challenges of modelling cell migration and the need for rigorous experimental work to effectively parameterise a model.

AB It is not an easy task to regenerate chromium(III) ions from weak electrolyte carboxylate resins using conventional chemicals (e.g., mineral acids, saline solutions, alone or in combination).
   In areas of environmental control, referring to some specific cases of industrial effluents (e.g., tanneries), where metal complexing agents are present, additional difficulties in separation and recovery of the metals may arise by use of carboxylate form resins.
   Referring to the Cr(III)/Al(III)/Fe(III) ionic system in a solution simulating a typical spent chrome tanning bath, the exhaustion-regeneration behaviour of a commercial acrylic-based macroporous carboxylic resin (i.e., Purolite C106) is reported. The exhaustion behaviour of the resin is straightforward, whereas regeneration by using chemicals, such as sulphuric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium sulphate, is difficult. The adoption of hydrogen peroxide in alkaline media, during the regeneration step, seems very promising.
   The general behaviour is interpreted in terms of ionic speciation and complex formation. A mechanistic explanation is provided in support of the experimental findings.

AB The swelling properties of buffer material for high level radioactive waste repository in a near-field environment are of particular importance for achieving the low permeability sealing function. In this study, the free swelling behavior of a potential buffer material Zhisin clay is evaluated under simulated groundwater conditions such as immersion in NaCl, CaCl2, and Na2SO4 solutions at various concentrations. Experimental results indicate that Zhisin clay, being a Ca-bentonite, exhibits reduced swelling strain in salt solutions. The amount of decrease in swelling strain upon saline water intrusion is affected by both the type and concentration of electrolyte. At the same concentration, the swelling strains in CaCl2 solution are lower than those in NaCl solution due to the quasi-crystals formed in the presence of calcium ions. Also, the swells in Na2SO4 solution are found to be lower than those in NaCl solution. This is attributed to the precipitation of CaSO4, which acts as binding agent and results in aggregation of clay particles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to determine how the early-age shrinkage behavior of cementitious materials is affected by the addition of saturated cellulose fibers under sealed and unsealed conditions. The sealed condition simulates autogenous shrinkage exclusively while the unsealed condition introduces drying shrinkage, as well. Although the primary focus was to determine whether saturated cellulose fibers are suitable to mitigate autogenous shrinkage as an internal curing agent, evaluating their effect under drying conditions provided further insight into the overall shrinkage behavior of the composite material. At additions of 1% by mass of cement, the cellulose fibers were found to show significant drying shrinkage cracking control while providing some internal curing. In addition, early-age shrinkage test results were supplemented with a quantitative measure of fiber dispersion based on comparing theoretical and experimental values of the fiber volume fraction in hardened cementitious samples. Results indicated that improved dispersion leads to improved properties. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Most animals exhibit significant neurological and morphological change throughout their lifetime. No robots to date, however, grow new morphological structure while behaving. This is due to technological limitations but also because it is unclear that morphological change provides a benefit to the acquisition of robust behavior in machines. Here I show that in evolving populations of simulated robots, if robots grow from anguilliform into legged robots during their lifetime in the early stages of evolution, and the anguilliform body plan is gradually lost during later stages of evolution, gaits are evolved for the final, legged form of the robot more rapidly-and the evolved gaits are more robust-compared to evolving populations of legged robots that do not transition through the anguilliform body plan. This suggests that morphological change, as well as the evolution of development, are two important processes that improve the automatic generation of robust behaviors for machines. It also provides an experimental platform for investigating the relationship between the evolution of development and robust behavior in biological organisms.

AB Crystals of the cationic clathrate Si46-2xP2xTex can be grown via chemical vapour transport by adding tellurium tetrachloride. The transport proceeds in the temperature gradient T-1 = 923 K -> T-2 = 1003 K and with increasing temperature under reversion of the transport direction T-2 = 1173 K -> T-1 = 1073 K. By means of the thermodynamic modelling of solid state-gas phase equilibria, the transport mechanism for both directions was clarified; in the direction T-1 -> T-2 (T-1 < T-2) HCI(g) acts as the transport agent and in the other direction T-2 -> T-1 (T-2 > T-1) SiCl4(g) becomes active. Using the modelling the composition of the crystals Si46-2xP2xTex can be predicted depending on the experimental conditions, i.e. the temperature range, the direction of temperature gradient and the composition of the starting material.

AB An infusion pump powered by body heat is investigated in this paper, with the goal of addressing the needs of dermal wound healing. The infusion pump incorporates a Knudsen gas pump, a type of thermally driven pump, to pneumatic push the pharmaceutical agent from a reservoir. Two designs are considered: an integrated pump and reservoir, and a design with cascaded pump and reservoir. Thermal models are developed for both pumps, and the simulations agree well with the experimental results. The integrated pump and reservoir design uses hydrophobic materials to prevent a flow from occurring unless the infusion pump is placed on a human body. Flow rates in the mu L min(-1) range for the integrated pump and reservoir, and approximately 70 mu L min(-1) for the cascaded pump were obtained. The dynamic behavior of the cascaded pump is described based on the thermal models. Multiple copies of the cascaded pump are easily made in series or parallel, to increase either the pressure or the flow rate. The flow rate of multiple pumps in series does not change, and the pressure of multiple pumps in parallel does not change.

AB Gas-liquid slug flow is characterized by complex and intermittent hydrodynamic features that offer an efficient alternative to promote biofilm control. In the present work, the mechanism of transferring a gaseous solute into a co-current liquid in a micro-scale slug flow system was inspected in detail. Specifically, the gas-liquid mass transfer from an individual Taylor bubble filled with oxygen was numerically studied using CFD techniques. To accurately describe the referred phenomenon, the hydrodynamic and concentration fields were simultaneously solved. Furthermore, the interface capturing based on the VOF methodology was also coupled to this solution approach. Three sub-categories within slug flow pattern were identified based on the flow behavior in the liquid phase: no liquid in recirculation (Case A); closed wake below the bubble tail (Case B); and recirculation ahead and below bubble (Case C). Regarding the solute distribution, in Case A the solute is dispersed only backwards, it accumulates in the closed wake structure in Case B, and it reaches the wall within the film region in Case C. Local and average mass transfer coefficients were also estimated for the different cases. The influence of the two most relevant dimensionless groups (Reynolds and Capillary numbers) was also briefly analyzed. Global mass transfer coefficients results confirmed that the penetration theory can provide reasonable estimations for systems like Case C.

AB Phosphodiesterases 4 enzyme is an attractive target for the design of anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator agents. In the present study, pharmacophore and atom-based 3D-QSAR studies were carried out for pyrazolopyridine and quinoline derivatives using Schrodinger suite 2014-3. A four-point pharmacophore model was developed using 74 molecules having pIC(50) ranging from 10.1 to 4.5. The best four feature model consists of one hydrogen bond acceptor, two aromatic rings, and one hydrophobic group. The pharmacophore hypothesis yielded a statistically significant 3D-QSAR model, with a high correlation coefficient (R-2=.9949), cross validation coefficient (Q(2)=.7291), and Pearson-r (.9107) at six component partial least square factor. The external validation indicated that our QSAR model possessed high predictive power with R-2 value of .88. The generated model was further validated by enrichment studies using the decoy test. Molecular docking, free energy calculation, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies have been performed to explore the putative binding modes of these ligands. A 10-ns MD simulation confirmed the docking results of both stability of the 1XMU-ligand complex and the presumed active conformation. Outcomes of the present study provide insight in designing novel molecules with better PDE4 inhibitory activity.

AB The aim of this study was to prove the hypothesis that dentine adhesives can be used as therapeutic material in treating dentine hypersensitivity, regardless of aetiology. The research was conducted on 492 students of Zagreb University School of Dental Medicine (154 male, 338 female), 20-25-years-old. The defects of the tooth neck were found in 38 patients, on 133 teeth (38 of male patients, 95 of female) and dentine hypersensitivity was recorded according to the subjective sensations of patients. Therapeutic characteristics of three adhesive materials were examined simultaneously: All Bond 2, fourth generation adhesive, Syntac Single Component and One Step, fifth generation adhesives. Teeth treated with dentine lacquer Cervitec were used as a control group. Tooth necks were treated with selected materials according to instructions of a manufacturer. A completed statistical survey of the results has clearly shown that dentine adhesives can be used in symptomatic therapy of dentine hypersensitivity of the non-caries cervical lesions (NCCL). The survey has also shown that dentine adhesives of the fifth generation (Syntac Single Component and One Step) have much higher efficiency rate than dentine adhesives of the fourth generation (All Bond 2) and dentine lacquer (Cervitec). According to data complied through this study the conclusion can be brought forward that dentine adhesives are not a final solution to the problem of dentine hypersensitivity, because their efficiency decreases with time.

AB Decision-making in complex logistics systems involves high risks and associated impacts. A way to forecast the impacts of these decisions is through the use of systems simulation projects, where the systematic impacts of the parameters can be visualized. This study presents a project based on Discrete-Event Simulation (DES) that analyses Brazilian soybean export logistics from producing regions to main international customers. The strategic analysis of a global logistics system using DES is a particularity of this study. At the conception stage, the conceptual modelling was made using IDEF-SIM (Integrated Definition Methods - Simulation) method, which allowed a better abstraction of reality and more accurate model implementation. The experimental analysis took place through the construction of 39 scenarios with specific characteristics that verified system behaviours through proposed changes. The analyses and decisions are based on costs. The simulations indicated the necessity for: a) an integrated management between the systems agents; b) the development of internal transportation infrastructure, especially railways and waterways, to increase competitiveness of Brazilian soybeans in the international market.

AB This paper presents the results of a large-scale experimental program aiming to study the behavior of reinforced concrete (RC) columns under simulated seismic loading, strengthened in flexure (of crucial importance in capacity design) with different types and configurations of near-surface-mounted (NSM) reinforcing materials. The role of different parameters is examined by comparing lateral load-versus-displacement response characteristics (peak force, drift ratios, energy dissipation, and stiffness). Those parameters are as follows: carbon or glass fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) versus stainless steel, configuration and amount of NSM reinforcement, confinement via local jacketing, and type of bonding agent (epoxy resin or mortar). The results demonstrate that NSM FRP and stainless steel reinforcement is a viable solution toward enhancing the flexural resistance of RC columns subjected to seismic loads. This is especially the case when the retrofitting scheme combines epoxy-bonded NSM bars with local confining jackets (provided in this study with textile-reinforced mortars [TRM]).

AB The incorporation of various wastes in red clay-based ceramic products has been widely investigated, frequently with the aim of reducing the waste environmental impact. This work explores the not so obvious waste potentialities and describes the properties and microstructure development in a natural clay showing large processing limitations, upon the addition of two different ornamental stone Cutting rejects, granite and marble + granite. All materials were collected at industrial sites and the behavior of mixtures containing 70 wt.% clay + 30 wt.% reject is detailed. Powder samples were uniaxially pressed under 20 MPa, sintered in air in an electric furnace for 2 h at a temperature in the range 950-1150 degrees C, and characterized. The experimental results obtained (firing shrinkage, porosity, flexural strength, microstructure) show that the rejects can be used to replace traditional fluxing agents, helping the sintering process, and simultaneously control the plasticity and shrinkage of an otherwise unusable clay, with obvious economical and environmental benefits.

AB The drugs against tropical neglected diseases, especially Chagas Disease, were launched more than 30 years ago, and the development of resistance requires the discovery of new and more effective chemotherapeutic agents. Trypanosoma cruzi has a redox enzyme called trypanothione reductase which was successfully inhibited for peptide derivatives (McKie et similar to al., Amino Acids, 2001, 20: 145). This work aims at studying the mechanism of inhibition of this enzyme through molecular dynamics simulations and evaluating the behavior of some derivatives when inhibiting this protein. We should affirm that any particular molecular dynamics analysis tools (Hbond pattern, 3-D root-mean-square deviation, solvent accessible surface area, etc.) cannot be used apart from the others to justify completely these peptides inhibitory patterns. Based on our results, we reproduced the experimental data and, moreover, we discriminated against a new site in enzyme aperture, which can assist the development of powerful inhibitors against trypanothione reductase enzyme.

AB The development of personalized medicine is a primary objective of the medical community and increasingly also of funding and registration agencies. Modeling is generally perceived as a key enabling tool to target this goal. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) have previously been used to simulate inflammation at various scales up to the whole-organism level. We extended this approach to the case of a novel, patient-specific ABM that we generated for vocal fold inflammation, with the ultimate goal of identifying individually optimized treatments. ABM simulations reproduced trajectories of inflammatory mediators in laryngeal secretions of individuals subjected to experimental phonotrauma up to 4 hrs post-injury, and predicted the levels of inflammatory mediators 24 hrs post-injury. Subject-specific simulations also predicted different outcomes from behavioral treatment regimens to which subjects had not been exposed. We propose that this translational application of computational modeling could be used to design patient-specific therapies for the larynx, and will serve as a paradigm for future extension to other clinical domains.

AB The formation of complexes of Zn(II), Cd(II), HE(II), and Pb(II) and N-carboxymethyl-D,L-threonine (H2CMT, H2L) in aqueous solutions has been studied by spectrophotometric and potentiometric methods. The complexation model for each system has been established by the HYPERQUAD program from the potentiometric data. Three different behaviors are found: ML2H, MLH, ML, MLOH, and ML2 complexes are formed by Zn(II) and Cd(II) ions, ML2H. ML, MLOH, and ML2 are formed by HB(II) ion, and only 1/1 complexes MLH, ML, and MLOH are formed by the Pb(II) ion. The formation constants determined for all these complexes allow simulation of experimental titration curves with good agreement. The speciation of multimetal systems with H2CMT shows that this compound is a good and selective ligand at low pH for the Hg(II) ion.

DT Article
AB In order to make clear the role of zinc (Zn) ions in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) the investigations of rats with the compression model of TN as well as on false operated animals were carried out. In 1.5 months after the intraorbital nerve compression the increase of Zn concentration in caudal trigeminal nucleus and (to a less degree) in hyppocampus as well as behavioural and pathophysiological pain correlates were revealed. The exogenous Zn introduction led to an increase of its level in these structures simultaneously with the exacerbation of all sings of the TN syndrome. The addition of chelating agents Xydiphone which bound bivalent cations in soft tissues, into drinking water, normalized the Zn content in rats brain and reduced the pathological symptoms. The use of Xydiphone in the complex therapy of 25 patients with the TN tolerant to carbamazepine reduced the pain syndrome in 15 cases. thus the local changes of Zn level in the CNS may play a certain role in the manifestation of the TN pain syndrome.

TI State representation modeling for deep reinforcement learning based

DE State representation modeling; Deep reinforcement learning;
   Recommendation
AB Reinforcement learning techniques have recently been introduced to interactive recommender systems to capture the dynamic patterns of user behavior during the interaction with recommender systems and perform planning to optimize long-term performance. Most existing research work focuses on designing policy and learning algorithms of the recommender agent but seldom cares about the state representation of the environment, which is indeed essential for the recommendation decision making. In this paper, we first formulate the interactive recommender system problem with a deep reinforcement learning recommendation framework. Within this framework, we then carefully design four state representation schemes for learning the recommendation policy. Inspired by recent advances in feature interaction modeling in user response prediction, we discover that explicitly modeling user-item interactions in state representation can largely help the recommendation policy perform effective reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets are conducted under both the offline and simulated online evaluation settings. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed state representation schemes lead to better performance over the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Albeit arsenic compounds are ubiquitous in aqueous solutions, the speciation of such a pollutant in natural water mainly depends on its binding capabilities with specific molecules. The features of most of the interactions of arsenic complexes can be established in solution, but the data related to the stability of the formed species, essentially depending on the concentration of the ligands, are elusive. For this reason, here, we report on a series of investigations where diverse approaches are combined together in order to characterize the behavior of As(III) species in aqueous solutions where simple chelating agents, such as thiolactic and thiomalic acids, are solvated. By synergistically exploiting potentiometric, calorimetric, and spectroscopic measurements along with ab initio molecular dynamics, the stability and the underlying formation mechanisms of specific species, along with the arsenic coordination modalities with the ligands, have macroscopically and microscopically been assessed. Furthermore, vibrational modes of the complexes formed by arsenic and simple thioacids have been assigned by means of Raman experiments.

AB This article is part of an ambitious project. The aim is to simulate mechanical properties of rotomolded part from microstructure consideration. Main objective here is to consider metallocene polypropylene crystallization kinetic (PP) during cooling stage in rotational molding. Crystallization kinetic of metallocene PP is so rapid that microscopy cannot help to observe nucleation and growth. Crystallization rate can be estimated by a global kinetic. Given that cooling in rotational molding is dynamic with a constant rate, Ozawa law appears more appropriate. Ozawa parameters have been estimated by differential scanning calorimetry. In rotational molding thermal condition, Avrami index identifies a complex nucleation intermediate between spontaneous and sporadic. Ozawa rate constant is 68 times higher than this obtained for Ziegler-Natta PP. By coupling transformation rate from Ozawa model and a thermal model developed earlier, the difference between theory and experimental is less than 1%. To optimize rotational molding, study has been completed by sensitivity to adjustable parameters. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

SO GLASS TECHNOLOGY-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GLASS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PART A

DT Article
AB Lightweight glass-ceramic foams produced from silicate wastes have been characterised with regards to their thermal and mechanical properties. The level of porosity of the fabricated foams was controlled by varying the heat treatment temperature and the amount of foaming agent. Lee's Disc was used to measure the thermal conductivity of each type of foam in order to assess its potential as a thermal insulator. The most porous material, with a porosity of 90%, achieved a thermal conductivity of about 0 center dot 2 Wm(-1)K(-1). Good agreement was obtained between experimental conductivity data and simulated values obtained by a finite element analysis, which employed structural information obtained from x-ray microtomography. Mechanical properties, such as Young's modulus, flexural and crushing strength of foams of various densities, were also determined in this study. Correlations against well known models indicated the waste derived foams behaved in a manner typical of brittle foams. The study provides an understanding of the thermal and mechanical behaviour of glass-ceramic foams; these waste derived materials show potential for thermal insulation applications.

AB It is commonly assumed that agents will adopt Nash equilibrium strategies; however, experimental studies have demonstrated that this is often a poor description of human players' behavior in unrepeated normal-form games. We analyze five widely studied models of human behavior: Quantal Response Equilibrium, Level-k, Cognitive Hierarchy, QLk, and Noisy Introspection. We performed what we believe is the most comprehensive meta-analysis of these models, leveraging ten datasets from the literature recording human play of two-player games. We first evaluated predictive performance, asking how well each model fits unseen test data using parameters calibrated from separate training data. The QLk model (Stahl and Wilson, 1994) consistently achieved the best performance. Using a Bayesian analysis, we found that QLk's estimated parameter values were not consistent with their intended economic interpretations. Finally, we evaluated model variants similar to QLk, identifying one (Camerer et al., 2016) that achieves better predictive performance with fewer parameters. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Sorption and desorption of Sr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn on xylain from lignites of the Mariza-East coal basin (Bulgaria) were studied. Sorption behaviour for all the studied elements was found to be of similar pH dependence for all elements. The maximum quantities bound vary from 0.104 meq (Sr) to 0.167 meq for Cu. On treatment with a complex-forming agent such as tartaric acid, a high degree of extraction was achieved. However, appreciable amounts of elements remain tightly bound on the sorbent. When present simultaneously in solution, the quantity of every element sorbed, excluding Cu, is lower as compared with the quantities from the experiments for single cations. The cation-exchange mechanism of the sorption and formation of covalent links was determined. Such processes may be responsible for part of the organically-associated elements in coals in case they are influenced by solutions enriched in some trace elements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

DE MAC protocol; ns2; Wireless sensor network
AB Increasing deployment density and shrinking size of wireless sensor nodes requires small equipped battery size. This means emerging wireless sensor nodes must compete for efficient energy utilization. Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols play a vital role in energy consumption of sensor node as it controls the radio activities. Customized or open source simulators play an important role to measure the performance effectiveness of MAC protocols based on the fact that they are flexible, reduce experimental overhead and cost. Nevertheless, these benefits come at the cost of results accuracy. In this paper, we investigate differences of the behaviour of our agent based S-MAC protocols in real deployment compared to the results produced using our custom based simulator, which ignores the lower layers effects such as packet collision and overhearing. We use network simulator 2 (ns2), an open source simulator, which provides a complete protocol stack. We further try to find and explain the rationale of the variance of results produced by real deployment and that of simulators. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Rubber-like thermosetting epoxy asphalt composites (REACs) were prepared by curing epoxy resin (diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A) with curing agents system made up of maleated petroleum asphalt, adipic acid, and methylhexahydrophthalic anhydride. REACs' glass transition temperatures (T,) and mechanics performances were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and universal tester, respectively. DSC results indicated that REACs had homogeneous phase structures, and their T. were lower than room temperature. Large elongation at break (epsilon(b)), as high as 150-286%, and atypical yielding behaviors similar to so-called "hard elastic" thermoplastics were observed simultaneously for the first time as to thermosetting epoxy composites at room temperature. The striking characteristics of REACs were ascribed to the formation of unique asphalt-filled bimodal networks, consisting of simultaneous cured maleated asphalt short-chain and dicarboxylic acid long-chain interpenetrating bimodal networks and wherewith filled unmaleated asphalt. The experimental results suggest that these inexpensive REACs may find promising applications in many engineering fields. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym Sci 116: 1678-1685, 2010

AB The sources of iron blanks in liquid chromatography and interactions of these blanks with injected samples were investigated. The main sources of the blanks are the chemicals used and the chromatographic equipment. Even so-called ''metal-free'' systems contain iron blanks in the low-ng range, which can be a source of error in speciation analysis of iron. The effects induced by iron blanks include the formation of additional peaks (positive and negative) and changes in the recovery of injected species. Especially free ligands, which are present in the sample, interact strongly with blanks. The mechanism of interaction of blanks with injected species was investigated in some detail using organic acids as complexing agents for Fe(II), Fe(III) or both. The experimental results were compared with computer-simulated chromatograms. It is shown that the observed effects can be explained by using a model based on chemical equilibria in the stationary and mobile phases.

AB Fluorescent inorganic quantum dots are highly promising for biomedical applications as sensing and imaging agents. However, the low internalization of the quantum dots, as well as for most of the nanoparticles, by living cells is a critical issue which should be solved for success in translational research. In order to increase the internalization rate of inorganic CdSe/ZnS quantum dots, they were functionalized with a fluorinated organic ligand. The fluorinated quantum dots displayed an enhanced surface activity, leading to a significant cell uptake as demonstrated by in vitro experiments with HeLa cells. We combined the experimental and computational results of Langmuir monolayers of the DPPC phospholipid as a model cell membrane with in vitro experiments for analyzing the mechanism of internalization of the fluorinated CdSe/ZnS quantum dots. Surface pressure-molecular area isotherms suggested that the physical state of the DPPC molecules was greatly affected by the quantum dots. UV-vis reflection spectroscopy and Brewster Angle Microscopy as in situ experimental techniques further confirmed the significant surface concentration of quantum dots. The disruption of the ordering of the DPPC molecules was assessed. Computer simulations offered detailed insights in the interaction between the quantum dots and the phospholipid, pointing to a significant modification of the physical state of the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid molecules. This phenomenon appeared as the most relevant step in the internalization mechanism of the fluorinated quantum dots by cells. Thus, this work sheds light on the role of fluorine on the surface of inorganic nanoparticles for enhancing their cellular uptake.

AB This paper aims at investigating the interplay between inequality, innovation dynamics, and investment behaviors in shaping the long-run patterns of growth of a closed economy. By extending the analysis proposed in Caiani et al. [(2018) Journal of Evolutionary Economics], we explore the effects of alternative wage regimes under different investment and technological change scenarios. Experimental results seem to de-emphasize the role of technological progress as a possible source of greater inequality. Overall, simulation results are consistent with the predominance of a wage-led growth regime in most of the scenarios analyzed: A faster growth of low- and middle-level workers' wages, relative to managers', generally exert beneficial effects on the economy and allows to counteract the labor-saving effects of technological progress. Furthermore, a distribution more favorable to workers does not compromise firms' profitability, but rather strengthen it by creating a more favorable macroeconomic environment, which encourages further innovations, stimulates investment, and sustains economic growth.

AB In this work, a generic model describing the dynamic adsorption behaviour of proteins on membrane adsorbers over complete purification cycles under consideration of module geometry and of the interaction between multiple transport mechanisms is developed.
   A general rate model for membrane adsorption, in which the interaction between multiple phenomena, like mass transfer and adsorption kinetics are considered, is formulated. Hereby, the implemented isotherms describe the influence of eluting agents on the adsorption behaviour, so that complete purification cycle (loading, washing and elution operation) can be simulated.
   Using the developed model the theoretical influence of relevant transport phenomena, operating conditions and process scale on affinity and ion exchange membrane adsorption of proteins are investigated. An example on ion exchange membrane adsorption illustrates the possibility to predict scale up effects occurring in configurations of multiple membrane adsorber modules. The obtained simulation results are in accordance with experimental observations reported in literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Many infectious diseases arise from co-infections or re-infections with more than one genotype of the same pathogen. These mixed infections could alter host fitness, the severity of symptoms, success in pathogen transmission and the epidemiology of the disease. Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, exhibits a high biological variability often correlated with its genetic diversity. Here, we developed an experimental approach in order to evaluate biological interaction between three T. cruzi isolates belonging to different Discrete Typing Units (DTUs TcIII, TcV and TcVI). These isolates were obtained from a restricted geographical area in the Chaco Region. Different mixed infections involving combinations of two isolates (TcIII + TcV, TcIII + TcVI and TcV + TcVI) were studied in a mouse model. The parameters evaluated were number of parasites circulating in peripheral blood, histopathology and genetic characterization of each DTU in different tissues by DNA hybridization probes. We found a predominance of TcVI isolate in blood and tissues respect to TcIII and TcV; and a decrease of the inflammatory response in heart when the damage of mice infected with TcVI and TcIII + TcVI mixture were compared. In addition, simultaneous presence of two isolates in the same tissue was not detected. Our results show that biological interactions between isolates with different biological behaviors lead to changes in their biological properties. The occurrence of interactions among different genotypes of T. cruzi observed in our mouse model suggests that these phenomena could also occur in natural cycles in the Chaco Region.

SO AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF ADULT LEARNING
LA English
DT Article
DE adult literacy; transformative teaching and learning; dialogical care
ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Drawing on a research project: 'FE in England - Transforming lives and communities' (sponsored by the University and College Union) to explore the intersection between women, literacy and adult education, this paper argues for the place of research in affirming localised understandings of education that cut across the grain of contemporary educational reform. In the context of the increasing dominance of a 'skills' discourse in education in the UK and reductions in funding targeted at adult education, this research project exposed how further education can still challenge and address hurt and often spoiled learning identities and counteract the objectification of the skills discourse through creating catalysing bridging bonds of care. The research data illustrate that further education offers organic transformative tools for consciousness-raising (Freire, 1995) and a caring space where hope can act as a change agent that fuels women learners' lives and teachers' practice (Duckworth, 2013; Duckworth & Smith, 2017, 2018b).
   To support the discussion, our paper draws on a range of learners and teachers' narratives to expand on the conceptualisation of adult education as a bridging space for a curriculum informed by an ethic of what we term dialogic caring. We also develop a theoretical position that anchors the research in learners and practitioners' experience as an empirical antidote to the simulations (Baudrillard, 1994; Lefebvre, 2004) conjured up by the decontextualised knowledge production activities that marketisation has imposed on educational institutions. We position education research as having an important role to play in revealing powerful often hidden social practices and lived human experience beneath the neoliberal, globalised 'grand narratives' of international competition. To that end, we mobilise the term transformative teaching and learning to signify educational experiences that are not only student-centred, but which defy, counteract and work against the neoliberal educational imaginary. We align our research approach with adult literacy education and critical pedagogy as working towards social justice and against deficit generating educational structures that marginalise women, their families and communities.

DT Article
DE Vaccination; Sociocentric networks; Agent-based models
ID INFLUENZA VACCINATION; SOCIAL NETWORKS
AB Background: Network-based interventions against epidemic spread are most powerful when the full network structure is known. However, in practice, resource constraints require decisions to be made based on partial network information. We investigated how the accuracy of network data available at individual and village levels affected network-based vaccination effectiveness.
   Methods: We simulated a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered process on static empirical social networks from 75 rural Indian villages. First, we used regression analysis to predict the percentage of individuals ever infected (cumulative incidence) based on village-level network properties for simulated datasets from 10 representative villages. Second, we simulated vaccinating 10% of each of the 75 empirical village networks at baseline, selecting vaccinees through one of five network-based approaches: random individuals (Random); random contacts of random individuals (Nomination); random high-degree individuals (High Degree); highest degree individuals (Highest Degree); or most central individuals (Central). The first three approaches require only sample data; the latter two require full network data. We also simulated imposing a limit on how many contacts an individual can nominate (Fixed Choice Design, FCD), which reduces the data collection burden but generates only partially observed networks.
   Results: In regression analysis, we found mean and standard deviation of the degree distribution to strongly predict cumulative incidence. In simulations, the Nomination method reduced cumulative incidence by one-sixth compared to Random vaccination; full network methods reduced infection by two-thirds. The High Degree approach had intermediate effectiveness. Somewhat surprisingly, FCD truncating individuals' degrees at three was as effective as using complete networks.
   Conclusions:Using even partial network information to prioritize vaccines at either the village or individual level, i.e. determine the optimal order of communities or individuals within each village, substantially improved epidemic outcomes. Such approaches may be feasible and effective in outbreak settings, and full ascertainment of network structure may not be required.

AB Mesoscale simulation was performed to investigate the dynamical structural behavior of the pluronic P123 block copolymer in the synthesis of mesoporous SBA-15. Shear is introduced to represent stirring in the actual experiment, and a weak charge is included to simulate the acidic conditions in the synthesis. Under shear, with the increase in weak charge in the PEO [poly(ethylene oxide)] block, the template forms more ordered hexagonal phases, and the pore sizes of the cylindrical hydrophobic PPO [poly(propylene oxide)] blocks decrease. The structural factor shows three types of water molecules in the mesoscale aggregates, including bulk water in the solution, bound water around the hydrophilic PEO corona, and trapped water in the hydrophobic PPO core. When 1,3,5-trimethyl-benzene (TMB) is added to the system as a swelling agent, expanded hexagonal phases are formed, and the density mapping of TMB shows that the TMB molecules are mainly located in the hydrophobic PPO cores. In configurations with spherical micelles, although bimodally dispersed spheres are observed, the face-centered cubic (fcc) packing of the micelles hardly changes with the addition of TMB. In agreement with experimental results, the simulations show that the shear and the weak charge are essential to the formation of hexagonal templates in the copolymer.

ID STRENGTH; BEHAVIOR
AB Over the last two decades fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rods have emerged as one of the most promising and affordable solutions to the corrosion problems of steel reinforcement in structural concrete. The application of FRP rods in new or damaged structures requires the development of design equations that must take into account the mechanical properties and the durability properties of FRP products.
   Concerns still remain about the structural behavior of FRP materials under severe environmental and load conditions for longtime exposures. In the case of glass FRP rods, it is the high pH of the pore water solution created during the hydration of the concrete that may cause the chemical attack of the fibers.
   In this study, an effort was made to develop an experimental protocol to study the effects of accelerated aging on FRP rods. The physico-mechanical properties of five types of carbon and glass FRP rods were investigated. FRP specimens were subjected to alkaline simulated concrete pore solution and environmental agents including freeze-thaw, high relative humidity, high temperature and ultraviolet (UV) radiations. Mechanical and physical tests were used to measure the retained properties and to observe the causes of damage and strength reduction. The experimental data showed that resin properties may strongly influence the durability of FRP reinforcement, environmental combined cycles did not take to significant damage of conditioned rod-specimens, GFRP rods are sensitive to alkaline attack when resin does not provide adequate protection to fibers.

AB alpha, beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide was cross-linked by gamma radiations in order to obtain micromatrices capable of swelling in an aqueous medium. alpha, beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide hydrogels were loaded by a soaking method with zidovudine, a water soluble drug, and diflunisal, a poorly water soluble drug. Samples containing two different loaded drug amounts (4.76 and 16.70 % m/m) were prepared. X-ray analysis revealed that both these drugs are dispersed into alpha, beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide networks in an amorphous state. alpha, beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide hydrogels loaned with zidovudine or diflunisal were also characterized by dimensional analysis and scanning electron microscopy, which showed the presence of quasi-spherical micro particles. The zidovudine release from alpha, beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide hydrogels was studied in vitro at pH I and in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution. Experimental results indicated that zidovudine is released rapidly, regardless of the pH value or the amount of drug loaded. In vitro release tests of alpha, beta-poly(N-hydroxyethyl)-DL-aspartamide hydrogels loaded with diflunisal were performed in simulated gastro-intestinal fluids (pH 1/6.8) using the pH variation method, and in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution. Experimental data indicated that, particularly at a low pH, the delivery of diflunisal is more prolonged than that of zidovudine.

AB Under insonation contrast agents are known to perform nonlinear pulsations and deform statically, in the form of buckling, or dynamically via parametric mode excitation, and often exhibit jetting and break-up like bubbles without coating. Boundary element simulations are performed in the context of axisymmetry in order to establish the nonlinear evolution of these patterns. The viscoelastic stresses that develop on the coating form the dominant force balance tangentially to the shell-liquid interface, whereas the dynamic overpressure across the shell balances viscoelastic stresses in the normal direction. Strain softening and strain hardening behavior is studied in the presence of shape instabilities for various initial conditions. Simulations recover the pattern of static buckling, subharmonic/harmonic excitation, and dynamic buckling predicted by linear stability. Preferential mode excitation during compression is obtained supercritically for strain softening phospholipid shells while the shell regains its sphericity at expansion. It is a result of energy transfer between the emerging unstable modes and the radial mode, eventually leading to saturated oscillations of shape modes accompanied by asymmetric radial pulsations in favor of compression. Strain softening shells are more prone to sustain saturated pulsations due to the mechanical behavior of the shell. As the sound amplitude increases and before the onset of dynamic buckling, both types of shells exhibit transient break-up via unbalanced growth of a number of unstable shape modes. The effect of pre-stress in lowering the amplitude threshold for shape mode excitation is captured numerically and compared against the predictions of linear stability analysis. The amplitude interval for which sustained shape oscillations are obtained is extended, in the presence of pre-stress, by switching from a strain softening constitutive law to a strain hardening one once the shell curvature increases beyond a certain level. This type of mechanical behavior models the formation of lipid bilayer structures on the shell beyond a certain level of bending, as a result of a lipid monolayer folding transition. In this context a compression only type behavior is obtained in the simulations, which is accompanied by preferential shape deformation during compression at relatively small sound amplitudes in a manner that bears significance on the interpretation of available experimental observations exhibiting similar dynamic behavior.

AB Optimizing the heating properties of magnetic nanoparticles is of great importance for hyperthermia applications. Recent experimental results show that core/shell nanoparticles could give an increased specific absorption rate (SAR) compared to the magnetic oxide nanoparticles currently used. We have developed a modified phenomenological model based on the linear Neel-Brown relaxation model to calculate the SAR due to susceptibility losses in complex nanoparticles with ferromagnetic (FM) core/ferrimagnetic (FiM) shell morphology. We use the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation technique with the implementation of the Metropolis algorithm to investigate the effect of size and shape on the magnetisation behaviour of complex ferromagnetic/ferrimagnetic nanoparticles covered by a surfactant layer. The findings of our simulations are used as an input in our modified model for the calculation of the SAR. Our calculations show that for all the sizes and shapes the complex FM/FiM nanoparticles give higher SAR values than the pure ferrimagnetic ones due to their higher core saturation magnetisation. For all sizes the nanoparticles with the truncated cuboctahedral shape give the highest SAR values and the cubic ones the lowest ones. The decrease in the surfactant thickness results in an increase of the SAR values. Our results have the same characteristics as the available experimental data from Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles, confirming that the complex nanoparticles with core/shell morphology can optimise the heating properties for hyperthermia.

AB Complexation kinetics of the europium(III)-H(5)do3ap complex (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic-10-(methylphosphonic acid)) was studied at 25 degrees C and I= 0.1 M KCI and compared with the analogous H(4)dota-like ligands. The mechanism of the formation reactions between the europium(III) ion and H(3)do3a, H(4)dota and H(4)dota analogs having one methylphosphonic (H(5)do3ap) or phosphinic acid pendant arms with a propionate side chain (H5do3ap P,A) was proposed on the basis of TRLIFS measurements. The experimental data of the dissociation kinetics of the europium(III) complexes with H(5)do3ap and H(5)do3ap(PrA) ligands show that there is no change in reactivity of the complexes due to the side chain of the phosphinic acid bifunctional chelate. The TRLIFS study of the proton-assisted decomplexation reaction of the europium(III) complexes with H(3)do3a, H4dota, H5do3ap and H(5)do3ap PrA demonstrates different behaviour influenced by a change in the number of water molecules during the reaction. The advantages and disadvantages of the TRLIFS methodology as a new experimental technique for simultaneous evaluation of kinetics and reaction mechanisms are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-dodecanoylthiourea (Cl-DPTU) surfactant modified GCE (Cl-DPTU/GCE) was developed for the selective and sensitive simultaneous detection of six metal ions. The as developed electrochemical sensing platform was characterized using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronocoulometry to determine the charge transfer characteristics. The charge transfer behavior of bare GCE and Cl-DPTU/GCE was compared and the results revealed the modifier to significantly improve the charge transduction between the redox probe and transducer. The square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was then performed to investigate the electrochemical catalytic activity of the modifier. The sensing limits of Cl-DPTU/GCE under optimized experimental conditions for Cd2+, Cu2+, Hg (2+), Pb2+, Zn2+, and Sr2+ ions were obtained as 6.45 nM, 7.85 nM, 9.15 nM, 11.0 nM, 16.9 nM, and 178.8 nM respectively. The selectivity of Cl-DPTU/GCE was examined from the influence of interfering agents on the signals of the targeted metal ions. Likewise, the applicability of the SWASV was checked in real water samples. Interestingly the recovery percentages of nearly 100% for all water samples evidenced authenticity of Cl-DPTU/GCE for multiple metal ions determination in real water samples. Moreover, computational studies were performed and the computed parameters supported the experimental results. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In China, many oilfields with low permeability and heterogeneity have entered the secondary oil recovery stage, in which more oil displacement agents for expanding sweep volume has become a key technology. A water-gas dispersion flooding system is reasonably proposed to change the seepage resistance and adjust the mobility ratio. In this FOR technique, the generation of micron-sized bubbles in the low-permeability reservoir is of considerable interest. In this study, a visual device by using an orifice spraying method was designed to simulate reservoir conditions with high temperature and high pressure, and efficiently to produce more microbubbles. Based on the orifice spraying method, the morphological characteristics of microbubbles generated by different orifice plate materials were compared, which provided the choice of the microbubbles generation by the orifice spraying method for laboratory experiments. Besides, the influence of different factors on the quantity and size of microbubbles produced by a single orifice plate was presented in detail. The experimental results showed that the diameter of the microbubbles generated by the orifice spraying method under a hypothetic reservoir condition was about 10-100 mu m. These visual experimental devices were practically designed to meet the demand of the micron-level pores and throats to enhance oil recovery in low-permeability reservoirs. This investigation of microbubbles generation provided the basic research means for further preparation of a water-gas dispersion flooding system.

Copper has been recognized to act as a catalyst in the process, and ammonia to stabilize the system. However, discrepancies exist in the literature concerning the oxidizing agent and, specifically in the case of silver sulfide (argentite), whether the leaching is oxidative or by substitution. The distinct mechanisms have implications concerning the feasibility of the process. The present study elucidates the chemistry of the leach through calculation of the species distribution and experiments on pure phase argentite, and also determines the role of the ammonia/thiosulfate concentration ratio. The experimental results on the pure phase show that the cupric ion reacts with thiosulfate to form the tetrathionate ion and a cuprous thiosulfate or ammonia complex, which liberates the silver by substitution in the solid phase. The results of leaching studies from a mineral concentrate indicate that, in addition to the cuprous ion concentration, the ammonia/thiosulfate ratio influences the silver extraction velocity: silver solubility and extraction are favored at low values of this quantity. A mathematical model for silver leaching in this system, which considers redox and complex equilibria, was developed. The experimental extractions were similar to those predicted by the model for low ammonia concentrations. Divergence from the simulated behavior was probably due to the slow reduction of the cupric ion at the high ammonia concentration (I M). (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The mechanism of the oxidation of 2-mercapto-5-methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole (McMT) to its disulfide dimer and its subsequent reduction has been examined with a combined approach employing experimental data and digital simulation. In order to elucidate the influence of proton transfers on these redox processes, special attention has been paid to the influence of various bases, including triethylamine, pyridine, 3-chloropyridine, lutidine and 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, and proton donors, including methanesulfonic acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, on both the oxidation and reduction reactions. On the basis of detailed comparisons of the experimental data with simulations of several mechanistic models, it is found that proton transfer pathways have a pronounced influence on both the oxidative and reductive pathways. In particular, McMT oxidation is facilitated by a rapid bimolecular proton transfer from McMT to weak bases such as Py that produces McMT(-), the thiolate form, which is then oxidized. There is no such facilitation in the presence of the sterically hindered base 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine, suggesting that the facilitation occurs through the formation of a discrete hydrogen-bonded complex. The overall kinetic scheme by which these redox processes proceed both in the presence and absence of proton transfer agents is discussed, especially with regard to the potential use of a related dithiolate compound as a cathode material in Li secondary batteries.

AB We explore the role that the obstacle position plays in the evacuation time of agents when leaving a room. To this end, we simulate a system of nonsymmetric spherocylinders that have a prescribed desired velocity and angular orientation. In this way, we reproduce the nonmonotonous dependence of the pedestrian flow rate on the obstacle distance to the door. For short distances, the obstacle delays the evacuation because the exit size is effectively reduced; i.e., the distance between the obstacle and the wall is smaller than the door width. By increasing the obstacle distance to the door, clogging is reduced leading to an optimal obstacle position (maximum flow rate) in agreement with results reported in numerical simulations of pedestrian evacuations and granular flows. For further locations, however, a counterintuitive behavior occurs as the flow rate values fall again below the one corresponding to the case without obstacle. Analyzing the head-times distribution, we evidence that this new feature is not linked to the formation of clogs, but is caused by a reduction of the efficiency of the agent's instantaneous flow rate when the exit is not blocked.

AB Model simulations indicate that the response of growing cell populations on mechanical stress follows the same functional relationship and is predictable over different cell lines and growth conditions despite the response curves look largely different. We develop a hybrid model strategy in which cells are represented by coarse-grained individual units calibrated with a high resolution cell model and parameterized measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters. Cell cycle progression in our model is controlled by volumetric strain, the latter being derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After parameter calibration from experiments with mouse colon carcinoma cells growing against the resistance of an elastic alginate capsule, the model adequately predicts the growth curve in i) soft and rigid capsules, ii) in different experimental conditions where the mechanical stress is generated by osmosis via a high molecular weight dextran solution, and iii) for other cell types with different growth kinetics. Our model simulation results suggest that the growth response of cell population upon externally applied mechanical stress is the same, as it can be quantitatively predicted using the same growth progression function.
   Author summary The effect of mechanical resistance on the growth of tumor cells remains today largely unquantified. We studied data from two different experimental setups that monitor the growth of tumor cells under mechanical compression. The existing data in the first experiment examined growing CT26 cells in an elastic permeable capsule. In the second experiment, growth of tumor cells under osmotic stress of the same cell line as well as other cell lines were studied. We have developed an agent-based model with measurable biophysical and cell-biological parameters that can simulate both experiments. Cell cycle progression in our model is a Hill-type function of cell volumetric strain, derived from a bio-mechanical relation between applied pressure and cell compressibility. After calibration of the model parameters within the data of the first experiment, we are able predict the growth rates in the second experiment. We show that that the growth response of cell populations upon externally applied mechanical stress in the two different experiments and over different cell lines can be predicted using the same growth progression function once the growth kinetics of the cell lines in abscence of mechanical stress is known.

   simulations; finite difference method
AB We consider a class of mean field games in which the agents interact through both their states and controls, and we focus on situations in which a generic agent tries to adjust her speed (control) to an average speed (the average is made in a neighborhood in the state space). In such cases, the monotonicity assumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not hold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems of forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are supplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular Neumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the underlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with numerical approximations of the above megntioned systems. After describing the finite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the systems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines a continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like solver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make experiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of the model vary.

AB Graphene nanoscrolls (GNS), due to their remarkably interesting properties, have attracted significant interest with applications in various engineering sectors. However, uncontrolled morphologies, poor yield and low quality GNS produced through traditional routes are major challenges associated. We demonstrate sustainable approach of utilizing bio-derived cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as template for fabrication of GNS with tunable morphological dimensions ranging from micron-tonanoscale(controlled length < 1 mu m or > 1 mu m), alongwith encapsulation of catalytically active metallic-species in scroll interlayers. The surface-modified magnetic CNCs acts as structural-directing agents which provides enough momentum to initiate self-scrolling phenomenon of graphene through van der Waals forces and p-p interactions, mechanism of which is demonstrated through experimental and molecular simulation studies. The proposed approach of GNS fabrication provides flexibility to tune physico-chemical properties of GNS by simply varying interlayer spacing, scrolling density and fraction of encapsulated metallic nanoparticles. The hybrid GNS with confined palladium or platinum nanoparticles (at lower loading similar to 1 wt.%) shows enhanced hydrogen storage capacity (similar to 0.2 wt.% at similar to 20 bar and similar to 273 K) and excellent supercapacitance behavior (similar to 223-357 F/g) for prolonged cycles (retention similar to 93.5-96.4% at similar to 10000 cycles). The current strategy of utilizing bio-based templates can be further extended to incorporate complex architectures or nanomaterials in GNS core or inter-layers, which will potentially broaden its applications in fabrication of high-performance devices.

AB Reputation can promote cooperation in public goods game and player's cooperative behavior is not pure economical rationality, but habituation would influence their behaviors as well. One's habituation can be formed by repeated behaviors in daily life and be affected by habitual preference. We aim to investigate the sustainable cooperation based on reputation and habit formation. To better investigate the impacts of reputation and habitual preference on the evolution and sustainability of cooperation. We introduce three types of agents into our spatial public goods game. Through numerical simulations, we find that the larger habitual preference make cooperation easier to emerge and maintain. Additionally, we find that a moderate number of agents who want to obtain more reputation (ICs) are best for the sustainability of cooperation. Finally, we observe that the variation of donations of ICs can influence greatly on the equilibrium of public goods game. When ICs reduce their donations, a proper contribution will be better to maintain the cooperative behaviors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Within a continuous-time framework, this paper proposes a stochastic heterogeneous agent model (HAM) of financial markets with time delays to unify various moving average rules used in discrete-time HAMs. The time delay represents a memory length of a moving average rule in discrete-time HAMs. Intuitive conditions for the stability of the fundamental price of the deterministic model in terms of agents' behavior parameters and memory length are obtained. It is found that an increase in memory length not only can destabilize the market price, resulting in oscillatory market price characterized by a Hopf bifurcation, but also can stabilize an otherwise unstable market price, leading to stability switching as the memory length increases. Numerical simulations show that the stochastic model is able to characterize long deviations of the market price from its fundamental price and excess volatility and generate most of the stylized facts observed in financial markets.

AB The practice of numerical simulation of flows and other processes occurring in water has now matured into an established and efficient part of hydraulics. At the same time, however, the models themselves often become very extended. In many situations, given the divergence between the response-time requirements and the computational-time requirements of numerical models, the need arises to reduce the time needed to simulate the impact of given input events on hydraulics systems. In this study the possibility of using systems composed of agents consisting only of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as modelling tools for the simulation of tidal flow in a two-dimensional flow field is investigated. In particular this involves the modelling of a process that evolves in time and the ANNs themselves function as non-linear dynamic systems that effectively reproduce the behaviour of the fluid at any one place and any one time from the behavior at other places at earlier times. Different types of ANN-agent architectures are investigated in order to asses their ability and relative performance in encapsulating the site-specific knowledge and data necessary to reproduce the temporal sequence of states observed in a modelled area.

AB The influences of various factors including concentration of solvent, operation temperature, gas flow rate, CO2 loading on foaming tendency of UDS solvent were experimentally investigated under simulated conditions. Foaming tendency test was combined with physical characterization to enhance the understanding of the foaming behavior. It was indicated that the foam height kept increasing while the foam breaking time first rose and then dropped as gas flow rate increased. Foaming tendency increased and eventually decreased with UDS concentration. Moreover, an increase in CO2 loading enhanced foaming tendency. Meanwhile, lower solution temperature resulted in larger foam height and longer breaking time. Surface tension, viscosity, and density of solutions played complex roles in determining foaming tendency and foam stability. A semi-empirical model considering gravitational force, viscous force and surface tension force was found to be able to explain the parametric effects on the foaming of UDS solution and predict its foaming behavior very well. Finally, defoaming agent DF-C was observed to improve the foaming control of UDS system to a satisfactory level. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The use of nonlinear dynamic models in economics and finance has expanded rapidly in the last two decades. Numerical simulation is crucial in the investigation of nonlinear systems. E&F Chaos is an easy-to-use and freely available software package for simulation of nonlinear dynamic models to investigate stability of steady states and the presence of periodic orbits and chaos by standard numerical simulation techniques such as time series, phase plots, bifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponent plots, basin boundary plots and graphical analysis. The package contains many well-known nonlinear models, including applications in economics and finance, and is easy to use for non-specialists. New models and extensions or variations are easy to implement within the software package without the use of a compiler or other software. The software is demonstrated by investigating the dynamical behavior of some simple examples of the familiar cobweb model, including an extension with heterogeneous agents and asynchronous updating of strategies. Simulations with the E&F Chaos software quickly provide information about local and global dynamics and easily lead to challenging questions for further mathematical analysis.

AB To solve information asymmetry, we adopted the principal-agent framework to design the incentive mechanisms between the remanufacturer and the collector in the construction and demolition (C&D) waste-recycling industry. By using the model of reciprocity, we analyzed how the entities' behavioral motives affect their decisions in terms of the incentive mechanisms. The findings showed that the collector responds to their perception of the remanufacturer's intentions. If the perception is positive, they will make more effort in the collection work. If not, less effort will be put forth. Most importantly, we found that reciprocity helps to save the remanufacturer cost in the incentive mechanisms and makes the collector choose a higher effort level in the collection work. This finding showed that reciprocity serves to solve information asymmetry. By conducting a numerical simulation, we found that although a high subsidy policy can achieve rapid improvement of recycling-supply-chain performance, it is inefficient in maintaining friendly cooperation between the remanufacturer and the collector.

AB The present paper renders amodeling and a 2D numerical simulation for the removal of CO2 from CO2/CH4 gaseous stream utilizing sodium hydroxide (NaOH), monoethanolamine (MEA) and triethanolamine (TEA) liquid absorbents inside the hollow fiber membrane contactor. Counter-current arrangement of absorbing agents and CO2/CH4 gaseous mixture flows are implemented in the modeling and numerical simulation. Non-wetting and partial wetting modes of operation are considered where in the partial wetting mode, CO2/CH4 gaseous mixture and liquid absorbents fill the membrane pores. The deteriorated removal of CO2 in the partial wetting mode of operation is mainly due to the mass transfer resistance imposed by the liquid in the pores of membrane. The validation of numerical simulation is done based on the comparison of simulation results of CO2 removal using NaOH and experimental data under non-wetting mode of operation. The comparison illustrates a desirable agreement with an average deviation of less than 5%. According to the results, MEA provides higher efficiency for CO2 removal in comparison with the other liquid absorbents. The order for CO2 removal performance is MEA > NaOH > TEA. The influence of non-wetting and partial wetting modes of operation on CO2 removal are evaluated in this article as one of the novelties. Besides, the percentage of CO2 sequestration as a function of gas velocity for various percentages of membrane pores wetting ranging from 0 (non-wetting mode of operation) to 100% (complete wetting mode of operation) is studied in this research paper, which can be proposed as the other novelty. The results indicate that increase in some operational parameters such as module length, membrane porosity and absorbents concentration encourage the removal percentage of CO2 from CO2/CH4 gaseous mixture while increasing in membrane tortuosity, gas velocity and initial CO2 concentration has unfavorable influence on the separation efficiency of CO2.

AB BACKGROUND: Livestock operations are under increasing pressure to fulfil minimum environmental requirements and avoid polluting the atmosphere. In regions with high farm animal densities, new farm buildings receive building permission only when biological exhaust air treatment systems (BEATS) are in place, such as biofilters. However, it is currently unknown whether BEATS can harbour pathogens such as zoonotic agents, which are potentially emitted via the purified gas. Because BEATS are located very close to the livestock building, it is assumed that BEATS-related microorganisms are aerially transported to farm animals via the inlet system of the ventilation system. To support this hypothesis, a computer simulation was applied to calculate the wind field around a facility consisting of a virtual livestock house and an adjacent biofilter.
   RESULTS: Under the chosen wind conditions (speed and direction), it can be shown that turbulences and eddies may occur in the near surrounding of a livestock building with an adjacent biofilter. Consequently, this might cause the entry of the released biofilter's purified gas into the barn, including possible microorganisms within this purified gas.
   CONCLUSIONS: If field investigations verify the results of the simulations, counter-measures must be taken to ensure biosecurity on farms with BEATS. (C) 2013 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Behavioral theory explains that organizational change is prompted by performance relative to a firm-specific aspiration. Although this explanation has been empirically confirmed, it has not been tested comparatively alongside other explanations, most notably rational choice. This lack of comparative study implies that prior research may be committing Type I errors-confirming aspiration-level decision making when it is not actually occurring. This paper contributes to behavioral theory in two specific ways. First, we show that several foundational studies purporting to provide empirical support for aspiration-level decision making may actually represent maximizing behavior. To consider this potential, we simulate a sample of subjectively rational agents who choose strategies by maximizing expectations. We show that it is possible and highly probable to diagnose satisficing when agents are, in fact, maximizing. Second, we develop and implement recommendations for comparative testing to demonstrate reliability. Analysis shows that the recommendations are effective at reducing Type I and II errors for both behavioral theory and rational choice. This paper is meant to inspire the design of future studies on aspirations and, indeed, all studies of organizational change.

AB Aiming at improving the quality of syngas, the thermochemical behavior of syngas formation during a single coal particle gasification process is investigated based on a validated numerical model. Initially, simulations of coal gasification with steam (H2O) are conducted in a reactor, and the results show that the steam gasification generally favors the production of H-2 and CH4. However, the switch of agent to CO2 into the gasifier influences the gasification products having H-2, CO, and CH4. This then prompts the investigation of a mixture of H2O and CO2 agent in the reactor's environment, and the results show a promising indicator in producing an overall better syngas quality. Moreover, the influence of the coal particle size and gasification temperature on the syngas production is studied. The results identify that the concentration of syngas products is higher when using smaller coal particles as the behavior of heterogeneous reactions of CO formation is affected by the particle size. Finally, high temperature promotes the chemical reactions of the gasification process, resulting in the improved production of syngas.

AB The inland waterway transportation system of the United States links its inland ports with the rest of the world by providing a cost-effective, fuel-efficient, and environmentally friendly mode of freight transportation. For this research study, a maritime transportation simulator (MarTranS) that integrates agent-based modeling, discrete-event simulation, system dynamics, and multiregional input-output analysis was developed to elucidate the relationships between inland waterway transportation system components and their associated economic impacts. An improved understanding of these relationships is critical to the assessment of risk reduction within the system, decisions concerning investment in support infrastructure, and future economic impacts. It is hypothesized that failure to invest in future improvements to the infrastructure that supports the inland waterway transportation system will have negative long-term economic consequences. While the performance of the MarTranS is demonstrated through a case study of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, the work is generalizable to other segments of the inland waterway transportation system and can enable maritime transportation stakeholders to better allocate investment budgets and increase the economic benefits of waterway transportation systems.

AB In attempt to reproduce price dynamics of financial markets, a stochastic agent-based financial price model is proposed and investigated by stochastic exclusion process. The exclusion process, one of interacting particle systems, is usually thought of as modeling particle motion (with the conserved number of particles) in a continuous time Markov process. In this work, the process is utilized to imitate the trading interactions among the investing agents, in order to explain some stylized facts found in financial time series dynamics. To better understand the correlation behaviors of the proposed model, a new time-dependent intrinsic detrended cross-correlation (TDI-DCC) is introduced and performed, also, the autocorrelation analyses are applied in the empirical research. Furthermore, to verify the rationality of the financial price model, the actual return series are also considered to be comparatively studied with the simulation ones. The comparison results of return behaviors reveal that this financial price dynamics model can reproduce some correlation features of actual stock markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We named this rCBF measurement technique utilizing the early data points of the Gd-DTPA bolus the "early time points" method (Er). based on the hypothesis that early time point signals were proportional to rCBF. Simulation data were used successfully to examine the ideal behavior of ET while monkey's MRI results offered encouraging support to the utility of ET for rCBF calculation. A better brain coverage for ET could be obtained by applying the Simultaneous Echo Refocusing (SER) EPI technique. A recipe to run ET was presented, with attention paid to the noise problem around the time of arrival (TOA) of the contrast agent. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The initial step in preventing biomaterial-associated infections consists of preventing bacterial adhesion to the device surface. One possible approach is the design of antibiotic-releasing biomaterials. Cellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes with the antibiotic imipenem (IPM) entrapped (CTA-IPM) were prepared. The material was characterised in terms of surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy, surface free energy of interaction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Antibiotic release studies were also performed. In vitro adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A to CTA-IPM was investigated using a modified microtitre plate assay, and the antibacterial activity of the CTA-IPM membrane was assessed by a modified Kirby-Bauer test, which showed effective entrapment of the antibiotic as confirmed by XPS and hydrophilicity assays. Release studies showed that this drug-polymer conjugate serves as an adequate reservoir for sustained release of IPM over a period of 71 h at an effective bacteriostatic concentration. Moreover, bacterial adhesion tests showed a statistically significant decrease in the adhesion of S. epidermidis RP62A to CTA-IPM compared with its adhesion to CTA alone. The present innovative approach is capable of providing a membrane with anti-adhesive and antiproliferative properties, thus encouraging in vivo studies to provide a better simulation of the clinical situation.

AB Microstructural properties of extracellular matrix (ECM) promote cell and tissue homeostasis as well as contribute to the formation and progression of disease. In order to understand how microstructural properties influence the mechanical properties and traction force-induced remodeling of ECM, we developed an agent-based model that incorporates repetitively applied traction force within a discrete fiber network. An important difference between our model and similar finite element models is that by implementing more biologically realistic dynamic traction, we can explore a greater range of matrix remodeling. Here, we validated our model by reproducing qualitative trends observed in three sets of experimental data reported by others: tensile and shear testing of cell-free collagen gels, collagen remodeling around a single isolated cell, and collagen remodeling between pairs of cells. In response to tensile and shear strain, simulated acellular networks with straight fibrils exhibited biphasic stress-strain curves indicative of strain-stiffening. When fibril curvature was introduced, stress-strain curves shifted to the right, delaying the onset of strain-stiffening. Our data support the notion that strain-stiffening might occur as individual fibrils successively align along the axis of strain and become engaged in tension. In simulations with a single, contractile cell, peak collagen displacement occurred closest to the cell and decreased with increasing distance. In simulations with two cells, compaction of collagen between cells appeared inversely related to the initial distance between cells. These results for cell-populated collagen networks match in vitro findings. A demonstrable benefit of modeling is that it allows for further analysis not feasible with experimentation. Within two-cell simulations, strain energy within the collagen network measured from the final state was relatively uniform around the outer surface of cells separated by 250 mu m, but became increasingly nonuniform as the distance between cells decreased. For cells separated by 75 and 100 mu m, strain energy peaked in the direction toward the other cell in the region in which fibrils become highly aligned and reached a minimum adjacent to this region, not on the opposite side of the cell as might be expected. This pattern of strain energy was partly attributable to the pattern of collagen compaction, but was still present when mapping strain energy divided by collagen density. Findings like these are of interest because fibril alignment, density, and strain energy may each contribute to contact guidance during tissue morphogenesis.

DE Climatic change; Agent-based model; Late Bronze Age; Crisis; Sea Peoples
AB The Late Bronze Age crisis has traditionally been considered a turning point in the recent prehistory of the eastern Mediterranean. Between the 13th and 11th centuries B.C., the Aegean area experienced a dramatic reduction in the annual precipitation, the destruction or shrinkage of a large number of urban centres, critical demographic constrictions, an increase in struggles, and changes in settlement patterns. Various hypotheses have been proposed to explain these transformations; however, very few studies have explicitly examined the complex and dynamic set of relationships between the parameters that contributed to this crisis. In this study, we use an agent-based model to explore how (a) aridity, (b) rainfall variability, (c) intensity of raiding, (d) soil erosion and (e) dietary reliance on agriculture could have influenced (a) the human pressure for cultivable lands, (b) demographic behaviour, (c) settlement patterns, (d) commercial networks and (e) migrations. Outputs obtained from the simulations are consistent with the archaeological record and suggest that soil degradation, rainfall variability and dietary reliance on agriculture could have amplified the socio-ecological effects of the climatic change in the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age.

ID IMPEDANCE CONTROL
AB Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been proven successful in solving manipulation tasks autonomously. However, RL is still not widely adopted on real robotic systems because working with real hardware entails additional challenges, especially when using rigid position-controlled manipulators. These challenges include the need for a robust controller to avoid undesired behavior, that risk damaging the robot and its environment, and constant supervision from a human operator. The main contributions of this work are, first, we proposed a learning-based force control framework combining RL techniques with traditional force control. Within said control scheme, we implemented two different conventional approaches to achieve force control with position-controlled robots; one is a modified parallel position/force control, and the other is an admittance control. Secondly, we empirically study both control schemes when used as the action space of the RL agent. Thirdly, we developed a fail-safe mechanism for safely training an RL agent on manipulation tasks using a real rigid robot manipulator. The proposed methods are validated both on simulation and a real robot with an UR3 e-series robotic arm.

AB Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can cause severe liver cirrhosis, for which liver transplantation is the only therapy. To prevent organ rejection, transplanted patients are treated with immunosuppressive agents. We describe two transplanted patients treated with tacrolimus who were simultaneously treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for their chronic HCV infection. No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) were expected between tacrolimus and the selected DAAs. However, in both patients, tacrolimus plasma concentrations decreased during HCV treatment. We hypothesise that decreased plasma concentrations were not caused by a DDI but were an indirect result of the clearance of the HCV infection. During chronic HCV infection, pro-inflammatory cytokines may inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which are primarily responsible for tacrolimus metabolism. If this is true, then with clearance of the virus the activity of these enzymes will normalise and tacrolimus metabolism will increase. These changes were clinically relevant because the tacrolimus dosage needed to be adjusted. Therefore, physicians should be aware that CYP substrates with narrow therapeutic ranges might require dose adaption during HCV therapy with DAAs.

AB The integrins and PI3K/Akt are important mediators of the signal transduction pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and cell survival after exposure to ionizing radiation. Selective targeting of either integrins or PI3K/Akt can radiosensitize tumors. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the combined inhibition of integrin alpha v beta 3 by cRGD and PI3K/Akt by LY294002 would significantly enhance radiation-induced inhibition of angiogenesis by vascular endothelial cells. Treatment with cRGD inhibited the adhesion and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The inhibitory effect was further increased when cRGD and LY294002 were applied simultaneously. Both radiation and cRGD induced Akt phosphorylation, up-regulated COX2 expression, and increased PGE2 production in HUVECs. Treatment with LY294002 effectively inhibited radiation- and cRGD-induced Akt phosphorylation and up-regulation of COX2 and increased apoptosis of HUVECs. The combined use of cRGD and LY294002 enhanced radiation-induced cell killing. The clonogenic survival of HIUVECs was decreased from 34% with 2 Gy radiation to 4% with these agents combined. These results demonstrate that combined use of ionizing radiation, cRGD and LY294002 inhibited multiple signaling transduction pathways involved in tumor angiogenesis and enhanced radiation-induced effects on vascular endothelial cells.

AB The increasing adoption of small-scale electricity generation technologies represents a transition from a hub-and-spoke system of centralized electricity generation to distributed energy resources (DER). Many utilities understand the benefits of DER but are unsure of how to mitigate the associated challenges, including intermittent generation, stranded assets, inability to dispatch, and an inability to control when generation is produced ("must take" energy). Using a bottom-up agent-based computational economics approach, this paper studies the evolving dynamic behaviors that influence the DER investment decisions facing the associated stakeholders. Building off the existing agent-based modeling of electricity systems (AMES) model and using a hypothetical case study in evolving actual data from Tennessee, the New England region, and some other reasonably assumed and verified parameters from the literature; the authors developed a proof-of-concept framework to account for the different system components associated with adoption of distributed solar generation (DSG). The interdependent steps included (1) incorporating different transmission and generation features from that of AMES, (2) allowing for customer electricity demand sensitivity to electricity rates, and (3) creating a new end-use customer agent type that allows for investigation of DSG investment behavior. Pursuant to a successful model testing processes including local sensitivity analysis, the model's architectural design was able to represent the generic characteristics of the DSG domain problem and its potential future application to actual utility data. To this end, the authors present a benchmark simulation that was compared with two counterfactual scenario simulations. Although the results presented in this paper are illustrative and not prescriptive (i.e., the observations and discussions from the hypothetical case study are expected to-and should-change when applied to specific utility companies), they do still highlight a number of interesting trends. First, the declining cost of solar has not yet had a statistically significant impact on customer demand in six of the model's largest utilities. Second, decreased load demand due to adoption of DSG technologies will have a large impact on high-cost generating units in the model but may have little impact on the lowest-cost generating units. Third, transmission line constraints matter. Despite the promising results, the model still needs more refinements to completely capture the feedback between customer adoption of DSG and utility investments in new generation resources and transmission assets. When complete, this research will result in a decision-support tool that will identify least-cost strategies that utility companies can use to respond to increasing penetration of DER.

   the majority-vote model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID SZNAJD MODEL; OPINION; SOCIOPHYSICS; EVOLUTION; DYNAMICS; MOBILITY
AB In this work we study a modified version of the majority-vote model with noise. In particular, we consider a random diluted square lattice wherein a site is empty with a probability r. In order to analyze the critical behavior of the model, we perform Monte Carlo simulations on lattices with linear sizes up to L = 140. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis we estimate the critical noises q(c) and the critical ratios beta/nu, gamma/nu, and 1/nu for some values of the probability r. Our results suggest that the critical exponents are different from those of the original model (r = 0), but they are r independent (r > 0). In addition, if we consider that agents can diffuse through the lattice, the exponents remain the same, suggesting a new universality class for the majority-vote model with noise. Based on the numerical data, we may conjecture that the values of the exponents in this universality class are beta similar to 0.45, gamma similar to 1.1, and nu similar to 1.0, which satisfy the scaling relation 2 beta + gamma = d nu = 2.

TI Interpreting attenuation at different excitation amplitudes to estimate

DT Article

   MODEL; ENCAPSULATION; OSCILLATIONS; THRESHOLD
AB Broadband attenuation of ultrasound measured at different excitation pressures being different raises a serious theoretical concern, because the underlying assumption of linear and independent propagation of different frequency components nominally requires attenuation to be independent of excitation. Here, this issue is investigated by examining ultrasound attenuation through a monodisperse lipid-coated microbubble suspension measured at four different acoustic excitation amplitudes. The attenuation data are used to determine interfacial rheological properties (surface tension, surface dilatational elasticity, and surface dilatational viscosity) of the encapsulation according to three different models. Although different models result in similar rheological properties, attenuation measured at different excitation levels (4-110 kPa) leads to different values for them; the dilatation elasticity (0.56 to 0.18 N/m) and viscosity (2.4 x 10(-8) to 1.52 x 10(-8) Ns/m) both decrease with increasing pressure. Numerically simulating the scattered response, nonlinear energy transfer between frequencies are shown to be negligible, thereby demonstrating the linearity in propagation and validating the attenuation analysis. There is a second concern to the characterization arising from shell properties being dependent on excitation amplitude, which is not a proper constitutive variable. It is resolved by arriving at a strain-dependent rheology for the encapsulation. The limitations of the underlying analysis are discussed. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

AB The subject of this paper is the detection and mitigation of data injection attacks in randomized average consensus gossip algorithms. It is broadly known that the main advantages of randomized average consensus gossip are its fault tolerance and distributed nature. Unfortunately, the flat architecture of the algorithm also increases the attack surface for a data injection attack. Even though we cast our problem in the context of sensor network security, the attack scenario is identical to existing models for opinion dynamics (the so-called DeGroot model) with stubborn agents steering the opinions of the group toward a final state that is not the average of the network initial states. We specifically propose two novel strategies for detecting and locating attackers and study their detection and localization performance numerically and analytically. Our detection and localization methods are completely decentralized and, therefore, nodes can directly act on their conclusions and stop receiving information from nodes identified as attackers. As we show by simulation, the network can often recover in this fashion, leveraging the resilience of randomized gossiping to reduced network connectivity.

AB TWO NEWLY-DEVELOPED COMPOUNDS (U92798 and U92032), which inhibit lipid peroxidation and block calcium entry, were studied for their effects on neocortical damage after transient focal ischemia. Ischemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by simultaneous occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries for a period of 3 hours. Compounds (1 mg/kg) were administered intravenously 30 minutes before occlusion and again 2.5 hours after the cessation of blood flow. After a 72-hour period of reperfusion, the animals were killed and examined for cerebral infarction and edema. Treatment with U92798 or U92032 significantly reduced the volume of cortical infarction. Edema was also reduced in these groups; however, this effect did not achieve statistical significance. These results suggest that dual function compounds, which both inhibit lipid peroxidation and block calcium entry, are promising therapeutic agents for the amelioration of ischemic cerebral damage.

AB Background: Geriatric trauma patients have high circulating norepinephrine (NE) levels but attenuated release of epinephrine (Epi) in response to increasing severity of injury. We hypothesized that NE and Epi have different effects on the endothelial and glycocalyx components of the vascular barrier following shock.
   Methods: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with varying concentrations of NE or Epi and exposed to simulated shock conditions (HR). Relevant biomarkers were sampled to index glycocalyx injury and endothelial cell activation.
   Results: NE was associated with significantly greater glycocalyx damage and endothelial activation/injury vs. Epi treatment groups. There were minimal changes in PAI-1 with either NE or Epi +/- H/R. However NE +/- H/R was associated with significantly higher tPA levels.
   Conclusions: NE favors a profibrinolytic state. Our study supports investigating liberal use of the anti-fibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid in the severely injured geriatric trauma patient. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: To compare the marginal adaptation of adhesively luted ceramic inserts in standardized cylindrical cavities of bovine dentin and enamel with the marginal adaptation of adhesively luted ceramic inlays in extracted molars after mechanical loading, and to calculate the minimum sample size required to differentiate between material groups based on the findings of this investigation.
   Materials and Methods: Ceramic inserts of similar dimension were luted in standardized cylindrical cavities of bovine dentin and enamel (n = 6, circle divide = 4 mm) with seven different adhesive/resin cement systems (Syntac/Variolink, Prime&Bond NT/Variolink, Excite DSC/Variolink, AdheSE/Variolink, Excite DSC/Multilink, Multilink Primer/ Multilink, RelyX Unicem). The same materials were used to lute ceramic inlays (Empress II) in three- surface cavities of extracted human molars (n = 6 per group). All specimens were submitted to 2000 cycles of thermocycling. In addition, restored teeth were submitted to cyclic loading (640,000 cycles, 50 N) in a chewing simulator. Replicas after stressing were analyzed with SEM, and the percentage of continuous margin of the inserts and the inlays was calculated, differentiating the proximal part of the inlay into cervical dentin/enamel and axio-proximal enamel. The mean percentage values per material group of the insert and inlay groups were ranked using relative ranks. Sample size estimation was done for pooled standard deviations comparing between two and seven materials and. assuming 20% or 10% of the mean of continuous margin to be statistically significant.
   Results: The Spearman correlation coefficient between the variables "insert dentin" and "inlay cervical dentin" was 0.71 (p = 0.07), between "insert enamel" and "inlay axio-proximal enamel" 0.07,(p = 0.9). The variability of the test results was large for both the insert and inlay variables, especially at the resin-dentin interface. No statistically significant difference between the materials could be found for the insert method when ANOVA and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were applied (p > 0.05), while the inlays luted with Prime&Bond NT/Variolink showed significantly less continuous margin at the cervical dentin than all other groups with the exception of, RelyX Unicem. At least 16 (63) inlays and 14 (57) inserts had to be used per group for differences of 20% (10%) of the mean of continuous margin.
   Conclusion: To evaluate luting agents with regard to their ability to reduce marginal discrepancies, the inlay model is inadequate due to high sample numbers which make the test time-consuming and expensive; furthermore, its clinical relevance is uncertain. Alternatively, the insert method may be a suitable screening method for dentinal margins, although its clinical relevance is also unknown.

AB A theoretical analysis is presented on the use of semibatch reactors for producing non-linear copolymers through the homogeneous free-radical polymerization of mono- and divinyl-monomers. The kinetic scheme distinguishes two kinds of pendant double bonds and five kinds of polymer radicals, as it also takes into account the primary cyclization of terminal divinyl units. In spite of the fairly large number of groups and reactions, the generating function of vector chain length distribution of polymer species can still be accurately computed by a numerical implementation of the method of characteristics and thus average molecular weights before and after gelation can be reliably obtained. The influence of feed policies of the monomers, initiator and transfer agent on gelation, average chain lengths and weight fraction of sol is discussed, as well as their sensitivity to some kinetic parameters.

AB Cellulose powder was modified with Sodium Hypochlorite (NaOCl) and Octenyl Succinic Anhydride (OSA) in different proportions. The adsorbents were characterised by BET, FTIR, XRD, TGA and SEM. Intrinsic viscosity increased with degree of substitution (DS). FTIR peaks confirmed the presence of carbonyl groups. Batch adsorption parameters studied were contact time, adsorbent dosage, pH and temperature. Adsorption process was influenced significantly by pH. Freundlich isotherm showed a better correlation coefficient (R-2 and chi(2)) than Langmuir and Temkin isotherms. The adsorption process was inferred as physico-chemical adsorption process (based on isotherm and kinetic modelling). Pseudo second order kinetics model was found to fit well on the empirical data obtained. Adsorption of Cu(II) ions over the modified cellulose was found to be exothermic in nature (Delta H < 0). HCl was found to be more effective desorbing agent than NaOH.

To address this, researchers use map abstraction method to abstract out a simplified map with fewer links and nodes based on the original full detailed map. Traditional static abstraction methods produce analysis maps with a single fidelity across the entire planning horizon, which cannot reflect the dynamic changes of daily traffic. This paper proposes a spatiotemporal dynamic map abstraction approach that adopts a time series clustering method to segment the analysis time horizon adaptively based on a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) curve, which describes network-wide dynamic traffic states. Time periods with similar macro-performance are grouped into one subinterval. A map with a dedicated fidelity is produced for each subinterval. Furthermore, a simulation is run on multiple abstracted maps with different fidelities in a sequence according to their temporal order. A numerical experiment ascertains that the proposed approach has promising results in both analysis accuracy and efficiency for resource-constrained modeling agents.

AB A full Bayesian analysis is developed for an extension to the short-term and long-term hazard ratios model that has been previously introduced. This model is specified by two parameters, short- and long-term hazard ratios respectively, and an unspecified baseline function. Furthermore, the model also allows for crossing hazards in two groups and includes the proportional hazards, and the proportional odds models as particular cases. The model is extended to include covariates in both, the short- and long-term parameters, and uses a Bayesian nonparametric prior, based on increasing additive processes mixtures, to model the baseline function. Posterior distributions are characterized via their full conditionals. Latent variables are introduced wherever needed to simplify computations. The algorithm is tested with a simulation study and posterior inference is illustrated with a survival study of ovarian cancer patients who have undergone a treatment with erythropoietin stimulating agents.

ID INCREASED ENERGY EFFICIENCY; CONSUMPTION
AB Australia is planning to take action to tackle climate change via improvements in light vehicle fuel efficiency. The proposed light vehicle emissions standards are expected to reduce petroleum use as well as greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles, sports utility vehicles and light commercial vehicles. Consumers of light vehicles, including private households and firms, will respond to this policy in a way that maximise their utility based on economic theory. On one hand, these economic agents will use less petrol, through directly purchasing more efficient new cars to react to the mandatory standard. On the other hand, the more efficient vehicle will provide an incentive for the consumers to use it more as the effective cost of driving decreases. Understanding these economic and behavioural responses to the policy is crucial for policymakers. This paper contributes to the empirical studies of the rebound effect by simulating the business-as-usual (BAU) and policy scenarios in a computable general equilibrium framework. The direct rebound effect of the Australian proposed light vehicle fuel efficiency standards are shown to range between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, measured by petroleum use. Each of these policy scenarios is shown to have a much larger economy-wide rebound effect, reaching up to 50 per cent measured by life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions. Although the stringent fuel efficiency standard generates more direct rebound effects measured in percentage than the lenient and medium standards, the stringent policy produces the most reduction in carbon emissions measured in physical units overall. This paper concludes by providing comprehensive understanding of the Australian proposed light vehicle fuel efficiency standards and offering policy recommendations based on the CGE simulation results.

DT Article
ID INFORMATION-RETRIEVAL; MODEL; ABSTRACTS
AB Professional summarizing includes the cognitive processes of abstracting, indexing, and classifying as performed by expert summarizers who prepare records for bibliographic information systems. In order to simulate their skilled performance, a "grounded" (or "naturalistic") cognitive model of expert summarization has been developed, using 54 working processes of 6 experts recorded by thinking-aloud protocols. The working processes comprise up to 140 working steps. The model is explained in the following using the abstracting step Trueby-2 executed by the expert Marliese. Components of the model are a toolbox of empirically founded strategies, principles of process organization, and interpreted working steps where the interaction of cognitive strategies can be investigated. In the computerized simulation, the SimSum (Simulation of Summarizing) system, cognitive strategies are represented by object-oriented agents grouped around dedicated blackboards. While the main scientific goal of the system is to check and improve the cognitive model, the system also serves practical presentation purposes. It will be distributed on CD-ROM as part of a textbook and thus help to explain the cognitive task of summarizing.

AB Transformation of hematopoietic cells by the p210(bcr/abl) tyrosine kinase appears to require the expression of a functional MYC protein, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of BCR-ABL and c-myc might be a rational strategy for attempting treatment of Philadelphia(1) leukemia. To test this hypothesis, severe combined immunodeficiency mice injected with Philadelphia(1) leukemic cells were treated systemically with equal doses of bcr-abl or c-myc antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) or with both ODNs in combination. Compared with the mice treated with individual agents, the disease process was much slower in the group treated with both ODNs, as revealed by now cytometry, clonogenic assay, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect leukemic cells in mouse tissue cell suspensions, and by enumeration of liver metastases. The retardation of the disease process was positively correlated with a markedly increased survival of leukemic mice treated with both ODNs. These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting multiple cooperating oncogenes.

TI Win-Win Concession Period Determination Methodology
SO JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB In infrastructure development through public-private partnerships (PPPs), governments worldwide often preset the concession period to a fixed length and then invite the private sector to bid on other aspects of the project. This practice has potential economic, financial, and social problems as shown in a case study of Hong Kong tunnel projects. To overcome these problems, this paper has proposed a win-win concession period determination methodology, in which PPPs are addressed as a principal-agent maximization problem. Both deterministic and simulation-based methods are provided to determine the concession period, with detailed step-by-step procedures. These methods take into consideration the financial characteristics of PPPs and the construction and operation requirements. In particular, the simulation-based approach combines the critical path method and Monte Carlo simulation technique in an effort to quantify construction and market risks for informed decision making. Furthermore, some issues related to the proposed methodology also have been discussed. These issues include (1) factors in determining a reasonable rate of return to the concessionaire's equity investment; (2) advantages and disadvantages of rate of return regulation; (3) concession period as a tender evaluation criterion; (4) efficiency check of the concessionaire's cost performance; (5) workable pricing mechanism; and (6) a practical approach to establishing statistical construction cost/duration distributions.

AB Background and objectives: Patient self-rating based scales such as Numerical Rating Scale, Visual Analog Scale that is used for postoperative pain assessment may be problematic in geriatric or critically ill patients with communication problems. A method capable of the assessment of pain in objective manner has been searched for years. Analgesia nociception index, which is based on electrocardiographic data reflecting parasympathetic activity, has been proposed for this. In this study we aimed to investigate the effectiveness of analgesia nociception index as a tool for acute postoperative pain assessment. Our hypothesis was that analgesia nociception index may have good correlation with Numerical Rating Scale values.
   Methods: A total of 120 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II undergoing any surgical procedure under halogenated-based anesthesia with fentanyl or remifentanil were enrolled for the study. At the 15th minute of arrival to the Postoperative Care Unit the patients' pain was rated on a 0-10 point Numerical Rating Scale. The patients' heart rate, blood pressure, and analgesia nociception index scores were simultaneously measured at that time. The correlation between analgesia nociception index, heart rate, blood pressure and Numerical Rating Scale was examined.
   Results: The study was completed with 107 patients, of which 46 were males (43%). Mean (SD) analgesia nociception index values were significantly higher in patients with initial Numerical Rating Scale < 3, compared with Numerical Rating Scale <= 3 (69.1 [13.4] vs. 58.1 [12.9] respectively, p <0.001). A significant negative linear relationship (r2 = -0.312, p= 0.001) was observed between analgesia nociception index and Numerical Rating Scale.
   Conclusion: Analgesia nociception index measurements at postoperative period after volatile agent and opioid-based anesthesia correlate well with subjective Numerical Rating Scale scores. (C) 2019 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB We investigate how insurance affects agents' decisions when being faced by endogenous, climate-driven extreme events. This is not only important in order to understand how the possibility of insurance augments mitigation and saving decisions, but it also improves our understanding of how insurance should be provided. Since there are no studies as of now that rely on such an integrated approach, we extend the literature along two lines. Firstly, we develop a neoclassical growth framework with endogenous extreme events and an insurance sector. Secondly, we introduce a simulation method that allows us to explicitly take these extreme events into account and which yields additional numerical insights. In doing so we can fully characterize and quantify the impact of different insurance policies for mitigation and economic growth decisions.
   Our analytical results and computational experiments show that (i) transparency of the insurance sector is the decisive requisite for abatement activities, implying substantial policy opportunities; (ii) a decentralized economy will under-invest in abatement without adequate policy interventions; (iii) precautionary beliefs on the frequency of extreme events lead to more sustainability; (iv) a social security system which prices insurance fairly is preferable to an insurance industry which provides insurance with an overhead.

DT Article; Early Access
DE Bayesian statistics; probabilistic models; COVID-19
AB The correct evaluation of the reproductive number R for COVID-19 is central in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic and the selection of an appropriate course of action. In most models, R is modeled as a constant - effectively averaging out the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying individual contact rates, population densities, or temporal factors amongst many. Yet, due to the exponential nature of epidemic growth, the error due to this simplification can be rapidly amplified, and its extent remains unknown. How can this intrinsic variability be percolated into epidemic models, and its impact, better quantified? We study this question here through a Bayesian perspective that captures at scale the heterogeneity of a population and environmental conditions, creating a bridge between the traditional agent-based and compartmental approaches. We use our model to simulate the spread as well as the impact of different social distancing strategies on real COVID-19 data, and highlight the significant impact of the heterogeneity. We emphasize that the contribution of this paper focuses on discussing the importance of the impact of R's heterogeneity on uncertainty quantification from a statistical viewpoint, rather than developing new predictive models.

AB Depression and anxiety disorders are distinct illnesses that often coexist. Patients suffering from both disorders have more psychological, physical, and social impairment than do patients suffering from either illness alone. Mixed anxiety-depression is gaining recognition as a separate diagnosis and has been included in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition, and in the appendix of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition. Current treatment recommendations for comorbid depression and anxiety are based on clinical experience with the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders when they occur independently. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective for simultaneously occurring anxiety and depression, but the side-effect profiles of the MAOIs and TCAs limit their use for this condition. Benzodiazepines are useful for the acute treatment of anxiety symptoms and buspirone for chronic generalized anxiety, but neither agent is effective for the long-term treatment of depression. The recently available antidepressants nefazodone and venlafaxine may also be useful for this patient population. When possible, psychotherapy should be used in conjunction with pharmacotherapy to improve treatment outcomes.

AB Efficient information flow in the complex, often microscale simulation systems such as the social, artificial life, or traffic ones poses a significant challenge. It is difficult to implement a highly scalable system due to algorithmic problems, which significantly hamper the efficiency, especially in the case of maintaining a synchronized state in a parallelized, distributed environment. Our previous work presented a desynchronized method of information distribution in a simulation environment, inspired by the propagation of smell, and proved this method to be highly scalable. In this paper, we enhance and validate this method to ensure it does not invalidate the conclusions drawn from the simulation, enabling the development of efficient, scalable simulation systems. The prototype of the method presented here leverages the actor model for parallelization and cluster sharding mechanisms for cluster management, providing a comprehensive solution for large-scale simulations, following realistic rules known from the nature. In order to validate the method of signal propagation modeling, three simulation models are created and tested. The validation is based on statistical analysis of metrics collected during the simulation execution. Statistical similarity of the results obtained from the distributed and nondistributed executions indicates that the distribution process does not impact the correctness of the simulation.

AB This paper formulates a multiple discrete-continuous probit (MDCP) land use model within a spatially explicit economic structural framework for land use change decisions. The spatial MDCP model is capable of predicting both the type and intensity of urban development patterns over large geographic areas, while also explicitly acknowledging geographic proximity-based spatial dependencies in these patterns. At a methodological level, the paper focuses on specifying and estimating a spatial MDCP model that allows the dependent variable to exist in multiple discrete states with an intensity associated with each discrete state. The formulation also accommodates spatial dependencies, as well as spatial heterogeneity and heteroskedasticity, in the dependent variable, and should be applicable in a wide variety of fields where social and spatial dependencies between decision agents (or observation units) lead to spillover effects in multiple discrete-continuous choices (or states). A simulation exercise is undertaken to evaluate the ability of the proposed maximum approximate composite marginal likelihood (MACML) approach to recover parameters from a cross-sectional spatial MDCP model. The results show that the MACML approach does well in recovering parameters. An empirical demonstration of the approach is undertaken using the city of Austin parcel level land use data.

AB Macroeconomic statistics simultaneously shape and try to capture the political economy we study. Their biases mold social and political dynamics; they also infect academic and policy analysis. Political economy can both benefit from and advance an understanding of economic statistics as political artefacts. To help unlock that potential, this article builds on scholarship dispersed across disciplines and highlights three points. First, a binary debate that either acclaims or vilifies economic data is misdirected. Indispensable for public policy, quantification is neither good nor bad per se; the question is what its specific ramifications are. Second, macroeconomic statistics have been built around an ideal of white male factory work for wages. The further economic activity is removed from that image, the more statistics misrepresent or ignore it, with systematic biases as a result. Third, the real-world impact of statistics always depends on how they are understood, used, and subverted. It hinges on statisticalpractices, not just on abstract measurement approaches. As political economists we are political agents when we define, and reproduce, our object of study. We face both an analytical and a normative imperative to work with and towards statistics that do justice to the world and the people in it.

TI Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2: a
   modelling study
SO LANCET PUBLIC HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
AB Background In most countries, contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases are asked to quarantine for 14 days after exposure to limit asymptomatic onward transmission. While theoretically effective, this policy places a substantial social and economic burden on both the individual and wider society, which might result in low adherence and reduced policy effectiveness. We aimed to assess the merit of testing contacts to avert onward transmission and to replace or reduce the length of quarantine for uninfected contacts.
   Methods We used an agent-based model to simulate the viral load dynamics of exposed contacts, and their potential for onward transmission in different quarantine and testing strategies. We compared the performance of quarantines of differing durations, testing with either PCR or lateral flow antigen (LFA) tests at the end of quarantine, and daily LFA testing without quarantine, against the current 14-day quarantine strategy. We also investigated the effect of contact tracing delays and adherence to both quarantine and self-isolation on the effectiveness of each strategy.
   Findings Assuming moderate levels of adherence to quarantine and self-isolation, self-isolation on symptom onset alone can prevent 37% (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 12-56) of onward transmission potential from secondary cases. 14 days of post-exposure quarantine reduces transmission by 59% (95% UI 28-79). Quarantine with release after a negative PCR test 7 days after exposure might avert a similar proportion (54%, 95% UI 31-81; risk ratio [RR] 0.94, 95% UI 0.62-1.24) to that of the 14-day quarantine period, as would quarantine with a negative LFA test 7 days after exposure (50%, 95% UI 28-77; RR 0.88, 0.66-1.11) or daily testing without quarantine for 5 days after tracing (50%, 95% UI 23-81; RR 0.88, 0.60-1.43) if all tests are returned negative. A stronger effect might be possible if individuals isolate more strictly after a positive test and if contacts can be notified faster.
   Interpretation Testing might allow for a substantial reduction in the length of, or replacement of, quarantine with a small excess in transmission risk. Decreasing test and trace delays and increasing adherence will further increase the effectiveness of these strategies. Further research is required to empirically evaluate the potential costs (increased transmission risk, false reassurance) and benefits (reduction in the burden of quarantine, increased adherence) of such strategies before adoption as policy.Copyright (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB Purpose: Retinoblastoma is a childhood malignancy of the retina. To increase the exposures of systemic chemotherapy, high-dose cyclosporine, as a P-glycoprotein modulating agent, has been combined with a standard chemotherapy. However, the effective and safe dose of cyclosporine has not been well evaluated. This study is to optimize cyclosporine dose using population pharmacokinetic modeling. Methods: Clinical data were obtained from 161 systemic chemotherapy cycles of 34 pediatric retinoblastoma patients between December 2006 and April 2015. Total 15 scenarios were simulated by 5 different doses (12, 14, 15, 17, and 20mg/kg) of cyclosporine in 3 different weight groups (5-10, 10-15, and 15-20kg). Numerical success ratio was obtained after assessing the simulated target cyclosporine concentration in the range of 2,000-2,500ng/mL using NONMEM version 7.3 software. Results: A final model was built based on a 1-compartment model with weight-normalized allometric scaling to minimize the variability of pediatric size. In simulations, numeric success ratio with 15mg/kg/day and the above were higher than that of traditional doses in all of the scenario groups. No significant adverse responses were reported. Conclusion and Relevance: High-dose cyclosporine regimen as a P-gp modulator is required to improve the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy with caution in pediatric patients with retinoblastoma. Clearance, volume of distribution, and body weight are important parameters to consider in selecting adequate dosing regimen.

AB Acetyl cholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme associated with the loss of cholinergic neurones in Alzheimer's disease. Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter found in the brain and the levels of which decrease significantly in Alzheimer's patients due to increased expression of AChE. In this study, a novel fragment-based QSAR model has been developed using twenty-seven flavonoid-derived compounds exhibiting inhibitory activity against AChE. This fragment-based method gives the advantage of studying the effect of individual fragments on the biological activity of the compound by evaluating the descriptors. The compounds were divided into training and test sets, where the test set was used for cross-validation of the model. The QSAR model exhibited good statistical values for the training set (r (2) = 0.8070, q (2) = 0.7088, F-ratio = 31.3616) and test set (pred_r (2) = 0.8131). The regression equation obtained had three descriptors describing effect of substitutions in terms of quantitative values. Evaluation of the model implied that electronegative substitution at R1 position lowers the inhibitory activity, while the presence of hydroxyl group improves the same. The presence of rings increased the activity of the compounds. The model thus generated was used to obtain six combinatorial libraries and predicts the activity of these compounds. These compounds were selected for docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies and two leads were identified against AChE.

AB Background Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung injury and endothelial dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We examined the effects of priming the CPB pump with a low-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch pentastarch (PS) solution, PS conjugated to the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO), or lactated Ringer's solution done (LR) on lung injury parameters and skeletal microvessel relaxation responses.
   Methods and Results Sheep were placed on hypothermic CPB with a prime of PS (n=8), PS-DFO (n=8), or LR (n=8). A 60-minute period of cardioplegia-ischemia was followed by rewarming, separation from CPB, and 2 hours of post-CPB monitoring. Hemodynamics, oxygenation, pulmonary lymph flow, lymph protein clearance, and total body weight were measured. Right and left atrial blood samples were obtained simultaneously for white blood cell and platelet counts. No statistically significant hemodynamic or oxygenation differences were found between groups. Lymph flow was increased after CPB but significantly more in the LR group (264.6 +/- 45%, P<.05) compared with PS-DFO (126.6 +/- 22%) or PS (120.9 +/- 25%). Increases in lymph protein clearance and weight gain were significantly less with PS and PS-DFO compared with LR (P<.05).
   Conclusions The oncotic agent PS ameliorates lung derangements seen after CPB compared with that seen with an LR prime, and no significant additional pulmonary benefit was demonstrated with PS conjugated to the oxygen-derived free radical scavenger DFO.

AB Proportional hazards are a common assumption when designing confirmatory clinical trials in oncology. This assumption not only affects the analysis part but also the sample size calculation. The presence of delayed effects causes a change in the hazard ratio while the trial is ongoing since at the beginning we do not observe any difference between treatment arms, and after some unknown time point, the differences between treatment arms will start to appear. Hence, the proportional hazards assumption no longer holds, and both sample size calculation and analysis methods to be used should be reconsidered. The weighted log-rank test allows a weighting for early, middle, and late differences through the Fleming and Harrington class of weights and is proven to be more efficient when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold. The Fleming and Harrington class of weights, along with the estimated delay, can be incorporated into the sample size calculation in order to maintain the desired power once the treatment arm differences start to appear. In this article, we explore the impact of delayed effects in group sequential and adaptive group sequential designs and make an empirical evaluation in terms of power and type-I error rate of the of the weighted log-rank test in a simulated scenario with fixed values of the Fleming and Harrington class of weights. We also give some practical recommendations regarding which methodology should be used in the presence of delayed effects depending on certain characteristics of the trial.

AB Application of the gravity-driven regional groundwater flow (GDRGF) concept to the hydrogeologically complex thick carbonate system of the Transdanubian Range (TR), Hungary, is justified based on the principle of hydraulic continuity. The GDRGF concept informs about basin hydraulics and groundwater as a geologic agent. It became obvious that the effect of heterogeneity and anisotropy on the flow pattern could be derived from hydraulic reactions of the aquifer system. The topography and heat as driving forces were examined by numerical simulations of flow and heat transport. Evaluation of groups of springs, in terms of related discharge phenomena and regional chloride distribution, reveals the dominance of topography-driven flow when considering flow and related chemical and temperature patterns. Moreover, heat accumulation beneath the confined part of the system also influences these patterns. The presence of cold, lukewarm and thermal springs and related wetlands, creeks, mineral precipitates, and epigenic and hypogenic caves validates the existence of GDRGF in the system. Vice versa, groups of springs reflect rock-water interaction and advective heat transport and inform about basin hydraulics. Based on these findings, a generalized conceptual GDRGF model is proposed for an unconfined and confined carbonate region. An interface was revealed close to the margin of the unconfined and confined carbonates, determined by the GDRGF and freshwater and basinal fluids involved. The application of this model provides a background to interpret manifestations of flowing groundwater in thick carbonates generally, including porosity enlargement and hydrocarbon and heat accumulation.

AB Purpose: We performed a prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy, safety and cost of parenteral antibiotics and oral fluoroquinolones for prophylaxis in penile prosthesis surgery.
   Materials and Methods: We prospectively randomized 20 consecutive patients undergoing penile prosthesis surgery to receive ofloxacin orally or gentamicin and cefazolin parenterally followed by cephradine orally. Intraoperatively corpora cavernosa tissue and simultaneous peripheral serum samples were evaluated for antibiotic levels. Median followup was 16 months (range 8 to 21, mean 15.35).
   Results: There were no implant losses or reoperations and complications were comparable in the 2 groups. The difference in mean serum-to-tissue ratios of ofloxacin versus the combination of cefazolin and gentamicin was statistically significant (p <0.03). The minimum inhibitory concentrations of ofloxacin met or exceeded those of the 2 most common offending organisms, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, in 80% of patients, which was comparable to the results of the parenteral regimen. Cost savings of the medications alone were more than $250,000 in the ofloxacin group. By eliminating a hospital stay of the 25,000 cases of penile prosthesis placement in the United States yearly a total cost savings of more than $36 million would be realized.
   Conclusions: When oral ofloxacin is given for prophylaxis in penile implant surgery, the procedure may be performed on an outpatient basis and health care dollars are saved.

AB Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECCs) are found to be better replacements for traditional concretes due to their higher damage tolerance under loading, as well as the ability to induce multiple-cracking with a smaller width and potential crack healing capability. This paper presents the development and performance of an effective self-healing concrete system made of ECC and MgO-type expansive agent (MEA) (made of lightly burnt MgO powder). New measures were implemented in examining the performance of ECC-MgO self-healing system based on accelerated autoclave test to simulate the experimental results relevant to the field conditions. Test results suggested the best calcination system to be 900 degrees C with 2 h of holding time using 45 gm particle size based on higher hydration activity of MEA in a powder state. Low calcium Class-F fly ash was found to be the best supplementary cementing materials (SCMs) to produce ECC-MgO system based on lower expansion effect of MgO. The high volume of fly ash (HVFA) was used to achieve very low expansion within the crack walls just to heal hairline micro-cracks in ECC-MgO self-healing system without jeopardizing the durability. Similar behavior was shown by the MgO in powder state in terms of loss of CO2 content and remaining hydration activity as well as after utilizing it in the ECC-MgO system in water and autoclave linear expansion tests coupled with scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thermogravimetric analyses (TGA). The higher flexural strength recovery of pre-cracked ECC-MgO prismatic specimens cured under accelerated autoclaved conditions compared to their pre-cracked ECC (without MgO) counterparts confirmed the self-healing capability and potential of the proposed ECC-MgO system.

TI Pair approximation for the q-voter model with independence on multiplex
   networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMPLE VARIANT; ISING-MODEL; TRANSITION
AB The q-voter model with independence is investigated on multiplex networks with full overlap of nodes in the layers. The layers are various complex networks corresponding to different levels of social influence. Detailed studies are performed for the model on multiplex networks with two layers with identical degree distributions, obeying the LOCAL&AND and GLOBAL&AND spin update rules differing by the way in which the q-lobbies of neighbors within different layers exert their joint influence on the opinion of a given agent. Homogeneous pair approximation is derived for a general case of a two-state spin model on a multiplex network and its predictions are compared with results of mean-field approximation and Monte Carlo simulations of the above-mentioned qvoter model with independence for a broad range of parameters. As the parameter controlling the level of agents' independence is changed ferromagnetic phase transition occurs which can be firstor second-order, depending on the size of the lobby q. Details of this transition, e.g., position of the critical points, critical exponents and the width of the possible hysteresis loop, depend on the topology and other features of the layers, in particular on the mean degree of nodes in the layers which is directly predicted by the homogeneous pair approximation. If the mean degree of nodes is substantially larger than the size of the q-lobby good agreement is obtained between numerical results and theoretical predictions based on the homogeneous pair approximation concerning the order and details of the ferromagnetic transition. In the case of the model on multiplex networks with layers in the form of homogeneous Erdos-Renyi and random regular graphs as well as weakly heterogeneous scale-free networks this agreement is quantitative, while in the case of layers in the form of strongly heterogeneous scalefree networks it is only qualitative. If the mean degree of nodes is small and comparable with q predictions of the homogeneous pair approximation are in general even qualitatively wrong.

AB Occlusive brain ischemia and micro-strokes are the most frequent brain pathologies, particularly in older patients and a major cause of dementia. Currently, we are missing appropriate methodology to study micro-strokes in experimental animals. In vivo two-photon laser-scanning microscopy (2P-LSM) and transgenic mouse models expressing cell type specific reporters have been used to examine ischemia-related insults, e.g. perturbations of neuronal process morphology and local blood flow in the MCAO - middle cerebral artery occlusion-model. Glia and pericytes can be visualized by selective fluorescent protein expression, e. g. astrocytes by their cyan-fluorescent ECFP, pericytes by red-fluorescent tdtomato and microglia by green fluorescent EGFP expression. In these mice, the breakdown of the blood brain barrier and the immediate as well as long-term cellular responses can be monitored. A new prototype of microCT incorporating a fast X-ray XPAD3 camera has been recently set up to allow cerebral angiography at high sampling rate. Preliminary data indicate that it is useful to monitor blood perfusion disturbance (i.e. lateralization) in the brain of tumor-bearing mice following retro-orbital injection of iodinated contrast agent. We expect this technology to be adequate to assess in real time the impact of acute stroke models on brain blood perfusion. By localizing perfusion anomalies, we will evaluate the extent of non-perfused areas and correlate these observations with subsequent behavioral deficits, and with local changes in myelin content in white matter tracks. The spectral properties of the XPAD3 detector moreover allow for the simultaneous identification and localization of several contrast agents opening the way to whole body multicolor imaging of vessels and inflammatory cells in the context of microstrokes.

AB The extreme toxicity of organophosphorus nerve agents and pesticides mandates to employ models or simulants in place of the actual compounds in the laboratory. The importance of simulants is known, however, their efficacy for direct comparison with the toxic organophosphorus compounds is not well documented. We have examined the potential energy surfaces (PES) for the alkaline hydrolysis of pesticides like paraoxon (diethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate), parathion (O,O-diethyl O-4-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate) and PNPDPP (4-nitrophenyl diphenyl phosphate), a simulant with MP2/6-311 + G*//B3LYP/6-311 + G* + Delta G(solv) (HF/6-31 +G*) level of theory. The effect of aqueous solvation was considered with the Integral Equation Formalism Polarizable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM). The alkaline hydrolysis of these organophosphorus compounds reveals that the reaction proceeds through the attack of hydroxide ion at the phosphorus center to form a pentacoordinate intermediate. The calculated free energies of activation for the alkaline hydrolysis of paraoxon and parathion are in good agreement with the available experimental activation free energies. The computed results show that the reaction profiles for the alkaline hydrolysis of paraoxon, parathion and PNPDPP are largely similar; however, the rate of hydrolysis of parathion may be higher than that of paraxon and PNPDPP. Such difference arises due to the less electrophilic nature of the phosphorus atom of parathion molecule as observed in the charge analysis study. The conceptual DFT analysis also showed the similar trend for the alkaline hydrolysis of paraoxon, parathion and PNPDPP with hydroxide anion. This computational study provides a quantitative support toward the use of PNPDPP as a simulant for organophosphorus compounds, which cannot be used directly for the laboratory purposes.

AB Diphenyl ether derivatives are good candidates for anti-tuberculosis agents that display a promising potency for inhibition of InhA, an essential enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase involved in fatty acid biosynthesis pathways in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In this work, key structural features for the inhibition were identified by 3D-QSAR CoMSIA models, constructed based on available experimental binding properties of diphenyl ether inhibitors, and a set of four representative compounds was subjected to MD simulations of inhibitor-InhA complexes for the calculation of binding free energies. The results show that bulky groups are required for the R-1 substituent on the phenyl A ring of the inhibitors to favor a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Phe149, Met155, Pro156, Ala157, Tyr158, Pro193, Met199, Val203, Leu207, Ile215, and Leu218. Small substituents with a hydrophilic property are required at the R-3 and R-4 positions of the inhibitor phenyl B rings to form hydrogen bonds with the backbones of Gly96 and Met98, respectively. For the R-2 substituent, small substituents with simultaneous hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties are required to favor the interaction with the pyrophosphate moiety of NAD(+) and the methyl side chain of Ala198, respectively. The reported data provide structural guidance for the design of new and potent diphenyl ether-based inhibitors with high inhibitory activities against M. tuberculosis InhA.

AB Recently, a cyclic heptapeptide with cytostatic activity was isolated from marine sources by three different groups independently. The sequence of the isolated peptide was ambiguous, since two different isomers have been proposed: cycle(-Asn(1)-Pro(2)-Phe(3)-Val(4)-Val(5)-Pro(6)-Val(7)-) (1) also called axinastatin 1 resp. pseudooxinellin and cyclo(-Asn(1#)-Pro(2#)-Pro(3#)-Phe(4#)-Val(5#)-Val(6#)-Val(7#)-) (2) called malaysiatin. We synthesized both peptides 1 and 2 and compared their optical rotation, FAB-MS, H-1- and C-13-NMR data with those of the native compounds. Our results prove that peptide 1 has been assigned correctly, whereas the data of 2 differ significantly from those of the natural peptide. Peptide 1 adopts two conformations (90:10 ratio) in DMSO, interconverting slowly on the NMR time scale. According to MD simulations, using NOEs and J couplings as experimental restraints, a beta VIa-turn with a cis peptide bond between Val(5)-Pro(6) and a beta I-turn in the Asn(1)-Val(4) region are the characteristic secondary structural elements of the major conformer. Its backbone conformation is very similar to the X-ray structure of a related peptide cycle(-Asn(a)-Leu(b)-Ser(c)-Phe(d)-Leu(e)-Pro(f)-Val(g)-) called evolidine.

AB In this study, low-cost and high adsorption capacity hydrogels based on gum tragacanth biopolymer (GT or TG) and TiO2 nanoparticles were produced by using glutaraldehyde as the crosslinking agent. These hydrogels were applied in photocatalytic process to remove methylene blue from simulated colored solution. TiO2-Gum Tragacanth hydrogels (TGTH) were characterized by FESEM and FTIR to investigate the surface morphology and functional group of the synthesized hydrogel. Contact angle measurements showed that, the hydrophilicity nature of crosslinked TGTH decreased compared to GT films. The effect of particle size, initial dye concentration, pH of the solution and adsorbent/photocatalyst dosage on the removal efficiency was assessed. The obtained results demonstrated that lower dosage of the prepared TGTH (0.15g/L) outperformed GT (0.2 g/L) reaching 87% of dye removal, while GT resulted in 69% of removal. In order to model the cationic dye removal process, a Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) was investigated. This network was applied to predict dye removal based on the time duration, initial dye concentration, pH of the solution and TiO(2)dosage in gum tragacanth hydrogel structure ([TiO2/gum tragacanth hydrogel](0) (g/L)). The performance of the proposed model was validated by several training data. The RBFNN model mostly overlapped with the experimental data due to selecting proper structure and training algorithm.

AB High-performance fiber reinforced concrete (HPFRC) has been reported as a repairing material to normal concrete (NC) structures due to its predominant mechanical performance. Here, we investigate the debonding behavior between HPFRC and NC subjected to direct shear loading. HPFRC specimens are fabricated and experimentally calibrated to determine the compressive and bending (i.e., flexural) strengths. HPFRC-NC samples are fabricated using two bonding strategies, i.e., mechanical surface treatments with and without chemical agent. Direct shear loading is applied to test the HPFRC-NC debonding behavior. A finite element (FE) model is developed to predict the direct shear debonding response. The FE model is validated by the experimental observations and then used to characterize the debonding behavior with various geometric and material parameters, as well as bonding interface treatments. Subsequently, a robust machine learning model is developed to formulate the shear debonding strength of HPFRC-NC with those influencing parameters. Design examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed machine learning model in describing the debonding response of HPFRC-NC. A sensitivity analysis is further conducted to investigate the contribution of the chosen predictors to the debonding behavior of HPFRC-NC. The reported HPFRC and machine learning-based prediction model provide powerful tools to address repairing issues in various existing normal concrete structures. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Auxiliary fuels are used to replace expensive coke in two ways, as a reducing agent for iron oxides and to provide energy for the blast furnace operation. Poor combustion of heavy oil produces soot and cenosphere, which plug the coke bed and lead to an increased pressure drop and lower the productivity of blast furnace. In the study a new combustion model for heavy oil in a blast furnace is explained. Droplet atomization is modelled with the wave breakup model and the combustion consists of droplet vaporization and gas phase combustion with a detailed combustion model. Three different lance positions were modelled to evaluate the effect of lance position on combustion and blast furnace operation. The study is limited to the tuyere-raceway area, where e.g. mixing between air blast and heavy oil, pressure drop and combustion have been investigated. The most promising position based on this study is to move the injection lance 10 cm downstream from the tuyere nose. The results show that the pressure drop increases when the lance is moved inside the tuyere, but the pressure drop growth is moderate until the lance is at least 10 cm downstream from the tuyere nose. According to the results the pressure drop versus lance position behavior is similar to an experimental study previously described in the literature. In addition the combustion behavior was found to be similar to the actual blast furnace.

AB Controlled Interpersonal Affect Regulation the process of deliberately influencing the internal feeling states of others occurs in a variety of interpersonal relationships and contexts. An incipient corpus of research shows that interpersonal affect regulation can be characterized as a goal-directed behavior that uses self-control processes which, according to the strength model of self-regulation, consumes a limited resource that is also used by other self-control processes. Using interpersonal affect-improving and affect-worsening regulation strategies can increase agent's resource depletion but there is reason to think that effects will partially rely on target's feedback in response to the regulation. Using a healthcare paradigm, an experiment was conducted to test the combined effects of interpersonal affect regulation use and patient feedback on healthcare workers' resource depletion, measured as self-reported experienced and expected emotional exhaustion, and persistence on a self-regulation task. Medical students (N = 78) were randomly assigned to a 2(interpersonal affect regulation: affect-worsening vs. affect-improving) x 2(patients' feedback: positive vs. negative) factorial between-subjects design and given instructions to play the role of doctors in interactions with two professional actors trained to act as patients. Analysis of covariance showed that affect-worsening was more depleting than affect-improving for all measures, whereas the recovery effects of positive feedback varied depending on strategy type and measure. The findings confirm the characterization of interpersonal affect regulation as potentially depleting, but suggest that the correspondence between the agent's strategy and the target's response needs to be taken into consideration. Use of affect-improving and positive feedback showed positive effects on self-rated performance, indicating that interpersonal affect regulation is relevant for organizational as well as personal outcomes.

AB Disseminated neuroectoderma-derived tumors, mainly neuroblastoma in childhood and melanoma in the adulthood, are refractory to most current therapeutic regimens and hence the prognosis remains very poor. Preclinical research studies have indicated several agents that show promising therapeutic potential for these neoplasms. However, there appears to be a limitation to their in vivo applicability, mainly due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties that lead to insufficient drug delivery to the tumor or metastatic sites or to high systemic or organ-specific toxicity. In this scenario, the focus is on targeted cancer therapy. Encapsulating anticancer drugs in liposomes enables targeted drug delivery to tumor tissue and prevents damage to the normal surrounding tissue. Indeed, sterically stabilized liposomes have been shown to enhance the selective localization of entrapped drugs to solid tumors, with improvements in therapeutic indices. The identification of tumor-associated antigens and/or genes and the relative ease of manipulating the physicochemical features of liposome hold promise for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that selectively target tumor cells. Combined targeting is still investigated, especially the availability to simultaneously target and kill both the cancer cells and the tumor vasculature. Animal models make it possible to link molecular genetics and biochemistry information to the physiological basis of disease and are important predictive tools that offer a frontline testing system for studying the involvement of specific genes and the efficacy of novel therapeutics approaches. Relevant experimental models of human neuroblastoma and melanoma, which better reflect the tumor behavior in patients, are required to evaluate the effectiveness of the various targeted liposomal formulations and their possible systemic and organ-specific toxicity. The most multifunctional targeted liposomes are herein described, with primary attention on testing their efficacy in clinically relevant animal models for the treatment of neuroblastoma and melanoma.

AB The production of biodiesel or fatty acid esters (FAE) from lipids with supercritical methanol (scMe0H) has gained interest in the last decade because it allows the direct transesterification of crude oils and fats. The reaction should be carried out above 593 K in order to achieve complete conversion. When milder conditions are set, also monoglycerides (MG) and diglycerides (DG), together with glycerol, are obtained as byproducts of the transesterification process. Acylglycerols are common food emulsifiers and surface active agents in many industrial cleaning products. The main goal of this work is to study the fractionation of FAE and acylglycerols by using CO2 as a green solvent. Mixtures of FAE, MG and DG were produced by partial transesterification of sunflower oil with scMe0H in a temperature range of 556-605 K and using different methanol to oil molar ratios (between 20 and 50). Then, experimental data on phase equilibria of reaction products + CO2 were measured at 298 K and 313 K in a variable volume cell with windows. The measured data were used to test the predictive capability of the Group Contribution with Association Equation of State (GCA-EoS). The acylglycerols can be purified by near critical extraction of the FAE with CO2. The simulation of the extraction process working with CO2, in liquid or supercritical state, gives a concentration of acylglycerols higher than 99.8 wt.% in the raffinate phase with a concentration of FAE above 97 wt.% in the extract phase.

AB Sixteen propellant formulations based on ammonium perchlorate (AP), hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene, and aluminium particles have been tested for size distribution of aluminium agglomerates emerging from their burning surface. The formulations are based on a bimodal size distribution of AP particles. Ten of the formulations exhibit one or two plateaus/mesa in their burning rate variation with pressure (zero/negative pressure exponent of burning rate). The relevant formulation variables, namely, coarse and fine AP sizes and coarse-to-fine ratio, aluminium size and content, and two different curing agents, have been varied. Tests are performed in the 1-10 MPa pressure range. A direct correlation between burning rate and agglomerate size exists for propellants with normal burning rate trends but a neutral or inverse correlation is observed for those exhibiting plateau burning behaviour. Larger the parent aluminium size, lesser the agglomeration, as expected; but the effect of aluminium content is non-monotonic. The coarse AP size influences the aluminium agglomerate size as expected from the pocket model regardless of plateau burning effects. The agglomerate size decreases with increase in fine AP size, however. A computer model developed earlier at this laboratory for prediction of aluminium agglomerates based on three-dimensional packing of particles and deduction of AP particles with attached leading edge diffusion flames is applied to the present formulations. The model under-predicts the agglomerate size, only marginally for propellants that do not exhibit plateau burning rate trends, but substantially, otherwise. This is because it does not take into account effects of binder melt flow and is independent of the curing agent of the binder.

AB Cisplatin (Cisp) is an active cytotoxic agent that was found efficient in the treatment of various types of solid tumors. Its nephrotoxic effect has been very well documented in clinical oncology. Erythropoietin (EPO), a renal cytokine-regulating hematopoiesis, has recently been shown to exert important cytoprotective effects in many experimental injuries. The aim of this study was to explore whether EPO would protect against Cisp-induced apoptosis in rat kidney. Adult Wistar rats were treated with saline solution as the control group, Cisp alone, EPO alone, or EPO with Cisp in different treatments: 1) EPO and Cisp simultaneously administrated to animals as a cotreatment; 2) EPO administered 24 hours before Cisp as a pretreatment; and 3) EPO administered 5 days after Cisp injection as a post-treatment. Our results have shown that Cisp induced renal failure, characterized with a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentrations. Cisp promoted kidney DNA fragmentation and apoptotic cell death. Apoptosis was revealed by an enhancement of proapoptotic protein (e. g., p53 and Bax) levels, decrease in antiapoptotic proteins (e. g., Bcl2 and Hsp27), and increase in caspase-3 activity. Treatments with EPO restored creatinine and BUN levels and inhibited Cisp-induced DNA damage in the kidney. Apoptosis was also reduced by the upregulation of antiapoptotic protein expressions, downregulation of proapoptotic protein levels, and reduction of caspase-3 activity.

AB The identification of drug metabolites is very important in drug development. Nowadays, the most widely used methods are isotopes and mass spectrometry. However, the commercial isotopic labeled reagents are usually very expensive, and the rapid and convenient identification of metabolites is still difficult. In this paper, an O-18 isotope labeling strategy was developed and the isotopes were used as a tool to identify drug metabolites using mass spectrometry. Curcumin was selected as a model drug to evaluate the established method, and the O-18 labeled curcumin was successfully synthesized. The non-labeled and O-18 labeled curcumin were simultaneously metabolized in human liver microsomes (HLMs) and analyzed by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The two groups of chromatograms obtained from metabolic reaction mixture with and without cofactors were compared and analyzed using Metabolynx software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA). The mass spectra of the newly appearing chromatographic peaks in the experimental sample were further analyzed to find the metabolite candidates. Their chemical structures were confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry. Three metabolites, including two reduction products and a glucuronide conjugate, were successfully detected under their specific HLMs metabolic conditions, which were in accordance with the literature reported results. The results demonstrated that the developed isotope labeling method, together with post-acquisition data processing using Metabolynx software, could be used for fast identification of new drug metabolites.

AB The gram negative facultative bacterium P. salmonis is the etiological agent of Salmonid Rickettsial Septicaemia (SRS), a severe disease that causes important economic losses in the global salmon farmer industry. Despite efforts to control this disease, the high frequency of new epizootic events indicate that the vaccine and antibiotics treatments have limited effectiveness, therefore the preventive and diagnostic approaches must be improved. A comparison of several methodologies for SRS diagnostic indicate differences in their specificity and its capacity to detect other bacteria coexisting with P. sairnonis in culture media (contamination) and fish samples (coinfection), aspects relevant for research, vaccine development and clinical diagnostic. By computer-simulation analyses, we identified a group of restriction enzymes that generate unique P. salmonis 16S rDNA band patterns, distinguishable from all other bacteria. From this information, we designed and developed a PCR-RFLP (Polymerase Chain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) assay, which was validated using 16S rDNA universal primers and restriction enzyme PmaCl for the amplification and digestion, respectively. Experimental validation was performed by comparing the restriction pattern of P. salmon's with the restriction patterns generated by bacteria that cohabit with P. salmonis (fish bacterial isolates and culture media contaminants). Our results indicate that the restriction enzyme selection pipeline was suitable to design a more specific, sensible, faster and cheaper assay than the currently used P. salmonis detection methodologies.

AB An emulsion liquid membranes (ELMs) containing 2-ethylhexyl phosphonic acid mono-2-ethylhexyl ester (H-2 A(2)) was tested for the extraction of plutonium(IV) from aqueous nitrate solutions of different compositions. Span 80 was used as the surface-active agent and a mixture of 0.05 mol dm(-3) HNO3 + 0.3 mol dm(-3) H2C2O4 was used as the internal phase. Influence of some important experimental parameters such as exterior phase nitric acid concentration, ionic impurities in the exterior phase, concentration of H 2 A 2 in ELM phase, and organic solvents on the ELM permeation process were systematically studied. The maximum efficiency of Pu extraction among group of experiments was 98% with permeability coefficient = 0.508 min(-1) , and the corresponding concentration factor of Pu in the receiving phase was ca. 10. The stability of the emulsions was tested in the presence of different organic solvents and at different concentrations of Span 80 in LM phase. The extractions of Pu by ELM from actual and simulated waste solutions as well as in presence of some added ionic impurities were investigated. Rate of Pu extraction by ELM was studied at different treatment ratios and under repeat extractions by the same emulsion. The repeat extraction experiments showed that a concentration factor of more than 80 for Pu could be achieved.

AB Tea tree oil (TTO) is well known as an antimicrobial and immunomodulatory agent. In the present study we confirmed the anti-inflammatory properties of TTO and investigated the involvement of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in the immunomodulatory action of TTO administered by inhalation. Sexually mature, 6-8-week-old, C(57)Bl(10) x CBA/H (F-1) male mice were used. One group of animals was injected intraperitoneally (ip) with Zymosan to elicit peritoneal inflammation and was then submitted to four sessions of TTO inhalation (15 mins each). Some of the mice were simultaneously injected ip with Antalarmin, a CRH-1 receptor antagonist, to block HPA axis functions. Twenty-four hours after the injections the mice were killed by CO2 asphyxia, and peritonea[ leukocytes (PTLs) were isolated and counted. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in PTLs were assessed by fluorimetric and colorimetric assays, respectively. The results obtained show that sessions of TTO inhalation exert a strong anti-inflammatory influence on the immune system stimulated by Zymosan injection, while having no influence on PTL number, ROS level, and COX activity in mice without inflammation. The HPA axis was shown to mediate the anti-inflammatory effect of TTO; Antalarmin abolished the influence of inhaled TTO on PTL number and their ROS production in mice with experimental peritonitis, but it had no effect on these parameters in mice without inflammation.

AB The rates of dissolution of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides are critically dependent on the coordinative interactions taking place on their surfaces, above all of the reactions of the surface functional > FeOH groups with H+, OH-, metal ions and suitable ligands. Surface processes rather than transport processes are typically the rate-controlling steps. Thus the     dissolution rates depend on the type of surface species present. In this work, the inhibition of the dissolution of gamma-FeOOH by various organic and inorganic solutes, benzoate, arsenate, phosphate, selenite, sulfate and the inhibition of the acid dissolution of alpha-FeOOH by Cr(III) and chromate was investigated. Enhancement and inhibition of dissolution are relative terms and have to be measured operationally in relation to a reference condition. As a reference ligand in ligand-promoted and ligand-inhibited dissolution, ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA) was chosen because it is dissolution-active over a relatively large pH range. The experimental results show pronounced inhibition of the dissolution by phosphate, arsenate and selenite at near neutral pH values. At pH < 5, phosphate, arsenate and selenite accelerate the dissolution. It is postulated that binuclear surface complexes inhibit the dissolution, because much more energy is needed to remove simultaneously two center atoms from the crystalline lattice than to remove solely one center. However, mononuclear complexes, especially if they are nucleophilic and bidentate, accelerate the dissolution.

AB Stimuli-responsive contrast agents (CAs) show great promise for the early detection and understanding of cancer. In particular, CM that respond to ion content may allow monitoring of both the development of cancer and the efficacy of novel therapies. Understanding the responsive behavior of stimuli-responsive CM in different ionic environments requires development of more advanced characterization methods. Here we report a high-resolution NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) study of conformational changes of ion-responsive F-19 copolymers of oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (OEGMA) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl acrylate (TFEA) (poly(OEGMA-co-TFEA)) in the presence of salt. H-1 2D NOESY spectra were collected with and without the presence of NaCl and demonstrated that further separation of OEGMA and TFEA segments and closer association of OEGMA side chain were observed with the addition of NaCl. MD simulations provided additional information on the changes in conformation and were consistent with the experimental findings. Furthermore, we investigated the behavior of polymer internalized by normal and cancer cells (MCF-12A and MCF-7) by monitoring the F-19 spin spin relaxation time (T-2) of poly(OEGMA-co-TFEA) copolymer in vitro. The F-19 NMR T-2 value we obtained in MCF-7 cancer cells (82.3 ms) is much lower than that in MCF-12A normal cells (124.2 ms), and the difference is sufficient to obtain contrast using modern magnetic resonance imaging methods in high field scanners. Our results encourage further attempts to develop even more potent CM. This would also result in novel methods that allow monitoring of cancer at the cellular and molecular level.

AB The relative spatial distribution and motion with respect to Gd3+ of the H-1 and F-19 nuclei in the acetate ion and its fluorine derivatives are studied in D2O solutions through the paramagnetic relaxation rate enhancements (PREs) of these nuclei We derive general theoretical expressions of the longitudinal PRE in terms of the analytical concentrations of metal and ligands, formation constants of the complexes, metal-nucleus distances, and coordination lifetimes of the ligands The observed formation constants of the 1 metal 1 ligand complexes markedly decrease with increasing number of fluorine atoms, the electronegativity of which reduces the negative partial charge of the coordinating COO- group The coordination lifetimes are very short at the scale of the relaxation times of the protons of metal bound acetate, that is, shorter than about 10 mu s The average distance of the acetate protons from Gd3+ is in fair agreement with independent crystallographic determination The release of free Gd3+ from the very stable Gddtpa (dtpa=diethylene-triaminepentaacetate) complex caused by the competition of Zn2+ for dtpa, is evidenced by an increase of the PREs with Zn2+ concentration The observed PRE increase is consistent with the known equilibrium constants governing the speciation involving Gd3+, Zn2+, and dtpa The present case study illustrates a method which easily yields experimental tunable properties suitable to test the ongoing theories of lanthanide Ln(3+) complexation in solution

AB Present study deals with hematite/M (M = Au, Pd) catalysts converted from a double-hollow Prussian blue microstructure (DHPM). The unique Prussian blue (PB) microstructure (MS) is prepared by a template-free solvothermal synthetic route in a single-step reaction. An amine-functionalized silicate sol-gel matrix (SSG) has served as the structure-directing agent cum stabilizer for making DHPM. Synthesized DHPM is having a unique structure: a hollow core and an in situ etched porous surface. Growth mechanism is explored and revealed by analyzing several experimental parameters such as HCl concentration, Fe source, effect of the added EtOH, silane concentration, and role of silanes' amine groups. It is identified that the superstructure consisted of well-aligned PB cubes growing radially from the core of the superstructure. Metal (Au and Pd) nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on both interior and exterior of the PB MS through galvanic displacement reaction, and thus metal NP-loaded hematite phase iron oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) nanomaterials were derived by annealing them in air. Catalytic activities of the hematite/M(M = Au, Pd) MS are investigated toward simultaneous catalytic reduction of o-nitrophenol and p-nitrophenol. The resultant hematite/Pd MS showed high structural stability and catalytic active sites than the hematite/Au MS, which enhances the catalytic properties for the simultaneous catalytic reduction of both nitrophenols.

AB Surfactant flooding is a proven enhanced oil recovery method for the recovery of trapped crude oil from the pores of the reservoir. In the present study, the applicability of a synthesized zwitterionic surfactant as an efficient EOR agent was tested, in terms of its interfacial tension reduction capability, emulsification behavior, and wettability modification behavior. Core flooding experiments conducted in sandstone core with the injection of 0.3 pore volume of chemical slug after water flooding showed 20% of additional oil recovery. The core flooding experiment was simulated using CMG-STARS simulator and history matching of relative permeability curve and its interpolation parameters were done. The validated model closely represented the experimental core flooding with very low error of 6%. The validated model helps in understanding the movement of crude oil and its interaction with the injected surfactant slug in the porous media. The validated model was further used for optimization of injected chemical slug by varying the parameters such as the surfactant concentration in the injected slug, the volume of injected chemical slug, and the injection rate of chemical slug. Each parameter had different effects on the oil recovery efficiency and cumulative oil recovery of more than 90% OOIP was obtained using model with injection of 1 PV of chemical slug containing 100 ppm of surfactant with the injection rate of 0.3 mL/min. The simulation of core flooding helped in optimization of crude oil production by zwitterionic surfactant and its implementation on field scale production by zwitterionic surfactant flooding.

AB The widespread applications of polymeric materials require the use of conventional flame retardants based on halogen and phosphorous compounds to satisfy fire safety regulatory standards. However, these compounds, particularly halogen-based examples, are persistent organic pollutants of global concern and generate corrosive/toxic combustion products. To account for eco-friendliness, ultimate mechanical/physical properties and processing difficulties, the window of options has become too narrow. Although the incorporation of non-toxic nanofillers in polymers shows positive potential towards flame retardancy, many obstacles remain. Moreover, most of the literature on these materials is qualitative, and often points to conflicting/misleading suggestions from the perspectives of short-term and long-term fire exposure tests. Hence, there is a renewed need to fundamentally understand the fire response of such materials, and complement experimental results with theoretical modelling and/or numerical simulation.
   A part of this review will highlight the ecological impacts of using conventional flame retardants, thereby signifying the necessity to use eco-friendly agents. In other sections, we explore the use of various nanofillers for this purpose, compare their performance with traditional systems, provide insights into different testing standards and combustion mechanisms, modelling aspects of the combustion behavior, and identify novel approaches that could be considered for meeting the fire safety standards with eco-friendly materials.

AB Cotton textile waste-based magnetic activated carbon was prepared via simultaneous activation-pyrolysis using FeCl3 as a novel activating agent. The response surface methodology based on the Box-Behnken design method was applied to optimize the preparation parameters and predict the specific surface area of the samples. The optimal activated carbon was obtained at a mass ratio of FeCl3/CTW, activation time and activation temperature of 1.62:1, 1 h and 700 degrees C, respectively. The experimental maximum yield and iodine adsorptive value (32.66% and 714.55 mg g(-1)) of the resultant carbon were close to that of the predicated response values (34.85% and 783.75 mg g(-1)), respectively. SEM, N-2 adsorption-desorption isotherms, XRD, PPMS, FTIR and pH(pzc) measurements were conducted to analyze the physicochemical characteristics of the optimal sample. The results showed that the carbon matrix had a high specific surface area of 837.39 m(2) g(-1) with abundant micropores and acidic surface functional groups, and the saturation magnetization (Ms) was 5.2 emu g(-1) due to the formation of Fe3O4. The maximum adsorption of Cr(vi) by the carbon reached 212.77 mg g(-1). Furthermore, the addition of FeCl3 lowered the pyrolytic carbonization temperature and inhibited the generation of volatiles in the activation-pyrolysis process. Meanwhile, the formation of Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 derived from FeCl3 was beneficial for the development of vast micropores.

AB Using mineral additives and admixtures as self-healing agents in cement-based composites has been extensively researched. However, if the minerals are added directly to the cementitious matrix without any protection, they could immediately react, leading to a decrease in self-healing efficiency with further associated side-effects on the mechanical properties of cementitious composites. Thus, this paper describes the development of coated pellets as a self-healing system in cement based materials. Pan pelletisation was utilised for producing pellets from three different powder minerals as potential healing agents: reactive magnesium oxide (MgO), silica fume and bentonite. Of these materials, two types of developed prototype pellets in addition to another two commercial types of MgO pellets with different pellet sizes were then encapsulated in a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) based film coating. The PVA coating was evaluated for the apparent solubility in water and in alkaline solution, swelling property, water permeability, dynamic mechanical properties, and shell thickness on pellets. Although PVA coating exhibited a decrease in its mechanical properties in water or in the simulated concrete environment, it retained integrity and stability in both environments. The PVA shell thickness varied from 10 to 50 pm. As the coated pellets partially replaced the natural sand in mortar mixtures, they were characterised in comparison with sand for the particle size distribution, density, porosity, crushing strength and particle shape. Experimental results indicated that the different types of pellets showed higher porosity and lower crushing strength compared to sand. In mortar mixtures, the pellets showed excellent compatibility with minimal influence on the fresh mixture properties and the compressive strength of the hardened specimens. This was accompanied by good distribution inside the concrete matrix. Further investigations on the self-healing performance of these pellets are under way. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to consider queuing systems where captive repeat customers select a service facility each period. Are people in such a distributed system, with limited information diffusion, able to approach optimal system performance? How are queues formed? How do people decide which queue to join based on past experience? The authors explore these questions, investigating the effect of information availability, as well as the effect of heterogeneous facility sizes, at the macro (system) and micro (individual performance) levels.
   Design/methodology/approach - Experimental economics, using a queuing experiment.
   Findings - The authors find little behavioural difference at the aggregate level, but observe significant variations at the individual level. This leads the authors to the conclusion that it is not sufficient to evaluate system performance by observing average customer allocation and sojourn times at the different facilities; one also needs to consider the individuals' performance to understand how well the chosen design works. The authors also observe that better information diffusion does not necessarily improve system performance.
   Practical/implications - Evaluating system performance based on aggregate behaviour can be misleading; however, this is how many systems are evaluated in practice, when only aggregate performance measures are available. This can lead to suboptimal system designs.
   Originality/value - There has been little theoretical or empirical work on queuing systems with captive repeat customers. This study contributes to the understanding of decision making in such systems, using laboratory experiments based on the cellular automata approach, but with all agents replaced by humans.

AB In the last two decades, nanotechnology has flourished due to its vast number of applications in many fields such as drug delivery, oil and gas, and thermal applications, like cooling and air-conditioning. This study focuses on the applications of nanoparticles/nanofluids in the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) process to increase oil recovery efficiency. To understand the nanoparticle-assisted EOR process, the first step is to understand the flow characteristics of nanoparticles in porous media, including entrapment and release in the pores and the behavior of nanoparticles under high temperatures, pressures, and salinity levels and in the presence of external electric and magnetic fields. Also, the process looks at the roles of various pore distributions during their application as EOR agents. The experimental approaches are not only time consuming, but they are also cumbersome and expensive. Hence, the mathematical models could help to facilitate the understanding of the transport and interaction of nanofluids in a reservoir and how such processes can be optimized to get maximum oil recovery and, in turn, reduce the production cost. This paper reviews and critically analyzes the latest developments in mathematical modeling and simulation techniques that have been reported for nanofluid-assisted EOR. One section is dedicated to discussing the challenges ahead, as well as the research gaps in the modeling approach to help the readers to also contribute to further enlightening the modeling nanofluid-assisted EOR process.

AB Purpose: The proposed project is aimed at enhancing the efficiency of epithelial ovarian cancer treatment and reducing adverse side effects of chemotherapy using nanotechnology. Overexpression of the CD44 membrane receptor results in tumor initiation, growth, cancer stem cells' specific behavior, development of drug resistance, and metastases. We hypothesize that a developed cancer-targeted delivery system that combines CD44 siRNA with paclitaxel would successfully deliver its payload inside cancer cells, effectively induce cell death, and prevent metastases.
   Experimental Design: We synthesized, characterized, and tested a nanoscale-based drug delivery system (DDS) containing a modified polypropylenimine (PPI) dendrimer as a carrier; anticancer drug paclitaxel as a cell death inducer; a synthetic analog of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) peptide as a tumor-targeting moiety; and siRNA targeted to CD44 mRNA. The proposed DDS was tested in vitro and in vivo using metastatic ovarian cancer cells isolated from patients with malignant ascites.
   Results: We found that in contrast with cells isolated from primary tumors, CD44 was highly over-expressed in metastatic cancer cells. Treatment with the proposed tumor-targeted nanoscale-based nucleic acid and DDS led to the suppression of CD44 mRNA and protein, efficient induction of cell death, effective tumor shrinkage, and prevention of adverse side effects on healthy organs.
   Conclusion: We show a high therapeutic potential for combinatorial treatment of ovarian carcinoma with a novel DDS that effectively transports siRNA targeting to CD44 mRNA simultaneously with cytotoxic agents. (C) 2013 AACR.

AB Polymer-derived ceramics (PDCs) are innovative materials with a wide range of novel applications (micro fibers, protective coatings, porous materials, MEMS). Among high-performance, non-oxide ceramics, hexagonal boron nitride offers interesting potentialities as fibrous reinforcing agent for ceramic composites. Boron nitride can easily be produced from preceramic polymers and previous studies have shown the great potential of poly[(B-methylamino) borazines], called polyMAB as melt-spinnable precursors for the preparation of this type of ceramics. The goal of the present study is to provide a comprehensive structural and rheological characterization of polyMAB-type polymers using a combination of thermal, structural, and chemical experiments, as well as rheological investigations and constitutive modeling, in order to predict and control polymer spinnability from the early stage of material formation. The results from dynamic shear rheology are consistent with the rheological behavior observed in spinning. The experimental measurements of the fiber diameter during steady spinning put in evidence the difference in extensional rheological behavior and spinnability between samples. Numerical simulations of 1D model of fiber spinning emphasis the importance of heat transfer at the exit from the die and relevant differences for the polymers under investigation in the evolution of spin extensional viscosity along the fiber. The present work evidences for the first time the rheological behavior of polyMAB samples and the link to their chemistry, especially in relation to the fiber spinning process.

TI NSAID analgesic ketorolac used perioperatively may suppress early breast

AB To explain a bimodal relapse hazard among early stage breast cancer patients treated by mastectomy we postulated that relapses within 4 years of surgery resulted from something that happened at about the time of surgery to provoke sudden exits from dormant phases to active growth. Relapses at 10 months appeared to be surgery-induced angiogenesis of dormant avascular micrometastases. Another relapse mode with peak about 30 months corresponded to sudden growth from a single cell. Late relapses were not synchronized to surgery. This hypothesis could explain a wide variety of breast cancer observations. We have been looking for new data that might provide more insight concerning the various relapse modes. Retrospective data reported in June 2010 study of 327 consecutive patients compared various perioperative analgesics and anesthetics in one Belgian hospital and one surgeon. Patients were treated with mastectomy and conventional adjuvant therapy. Follow-up was average 27.3 months with range 13-44 months. Updated hazard as of September 2011 for this series is now presented. NSAID ketorolac, a common analgesic used in surgery, is associated with far superior disease-free survival in the first few years after surgery. The expected prominent early relapse events are all but absent. In the 9-18 month period, there is fivefold reduction in relapses. If this observation holds up to further scrutiny, it could mean that the simple use of this safe and effective anti-inflammatory agent at surgery might eliminate most early relapses. Transient systemic inflammation accompanying surgery could be part of the metastatic tumor seeding process and could have been effectively blocked by perioperative anti-inflammatory agents. In addition, antiangiogenic properties of NSAIDs could also play a role. Triple negative breast cancer may be the ideal group with which to test perioperative ketorolac to prevent early relapses.

AB Models of travel time perception and learning mechanisms in traffic networks are presented. Mechanisms for updating travel times in light of new experiences and for triggering and terminating the updating process are examined. Travel time perception and learning are modeled on the basis of concepts from Bayesian statistical inference. Mechanisms for triggering and terminating the learning process are modeled with the use of simple heuristic rules based on the inter-update period and thresholds that define the salience of travel times and acceptable confidence levels. These models are embedded inside a microscopic (agent-based) simulation framework and model to study their collective effects on the day-to-day behavior of traffic flows through a series of experiments. The effect of alternative travel time perception and learning mechanisms on system performance and its dynamic properties, in particular convergence, is explored.

AB We hypothesized that, associated with the state of anaesthesia, characteristic changes exist in both cardio-respiratory and cerebral oscillator parameters and couplings, perhaps varying with depth of anaesthesia. Electrocardiograms (ECGs), respiration and electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from two groups of 10 rats during the entire course of anaesthesia following the administration of a single bolus of ketamine-xylazine (KX group) or pentobarbital (PB group). The phase dynamics approach was then used to extract the instantaneous frequencies of heart beat, respiration and slow delta-waves (within 0.5-3.5 Hz). The amplitudes of delta- and theta-waves were analysed by use of a time-frequency representation of the EEG signal within 0.5-7.5 Hz obtained by wavelet transformation, using the Morlet mother wavelet. For the KX group, where slow delta-waves constituted the dominant spectral component, the Hilbert transform was applied to obtain the instantaneous delta-frequency. The theta-activity was spread over too wide a spectral range for its phase to be meaningfully defined. For both agents, we observed two distinct phases of anaesthesia, with a marked increase in theta-wave activity occurring on passage from a deeper phase of anaesthesia to a shallower one. In other respects, the effects of the two anaesthetics were very different. For KX anaesthesia, the two phases were separated by a marked change in all three instantaneous frequencies: stable, deep, anaesthesia with small frequency variability was followed by a sharp transition to shallow anaesthesia with large frequency variability, lasting until the animal awoke. The transition occurred 16-76 min after injection of the anaesthetic, with simultaneous reduction in the delta-wave amplitude. For PB anaesthesia, the two epochs were separated by the return of a positive response to the pinch test at 53-94 min, following which it took a further period of 45-70 min for the animal to awaken. delta-Waves were not apparent at any stage of PB anaesthesia. We applied non-linear dynamics and information theory to seek evidence of causal relationships between the cardiac, respiratory and slow delta-oscillations. We demonstrate that, for both groups, respiration drives the cardiac oscillator during deep anaesthesia. During shallow KX anaesthesia the direction either reverses, or the cardio-respiratory interaction becomes insignificant; in the deep phase, there is a unidirectional deterministic interaction of respiration with slow delta-oscillations. For PB anaesthesia, the cardio-respiratory interaction weakens during the second phase but, otherwise, there is no observable change in the interactions. We conclude that non-linear dynamics and information theory can be used to identify different stages of anaesthesia and the effects of different anaesthetics.

AB Biomolecular interactions in solution include a variety of effects: hard sphere, electrostatic, van der Waals, hydrophobic, etc. The corresponding interaction potentials govern the macromolecular distribution in solution, the shapes of the phase diagrams and the crystallization process. Different techniques: small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), light scattering, osmotic pressure, can be used to characterize these potentials. Here, SAXS was the tool of choice to follow the changes induced by the crystallizing agents in different physicochemical conditions. Moreover, the coupling of SAXS (experimental structure factors) and numerical simulations derived from statistical mechanics (calculated structure factors) allowed us to determine the best fit parameters of the relevant potentials. Several protein model systems have now been investigated, with different isoelectric points, sizes and compactness, After the studies performed on lysozyme, and on aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), we proceeded with lens gamma- and alpha-crystallins and with urate oxidase. We can now draw the following picture of the relevant potentials. With low molecular weight proteins, a coulombic, pH dependent, repulsive potential and a short range (a few Angstrom), possibly van der Waals, attraction are sufficient to account for the behavior observed at low ionic strength. At higher ionic strength, the salt specific effects that follow the (direct or reverse) order of the Hofmeister series, correspond to an additional short range salt specific attraction. With increasing protein size, the van der Waals contribution becomes negligible. The addition of polymers like polyethylene glycol (PEG) induces a depletion mechanism, which is equivalent to a protein-protein attraction. Crystallization definitively appears to be under control of sufficiently strong and short range (a few Angstrom) attractions, which means that, despite the diversity of protein sequences, it is possible to define a range of physicochemical conditions that may generate crystals. Yet, if salt addition appears to be sufficient to provide such conditions with small compact proteins, additives like PEG seem to be required at higher molecular weights. The success, of course, will also rely upon the protein purity and stability. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The 150 year history of the Japanese steel industry dates from the first western blast furnace, which was built by T. Ohashi in 1857. Modern blast furnace operation at integrated steel works in Japan started in 1901 with the first blow-in of Higashida No. 1 blast furnace at Yawata Steel Works. Throughout the prewar and postwar periods, the steel industry has supported the Japanese economy as a key industry which supplies basic materials for social infrastructure and development.
   After the period of recovery following the destruction caused by World War II, Chiba Works of Kawasaki Steel Corporation (now JFE Steel Corporation) was built and began operation in 1953 as the first integrated steel works in the Keiyo Industrial Region after the war. During Japan's period of high economic growth, many coastal steel works with large blast furnaces having inner volumes of more than 3 000 m(3) and even 5 000 m(3) were built to enable efficient marine transportation of raw materials and steel products. Japanese steel makers introduced and improved the most advanced technologies of the day, which included high pressure equipment, stave cooler systems, bell-less charging systems, etc. As a result, Japanese steel works now lead the world in low reducing agent rate (RAR) operation, energy saving, and long service life of blast furnaces and coke ovens.
   Following the Oil Crises of the 1970s, the Japanese steel industry changed energy sources from oil to coal and implemented cost-oriented operation design and technology. In 2012, the Japanese steel industry produced approximately 80 million tons of hot metal from 27 blast furnaces, including large-scale furnaces with inner volumes over 5 000 m(3). During this period, the industry has faced many economic and social challenges, such as the high exchange rate of the yen, oligopoly in the mining industry, global warming, and the surge in iron ore and coal prices driven by the rapid growth of the BRICs. The industry has successfully responded to these challenges and maintained its international competitiveness by developing advanced technologies for pulverized coal injection, expanded use of low cost iron resources, recycling for environmental preservation, and CO2 mitigation.
   In this paper, the prospects for ironmaking technologies in the coming decades are described by reviewing published papers and looking back on the history of developments in ironmaking during the last 100 years.

TI A Computer Simulation of Employee Vaccination to Mitigate an Influenza
   Epidemic
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID PANDEMIC INFLUENZA; STRATEGIES
AB Background: Better understanding the possible effects of vaccinating employees is important and can help policymakers and businesses plan vaccine distribution and administration logistics, especially with the current H1N1 influenza vaccine in short supply.
   Purpose: This article aims to determine the effects of varying vaccine coverage, compliance, administration rates, prioritization, and timing among employees during an influenza pandemic.
   Methods: As part of the H1N1 influenza planning efforts of the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study network, an agent-based computer simulation model was developed for the Washington DC metropolitan region, encompassing five metropolitan statistical areas. Each simulation run involved introducing 100 infectious individuals to initiate a 1.3 reproductive-rate (R-0) epidemic, consistent with H1N1 parameters to date. Another set of scenarios represented a R-0=1.6 epidemic.
   Results: An unmitigated epidemic resulted in substantial productivity losses (a mean of $112.6 million for a serologic 15% attack rate and $193.8 million for a serologic 25% attack rate), even with the relatively low estimated mortality impact of H1N1. Although vaccinating Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices- defined priority groups resulted in the largest savings, vaccinating all remaining workers captured additional savings and, in fact, reduced healthcare workers' and critical infrastructure workers' chances of infection. Moreover, although employee vaccination compliance affected the epidemic, once 20% compliance was achieved, additional increases in compliance provided less incremental benefit. Even though a vast majority of the workplaces in the DC metropolitan region had fewer than 100 employees, focusing on vaccinating only those in larger firms (>= 100 employees) was just as effective in mitigating the epidemic as trying to vaccinate employees in all workplaces.
   Conclusions: Timely vaccination of at least 20% of the large-company workforce can play an important role in epidemic mitigation. (Am J Prev Med 2010;38(3):247-257) (C) 2010 American journal of Preventive Medicine

ID BULK PARAMETERIZATION
AB An extensive work has been done by the Department of Meteorology and Climatology at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki and others using a three-dimensional cloud resolving model to simulate AgI seeding by aircraft of three distinct hailstorm cases occurred over Greece in period 2007-2009. The seeding criterion for silver iodide glaciogenic seeding from air is based on the beneficial competition mechanism. According to thermodynamic analysis and classification proposed by Marwitz (1972a, b, and c) and based on their structural and evolutionary properties we classified them in three groups as singlecell, multicell and supercell hailstorms. The seeding optimization for each selected case is conducted by analysis of the thermodynamic characteristics of the meteorological environment as well as radar reflectivity fields observed by the state of the art Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, Analysis and Nowcasting (TITAN) software applied in the Greek National Hail Suppression Program (GNHSP). Results of this comprehensive study have shown positive effects with respect to hailfall decrease after successful seeding as our primarily objective. All three cases have illustrated 15-20% decrease in accumulated hailfall at the ground Seeded clouds have exhibited earlier development of precipitation and slight dynamical enhancement of the updraft and rainfall increase of 10- 12.5%. The results have emphasized a strong interaction between cloud dynamics and microphysics, especially the subgrid scale processes that have impact on agent transport and diffusion in a complex environment. Comparisons between modelled and observed radar reflectivity also show a relatively good agreement. Simulated cloud seeding follows the operational aircraft seeding for hail suppression. The ability of silver-iodide particles to act as ice nuclei has been used to perform airborne cloud seeding, under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. The seeding effects depend upon applying the seeding methodology in proper seeding time, right placement and agent dose rate.

AB Parental care, a central component of reproduction in a wide range of animal species, often involves elaborate behavioural interactions between parents and their offspring. Due to the reciprocal nature of these interactions, it has been hypothesized that parental and offspring behaviours (e.g. parental food provisioning and offspring begging) are not only target but also agent of selection. These traits are therefore expected to co-evolve, ultimately leading to co-adaptation of parent and offspring behaviours within families. However, empirical data on such parent-offspring co-adaptation are limited, particularly for wild populations. Furthermore, mean levels of behaviour (as measured in previous studies) may not adequately describe the dynamic nature of the reciprocal interplay between parents and their offspring, and instead rather the behavioural reaction norms for provisioning and begging may be co-adapted. We applied a large-scale cross-fostering study over 3 consecutive breeding seasons to investigate whether provisioning behaviour of wild blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) parents covaries with the begging behaviour of their genetic, cross-fostered offspring. We simultaneously analysed parent and offspring behaviours, both as static traits (mean levels) and behavioural reaction norms (offspring begging as a function of food deprivation and parental provisioning as a function of short-term experimental changes in brood size). Neither maternal nor paternal provisioning rates covaried with the begging intensity of their genetic offspring when analysed as mean levels of behaviour. However, the slopes of the reaction norms for provisioning and begging were negatively correlated between male, but not female, parents and their genetic offspring. Thus, fathers that change their provisioning rate strongly with brood size sire offspring whose level of begging only weakly increases with hunger, and vice versa. The observed covariation suggests the existence of sex-specific optima for parent-offspring trait combinations. Thus, our study not only highlights the importance of a behavioural reaction norm approach when investigating parent-offspring interactions, but also stresses the relevance of considering parents as separate units, at least for biparental species.

AB Background: Both calcipotriene and tazarotene have been shown to be effective in the treatment of psoriasis. No study has evaluated the effect of using both agents simultaneously.
   Objective: Our purpose a as to evaluate the effectiveness of combination treatment of psoriasis with calcipotriene ointment and tazarotene gel by comparing them with clobetasol ointment, a class I topical corticosteroid. A secondary objective was to evaluate the clinical compatibility of applying both agents at the same time.
   Methods: This pilot study was a prospective, single-center, open-label, right/left comparison of 28 lesion pairs in 15 patients. It consisted of a 2-week treatment phase, followed by a 4-week post-treatment observation phase.
   Results: All 15 patients completed the treatment phase of the study. At the end of the active treatment phase (end of week 2), calcipotriene- and tazarotene-treated lesions showed nearly identical reductions in scaling (P = .93), plaque elevation (P = .76), and overall lesional severity scores (P = .29) compared with their matched clobetasol-treated counterparts. Erythema improved significantly more in clobetasol-treated lesions (P < .05) during the treatment period, but differences became statistically insignificant during the post-treatment period (P = .20). No patients had significant irritation from the treatments. During the post-treatment phase (weeks 3-6), all lesions worsened; plaque elevation returned somewhat more rapidly in calcipotriene- and tazarotene-treated lesions (P < .01), whereas changes in scaling, erythema, and overall lesional severity were not significantly different between the two treatment groups (P > .05).
   Conclusion: The nonsteroid combination of twice-daily calcipotriene ointment and once-daily tazarotene gel was not statistically different froth twice-daily application of the class I corticosteroid clobetasol ointment in reducing psoriatic scaling, plaque elevation, and overall lesional severity over a 2-week period. There does not seem to be any chemical incompatibility between calcipotriene ointment and tazarotene gel that is clinically significant.

TI Dynamic effects of labor supply: A mechanism explaining cross-sectional
   differences in hours
SO REVIEW OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Macroeconomics; Labor supply decisions; Heterogeneous agents
ID WAGE INEQUALITY; TRENDS; US
AB This paper first establishes the empirical fact that over the last quarter of the 20th century, the average weekly hours worked increased for workers in the highest wage quintile while it decreased for the ones at the lowest. In 1976, a worker in the lowest quintile worked 2.8 hours more per week than a high wage worker (worker in the highest quintile), but by 2006, the low wage worker worked 1 hour less. During this period, there was also a wide increase in wage inequality. The typical mechanism in which hours are only determined by contemporaneous wages cannot simultaneously explain the pattern found in both variables for every quintile.
   This paper attempts to reconcile these cross-sectional trends in both hours and wages for the US during this time period. As a first step, we show that compositional changes (in education, occupation and age) within quintiles can only explain a fraction of the observed pattern. Next, we propose a mechanism in which individuals' current decisions of how much to work take into account two components: the contemporaneous benefit of the wage received, and also how current hours worked affects the probability of moving across the wage distribution in later periods. The latter dynamic component is estimated from our dataset. We find that changes over time in how hours affect these probabilities provided incentives that differ across the quintiles, and are consistent with the labor supply decisions observed in the data. We incorporate these two components into an equilibrium model of heterogeneous agents with uninsurable income risk. We are able to replicate the decline in hours for the bottom of the distribution as well as the increase at the top. The ratio of hours worked between the two groups delivered by the model also fits the trend found in the data. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Lipid A is a highly conserved component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), itself a major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. Lipid A is essential to cells and elicits a strong immune response from humans and other animals. We developed a quantitative model of the nine enzyme-catalyzed steps of Escherichia coli lipid A biosynthesis, drawing parameters from the experimental literature. This model accounts for biosynthesis regulation, which occurs through regulated degradation of the LpxC and WaaA (also called KdtA) enzymes. The LpxC degradation signal appears to arise from the lipid A disaccharide concentration, which we deduced from prior results, model results, and new LpxK overexpression results. The model agrees reasonably well with many experimental findings, including the lipid A production rate, the behaviors of mutants with defective LpxA enzymes, correlations between LpxC half-lives and cell generation times, and the effects of LpxK overexpression on LpxC concentrations. Its predictions also differ from some experimental results, which suggest modifications to the current understanding of the lipid A pathway, such as the possibility that LpxD can replace LpxA and that there may be metabolic channeling between LpxH and LpxB. The model shows that WaaA regulation may serve to regulate the lipid A production rate when the 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (KDO) concentration is low and/or to control the number of KDO residues that get attached to lipid A. Computation of flux control coefficients showed that LpxC is the rate-limiting enzyme if pathway regulation is ignored, but that LpxK is the rate-limiting enzyme if pathway regulation is present, as it is in real cells. Control also shifts to other enzymes if the pathway substrate concentrations are not in excess. Based on these results, we suggest that LpxK may be a much better drug target than LpxC, which has been pursued most often.

AB Chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress (OS) appear to be two main pathways involved in the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary (PCO) syndrome. Therefore, targeting these pathways by means of anticytoldne and antioxidant agents might be a therapeutic alternative approach to the current treatments of PCO syndrome. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of pentoxifylline (FIX), a drug with antioxidant and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) properties, in hyperandrogenism-induced PCO rats. The inflammatory and OS responses and their connections with ovarian functionality in induced PCO rats were investigated through ovarian histopathologic examination and a series of biochemical measurements including serum estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, insulin, and TNF-alpha, ovarian and serum lipid peroxidation, total antioxidant power, and reactive oxygen species. Experimental PCO was induced in rats by oral administration of letrozole (1 mg/kg body weight) for 21 consecutive days. In a different group, FIX was administrated orally (50 mg/kg/d) for 21 days simultaneous with letrozole to assess its potential protective effects. The letrozole-induced PCOs were characterized by irregular cycles, high incidence of subcapsular ovarian cysts with diminished or scant granulosa cell layers, increased number of atretic preantral and antral follicles, and absence of a. In addition, the letrozole-induced PCO rats exhibited notable increase in lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species of serum and ovary, serum testosterone, insulin, and TNF-alpha and significant decline in total antioxidant power, serum estradiol, and serum progesterone. Our results indicated that all the identified pathologic parameters and biochemical characteristics in letrozole-induced PCO rats in this study were preserved close to normal levels by simultaneous PTX treatments. Present results demonstrate that there is a direct connection between ovarian dysfunction and increased OS and inflammation in PCO. For the first time, the beneficial effects of PTX as a powerful antioxidant and TNF-alpha blocker in hyperandrogenism-induced PCO are reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is part of managerial wisdom that managers need to take risks in order to succeed. This is in stark contrast to the prominent agent-based theories of experiential learning and competitive selection that are known to be biased against risky alternatives in the long run. How can the positive managerial view on risk taking prevail given these results? Qualitative surveys of managers suggest risks to be acceptable if their outcome distribution meets certain criteria. We argue in this paper that these criteria are widely congruent with lowdownside risk. Using a novel simulation design, we analyze the effects of experiential learning and competitive selection on downside risk preferences in an ecology of agents. In the long run, experiential learning implies weak downside risk seeking, whereas competitive selection leads to strong downside risk aversion. Furthermore, competitive selection leads to the prevalence of outcome distributions with low downside risk in an ecology, even if they have a significantly higher level of total risk than comparable distributions with more downside risk. We draw implications for empirical studies on managerial behavior.

AB Ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic particles as MRI contrast agent present many advantages for bringing about soft tissue contrast as compared to single-ion complexes. The classic microscopic outersphere theory that works successfully for small molecules in understanding the transverse relaxation rate I/T-2 is not valid for these larger and stronger magnetic spheres. We categorize the relaxation behavior of the tissue-sphere system for ferromagnetic spherical perturbers in five diffusion regimes. Over the entire range of perturber size a general understanding of the relaxation mechanisms is described in terms of basic physical features of the system, and, through empiric models, the imaging sequences of spin echo and gradient echo. The models are verified with results of our spectroscopic measurements as well as simulations and experiments in the literature. Normalized models, obtained through proper scaling of the sphere radius and the relaxation rate, can be used to quantitatively estimate I/T-2 for various combinations of the variables. Effects of diffusion upon image contrast and effects of sphere size change upon relaxation with their possible applications in microvascular dilatation and other areas are then discussed.

   antibiotic resistance
AB Background: Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an important risk factor for urinary tract infections. In this study, the causative agents of urinary tract infections were isolated from urine samples of benign prostatic hyperplasia patients aged 65 and older. Bacteremia risk and the patterns of antibiotic resistance were investigated to guide clinicians in empirical antibiotic treatment.
   Methods: Between 2015 and 2019, cultures of bacteria and yeast were made from urine samples from 655 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. The patients were divided into three groups based on age: 65 - 74, 75 - 84, and >= 85. The identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests of microorganisms were performed using the BD Phoenix (Becton Dickinson, USA) and the VITEK (R) 2 Compact (bioMerieux, France) automated systems, as well as traditional methods.
   Results: Microbial growth was detected in 24% of the patients. No significant differences were found concerning age (p = 0.15). The most commonly isolated microorganism was Escherichia coli (47.8%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (22%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%), and Candida albicans (4.4%). Escherichia coli showed no resistance to carbapenems. On the other hand, resistance values of 1% for amikacin, 5% for fosfomycin, 11% for nitrofurantoin, 13% for piperacillin/tazobactam, and 24% for gentamicin were detected. Resistance value for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefixime, cefuroxime, and ampicillin were more than 50%. Also, bacterial growth occurred in 9% of blood culture samples made simultaneously with urine culture from 55 patients.
   Conclusions: High resistance rates to some antibiotics frequently used in empirical antibiotic treatment of urinary tract infections have reached alarming levels in elderly male patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Therefore, identifying resistance patterns is important to contribute to rational antibiotic use policies. In addition, the risk of Candida-related urinary tract infections and bacteremia should be considered in these patients.

AB Recent evidence suggests that function and brain structure arc evolutionary related in several species. This historical relationship between different mammal species allows the study of higher human mental functions in animals under normal and pathological conditions. This idea constitutes theoretical support For the application of the experimental method in Psychiatry. The modeling of psychiatric illness in animals represents today an important chapter of medical and biological research conceptually supported by the above-described ideas. The introduction into the clinic of the chlorpromazine, an aliphatic phenotiazine, at the beginning of the 50's, resulted in a turning point in the development of experimental psychiatry. This fact was essential for the introduction of the experimental approach. Artificial or natural development of psychosis in humans could be observed under different medical conditions such as neurosyphilis, endocrinopathies; hypo and/or hyperthyroidism, head trauma, alcoholism and heavy metal intoxication and At the end of the 40's Hoffman synthesized a compound able tu strong disorganize a human or animal behavior, the lysergic diethialamide acid "LSD" even at very low doses. Nevertheless, the possibility of pharmacological correction of psychotic symptoms represented the real core for a radical change in the understanding of the neurological basis of higher mental function disturbances. This paradigmatic change could nut occur in the absence of a pharmacological treatment of psychotic symptoms. Based on this line of thinking, researchers started to model mental illnesses (other than psychosis disturbances'), using laboratory animals. The simulation of psychiatric illnesses was mainly oriented toward their pharmacological correction. This approach ignored the aethiopathological factors, focusing the efforts in the reduction of clinical symptoms. In addition, the lack of a conceptual body on the neurobiological basis of mental illness and the lack of adequate instruments fur its research delayed the development of the scientific basis fur clinical psychiatry. Nowadays, the chapter of anxiety disorders besides clinical classification includes animal research in most psychiatric areas. Preclinical approaches for the study of anxiety include more than 30 different animal models. These paradigms study behaviors that in a particular way are modified by anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds; among them are the conditioning animal models based on punishment or conflict procedures. These experimental designs are founded on the assumption that laboratory animals modify their pattern of response when conditioned aversive and unconditioned stimuli are temporarily associated, eliciting operant or classical responses, Most of these designs inhibit animal response when aversive and unconditioned stimuli are paired. The classical dogma of such an approach assumes that well-known anxiolytic compounds (barbiturate, benzodiazepines), frequently used as gold standard compounds, decrease behavioral inhibition in trained individuals. Generally the aversive stimuli used is a low electrical shock, Thus, an animal trained to perform a particular response modifies it after treatment with a known (gold standard) or unknown (the testing molecule) compound. An interesting point of these models is their similarity with generalized anxiety i.e., the real aversive stimulus is absent when the experiment is carried out, a fact that resembles one of the conditions of anxiety in the clinic. This feature makes these models different from those based on fear-elicited responses, paradigms that model sim
   Conditioning experimental models allow the control of basal behavioral levels, however the animals require training previously to the experimental session. In addition, detailed analyses are necessary discriminate non-specific effects of drugs on learning, memory, motor, perception food and water consumption. Several authors consider these features as diminishing the construct validity of the conditioning models, arguing the involvement of artificial elements, unrelated with emotional stress in animals in wild conditions and different of clinical anxiety. Other important tests used for the study of anxiety evaluate unconditioned responses. These models are supported on the species memory, i.e., analyze the innate behaviors of naive animals. These groups of behaviors are observed each and every time the subjects encounter the same stressful situation, not necessarily associated with painful or electrical stimuli. Many researchers believe that these models offer higher level of neurological validity. However, a strong level of intraspecific variability compared with those based on conditioned responses his been found. Unconditioned models are less dependent on the memory or motivational processes. There is an important discrepancy between DSM IV anxiety inventory and the animal models used, This discrepancy is related to the lack of phylogenetic relationships between the illness and the models. This concept suggests that some human behaviors considered as disrupting responses represent the cultural expression of archaical pre-human behavior, such as hipervigilance, defensive avoidance and escape responses, adaptive in natural conditions, but disadaptive in some cases in human groups. The validity of the animal models for the study of anxiety depends on the consensus that normal and/or pathological anxiety has anatomic and neurochemical substrates that interact in the neural systems involved in the defensive species reactions. The participation of different brain areas regulating, unlike in nature forms of anxiety has been recently proposed. Before this notion, the unified theory of limbic system regulation of the emotional activity was generally accepted. In summary, based on the above-described ideas it seems that there is not one single animal model for the study of anxiety. Different tests reflect at least one specific feature of the anxiety disorder and it must be carefully chosen.

ENMD-2076 showed a favorable toxicity profile. The limited results, one patient (3%) with a partial response and 57% of patients with stable disease, do not support further evaluation of ENMD-2076 as single agent. Future studies will depend on the simultaneous targeting approach ofDNAJB1-PRKACAand the critical downstream components. Background Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) represents approximately 0.85% of liver cancers. The associatedDNAJB1-PRKACAgene fusion transcript RNA codes for the catalytic domain of protein kinase A and overexpression of Aurora kinase A (AURKA). ENMD-2076 is a selective anti-AURKA inhibitor. Methods Patients aged >12 years with pathologically confirmed incurable FLC, with measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2 or Lansky 70-100, and adequate organ function were eligible. Patients were prescribed ENMD-2076 based on body surface area. The primary endpoint was overall objective response rate by RECIST v1.1, with a null hypothesis of true response rate of 2% versus one-sided alternative of 15%. Secondary endpoints included 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (Fig. 1), median PFS, time to progression (TTP), and overall survival (OS). Safety was evaluated throughout the study. Results Of 35 patients who enrolled and received treatment, 1 (3%) had a partial response (PR) and 20 (57%) had stable disease (SD). Median TTP, PFS, and OS were 5, 3.9, and 19 months, respectively. The most frequently reported drug-related serious adverse event was hypertension in three patients. Three deaths were reported on-study-two due to disease progression and one due to pulmonary embolism not related to ENMD-2076. Conclusion The study provided no rationale for further studying ENMD-2076 as a single agent in FLC.

AB Here, we evaluate in vitro the site-specific delivery ability of thrombolysis catheters and compare continuous infusion (CI) and periodic injection (PI) protocols with reference to this parameter. Thrombotic occlusion was simulated by placing a porcine blood clot proximal to an eccentric stenosis in a flow phantom, Iodinated contrast agent was used as the marker. Part I-Evaluation of thrombolysis catheters: four CI and three PI catheters were tested. The marker was delivered as an infusion at 1 ml/min for 1 min (CI), or as two 0.25 ml boluses 30 sec apart (PI), Iodine content of the clot was then estimated with x-ray fluorescence spectrometry, This value as a ratio of the delivered dose was defined as the targeting efficiency. Part II-Evaluation of thrombolysis protocols: CI and PI were compared. The marker was delivered for 3 or 5 min using one of seven protocols. The iodine content of both clot and effluent were estimated. Among PI catheters, the Jet-Lysis catheter proved to be the best (P = 0.02). The EDM catheter had the lowest targeting efficiency in the CI group (P = 0.01). With CI, median iodine recovery dropped from 0.21 (95% confidence interval: 0.08, 0.25) for 1 min to 0.13 (0.05, 0.16) for 3 min and 0.07 (0.03, 0.10) for 5 min; for PI the values remained unchanged. The fraction lost in the effluent increased with the duration of regimen with both CI (P = 0.014) and PI (P = 0.004). Reducing the rate of infusion or the bolus frequency resulted in major improvements with respect to this parameter (P = 0.005). For CI, the targeting efficiency increased as well (P = 0.03), We conclude that currently used thrombolysis protocols do not fully exploit the delivery advantage offered by CI or PI. Fortunately, simple modifications offer the possibility of overcoming these drawbacks. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Clinically, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (F-18-FDG-PET/CT) is useful in the evaluation of various types of human cancers. While PET analysis has been established to evaluate subcutaneous lesions of human cancers in mice, its applications for internal lesions are still being developed. We are currently evaluating new PET approaches for the effective evaluation of in vivo metastatic lesions in the internal organs of small experimental animals. In this study, we analyzed in vivo hepatic metastases of human colonic cancer in immunodeficient mice (NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2R gamma(null), NOG) using PET imaging. This new PET approach has been proposed for the evaluation of in vivo metastatic lesions in internal organs. The human colon cancer line HCT116 (1.0x10(5) and 1.0x10(6) cells/mouse) was transplanted by intrasplenic injection. F-18-FDG-PET/CT scans were performed 2 weeks after transplantation. After PET/CT scans, histopathological examinations were performed. PET/CT analysis disclosed multiple metastatic foci and increased standardized uptake values (SUV) of FDG in the livers of NOG mice (control, SUVmean 0.450+/-0.033, SUVmax 0.635+/-0.017; 1.0x10(5) cells, 0.853+/-0.087, 1.254+/-0.237; 1.0x10(6) cells, 1.211+/-0.108, 1.701+/-0.158). There were significant differences in FDG uptakes between the three groups (ANOVA, P=0.017 in SUVmean; P=0.044 in SUVmax, n=2). We clearly and quantitatively detected images of hepatic metastasis in the livers of NOG mice by F-18-FDG-PET/CT in vivo. PET/CT analysis of internal organ lesions of human cancerous xenografts is a new reliable experimental system to simulate metastases. This model system is useful for analyzing metastatic mechanisms and for developing new novel drugs targeting hepatic metastases of cancer.

ID DIFFUSION
AB This work investigates analytically and numerically the wave instabilities in a three-agent chemical system undergoing anomalous diffusion. Anomalous diffusion is modeled using higher-dimensional space-fractional operators. The model considers one activator and two inhibitors, and it is a superdiffusive extension of some reaction-diffusion systems in the literature (Phys D Nonlinear Phenom 199(1-2):264-277, 2004). The model under investigation is presented in generic form as a three-species reaction-diffusion system, so that it has broad applicability to a wide range of chemical and biological systems. A weakly nonlinear analysis is performed, dispersive curves of eigenvalues are plotted and their behavior is analyzed. This analysis reveals that the critical value of the wave number for wave instability increases when the superdiffusive exponent decreases. The numerical scheme is performed and some numerical simulations are conducted as evidence of the analytical predictions. We show how the evolution of spatio-temporal patterns is related to meaningful parameters. In particular, we demonstrate that the system exhibits the coexistence of regular and irregular structures, forming complex patterns that are not familiar in standard reaction-diffusion systems.

AB Statistical properties of order-driven double-auction markets with Bid-Ask spread are investigated through the dynamical quantities such as response function. We first attempt to utilize the so-called Madhavan-Richardson-Roomans model (MRR for short) to simulate the stochastic process of the price-change in empirical data sets (say, EUR/JPY or USD/JPY exchange rates) in which the Bid-Ask spread fluctuates in time. We find that the MRR theory apparently fails to simulate so much as the qualitative behaviour ('non-monotonic' behaviour) of the response function R(l) (l denotes the difference of times at which the response function is evaluated) calculated from the data. Especially, we confirm that the stochastic nature of the Bid-Ask spread causes apparent deviations from a linear relationship between the R(l) and the auto-correlation function C(l), namely, R(l) proportional to-C(l). To make the microscopic model of double-auction markets having stochastic Bid-Ask spread, we use the minority game with a finite market history length and find numerically that appropriate extension of the game shows quite similar behaviour of the response function to the empirical evidence. We also reveal that the minority game modeling with the adaptive ('annealed') look-up table reproduces the non-linear relationship R(l) proportional to-fC(l)) (f(x) stands for a non-linear function leading to 'lambda-shapes') more effectively than the fixed ('quenched') look-up table does.

AB There have been claims that new gambling technology is hazardous to player health, and that technological interventions can alleviate gambling-related harm. In this paper, we systematically review the empirical research about the nexus between gambling and technology to evaluate the veracity of these claims. We use a public health perspective (i.e., the Epidemiologic Triangle) to organize and present study results (i.e., agent, host, and environment). This review intends to offer insight about emerging technology and identify areas that indicate a need for additional research. Forty-seven studies met our inclusion and exclusion criteria; a review of this body of work shows that attempts to develop and implement safety features for new gambling technology are promising, but methodologically are rudimentary and limited in scope. Increased attention to the dynamic interaction among host, agent, and environment factors hold potential to advance the field. In addition, improved study methods (e.g., longitudinal analyses of actual betting behavior), and collaboration among policymakers, manufacturers, and researchers can increase understanding of how new gambling technology affects the public health and stimulate new strategies for implementing effective public health interventions.

AB Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin-a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms. The Digital Twin Emulator can support design decisions, test what-if system configurations, verify and validate the actual behavior of the complete system off-line, test realistic reactions, and provide statistics on the system's performance.

AB As electronic waste (e-waste) becomes one of the fastest growing environmental concerns, remanufacturing may be a promising solution. However, the profitability of take-back systems is hampered by several factors, including the lack of information on the quantity and timing of to-be-returned used products to a remanufacturing facility. Factors that contribute to this unpredictability in the waste stream include product design features, consumers' awareness of recycling opportunities, sociodemographic characteristics, peer pressure, and the tendency of consumers to keep used items in storage. A system that helps predict when the consumer will stop using a product and store, resell, recycle, or discard it could help manufacturers better estimate return trends. The objective of this paper is to develop an agent-based simulation (ABS) framework that integrates a discrete choice analysis (DCA) technique to predict consumer end-of-use (EOU) decisions. The proposed simulation tools examine the impact of design features, interaction among individual consumers, and sociodemographic criteria related to the number of e-product returns. A numerical example of a cellphone take-back system has been provided to show the application of the model.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Synthetic population serves as an agent group of the population of activity patterns that possesses identical socio-economic characteristics applied on the model that forecasts the travel demand in the activity-based profile. During the development of agentbased traffic simulation model, the accuracy of simulation outcomes relies highly on population synthesis. This study endeavors to develop a synthetic population, based on the Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm for the activity-based travel demand model. Hill climbing and cooling schedule are essential elements to be considered when applying SA into the synthetic population. Also, Metropolis-Hasting Algorithm was employed to decide whether to select or dismiss the follow-up distribution so that hill climbing phenomenon can be prevented. Additionally, the stability of the algorithm was figured through a scenario analysis of the optimal combination of iteration and temperature T on cooling issue. On the basis of this result, the current condition of micro sample and census data were utilized to compare the IPF (Iterative Proportional Fitting) of previous methodology with the establishment result of suggested algorithm. It is found that the algorithm is valid and built with the synthetic population based on SA through statistical verification. It is resulted from the application of the suggested SA method that such tradition algorithm as IPF has zero-cell or sample biased problems. However, not only can SA algorithm overcome such problems but also it can effectively address hill climbing and cooling schedule issues.

AB The evolution of life cycle assessment (LCA) from a merely comparative tool for the assessment of products to a policy analysis tool proceeds by incorporating increasingly Complex modelling approaches. In more recent studies of complex systems, such as the agriculture sector or mobility, agent-based modelling (ABM) has been introduced as tool for life cycle inventory modelling. The promises of such ABM/LCA coupled models include the consideration of human behaviour and local variabilities in the studied system as well as scenario modelling for emerging systems. The acceptance of this new approach depends, among other things, on the handling of uncertainty and variability forthcoming from various sources. As the complexity of a methodology increases, it also becomes increasingly challenging to adequately handle uncertainty and variability, and be confident about an inference. In the case of ABM/ LCA coupled models, the different nature of both parts (non-linear computational ABM and linear deterministic LCA) poses an additional challenge. The sources of uncertainty and variability and the preferable propagation methods differ for both parts and clear guidance is needed. Yet no study, to our best knowledge, has addressed this issue, although its need has been expressed by several authors. In this paper, to make uncertainty analysis of ABM/LCA coupled models operational, the different uncertainty sources in both models are identified and a systematic classification is proposed. The efforts in both fields to propagate these uncertainty sources are reviewed and discussed against three criteria (applicability, accuracy and computational effort). Using ABM within LCA adds new uncertainty sources to the LCI and limits the number of applicable propagation methods, as the coupled model can no longer be expressed as an explicit formula. The context of uncertainty sources (e.g. nature of uncertainty and available information) determines which propagation method is the most appropriate and promises high accuracy, while the choice might be constraint by the computational effort.

AB Twenty-three experimental cattle, mainly calves, were each inoculated 1-3 times with one of ten Finnish Borrelia burgdorferi sensu late strains. All three genospecies were represented. Borreliae were administered mainly by both intravenous (about 10(6) to 10(9) spirochaetes) and intradermal (10(4)) routes, and on six occasions subcutaneously (10(3)) only. For infectivity control and comparison purposes mice and rabbits were inoculated simultaneously. Immune responses in cattle were monitored both with whole-cell sonicate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IgG-ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescent assay (IgM-IgG-IFA). Five Finnish strains and the American strain B31 were used as antigens. No clinical signs of borreliosis were observed. Of the strains, 7/10 were interpreted by the immune responses to have caused relatively short-term subclinical infections of varying intensity. Borreliae could not be isolated from blood or other organ specimens of cattle. A rough estimate of the mean infectious dose in the conditions of experiments is 10(6) to 10(7) organisms. In conclusion, the overall result appears to argue a low susceptibility of cattle to clinical borreliosis, at least when infected by Finnish strains of the agent. Significant antigen-specific differences were observed both by ELISA and LFA in detection and quantification of immune responses. As a rule, the homologous antigen was found to be the most sensitive. Genospecies differences were mostly distinct. Antigens of two Borrelia garinii isolates proved practically equal in sensitivity, whereas major differences were displayed between two Borrelia afzelii antigens. In an IFA study, an American (B31) and a Finnish B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain proved equally sensitive as antigens. In two relatively strong primary immune responses the antigen-specific measurement differences were such that diagnostically in a cross-sectional study only the homologous antigen or an antigen of the same genospecies would have been sufficiently sensitive to show a positive result.

AB By studying two well known hypotheses in economics, this paper illustrates how emergent properties can be shown in an agent-based artificial stock market. The two hypotheses considered are the efficient market hypothesis and the rational expectations hypothesis. We inquire whether the macrobehavior depicted by these two hypotheses is consistent with our understanding of the microbehavior. In this agent-based model, genetic programming is applied to evolving a population of traders learning over time. We first apply a series of econometric tests to show that the EMH and the REH can be satisfied with some portions of the artificial time series. Then, by analyzing traders' behavior, we show that these aggregate results cannot be interpreted as a simple scaling-up of individual behavior. A conjecture based on sunspot-like signals is proposed to explain why macrobehavior can be very different from microbehavior. We assert that the huge search space attributable to genetic programming can induce sunspot-like signals, and we use simulated evolved complexity of forecasting rules and Granger causality tests to examine this assertion.

TI APROTININ - THE IDEAL ANTICOAGULANT
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF VASCULAR SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
DE APROTININ; HEPARIN; THROMBOSIS; ANTICOAGULANT
AB The serine proteinase inhibitor, aprotinin, significantly reduces transfusion requirements during open heart surgery.  Whether this benefit is associated with an increased tendency to thrombosis has not been studied.  We investigated the effect of aprotinin in an experimental arterial thrombosis model.  In 17 male Sprague-Dawley rats, the infrarenal aorta was replaced with 1.0-mm diameter PTFE grafts of varying lengths.  The time to graft occlusion, recorded by palpation, Doppler ultrasound and a distal bleeding test, was 20.2 +/- 1.8 min, 35.8 +/- 6.1 min and 43.7 +/- 6.6 min for grafts of 10, 7.5 and 5.0 mm respectively (r = -0.98, p < 0.05).  Following PTFE graft placement 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were given saline (n = 6), aprotinin (n = 6), heparin (n = 6), and heparin + aprotinin (n = 6).  The time to occlusion was significantly prolonged in the aprotinin group (71.7 +/- 20.4 min vs. 20.2 +/- 1.8 min, p < 0.05).  The time to thrombosis for heparin + aprotinin and heparin alone was also significantly prolonged (p < 0.05).  Prothrombin times (PT) were 21.9 +/- 3.0 s for control, 29.4 +/- 6.2 s for aprotinin, 40.7 +/- 2.5 s for heparin and 39.9 +/- 14.5 s for heparin + aprotinin (p < 0.05 vs. control for all values).  Bleeding time was not prolonged with aprotinin (3.0 +/- 0.9 min vs. 2.9 +/- 0.7 min).  The bleeding time was 18.9 +/- 4.1 min for heparin + aprotinin and 22.5 +/- 2.3 min for heparin alone (p < 0.05 vs. control for both values).  This analysis demonstrates that high doses of aprotinin induce a significant anti-coagulant effect in a simple experimental thrombosis model.  This effect is less than that seen with heparin and is not associated with abnormalities in the bleeding time.  The simultaneous administration of heparin and aprotinin does not have a cumulative anti-coagulant effect although the presence of heparin with aprotinin results in prolonged prothrombin and bleeding times.  Thus aprotinin does not reduce increased thrombosis in this model.  We speculate that aprotinin may be the ideal agent for anti-coagulation in surgery.

AB We provide a formal account of an interface that bridges two different levels of dynamic processes manifested by mimicry: prey-prey interactions and predators' perception. Mimicry is a coevolutionary process between an animate selective agent and at least two similar organisms selected by agent's perception-driven actions. Attractor field model explains perceived similarity of forms by noting that in both human and animal cognition, morphologically intermediate forms are more likely to be perceived as belonging to rare rather than abundant forms. We formalize this model in terms of predators' perception space deformation using numerical simulations and argue that the probability of confusion between similar species creates pressure on the perception space, which in turn leads to inflation of regions of perception space with high density of species representations. Such inflation causes increased discrimination between species by a predator, which implies that adaptive mimicry could initially emerge more easily among atypical species because they do not need the same level of similarity to the model. We provide a theoretical instrument to conceptualize interdependence between objective measurable matrices and perceived matrices of the same external reality. We believe that our framework leads to a more precise understanding of the evolution of mimicry.

DT Article
ID SEPARATION; BEHAVIOR
AB Active swarms, consisting of individual agents which consume energy to move or produce work, are known to generate a diverse range of collective behaviors. Many examples of active swarms are biological in nature (e.g., fish shoals and bird flocks) and have been modeled extensively by numerical simulations. Such simulations of swarms usually assume that the swarm is homogeneous; that is, every agent has exactly the same dynamical properties. However, many biological swarms are highly heterogeneous, such as multispecies communities of micro-organisms in soil, and individual species may have a wide range of different physical properties. Here we explore heterogeneity by developing a simple model for the dynamics of a swarm of motile heterogeneous rodlike bacteria in the absence of hydrodynamic effects. Using molecular dynamics simulations of active rods confined within a two-dimensional rectangular channel, we first explore the case of homogeneous swarms and show that the key parameter governing both dynamics is ratio of the motility force to the steric force. Next we explore heterogeneous or mixed swarms in which the constituent self-propelled rods have a range of motilities and steric interactions. Our results show that the confining boundaries play a strong role in driving the segregation of mixed populations.

AB Oscillatory activity is ubiquitous in nervous systems, with solid evidence that synchronisation mechanisms underpin cognitive processes. Nevertheless, its informational content and relationship with behaviour are still to be fully understood. In addition, cognitive systems cannot be properly appreciated without taking into account brain-body- environment interactions. In this paper, we developed a model based on the Kuramoto Model of coupled phase oscillators to explore the role of neural synchronisation in the performance of a simulated robotic agent in two different minimally cognitive tasks. We show that there is a statistically significant difference in performance and evolvability depending on the synchronisation regime of the network. In both tasks, a combination of information flow and dynamical analyses show that networks with a definite, but not too strong, propensity for synchronisation are more able to reconfigure, to organise themselves functionally and to adapt to different behavioural conditions. The results highlight the asymmetry of information flow and its behavioural correspondence. Importantly, it also shows that neural synchronisation dynamics, when suitably flexible and reconfigurable, can generate minimally cognitive embodied behaviour.

AB This study investigates the effectiveness of international environmental agreements (IEAs) and how it might be affected by the development of pro-environmental behaviour among households and firms. We propose a new framework based on a two-nested-game approach composed by: (1) a one-shot game with two asymmetric countries that negotiate the international abatement target, and (2) an evolutionary game which describes the economic structure resulting from agents' interactions. These two games are nested because the initial economic structure determines the welfare of each country, and thus the outcome of Game 1 which, in turn, is embedded in Game 2, modifies the agents' pay-off and the economic structure thereof. Numerical simulation outcomes suggest three key messages. First, we find that global solutions do not automatically produce the expected effects irrespective of any free-riding assumption. Second, extreme climate risks might not lead to a high abatement target in the event of marked cross-country inequality. Third, adverse consumers' environmental attitudes might hamper the success of an IEA. The above observations entail that governments should not simply impose environmental laws. Rather, top-down policies and bottom-up interventions should be coordinated; otherwise, they might fail if undertaken in isolation.

AB The profitability of electronic waste (e-waste) recovery operations is quite challenging due to various sources of uncertainties in the quantity, quality, and timing of returns originating from consumers' behavior. The cloud-based remanufacturing concept, data collection, and information tracking technologies seem promising solutions toward the proper collection and recovery of product life cycle data under uncertainty. A comprehensive model that takes every aspect of recovery systems into account will help policy makers perform better decisions over a planning horizon. The objective of this study is to develop an agent based simulation (ABS) framework to model the overall product take-back and recovery system based on the product identity data available through cloud-based remanufacturing infrastructure. Sociodemographic properties of the consumers, attributes of the take-back programs, specific characteristics of the recovery process, and product life cycle information have all been considered to capture the optimum buy-back price (bbp) proposed for a product with the aim of controlling the timing and quality of incoming used products to collection sites for recovery. A numerical example of an electronic product take-back system and a simulation-based optimization are provided to illustrate the application of the model.

ID MOBILITY; EMERGENCE
AB Human mobility patterns (HMP) have become of interest to a variety of disciplines. The increasing availability of empirical data enables researchers to analyze patterns of people's movements. Recent work suggested that HMP follow a Levy-flight distribution and present regularity. Here, we present an innovative agent-based model that simulates HMP for various purposes. It is based on the combination of regular movements with spatial considerations, represented by an expanded gravitation model. The agents in this model have different attributes that affect their choice of destination and the duration they stay in each location. Thus, their movement mimics real-life situations. This is a stochastic, bottom-up model, yet it yields HMP that qualitatively fit HMP empirical data in terms of individuals, as well as the entire population. Our results also correspond to real-life phenomena in terms of urban spatial dynamics, that is, the emergence of popular locations in the city due to bottom-up behavior of people. Our model is novel in being based on the assumption that HMP are space-dependent as well as follow high regularity. To our knowledge, we are the first to succeed in simulating HMP not only at the inter-city scale but also at the intra-urban one.

AB Background Mathematical modelling has been a vital research tool for exploring complex systems, most recently to aid understanding of health system functioning and optimisation. System dynamics models (SDM) and agent-based models (ABM) are two popular complementary methods, used to simulate macro- and micro-level health system behaviour. This systematic review aims to collate, compare and summarise the application of both methods in this field and to identify common healthcare settings and problems that have been modelled using SDM and ABM. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, MathSciNet, ACM Digital Library, HMIC, Econlit and Global Health databases to identify literature for this review. We described papers meeting the inclusion criteria using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis, and made comparisons between the identified SDM and ABM literature. Results We identified 28 papers using SDM methods and 11 papers using ABM methods, one of which used hybrid SDM-ABM to simulate health system behaviour. The majority of SDM, ABM and hybrid modelling papers simulated health systems based in high income countries. Emergency and acute care, and elderly care and long-term care services were the most frequently simulated health system settings, modelling the impact of health policies and interventions such as those targeting stretched and under resourced healthcare services, patient length of stay in healthcare facilities and undesirable patient outcomes. Conclusions Future work should now turn to modelling health systems in low- and middle-income countries to aid our understanding of health system functioning in these settings and allow stakeholders and researchers to assess the impact of policies or interventions before implementation. Hybrid modelling of health systems is still relatively novel but with increasing software developments and a growing demand to account for both complex system feedback and heterogeneous behaviour exhibited by those who access or deliver healthcare, we expect a boost in their use to model health systems.

AB Purpose: To introduce Agent-Based Model (ABM) to physical activity (PA) research and, using data from a study of neighborhood walkability and walking behavior, to illustrate parameters for an ABM of walking behavior. Method: The concept, brief history, mechanism, major components, key steps, advantages, and limitations of ABM were first introduced. For illustration, 10 participants (age in years: mean = 68, SD = 8) were recruited from a walkable and a nonwalkable neighborhood. They wore AMP 331 triaxial accelerometers and GeoLogger GPA tracking devices for 21 days. Data were analyzed using conventional statistics and high-resolution geographic image analysis, which focused on a) path length, b) path duration, c) number of GPS reporting points, and d) interaction between distances and time. Results: Average steps by subjects ranged from 1810-10,453 steps per day (mean = 6899, SD = 3823). No statistical difference in walking behavior was found between neighborhoods (Walkable = 6710 +/- 2781, Nonwalkable = 7096 +/- 4674). Three environment parameters (ie, sidewalk, crosswalk, and path) were identified for future ABM simulation. Conclusion: ABM should provide a better understanding of PA behavior's interaction with the environment, as illustrated using a real-life example. PA field should take advantage of ABM in future research.

AB We compare the empirical performances of three risk-sharing arrangements involving idiosyncratic skill shocks: (a) where individuals are unable to directly insure their consumption against individual-specific shocks, (b) where agents strike long-term insurance contract with financial intermediaries involving a truth revelation constraint as in Kocherlakota and Pistaferri (2009), (c) full risk sharing. Based on the widely accepted assumption of cross-sectional log-normality of individual consumption levels, we work out closed form expressions of the pricing kernels for (a) and (b). We put these three models to test four financial market anomalies, namely the equity premium, currency premium, risk-free rate, and consumption-real exchange rate puzzles simultaneously in an integrated framework. We find that the pricing kernel associated with (a) outperforms the other two models in terms of the produced estimates of the agent's preference parameters and the model ability to predict the equity and currency premia, the risk-free rate, and the log growth in the exchange rate. However, the predictive ability is still far from satisfactory for all three models under scrutiny. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The offshore oil industry functions in a team work culture, in which operations depend not only on individuals' competency, but also on team skills. Team skills are even more necessary when it comes to handling emergency conditions as they challenge personnel on board with high risk, time pressure, and complexity. This raises the need for training that goes beyond conventional training programs and incorporates team skills exercises. The major difficulty to design such training is that it involves practicing emergency exercises with a potentially large number of participants. Such large-scale team exercises suffer from both organizational and educational drawbacks. One solution to this problem is to use artificial agents that can reproduce the behavior of the team members. This paper presents a behavior model that can simulate the response of general personnel during emergency situations. The variability in human behavior is modeled using different performance influencing factors (PIFs). Empirical evidence is used to identify the sources of variability that are encoded in the agents to allow a realistic range of human behaviors. Though variability can come from both physical and mental differences, the focus of this paper is on the later. Focus is given to across-subject variability rather than within-subject variability.

AB Mobile robots are envisioned to cooperate closely with humans and to integrate seamlessly into a shared environment. For locomotion, these environments resemble traversable areas which are shared between multiple agents like humans and robots. The seamless integration of mobile robots into these environments requires accurate predictions of human locomotion. This work considers optimal control and model predictive control approaches for accurate trajectory prediction and proposes to integrate aspects of human behavior to improve their performance. Recently developed models are not able to reproduce accurately trajectories that result from sudden avoidance maneuvers. Particularly, the human locomotion behavior when handling disturbances from other agents poses a problem. The goal of this work is to investigate whether humans alter their trajectory planning horizon, in order to resolve abruptly emerging collision situations. By modeling humans as model predictive controllers, the influence of the planning horizon is investigated in simulations. Based on these results, an experiment is designed to identify, whether humans initiate a change in their locomotion planning behavior while moving in a complex environment. The results support the hypothesis, that humans employ a shorter planning horizon to avoid collisions that are triggered by unexpected disturbances. Observations presented in this work are expected to further improve the generalizability and accuracy of prediction methods based on dynamic models.

ID ASYMPTOTIC FLOCKING; BEHAVIOR
AB We introduce a Cucker-Smale-type model for flocking, where the strength of interaction between two agents depends on their relative separation (called "topological distance" in previous works), which is the number of intermediate individuals separating them. This makes the model scale-free and is motivated by recent extensive observations of starling flocks, suggesting that the interaction ruling animal collective behavior depends on topological rather than the metric distance. We study the conditions leading to asymptotic flocking in the topological model, defined as the convergence of the agents' velocities to a common vector. The shift from metric to topological interactions requires development of new analytical methods, taking into account the graph-theoretical nature of the problem. Moreover, we provide a rigorous derivation of the mean-field limit of large populations, recovering kinetic and hydrodynamic descriptions. In particular, we introduce the novel concept of relative separation in continuum descriptions, which is applicable to a broad variety of models of collective behavior. As an example, we shortly discuss a topological modification of the attraction repulsion model and illustrate with numerical simulations that the modified model produces interesting new pattern dynamics.

AB Taphonomic studies, along with modern analogs arisen from experimentation, have been developed to discern the agents responsible for bone accumulations. A special focus has been given to carnivores, which may produce bone accumulations or interact with hominins by ravaging bones from archaeological sites. Although a great effort has been made to study several carnivore species (namely, felids, hyenids and canids), a limited knowledge concerning some scavenging species such as the striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena) remains. The present study shows the results of an experiment carried out at Olduvai Gorge (Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Tanzania) which aimed at assessing the impact of striped hyenas on a goat carcass. After human butchering, the goat carcass was deposited in an area near the FLK North site, where nocturnal carnivores are very active. The orientation and arrangement of the bone assemblage were documented daily and recorded with the aid of photogrammetric techniques. The behaviour of the carnivores acting on the carcasses was recorded by a motion camera picture. The only carnivore involved in the modification of the bone assemblage was the striped hyena. The results show that the post-ravaging behaviour of this species is similar to that previously documented for the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta). Oddly, after one night of carnivore ravaging, the experimental sample showed anisotropy. The carnivore ravaging carried out by the striped hyena modified the orientation pattern of the simulated archaeological site. Thus, carnivore ravaging may also impact the spatial orientation pattern of archaeological sites.

AB Background: We present a multilevel, agent based, in silico model that represents the dynamics of rolling, activation, and adhesion of individual leukocytes in vitro. Object-oriented software components were designed, verified, plugged together, and then operated in ways that represent the molecular and cellular mechanisms believed responsible for leukocyte rolling and adhesion. The result is an in silico analogue of an experimental in vitro system. The experimentally measured, phenotypic attributes of the analogue were compared and contrasted to those of leukocytes in vitro from three different experimental conditions.
   Results: The individual in silico dynamics of "rolling" on simulated P-selectin, and separately on simulated VCAM-1, were an acceptable match to individual in vitro distance-time and velocity-time measurements. The analogues are also able to represent the transition from rolling to adhesion on P-selectin and VCAM-1 in the presence of GRO-alpha chemokine. The individual in silico and in vitro behavioral similarities translated successfully to population level measures. These behavioral similarities were enabled in part by subdividing the functionality of the analogue's surface into 600 independent, "cell"- controlled, equally capable modules of comparable functionality.
   Conclusion: The overlap in phenotypic attributes of our analogue with those of leukocytes in vitro confirm the considerable potential of our model for studying the key events that determine the behavioral outcome of individual leukocytes during rolling, activation, and adhesion. Our results provide an important foundation and framework for future in silico research into plausible causal links between well-documented, subcellular molecular level events and the variety of systemic phenotypic attributes that distinguish normal leukocyte adhesion from abnormal disease-associated adhesion.

AB Background Tc-99m glucarate has recently been reported to be an infarct-avid agent. The feasibility of imaging with (TC)-T-99m glucarate was evaluated for the early diagnosis of nonreperfused and reperfused myocardial infarction and compared with localization of simultaneously administered In-111 anti-myosin.
   Methods and Results Four groups of six rabbits each were studied. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was kept persistently occluded (n = 6) or reperfused after 40 minutes (n = 6) in rabbits. After confirmation of LAD occlusion by Tl-201 scintigraphy, a mixture of Tc-99m glucarate (15.7+/-1.6 mCi) and In-111 anti-myosin (0.53 +/- 0.03 mCi) was administered intravenously. Another group of rabbits (n = 6) with 5 or 15 minutes of LAD occlusion were used to assess the affinity of Tc-99m glucarate for the ischemic myocardium. The remaining 6 rabbits with reperfused myocardial infarction were used for the assessment of subcellular localization of Tc-99m glucarate. Tc-99m glucarate cleared rapidly from circulation (elimination t(1/2), 36 minutes). Infarcts were visualized within 10 minutes in reperfused and within 30 minutes in nonreperfused coronary territories after intravenous administration. In-111 anti-myosin delineated reperfused infarcts within 1 to 3 hours, but no uptake was seen in persistently occluded rabbits. Tc-99m glucarate uptake in reperfused and nonreperfused infarct centers was 28 and 12 times greater, respectively, than that in normal myocardium (P = .0001). A direct correlation between glucarate and antimyosin localization (r = .60 for nonreperfused; 0.76 for reperfused; P < .0001) was observed. Ischemic hearts showed no glucarate uptake. Subcellularly, Tc-99m glucarate localized predominantly in the nuclear fraction of the infarct, with lesser extents in the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic fractions.
   Conclusions Noninvasive imaging of myocardial infarcts with Tc-99m glucarate is possible within minutes in persistently occluded or reperfused myocardial infarcts. Early detectability results from the rapid blood clearance and high avidity of glucarate for the acutely necrotic myocardial tissue.

AB The traditional Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) processes allow improving the performance of mature oilfields after waterflooding projects. Chemical EOR processes modify different physical properties of the fluids and/or the rock in order to mobilize the oil that remains trapped. Furthermore, combined processes have been proposed to improve the performance, using the properties and synergy of the chemical agents. This paper presents a novel simulator developed for a combined surfactant/polymer flooding in EOR processes. It studies the flow of a two-phase, five-component system (aqueous and organic phases with water, petroleum, surfactant, polymer and salt) in porous media. Polymer and surfactant together affect each other's interfacial and rheological properties as well as the adsorption rates. This is known in the industry as Surfactant-Polymer Interaction (SPI). The simulations showed that optimum results occur when both chemical agents are injected overlapped, with the polymer in the first place. This procedure decreases the surfactant's adsorption rates, rendering higher recovery factors. The presence of the salt as fifth component slightly modifies the adsorption rates of both polymer and surfactant, but its influence on the phase behavior allows increasing the surfactant's sweep efficiency.

TI 'Partial' competition of heterobivalent ligand binding may be mistaken
   for allosteric interactions: a comparison of different target

AB Background and PurposeNon-competitive drugs that confer allosteric modulation of orthosteric ligand binding are of increasing interest as therapeutic agents. Sought-after advantages include a ceiling level to drug effect and greater receptor-subtype selectivity. It is thus important to determine the mode of interaction of newly identified receptor ligands early in the drug discovery process and binding studies with labelled orthosteric ligands constitute a traditional approach for this. According to the general allosteric ternary complex model, allosteric ligands that exhibit negative cooperativity may generate distinctive competition' curves: they will not reach baseline levels and their nadir will increase in par with the orthosteric ligand concentration. This behaviour is often considered a key hallmark of allosteric interactions.
   Experimental ApproachThe present study is based on differential equation-based simulations.
   Key ResultsThe differential equation-based simulations revealed that the same competition binding' pattern was also obtained when a monovalent ligand binds to one of the target sites of a heterobivalent ligand, even if this process is exempt of allosteric interactions. This pattern was not strictly reciprocal when the binding of each of the ligands was recorded. The prominence of this phenomenon may vary from one heterobivalent ligand to another and we suggest that this phenomenon may take place with ligands that have been proposed to bind according to two-domain' and charniere' models.
   Conclusions and ImplicationsThe present findings indicate a familiar experimental situation where bivalency may give rise to observations that could inadvertently be interpreted as allosteric binding. Yet, both mechanisms could be differentiated based on alternative experiments and structural considerations.

AB Mobile product recommendation agents (RAs) are software systems that operate on mobile hand-held devices, using wireless Internet to support users' decisions en route, such as consumers' product choices in retail stores. As the demand for ubiquitous access to the web grows, potential benefits of mobile RAs have been recognized, albeit with little supporting empirical evidence. We investigate whether and how mobile RAs enhance users' decisions in retail stores by reducing the effort to make purchase decisions while augmenting the accuracy of the decisions. In addition, to identify potential design principles for mobile RAs, we compare and evaluate two interaction styles of mobile RAs: alternative-driven (RA-AL) versus attribute-driven (RA-AT) interactions. The results of a laboratory experiment conducted in a simulated store indicate that mobile RAs reduced users' perceived effort and increased accuracy of their decisions. Furthermore, RA-AL users made more accurate decisions than RA-AT users due to the RA-AL's interaction style, which was compatible with the way in which users processed information and made decisions in the store. These empirical results support the notion that mobile RAs should be designed to fit the user's task undertaken in the particular context.

AB Stable operation under low reducing agent rate condition of blast furnace is necessary to realize to contribute solution of global warming. Under low reducing agent rate operation, large amount of powder materials like fine coke and unburnt pulverize coal generate in the furnace. It is known that the heavy accumulation of these powders in the packed bed of blast furnace deteriorates the permeability, and cause operation trouble in extreme case. Thus it is important to understand the flow and accumulation behaviors of powder in packed bed. This paper discussed the powder motion in the packed bed through numerical simulation under simplified condition. A simplified packing structure, namely an orifice consisting of three spherical particles that touched each other and were in equilateral triangle arrangement, was picked out from the packed bed. The powder trajectories passing through this orifice were tracked by using the discrete element method. The simulation results showed that only a few powder particles initiated the blockage of the particle orifice. Additionally the effects of mechanical properties of the particles on the passage and the blockage behaviors were also revealed.

AB Demand Response (DR)-activated smart thermostats can be used to exploit the flexibility of residential heating and/or cooling systems. However, the acceptance/rejection of DR events depends on how occupants interact with their thermostats during the activated setpoint modulations. This interaction is mainly driven by their thermal comfort needs. Thus, understanding and modelling occupants' comfort driven interactions with thermostats is crucial for the design, assessment, and control of DR strategies. In this paper, we describe, calibrate, and show the in-use potentialities of a novel framework which is able to model occupants' interactions with thermostats in residential buildings in winter. The framework includes a stochastic agent-based model of thermostat adjustments, whose dynamic thermal discomfort predictions are based on a two-node thermo-physiological model coupled with a dynamic thermal perception model. This represents a novelty with respect to the most often used static PMV/PPD model. Furthermore, the agent-based model is built on an activity and presence model and, therefore, is able to account for the diversity of the activities carried out by the occupants. User interaction data from about 9,000 connected Canadian thermostats included in the Donate Your Data (DYD) dataset are used to calibrate and establish the empirical foundation of the thermostat interaction model. Finally, we simulate typical DR-activated setpoint modulations in two residential buildings characterized by different levels of insulation and we use the framework to predict occupants' override rates as a function of the indoor temperature and the time since the start of the DR event. The derived relationship can be directly used to inform the design and control of setpoint modulations in residential buildings.

AB A modified Rayleigh-Plesset equation is derived to model the oscillation of a contrast agent microbubble attached to an elastic wall. The obtained equation shows that contact with the wall affects the bubble oscillation as if the bubble oscillated in a liquid with a changed (effective) density. Depending on the wall properties, the effective density can be either higher or lower than the real liquid density and hence the natural frequency of the attached bubble can be either lower or higher than the natural frequency of the same bubble in an unbounded liquid. Numerical simulations are made for a contrast bubble with shell properties similar to those used in the Marmottant shell model. The cases of a rigid wall and a plastic wall are compared. The properties of the plastic wall are set to correspond to walls of OptiCell chambers commonly used in experiments. It is shown that contact with the rigid wall decreases the natural frequency of the bubble as compared to its natural frequency in an unbounded liquid, whereas contact with the OptiCell wall increases the natural frequency of the bubble. Bubble resonance curves for three cases are compared: the bubble in an unbounded liquid; the bubble at a distance from an OptiCell wall; the bubble in contact with an OptiCell wall. Results obtained for a 2-mu m-radius bubble insonified with a 10-cycle, 40 kPa, 2.1 MHz Gaussian pulse show that contact with the OptiCell wall leads to the following effects. The amplitude of the radial oscillation of the attached bubble is decreased by about 70% as compared to that of the same bubble in an unbounded liquid. The fundamental component in the spectrum of the scattered pressure of the attached bubble is decreased by 12 dB. A strong second harmonic appears in the spectrum of the scattered pressure of the attached bubble; its magnitude is about 11.5 dB higher than the level corresponding to the case of an unbounded liquid.

AB A new type of high-efficiency dust suppressant for mines was synthesised by graft copolymerisation, with carboxymethyl chitosan serving as the matrix, and the microscopic adsorption mechanism of this dust suppressant was studied by molecular dynamics simulation. Four optimum conditions were determined by a single-factor experiment, namely, the amount of 2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid was 5 g, the amount of initiator was 2.0% monomer, the amount of crosslinking agent was 0.2 g, and the optimum reaction temperature was 50 ?C. The results of the water absorption test show that the product has strong water absorption, and the water absorption rate can reach 138 g/g, The results of the molecular dynamics simulation show that the structure and morphology of the dust suppressant do not change during water absorption; only the diffusion of water molecules in the molecular gap of the dust suppressant changes. The experimental results of the dust suppression performance show that the product can cover the surface of coal dust and form a colloidal film, which can effectively inhibit the spread of coal dust. The results of molecular dynamics simulation show that the dust suppressant acts primarily on the coal/water interface, which promotes the diffusion of water molecules on the coal surface. With the progress of the reaction, the dust suppressant molecules combine with each other and move and permeate towards the coal seam, with one end facing the coal seam and the other facing the water phase, thereby attracting water molecules to migrate towards the coal seam.

AB Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is gaining popularity for treating colorectal liver metastases by inducing image guided tumor hyperthermia. In order to reduce tumor recurrence, adjuvant therapies have been administered post-RFA. We hypothesized that tumor cells escaping RFA cytotoxicity by being in the sublethal zones of tumor might develop differential behavior toward cytotoxic drugs. Here, we used cultured human colorectal cancer cells to evaluate the interaction between heat treatment and chemotherapeutic agents. Human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT116 were subjected to temperatures of 42 degrees to 50 degrees C for 15 min, in combination with 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, or irinotecan at different sequences. Cytotoxicity was determined by MTT assay. The cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining. The expression of several genes associated with drug sensitivity was quantitated by real-time RT-PCR before and after heat treatment. Either heat treatment at 45 degrees C by simultaneous or pre-treatment with three different chemotherapeutic agents didn't affect the cytotoxicity of the combined treatment to HT29 and HCT116 cells, except for irinotecan treatment in HCT116 cells. However, when pre-exposure to 45 degrees C, HCT116 cells, but not HT29 cells, developed resistance to these three drugs. In an analysis of cell cycle profile after the drug followed heat treatment, a longer delay in cell cycle progression in HCT116 cells was observed in comparison to HT29 cells. Furthermore, HCT116 and HT29 cells exhibited different expression profiles of several drug-related genes in response to heat treatment at 45 degrees C. An observation of a differential response to the drug and heat treatment sequences between two human colon cancer cell lines suggests that tumor heterogeneity and selection of chemotherapeutic agents need to be under consideration in the clinical setting.

AB A miniaturized Planar Field Asymmetric Ion Mobility Spectrometer (P-FAIMS) has been simulated in N-2 at ambient pressure using COMSOL Multiphysics software. Micro-IMS is based on ion gas-phase separation due to the dependence of ion mobility with electric field. Ions are selected by a DC voltage characteristic of each kind of ion. The average kinetic behaviour of ions in high electric fields conditions is well known but not the chemical reactions and physical collisions related with. The aim of this work is the modelling of the average kinetic behaviour of different kind of ions in a P-FAIMS taking into account the main factors involved in their movement. Three different compounds, with high impact on security applications, have been studied: an explosive 2,4,6-trinitrotouluene (TNT-H)(-), a volatile organic compound Ac2H+ and a chemical warfare agent simulant DMMPH+ that emulates gas sarin. Displacement simulations along the P-FAIMS of theirs vapour phase ions have been done at different values of drift electric field amplitude to gas number density (E/N) ratio. Ions were selected between the ones present in the literature that covers the previous applications and the ones with more reliable experimental data of the main parameters involved in the definition of ions mobility needed for their analysis. Results show that simulations of ions behaviour in a P-FAIMS are possible with COMSOL Multiphysics software and that the time and intensity at which ions are detected are in good agreement with an experimental data in the literature.

DE Voting Procedure; Decision Processes; Brazil
ID QUALITY
AB How does the use of a secret vote affect the likelihood that legislators will punish their peers? Two contending arguments exist in the literature: some argue that secret voting may be prejudicial, while others argue that it may help accountability. We address this controversy by analyzing the case of the Brazilian Congress, which uses a sequential combination of open and secret voting procedures. We begin with a statistical analysis of the Congress that establishes some key parameters of variance. The results of this exercise are then used to populate an agent-based model of the Congress, which is used to simulate a variety of potential behaviors under diverse conditions. Agent-based modeling enables us to extend the discussion beyond the small-n of cases available in the real world, demonstrating that slight changes in parameters can lead to very large changes in the overall effect of voting procedure. Modeling voting behaviors under different conditions, we conclude that both arguments about secret voting may hold true, and that the effects of the type of vote - open or secret - will be contingent on factors such as the power of the accused politician, the composition of the voting body, and the publicity given to the accusations.

AB Isotope effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon and thus poses a challenge for the separation of isotopes of an element of interest, especially for heavy elements. Isotopic fractionation of zinc is also quite difficult and challenging but is necessitated due to various applications of its isotopes ranging from nuclear medicine to nuclear power reactors. Here, we developed the dibenzo-18-crown-6 (DB18C6) ether-functionalized poly(methacrylic acid) (PMA) resin by exploiting the ion and isotope recognition ability of the crown ether using DFT/MD simulations followed by experiments for isotopic fractionation of zinc. The PMADB18C6 adsorbent was prepared and suitably characterized. Both computational and experimental findings demonstrate that the adsorption and isotope separation of zinc with PMADB18C6 are due to the molecular recognition effect of the "O" dipole of the crown ether. Furthermore, both MD simulations and experiments suggest Langmuir type adsorption isotherms. The adsorption of Zn(2+)ions on the PMA resin is predicted to be endothermic, whereas it is exothermic on the PMADB18C6 resin, as revealed from the experimentally observed enthalpy change. A small scale fixed bed column study was demonstrated to test the scale-up application. The values of the experimental separation factors: 1.0013 for 66/64 and 1.0027 for 68/64 confirm the computationally predicted results of 1.00088 and 1.0010, respectively, thus establishing the combined strength of the theory and experiments for the identification of efficient fractionating agents for a complex quantum isotope effect which eventually helps in planning further experiments in view of medicinal and technological applications of zinc isotopes.

AB A systematic spectroscopic study of (R)-2-Amino-1-Phenylethanol was carried out using FT-IR, FT Raman, NMR and UV analysis. FT-IR (4000-400 cm-1) and FT-Raman (4000-100 cm-1) spectrum of the title molecule were recorded in solid phase, the H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra were recorded in CDCI3 (deuterated chloroform) solution phase and the UV Vis (200-800 nm) spectrum was recorded in gas phase and ethanol solution phase. Potential energy surface (PES) scan was performed using B3LYP functional with 6-311++G (d, p) basis set. The geometrical parameters (such as bond length, bond angle, dihedral angles) and theoretical frequencies of the title compound were studied from density functional theory (OFT) using B3LYP and B3PW91 functionals with 6-311++G (d, p) basis sets. The computed frequencies were scaled and compared with the experimental values and potential energy distribution (PED) has been tabulated. A comparative study of atomic charges was made by calculating Mulliken, Natural Population Analysis (NPA) and Electrostatic Potential (ESP) simultaneously, with B3LYP/6311++G (d, p) basis set. H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra were recorded and chemical shifts were compared to TMS by Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) method. Electronic properties such as excitation energy, energy gap between HOMO and LUMO was calculated using time dependent OFT technique. NBO analysis, which predicts the different possibilities of electronic transition in the molecule, was computed using B3PW91 functional with 6-311++G (d, p) basis set. The thermodynamic properties such as heat capacity, entropy and enthalpy at different temperatures were computed and analyzed. Molecular docking study shows that the secondary hydroxyl group and the primary amino group in the aliphatic chain attached to the benzene ring are crucial for binding and the title compound might exhibit inhibitory activity against Bacteroides fragilis (3P24) and may act as anti-bacterial agent.

ID DECISION
AB The emerging new area referred to as computational science or science done on a computer adds a third dimension to the traditional methods of theoretical and experimental approaches.  Counterparts to computational science such as computational linguistics, computational engineering and others arc beginning to take roots.  Naturally, new research paths and opportunities in computational epidemiology must also be explored.
   One of the major challenges in epidemiologic research is the issue of how to realistically and effectively handle complex bioepidemiologic dynamics involving interactions between humans or animals, etiological agents and the multiple array of environmental and socioeconomic determinants which affect these populations.  To understand the behavior of such complex biological systems, it is useful to devise computer based simulation models.  Computational epidemiologic approaches now provide alternative avenues to classical laboratory and/or field experimental methods.  Systems which may be impractical because they are too large, or, not feasible because the cost is too prohibitive can now be simulated realistically.  In the past obtaining solutions to biomathematical equations with any degree of complexity was impossible.  However, the availability of powerful computers now makes the quantitative analysis of such systems feasible and indeed practical.
   With this in mind our research at Tuskegee University has focused on:  a) Epidemiologic modelling and expert systems, and, b) Hypertex/hypermedia based epidemiologic knowledge management.  The case studies for our research involve the bioepidemiologic dynamics of two complex host-parasite systems of trypanosoma and schistosoma.  The ultimate goal is to develop resources and methodologies based on computational technology to advance epidemiologic research.  The paper will address the methodological issues and findings as well as questions related to configuring an appropriate research workstation for computational epidemiology.

AB Epoxy resins with high thermal stability, good mechanical properties and liquid oxygen compatibility are primary candidates in large cryogenic engineering projects, particularly for cryotank applications to avoid catastrophic accidents. Herein, an experimental characterization and molecular dynamics modeling are conducted for the thermal stability, mechanical properties and liquid oxygen compatibility of multiple epoxy systems. The multiple epoxy systems are synthesized to achieve a comprehensive evaluation of their thermal stability, room-temperature and cryogenic mechanical properties as well as liquid oxygen compatibility. Concretely speaking, the anti-oxidation properties of the degradation are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and the glass transition temperature (Tg) is measured by the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The tensile test and fracture toughness test under room-temperature/cryogenic conditions (90 K) are chosen for determining their mechanical performances. Moreover, limited oxygen index measurements and liquid oxygen impact tests are utilized to characterize the flame retardancy and liquid oxygen compatibility, respectively. In parallel, molecular dynamics models are established to construct the high cross-linking structures and predict thermomechanical properties, which helps reveal the relationship between the molecular structures and macroscopic properties. Finally, the synergistic effects of organic/inorganic flame retardants and polyurethane toughener are proven to be effective to balance the liquid oxygen compatibility and mechanical properties. The valuable and extensive evaluation data in this work could be beneficial to the epoxy resin system design for cryotank applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Resveratrol (3,4',5,-trihydroxystilbene, RV), an ingredient of wine, is an inhibitor of the proliferation-linked enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and shows a broad spectrum of cytotoxic effects against human cancer cells. In order to enhance these effects, we introduced additional hydroxyl moieties into the molecule. In the present study, the activity of a novel RV analog, 3,3',4,4,5,5-hexahydroxystilbene (M8), was investigated in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells.
   Methods. Cytotoxicity of M8 alone or in combination with Ara-C was assessed employing growth inhibition assays. Effects of M8 on nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) were examined by HPLC. The apoptotic potential of M8 and RV was compared using a specific double-staining method and inhibition of TNF-alpha-induced activation of NF-kappa B was studied. Cell-cycle distribution was analyzed by FACS.
   Results. Addition of ascorbic acid decreased the IC50 value of M8 from 6.25 mu M to 2 mu M. M8 depleted dATP and dTTP pools to 41% and 21% of control values, whereas dCTP pools increased to 199% of untreated controls. In addition, TTP, ATP, CTP, and GTP concentrations were decreased while UTP concentrations increased. M8 induced apoptosis at concentrations significantly lower than RV and could remarkably inhibit the activation of NF-kappa B. M8 arrested cells in the S phase of the cell cycle while depleting cells in the G2-M phase and exhibited synergistic combination effects when applied simultaneously with Ara-C.
   Conclusion. Due to these promising results, this novel polyhydroxylated stilbene derivative might become an additional option for the treatment of leukemia and therefore deserves further preclinical and in vivo testing.

AB BACKGROUND. A Phase I and feasibility study of combined docetaxel (D) plus paclitaxel (P) was undertaken to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for each analogue delivered concomitantly on a weekly schedule.
   METHODS. Patients were accrued in 3-6 patient cohorts to P administered over a course of 45-60 minutes followed by D infused over a course of 30 minutes for 4 consecutive weeks with the cycles repeated at 6 weeks. The MTD was defined as the dose of each agent administered with at least Grade 3 (according to National Cancer Institute standard criteria) hematologic toxicity in 50% of the patients but without Grade 4 toxicity.
   RESULTS. Twenty patients received D plus P weekly for 4 weeks at 4 dose levels. At the highest P dose (80 mg/m(2); total dose per cycle, 320 mg/m(2)) 2 of 6 patients received treatment for 4 consecutive weeks but 5 of 6 patients developed hematologic and/or nonhematologic (skin) DLTs. The recommended treatment doses for this combined taxane regimen is D, 35 mg/m(2)/week, plus P, 65 mg/m(2)/week, for 4 weeks. An unusual cutaneous syndrome was observed in four patients that was manifested as erythema and blistering on the dorsum of the hands.
   CONCLUSIONS. The lack of complete cross-resistance for D and P in experimental systems and the clinical observation that tumor resistance to one taxane does not necessarily convey resistance to the alternative taxane was the basis for exploring the use of both analogues administered simultaneously. This Phase I trial establishes the optimal weekly dose for each taxane when administered in combination. Cancer 2000;89:2309-14. (C) 2000 American Cancer Society.

AB Current Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are inductive. We present an additional, different approach that is based on the synthetic rather than the inductive approach to modeling and simulation. It relies on object-oriented programming A model of the referent system in its experimental context is synthesized by assembling objects that represent components such as molecules, cells, aspects of tissue architecture, catheters, etc. The single pass perfused rat liver has been well described in evaluating hepatic drug pharmacokinetics (PK) and is the system on which we focus. In silico experiments begin with administration of objects representing actual compounds. Data are collected in a manner analogous to that in the referent PK experiments. The synthetic modeling method allows for recognition and representation of discrete event and discrete time processes, as well as heterogeneity in organization, function, and spatial effects. An application is developed for sucrose and antipyrine, administered separately and together PBPK modeling has made extensive progress in characterizing abstracted PK properties but this has also been its limitation. Now, other important questions and possible extensions emerge. How are these PK properties and the observed behaviors generated? The inherent heuristic limitations of traditional models have hindered getting meaningful, detailed answers to such questions. Synthetic models of the type described here are specifically intended to help answer such questions. Analogous to wet-lab experimental models, they retain their applicability even when broken apart into sub-components. Having and applying this new class of models along with traditional PK modeling methods is expected to increase the productivity of pharmaceutical research at all levels that make use of modeling and simulation.

AB Controlling unwanted water has been major objective of oil and gas producers. Our theoretical and experimental studies demonstrated that treatment with a preformed particle gel (PPG) of poly(AAm-co-AA) is a successful approach to control unwanted water in oil fields. The swelling capacity of the gels in salt water (formation water) is one of the most crucial criteria in the selection of hydrogel types. In this study an efficient series of gels of acrylamide and acrylic acid, as P(AAm/AA) copolymers, were synthesized by a free radical method. A central-composite Design of Experiments (DOE) approach was employed to design the experiments and to optimize the desired properties of the copolymers. The mole ratio of AAm/AA, mole percentage of the crosslinker agent (N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide, MBA) and swelling time were simultaneously examined as key factors affecting the swelling behavior of the hydrogels. The results showed that these three factors were the dominate factors and were useful for prediction of the swelling process. The predicting model indicated that the optimized ranges of AAm/AA ratio, MBA mole percentage and swelling time, causing the maximum swelling percentage of PPG samples, were 6.77 to 8.54, 9.92 to 11.6% and 170.7 to 179.99 min, respectively. The maximum swelling percentage of the PPG samples was found to be 390% in the optimum ranges of AAm/AA, MBA mole percentage and swelling time. Additionally, it was evident from the results that the predicted results were in good agreement with the experimental data.

   Competitive interactions between salmonids and white suckers (Catostomus commersonii) often result in poor salmonid growth, condition, and ultimately angler catch-per-unit-effort. Fisheries managers frequently introduce hybrid northern pike (Esox lucius) and muskellunge (E. masquinongy), known as tiger muskellunge, as biological control agents to reduce the abundance of undesirable species including white suckers, while simultaneously attempting to create viable recreational fisheries with stocked salmonids. In this study, northern pike were used to evaluate esocid prey preference between naive, hatchery-reared rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and wild white suckers. Enclosures containing northern pike were stocked with rainbow trout and white suckers at 2 densities (50: 50 and 20: 80, respectively) to represent different ratios of forage. Weekly sampling by beach seine was used to determine rainbow trout and white sucker mortality. When the experiment was complete, enclosures were drained to determine overall survival of the forage species. Rainbow trout numbers declined precipitously to zero, while 60-75% of white suckers remained across all treatments. This study demonstrated a clear difference in survival of rainbow trout and white suckers (rainbow trout having lower survival) in the presence of northern pike under these conditions. We suggest fisheries managers consider these findings when stocking or managing for piscivores to control undesirable fish species, or to create recreational fisheries, while simultaneously stocking naive sport fish vulnerable to predation.

AB A novel model capable of quantitatively describing and predicting intracellular ice formation (IIF) as a function of temperature in a cell population characterized by a size distribution is proposed. The model overcomes the classical approach which takes into account a population of identically sized cells. The size distribution dynamics of a cell population in response to water osmosis and IIF occurrence during the cooling stage of a standard cryopreservation protocol without using cryoprotective agent (CPA) is simulated by means of a suitable population balance approach. Specifically, the model couples the classical water transport equation developed by Mazur(1) to the quantitative description of nucleation and diffusion-limited growth of ice crystals in the framework of a I-D population balance equation (PBE). It is found that IIF temperature depends on the cell size, i.e., it is higher for larger cells. Correspondingly, the probability of IIF (PIIF) results to be dependent on the initial size distribution of the cell population. Model's parameters related to the osmotic behavior of the cell population and to IIF kinetics are obtained by comparison between theoretical results and suitable experimental data of isolated rat hepatocytes available in the literature. Model reliability is successfully verified by predicting the experimental data of PIIF at different, constant cooling rates with better accuracy as compared to the theoretical approaches available in the literature.

AB Background: The first line anti-tuberculosis drugs isoniazid (INH), rifampicin (RIF) and pyrazinamide (PZA) continues to be the effective drugs in the treatment of tuberculosis, however, the use of these drugs is associated with toxic reactions in tissues, particularly in the liver, leading to hepatitis. Silymarin, a standard plant extract with strong antioxidant activity obtained from S. marianum, is known to be an effective agent for liver protection and liver regeneration. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective actions of silymarin against hepatotoxicity caused by different combinations of anti-tuberculosis drugs.
   Methods: Male Wistar albino rats weighing 250-300 g were used to form 6 study groups, each group consisting of 10 rats. Animals were treated with intra-peritoneal injection of isoniazid (50 mg/kg) and rifampicin (100 mg/kg); and intra-gastric administration of pyrazinamid (350 mg/kg) and silymarin (200 mg/kg). Hepatotoxicity was induced by a combination of drugs with INH+RIF and INH+ RIF+ PZA. Hepatoprotective effect of silymarin was investigated by co-administration of silymarin together with the drugs. Serum biochemical tests for liver functions and histopathological examination of livers were carried out to demonstrate the protection of liver against antituberculosis drugs by silymarin.
   Results: Treatment of rats with INH+ RIF or INH+ RIF+ PZA induced hepatotoxicity as evidenced by biochemical measurements: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activities and the levels of total bilirubin were elevated, and the levels of albumin and total protein were decreased in drugs-treated animals. Histopathological changes were also observed in livers of animals that received drugs. Simultaneous administration of silymarin significantly decreased the biochemical and histological changes induced by the drugs.
   Conclusion: The active components of silymarin had protective effects against hepatotoxic actions of drugs used in the chemotherapy of tuberculosis in animal models. Since no significant toxicity of silymarin is reported in human studies, this plant extract can be used as a dietary supplement by patients taking anti-tuberculosis medications.

AB In the field of experimental pharmacology, researchers continuously investigate new relaxant agents of the airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), since the pathophysiology of respiratory illnesses, such as asthma, involves hyperresponsiveness and changes in ASMC homeostasis. In this scenario, labdane-type diterpenes, like forskolin (FSK), are a class of compounds known for their relaxing action on smooth muscle cells (SMCs), being this phenomenon related to the direct activation of AC-cAMP-PKA pathway. Considering the continuous effort of our group to study the mechanism of action and prospecting for compounds isolated from natural sources, in this paper, we presented how the diterpene 8(17),12E,14-labdatrien-18-oic acid (LBD) promotes relaxant effect on ASMC, performing in vitro experiments using isolated guinea pig trachea and in silico molecular docking/dynamics simulations. In vitro experiments showed that in the presence of aminophylline, FSK and LBD had their relaxant effect potentiated (EC50 from 1.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(-5) M to 1.5 +/- 0.3 x 10(-6) M for LBD and from 2.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(-7) M to 6.4 +/- 0.4 x 10(-8) M for FSK) while in the presence of Rp-cAMPS this effect was attenuated (EC50 from 1.4 +/- 0.2 x 10(-5) M to 3 x 10(-4) M for LBD and from 2.0 +/- 0.2 x 10(-7) to 3.1 +/- 1.0 x 10(-6) M for FSK). Additionally, in silico simulations evidenced that the lipophilic character of LBD is probably responsible for its stability on AC binding site. LBD presented two preferential orientations, where the double bonds of the isoprene moiety as well as the unique polar group (carboxylic acid) in this compound form important anchoring points. In this sense, we consider that the LBD can interact stabilizing the catalytic dimmer of AC as the FSK, although less efficiently.

AB Background/Aims: Lubeluzole is a benzothiazole derivative that has shown neuroprotective properties in preclinical models of ischemic stroke. However, clinical research on lubeluzole is now at a standstill, since lubeluzole seems to be associated with the acquired long QT syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. Since the cardiac cellular effects of lubeluzole have not been described thus far, an explanation for the lubeluzole-induced QT interval prolongation is lacking. Methods: We tested the affinity of lubeluzole, its enantiomer, and the racemate for hERG channel using the patch-clamp technique. We synthesized and tested two simplified model compounds corresponding to two moieties included in the lubeluzole structure. The obtained experimental results were rationalized by docking simulation on the recently reported cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of hERG. Group efficiency analysis was performed in order to individuate the fragment most contributing to binding. Results: We found that lubeluzole and its R enantiomer are highly potent inhibitors of human ether-a-go- go-related gene (hERG) channel with an IC50 value of 12.9 +/- 0.7 nM and 11.3 +/- 0.8 nM, respectively. In the presence of lubeluzole, steady-state activation and inactivation of hERG channel were shifted to more negative potentials and inactivation kinetics was accelerated. Mutations of aromatic residues (Y652A and F656A) in the channel inner cavity significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of lubeluzole. Molecular docking simulations performed on the near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of hERG supported the role of Y652 and F656 as the main contributors to high affinity binding. Group efficiency analysis indicated that both 1,3-benzothiazol-2-amine and 3-aryloxy-2-propanolamine moieties contribute to drug binding with the former giving higher contribution. Conclusions: This study suggests the possibility to modulate lubeluzole hERG blockade by introducing suitable substituents onto one or both constituting portions of the parent compound in order to either reduce potency (i.e. torsadogenic potential) or potentiate affinity (useful for class III antiarrhythmic and anticancer agent development).

AB Acoustic super-resolution imaging has allowed the visualization of microvascular structure and flow beyond the diffraction limit using standard clinical ultrasound systems through the localization of many spatially isolated microbubble signals. The determination of each microbubble position is typically performed by calculating the centroid, finding a local maximum, or finding the peak of a 2-D Gaussian function fit to the signal. However, the backscattered signal from a microbubble depends not only on diffraction characteristics of the waveform, but also on the microbubble behavior in the acoustic field. Here, we propose a new axial localization method by identifying the onset of the backscattered signal. We compare the accuracy of localization methods using in vitro experiments performed at 7-cm depth and 2.3-MHz center frequency. We corroborate these findings with simulation results based on the Marmottant model. We show experimentally and in simulations that detecting the onset of the returning signal provides considerably increased accuracy for super-resolution. Resulting experimental cross-sectional profiles in super-resolution images demonstrate at least 5.8 times improvement in contrast ratio and more than 1.8 times reduction in spatial spread (provided by 90% of the localizations) for the onset method over centroiding, peak detection, and 2-D Gaussian fitting methods. Simulations estimate that these latter methods could create errors in relative bubble positions as high as 900 mu m at these experimental settings, while the onset method reduced the interquartile range of these errors by a factor of over 2.2. Detecting the signal onset is, therefore, expected to considerably improve the accuracy of super-resolution.

AB The purpose of the work was to improve the process for treatment of liquid radioactive waste containing complexing agents, which are generated during the decontamination operations.
   We performed some experiments using simulated waste solutions like secondary waste from the modified CANDEREM process (Canadian Decontamination and Remediation Process) and secondary waste from the modified CANDECON process (Canadian Decontamination Process).
   To improve efficiency and economics of the process it was proposed to treat the waste by combining the sorption of radionuclides on natural inorganic sorbents (zeolites) with membrane filtration.
   Standard procedures are applied to compare the sorption of radionuclides on different sorbent forms-determination of the ion exchange capacity, construction of sorption isotherms, determination of the distribution coefficients, and kinetics experiments.
   To check the influence of converting the sorbents to various cationic forms on their sorption properties, distribution coefficients of Cs-137 and Co-57 on natural zeolites from local deposits converted to NH4+, Na+ or H+ forms were determined. The results obtained show that the distribution coefficients of Cs-137 on the materials converted to Na+ form are higher than for the remaining forms studied [1].
   The parameters of Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption isotherms have been determined using sorption data. The Dubinin-Radushkevich model shows better correlation between the theoretical and experimental data for Cs-137 sorption on natural zeolites from local deposits converted to NH4+ and H+ forms than Langmuir and Freundlich equations.
   Kinetic studies were carried out with various zeolite forms. The sorbents studied are natural zeolites from local deposits (Marsid-Romania).
   The batch sorption kinetics has been tested for pseudo-second order reaction. The pseudo-second order model fits the experimental data well for all of the systems studied.

AB The bridged silsesquioxane precursor (EtO)(3)Si(CH2)(3)NH(C=O)NH-(CH2)(12)-N1-1(C=O)NH-(CH2)(3) Si(OEt)(3), combining polymerizable silylated groups, urea functionalities, and alkyl chains, undergoes fluoride (F-)-catalyzed sol-gel reactions in the presence or absence of EuCl3 center dot 6H(2)O. Supramolecular self-assembly of the growing structure relies primarily on the establishment of strong and ordered hydrogen bonding interactions. In the case of the Eu3+-containing hybrids the lanthanide ions play a totally unparallel dual-role acting simultaneously as structure directing agents and structural probes to sense locally morphological alterations. In the early stages of the synthesis, while a fraction of the Eu3+ ions promotes the formation of a unidirectional urea-urea hydrogen-bonded array, the remaining ions coordinate to silanol (Si-OH) groups inhibiting the growth of the siloxane network and yielding small anisotropic flakes (similar to 200 rim lone). These are subsequently assembled on the micrometer scale in a brick-like tile-to-tile arrangement that ends up with the formation of fibers or twisted bundles (3.0-4.0 mu m long and 0.5-1.0 mu m wide). At higher Eu3+ concentrations, Eu3+-based ionic interfiber cross-links hinder the solvent flow and force adjacent fibers to adopt a bow-tie form (3.0-4.0 mu m long and 3.0 mu m wide at the tips). The hybrids are room temperature multiwavelength emitters because of the convolution of the hybrids' intrinsic emission and the Eu3+ intra-4f(6) transitions. The photoluminescence features (D-5(0)-> F-7(0) energy, D-5(0) quantum efficiency, number of coordinated water molecules, and experimental intensity parameters) as a function of the Eu3+ content and acidic- and F--catalyzed conditions used in the synthesis are compared to address the effect of the morphology in the photoluminescence features of the hybrid materials.

TI Virus-Host Interactions Shape Viral Dispersal Giving Rise to Distinct

AB Reaction-diffusion waves have long been used to describe the growth and spread of populations undergoing a spatial range expansion. Such waves are generally classed as either pulled, where the dynamics are driven by the very tip of the front and stochastic fluctuations are high, or pushed, where cooperation in growth or dispersal results in a bulk-driven wave in which fluctuations are suppressed. These concepts have been well studied experimentally in populations where the cooperation leads to a density-dependent growth rate. By contrast, relatively little is known about experimental populations that exhibit density-dependent dispersal. Using bacteriophage T7 as a test organism, we present novel experimental measurements that demonstrate that the diffusion of phage T7, in a lawn of host E. coli, is hindered by steric interactions with host bacteria cells. The coupling between host density, phage dispersal, and cell lysis caused by viral infection results in an effective density-dependent diffusion coefficient akin to cooperative behavior. Using a system of reaction-diffusion equations, we show that this effect can result in a transition from a pulled to pushed expansion. Moreover, we find that a second, independent density-dependent effect on phage dispersal spontaneously emerges as a result of the viral incubation period, during which, phage is trapped inside the host unable to disperse. Additional stochastic agent-based simulations reveal that lysis time dramatically affects the rate of diversity loss in viral expansions. Taken together, our results indicate both that bacteriophage can be used as a controllable laboratory population to investigate the impact of density-dependent dispersal on evolution, and that the genetic diversity and adaptability of expanding viral populations could be much greater than is currently assumed.

ID EXPERIMENTAL SIMULATION; FORMULA
AB The main goal of the study presented in this paper was to analyse the mechanisms affecting an Underground Coal Gasification (UCG) process and to identify possible deviations of the system from normal work to limit, or even avoid, losses. The UCG process is one of the most innovative technologies connected with the exploitation of coal deposits that are currently being tested and developed all around the world. It allows the conversion of a coal seam into gas under in situ conditions of high temperature with the use of gasifying agents such as air, oxygen, steam or with a mixture of them.
   The paper presents the results of the analysis and assessment of a critical event during the process: a dangerous gas accumulation that occurred during an underground coal gasification experiment in the Experimental Mine "Barbara" of the Central Mining Institute (Poland). The UCG experiment using the shaft method is described, together with its monitoring system and the problems that appeared during the process. The application of the Fault Tree Methodology allowed the establishment of the main factors that may lead to the explosion and to present possible scenarios of its occurrence.
   Moreover, calculations were carried out to evaluate the risk level of explosion for the gas mixture and the minimum level of oxygen in the mixture that is necessary to initiate an explosion. These calculations were based on a modification of the formula proposed by Le Chatelier. During the course of the underground experiment, original information of the process behaviour has been acquired that can be used in the preparation of other UCG experiments in operational mines to guarantee the safety and the stability of the process.

AB The conformational properties of lanthanide(III) complexes with the mono- and biphosphonate analogues of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate (DOTA) are investigated by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and NMR spectroscopy Geometry optimizations performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level and using a 46 + 4f(n) effective core potential for lanthanides provide two energy minima corresponding to the square-antiprismatic (SAP) and twisted square-antiprismatic (TSAP) geometries Our calculations give relative free energies between the SAP and TSAP isomers in fairly good agreement with the experimental values The SAP isomer presents the highest binding energy of the ligand to the metal ion, which further increases with respect to that of the TSAP isomer across the lanthanide senes as the charge density of the metal ion increases The stabilization of the TSAR isomer upon substitution of the acetate arms of DOTA by methylenephosphonate ones is attributed to the higher steric demand of the phosphonate groups and the higher strain of the ligand in the SAP isomer A H-1 NMR band-shape analysis performed on the [Ln(DO(2)A(2)P)](3-) (Ln = La and Lu) complexes provided the activation parameters for enantiomerization of the TSAP form of the complexes. The TSAP isomerization process was also investigated by using DFT calculations on the [Lu(DOTA)](-) and [Ln(DO(2)A(2)P)](3-) (Ln = La and Lu) systems. Our results confirm that enantiomerization requires both rotation of the pendant arms and inversion of the four five-membered chelate rings formed upon coordination of the macrocyclic unit According to our calculations, the arm rotation pathway in [Lu(DOTA)](-) is a one-step process involving the simultaneous rotation of the four acetate arms, while in the DO(2)A(2)P analogue, the arm-rotation process is a multistep path involving the stepwise rotation of each of the four pendant arms The calculated activation free energies are in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data A comparison of the experimental C-13 NMR shifts of [Ln(DO(2)A(2)P)](3-) (Ln=La and Lu) complexes and those calculated by using the GIAO method confirms that the major isomer observed in solution for these complexes corresponds to the TSAP isomer.

AB Myxococcus xanthus cells self-organize into periodic bands of traveling waves, termed ripples, during multicellular fruiting body development and predation on other bacteria. To investigate the mechanistic basis of rippling behavior and its physiological role during predation by this Gram-negative soil bacterium, we have used an approach that combines mathematical modeling with experimental observations. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model (ABM) to simulate rippling behavior that employs a new signaling mechanism to trigger cellular reversals. The ABM has demonstrated that three ingredients are sufficient to generate rippling behavior: (i) side-to-side signaling between two cells that causes one of the cells to reverse, (ii) a minimal refractory time period after each reversal during which cells cannot reverse again, and (iii) physical interactions that cause the cells to locally align. To explain why rippling behavior appears as a consequence of the presence of prey, we postulate that prey-associated macromolecules indirectly induce ripples by stimulating side-to-side contact-mediated signaling. In parallel to the simulations, M. xanthus predatory rippling behavior was experimentally observed and analyzed using time-lapse microscopy. A formalized relationship between the wavelength, reversal time, and cell velocity has been predicted by the simulations and confirmed by the experimental data. Furthermore, the results suggest that the physiological role of rippling behavior during M. xanthus predation is to increase the rate of spreading over prey cells due to increased side-to-side contact-mediated signaling and to allow predatory cells to remain on the prey longer as a result of more periodic cell motility.

ID AMERICAN GINSENG; PANAX-NOTOGINSENG; ROOT
AB Background: Ginsenoside Rg3 is a promising anticancer agent. It is usually produced by heat treatment of ginseng, in which ginsenoside Rb1 is the major ginsenoside. A kinetic study was conducted to optimize ginsenoside Rg3 production by the heat treatment of ginsenoside Rb1.
   Methods: Ginsenoside Rb1 was heated using an isothermal machine at 80 degrees C and 100 degrees C and analyzed using HPLC. The kinetic parameters were calculated from the experimental results. The activation energy was estimated and used to simulate the process. The optimized parameters of ginsenoside Rg3 production are suggested based on the simulation.
   Results: The rate constants were 0.013 h(-1) and 0.073 h(-1) for the degradation of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg3 at 80 degrees C, respectively. The corresponding rate constants at 100 degrees C were 0.045 h(-1) and 0.155 h(-1). The estimated activation energies of degradation of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg3 were 69.2 kJ/mol and 40.9 mol, respectively. The rate constants at different temperatures were evaluated using the estimated activation energies, and the kinetic profiles of ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg3 at each temperature were simulated based on the proposed kinetic model of consecutive reaction. The optimum strategies for producing ginsenoside Rg3 from ginsenoside Rb1 are suggested based on the simulation. With increased temperature, a high concentration of ginsenoside Rg3 is formed rapidly. However, the concentration decreases quickly after the reaching the maximal concentration value.
   Conclusion: The optimum temperature for producing ginsenoside Rg3 should be the highest temperature technically feasible below 180 degrees C, in consideration of the cooling time. The optimum reaction time for heat treatment is 30 min. Copyright (C) 2015, The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier. All rights reserved.

AB Background and PurposeThe carbazole alkaloid murrayafoline A (MuA) enhances contractility and the Ca2+ currents carried by the Ca(v)1.2 channels [I-Ca1.2] of rat cardiomyocytes. As only few drugs stimulate I-Ca1.2, this study was designed to analyse the effects of MuA on vascular Ca(v)1.2 channels.
   Experimental ApproachVascular activity was assessed on rat aorta rings mounted in organ baths. Ca(v)1.2 Ba2+ current [I-Ba1.2] was recorded in single rat aorta and tail artery myocytes by the patch-clamp technique. Docking at a 3D model of the rat, (1c) central pore subunit of the Ca(v)1.2 channel was simulated in silico.
   Key ResultsIn rat aorta rings MuA, at concentrations 14.2 M, increased 30 mM K+-induced tone and shifted the concentration-response curve to K+ to the left. Conversely, at concentrations >14.2 M, it relaxed high K+ depolarized rings and antagonized Bay K 8644-induced contraction. In single myocytes, MuA stimulated I-Ba1.2 in a concentration-dependent, bell-shaped manner; stimulation was stable, incompletely reversible upon drug washout and accompanied by a leftward shift of the voltage-dependent activation curve. MuA docked at the (1C) subunit central pore differently from nifedipine and Bay K 8644, although apparently interacting with the same amino acids of the pocket. Neither Bay K 8644-induced stimulation nor nifedipine-induced block of I-Ba1.2 was modified by MuA.
   Conclusions and ImplicationsMurrayafoline A is a naturally occurring vasoactive agent able to modulate Ca(v)1.2 channels and dock at the (1C) subunit central pore in a manner that differed from that of dihydropyridines. (c) 2015 The British Pharmacological Society

AB P3B/Tsugane is a myelomonocytoid cell line derived from a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), The cells readily undergo apoptosis in response to various agents, and the cell line has been suggested as a useful model to study apoptosis in MDS, The aims of the present study were to assess differentiation and apoptosis induced with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and etoposide, to characterize the mode of apoptosis in these two model systems, and to assess the influence of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), which in combination with erythropoietin has been shown to inhibit apoptosis in MDS, ATRA induced differentiation and apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Differentiated cells were partially rescued (by 50%) from apoptosis with G-CSF, Etoposide induced apoptosis in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, but no signs of preceding maturation or G-CSF rescue were detected. ATRA- and etoposide-induced apoptosis were both mediated through the caspase pathway and were partially blocked with the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, Simultaneous treatment with G-CSP and zVAD-fmk additively blocked ATRA-induced apoptosis, However, the two pathways differed in terms of substrate cleavage during apoptosis, ATRA-induced apoptosis caused actin cleavage, which was not affected by G-CSF, and Bcl-2 downregulation, Etoposide induced a caspase-dependent cleavage of Bcl-2, while actin remained intact. The Fas system did not seem to play a major role in any of these apoptotic pathways, Our results may provide new tools to study the mechanisms of apoptosis in MDS.

AB Carbon dioxide was considered as a co-gasifying agent in a coal gasification reactor. The work presented herein describes the simulation results for the process and the experimental data on coal char gasification with CO2 addition as the rate-controlling step for the entire process. To study the potentially beneficial effect of the introduction of CO2 into the gasification system, several simulations were conducted using the commercial process simulation software ChemCAD 6.3(A (R)). The results of a Gibbs equilibrium reactor were evaluated. The Boudouard reaction is a critical path for the development of this process, and the kinetics were studied experimentally. Four chars derived from the pyrolysis of Polish coals of different origins were selected for the experiments. The kinetic characteristics of this system were examined using a custom-designed pressurized fixed-bed reactor. To determine the effect of pressure on the gasification rate, several preliminary studies on the gasification of coal chars were performed isothermally at the temperature of 950 A degrees C and pressures of 1, 10, and 20 bars. In contrast to the thermodynamic calculations, the experimental data revealed that increasing the CO2 pressure leads to a higher reaction rate for medium-rank coal chars and low-rank lignite coal char, resulting in higher efficiency for carbon monoxide production. The pressure influences the reactivity more strongly when varied from 1 to 10 bars; a further increase in pressure affects the rate almost insignificantly. The observed behavior representing the changes in carbon conversion degree during gasification is satisfactorily described by the grain model.

AB Rationale and Objectives. Catheter-directed thrombolytic therapy has become an accepted treatment for many vascular occlusions, However, the relative rates of lysis of the different methods of drug administration have not been quantified. We developed an in vitro model to simulate and quantify local lyric therapy of a thrombotic vascular occlusion and tested it by evaluating three catheter-directed lytic strategies.
   Methods. Seven-centimeter-long segments of I-125-fibrinogen-labeled thrombus made from recently expired human blood from a blood bank were formed in plastic tubes and were placed in a flowing stream of saline. Using multisidehole catheters, the clots were ''treated'' with intrathrombic saline or urokinase administered by drip infusion or forced injection using identical total doses of drug and volumes of fluid. Using endhole catheters, saline or urokinase was drip infused into the leading edge of the thrombus using the same protocol, A collimated scintillation detector was used to quantify the amount of activity remaining in the thrombus during each experiment, and the resultant time-activity curves for the different trials were compared.
   Results. Forced-injection administration of urokinase using a multisidehole catheter produced the fastest lysis, resulting in a half-life of 42 min. The other infusion methods were slower, with half-lives of 153 min for multisidehole urokinase drip infusion, 365 min for endhole urokinase drip infusion, and more than 1,000 min for multisidehole catheter forced injection of saline and multisidehole and endhole saline drip infusion. The differences among these groups were reproducible and statistically significant.
   Conclusion. Results suggest that a simple and inexpensive in vitro model simulating lysis of a vascular occlusion can produce reproducible quantitative data, The data demonstrate that forced injection of lytic agents with a multisidehole catheter enhances the rate of thrombolysis and that the enhancement is not primarily attributable to the mechanical effect of this mode of administration.

AB This study aimed to identify suitable siRNA delivery systems based on flexible generation 2-4 triazine dendrimers by correlating physico-chemical and biological in vitro and in vivo properties of the complexes with thermodynamic parameters calculated using molecular modeling. The siRNA binding properties of the dendrimers and PEI 25 kDa were simulated, binding and stability were measured in SYBR Gold assays, and hydrodynamic diameters, zeta potentials, and cytotoxicity were quantified. These parameters were compared with cellular uptake of the complexes and their ability to mediate RNAi. Radiolabeled complexes were administered intravenously, and pharmacokinetic profiles and biodistribution of these polyplexes were assessed both invasively and non-invasively. All flexible triazine dendrimers formed thermodynamically more stable complexes than PEI. While PEI and the generation 4 dendrimer interacted more superficially with siRNA, generation 2 and 3 virtually coalesced with siRNA, forming a tightly intertwined structure. These dendriplexes were therefore more efficiently charge-neutralized than PEI complexes, reducing agglomeration. This behavior was confirmed by results of hydrodynamic diameters (72.0 nm-153.5 nm) and zeta potentials (4.9 mV-21.8 mV in 10 mM HEPES) of the dendriplexes in comparison to PEI complexes (312.8 nm-480.0 nm and 13.7 mV-17.4 mV in 10 mM HEPES). All dendrimers, even generation 3 and 4, were less toxic than PEI. All dendriplexes were efficiently endocytosed and showed significant and specific luciferase knockdown in HeLa/Luc cells. Scintillation counting confirmed that the generation 2 triazine complexes showed more than twofold prolonged circulation times as a result of their good thermodynamic stability. Conversely, generation 3 complexes dissociated in vivo, and generation 4 complexes were captured by the reticulo-endothelial system due to their increased surface charge. Molecular modeling proves very valuable for rationalizing experimental parameters based on the dendrimers' structural properties. Noninvasive molecular imaging predicted the in vivo fate of the complexes. Therefore, both techniques effectively promote the rapid development of safe and efficient siRNA formulations that are stable in vivo. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Chalcones are naturally occurring compounds found in various plant species which are widely used for the traditional popular treatments. Chalcones are distinguished secondary metabolites that are reported to display diverse biological activities such as antiviral, antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antibacterial and antioxidant agents. The presence of a,beta- unsaturated carbonyl group in chalcones is assumed to be responsible for their bioactivity. In addition, heterocyclic compounds having nitrogen such as isoquinolines are of considerable interest as they constitute the core structural element of many alkaloids that have enormous pharmacological activities.
   Objective: The objective of this study is the synthesis and biological activity of novel chalcones incorporating thiadiazolyl isoquinoline as potential anticancer candidates. Different genetic tools were used in an attempt to know the mechanism of action of this compound against breast cancer.
   Methods: An efficient one pot synthesis of novel chalcones incorporating thiadiazolyl isoquinoline has been developed. The cytotoxic activity of the novel synthesized compounds was performed against four different kinds of cancer cell lines.
   Results: Among all the tested derivatives, chalcone 3 has the best cytotoxic profile against A549, MCF7, and HeLa cell lines, with IC(50)s (66.1, 51.3, and 85.1 mu M, respectively). Molecular docking studies for chalcone 3 revealed that CDK2, and EGFRTK domains have strong binding affinities toward the novel chalcone 3, while tubulin-colchicine-ustiloxin, and VEGFRTK domains illustrated moderate mode of binding.
   Conclusion: We have developed an efficient method for the synthesis of novel chalcones incorporating thiadiazolyl isoquinoline. All compounds showed better cytotoxicity results against four kinds of cancer cell lines (A549, MCF7, HCT116, and HELA cells). The results depicted that chalcone 3 has a high and promising cytotoxic effect against HELA cell line and the mechanism of cytotoxicity was widely studied through different theoretical and experimental tools. Thus, the newly synthesized derivative 3 can be utilized as a novel chemotherapeutic compound for cervical carcinoma.

AB Herein, we report the development of a facile process for the synthesis of magnetite-partially reduced graphene oxide (Mag-PRGO) without the use of chemical reducing agents or solvents for the efficient removal of arsenate As(V) ions from contaminated water. The Mag-PRGO is synthesized using the laser vaporization-controlled condensation method where a compressed target consisting of metallic iron (Fe) powder and solid graphene oxide (GO) is laser vaporized in an O-2-He atmosphere resulting in the simultaneous oxidation of the Fe nanoparticles and the partial reduction of the GO to form the Mag-PRGO nanocomposite where the magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles are anchored to the surface of the PRGO nanosheets. FTIR, Raman, XPS, XRD, TEM, and SEM confirm the successful attachment of the magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles to the PRGO nanosheets. The Mag-PRGO (50 wt% Fe) adsorbent shows exceptional selectivity for the extraction of As(V) ions with a capacity of 132 mg/g with no leaching of Fe ions into the solution, placing it among the best carbon-based materials for the efficient removal of As(V) from aqueous solutions. The Mag-PRGO displays a 100% removal of As(V) at concentrations up to 100 ppm with 98% and 100% removal within 15 min and 30 min, respectively, at 50 ppm concentration. The excellent agreement of the experimental sorption isotherms with the Langmuir model suggests a monolayer adsorption behavior. The mechanism of As(V) removal is based on surface complexation between the protonated hydroxyl groups on the surface of Mag-PRGO and the monobasic and dibasic arsenate anions forming (Fe-O-As) bonds as confirmed by FTIR and XPS. The Mag-PRGO is easily regenerated with the desorption of the As(V) ions reaching 99% from their maximum sorption capacities using NaOH. The efficient magnetic separation and high chemical stability of Mag-PRGO are demonstrated over six adsorption-desorption cycles of As(V). The Mag-PRGO is proposed as an excellent remediation adsorbent for the extraction of As(V) from contaminated water.

AB Objectives: Sepsis affects nearly 1 million people in the United States per year, has a mortality rate of 28-50% and requires more than $20 billion a year in hospital costs. Over a quarter century of research has not yielded a single reliable diagnostic test or a directed therapeutic agent for sepsis. Central to this insufficiency is the fact that sepsis remains a clinical/physiological diagnosis representing a multitude of molecularly heterogeneous pathological trajectories. Advances in computational capabilities offered by High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms call for an evolution in the investigation of sepsis to attempt to define the boundaries of traditional research (bench, clinical and computational) through the use of computational proxy models. We present a novel investigatory and analytical approach, derived from how HPC resources and simulation are used in the physical sciences, to identify the epistemic boundary conditions of the study of clinical sepsis via the use of a proxy agent-based model of systemic inflammation.
   Design: Current predictive models for sepsis use correlative methods that are limited by patient heterogeneity and data sparseness. We address this issue by using an HPC version of a system-level validated agent-based model of sepsis, the Innate Immune Response ABM (IIRBM), as a proxy system in order to identify boundary conditions for the possible behavioral space for sepsis. We then apply advanced analysis derived from the study of Random Dynamical Systems (RDS) to identify novel means for characterizing system behavior and providing insight into the tractability of traditional investigatory methods.
   Results: The behavior space of the IIRABM was examined by simulating over 70 million sepsis patients for up to 90 days in a sweep across the following parameters: cardio-respiratory-metabolic resilience; microbial invasiveness; microbial toxigenesis; and degree of nosocomial exposure. In addition to using established methods for describing parameter space, we developed two novel methods for characterizing the behavior of a RDS: Probabilistic Basins of Attraction (PBoA) and Stochastic Trajectory Analysis (STA). Computationally generated behavioral landscapes demonstrated attractor structures around stochastic regions of behavior that could be described in a complementary fashion through use of PBoA and STA. The stochasticity of the boundaries of the attractors highlights the challenge for correlative attempts to characterize and classify clinical sepsis.
   Conclusions: HPC simulations of models like the IIRABM can be used to generate approximations of the behavior space of sepsis to both establish "boundaries of futility" with respect to existing investigatory approaches and apply system engineering principles to investigate the general dynamic properties of sepsis to provide a pathway for developing control strategies. The issues that bedevil the study and treatment of sepsis, namely clinical data sparseness and inadequate experimental sampling of system behavior space, are fundamental to nearly all biomedical research, manifesting in the "Crisis of Reproducibility" at all levels. HPC-augmented simulation-based research offers an investigatory strategy more consistent with that seen in the physical sciences (which combine experiment, theory and simulation), and an opportunity to utilize the leading advances in HPC, namely deep machine learning and evolutionary computing, to form the basis of an iterative scientific process to meet the full promise of Precision Medicine (right drug, right patient, right time).

AB Simple Summary The weaning period is one of the most critical phases in a rabbit's life, when rabbits are most sensitive to various spoilage agents, often with fatal outcome. Preventing these post-weaning alimentary disturbances and improving gut health through the use of natural substances has become an area of research activity in rabbit nutrition. The possibilities of "in vivo" administration of bacteriocins in rabbits are often limited. Our study focused therefore on improving rabbits' health using enterocin M and sage extract, alone and also in combination, mainly to determine their effect on the microbiota, phagocytic activity, serum biochemistry, and morphometry of rabbits. The antibacterial effect of both additives was observed in the gastrointestinal tract of rabbits. Several biochemical parameters (increased in total proteins (TPs) using enterocin (Ent) M, reduction of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) using sage and its hypocholesteremic effect alone and in combination with EntM, and improvement of mineral levels) were optimized. All additives, but mostly EntM, showed a tendency to improve the jejunal morphological parameters.
   Abstract The present study investigated the effects of enterocin (Ent) M and sage extract alone and also in combination on the gut microflora, phagocytic activity, blood biochemistry, and morphometry of rabbits. Sixty-four rabbits (aged five weeks, M91 meatline, both sexes) were divided into three experimental groups: E (EntM; 50 mu L/animal/day), S (sage; 10 mu L/animal/day), and E + S (EntM + sage) groups and control group (C). The additives were administered in drinking water for a period of 21 days. Dietary supplementation of EntM and sage significantly reduced the coliforms (E: p < 0.001; S: p < 0.001; E + S: p < 0.001) in feces, while simultaneous addition of EntM and sage decreased enterococci (E + S: p < 0.0001), lactic acid bacteria (E + S: p < 0.01), and coagulase-positive staphylococci (E + S: p < 0.0001) in the appendix. Sage addition reduced HDL (S: p < 0.001) and LDL cholesterol (S: p < 0.001; E + S: p < 0.001), LDL/HDL ratio (S: p < 0.001; E + S: p < 0.01), and increased urea (S: p < 0.01; E + S: p < 0.001) and creatinine (S: p < 0.001; E + S: p < 0.001) in serum. EntM and sage application, alone or in combination, improve the jejunal morphometry (p < 0.0001) in rabbits.

AB Molecular structures of native and a pair of modified small interfering RNA-RNA duplexes containing carbocyclic [6'-(R)-OH/7'-(S)-methyl]- and [6'-(S)-OH/7'-(S)-methyl]-carba-LNA-thymine nucleotides, which are two diastereomeric analogs of the native T nucleotide, incorporated at position 13 in the antisense (AS) strand of siRNA, have been simulated using molecular mechanics/dynamics techniques. The main aim of the project has been to find a plausible structural explanation of why modification of siRNA at T-13 position by the [6'(R)-O-(p-Toluoyl)-7' (S)-methyl]-carba-LNA-Thymine [IC50 of 3.32 +/- 0.17 nM] is ca 24 times more active as an RNA silencing agent against the target HIV-1 TAR RNA than the [6' (S)-O-(p-Toluoyl)-7' (S)-methyl]-counterpart [IC50 of 79.8 +/- 17 nM] [1]. The simulations reveal that introduction of both C6' (R)-OH and C6' (S)-OH stereoisomers does not lead even to local perturbation of the siRNA-RNA duplex structures compared to the native, and the only significant difference between 6' (S)- and 6' (R)-diastereomers found is the exposure of the 6'-OH group of the 6' (R)-diastereoisomer toward the edge of the duplex while the 6'-hydroxyl group of the 6' (S)-diastereoisomer is somewhat buried in the minor groove of the duplex. This rules out a hypothesis about any possible local distortion by the nature of chemical modification of the siRNA-target the RNA duplex, which might have influenced the formation of the effective RNA silencing complex (RISC) and puts some weight on the hypothesis about the 6'-hydroxy group being directly involved with most probably Ago protein, since it is known from exhaustive X-ray studies [2, 3] that the core residues are indeed involved with hydrogen bonding with the internucleotidyl phosphates.

AB Background: Medication safety for older persons represents an ongoing challenge. Inappropriate prescriptions -those with a high risk of evidence-based harm -persist in up to 25 % of seniors, and account for a significant proportion of avoidable emergency department visits. This project is the sequel to the EMPOWER study, in which a novel consumertargeted written knowledge transfer tool aimed at empowering older adults to act as drivers of benzodiazepine de-prescription resulted in a 27 % reduction of inappropriate benzodiazepine use at 6-month follow-up (number needed to treat (NNT) = 4). Failure to discontinue in the EMPOWER study was attributable to re-emerging symptoms among participants, prescribing inertia, and lack of knowledge and skills for substituting alternate therapy among physicians and pharmacists. To maximize de-prescription of inappropriate therapy, educational medication-risk reduction initiatives should be tested that simultaneously include patients, physicians and pharmacists. The objective of this trial is to: 1) test the beneficial effect of a new de-prescribing paradigm enlisting pharmacists to transfer knowledge to both patients and prescribers in a 2-pronged approach to reduce inappropriate prescriptions, compared to usual care and 2) evaluate the transferability of the EMPOWER study concept to other classes of inappropriate prescriptions.
   Methods: We intend to conduct a 3-year pragmatic cluster randomized parallel-group controlled trial to test the effect of the new de-prescribing intervention compared to usual care for reducing 4 classes of inappropriate prescriptions from the 2012 Beers criteria among 450 community-dwelling older adults with polypharmacy. Inappropriate prescriptions will include benzodiazepines, sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, first generation antihistamines and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The study population is community-dwelling older adults recruited from community pharmacies in Quebec, Canada. The intervention was developed based on a systematic review of the evidence for each medication. Participants in the experimental group will receive the written educational program following randomization and have their pharmacist send their physicians an evidence-based pharmaceutical opinion to recommend de-prescription and be followed for a year. The control group will be wait-listed for 6 months.
   Discussion: System change to effectively reduce medication risk among community-dwelling seniors requires a coordinated approach targeting physicians, pharmacists and patients. This trial will test the feasibility and effectiveness of a tripartite approach to de-prescribing.

AB Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is a powerful tool for investigation of biofilms. Very few investigations have successfully quantified concurrent distribution of more than two components within biofilms because: 1) selection of fluorescent dyes having minimal spectral overlap is complicated, and 2) quantification of multiple fluorochromes poses a multifactorial problem. Objectives: Report a methodology to quantify and compare concurrent 3-dimensional distributions of three cellular/extracellular components of biofilms grown on relevant substrates. Methods: The method consists of distinct, interconnected steps involving biofilm growth, staining, CLSM imaging, biofilm structural analysis and visualization, and statistical analysis of structural parameters. Biofilms of Streptococcus mutans (strain UA159) were grown for 48 hr on sterile specimens of Point 4 and TPH3 resin composites. Specimens were subsequently immersed for 60 sec in either Biotene PBF (BIO) or Listerine Total Care (LTO) mouthwashes, or water (control group; n=5/group). Biofilms were stained with fluorochromes for extracellular polymeric substances, proteins and nucleic acids before imaging with CLSM. Biofilm structural parameters calculated using ISA3D image analysis software were biovolume and mean biofilm thickness. Mixed models statistical analyses compared structural parameters between mouthwash and control groups (SAS software; alpha=0.05). Volocity software permitted visualization of 3D distributions of overlaid biofilm components (fluorochromes). Results: Mouthwash BIO produced biofilm structures that differed significantly from the control (p<0.05) on both resin composites, whereas LTO did not produce differences (p>0.05) on either product. Conclusions: This methodology efficiently and successfully quantified and compared concurrent 3D distributions of three major components within S. mutans biofilms on relevant substrates, thus overcoming two challenges to simultaneous assessment of biofilm components. This method can also be used to determine the efficacy of antibacterial/antifouling agents against multiple biofilm components, as shown using mouthwashes. Furthermore, this method has broad application because it facilitates comparison of 3D structures/architecture of biofilms in a variety of disciplines.

AB A modeling methodology for a class of resist materials that rely on the acid catalyzed crosslinking of the resin matrix during a post-exposure bake is presented.  This methodology is used to derive a complete and quantitative model for a production worthy deep-ultraviolet (UV) resist, Shipley XP-8843 (also known commercially as SNR 248).  The modeling is based on the chemical and physical mechanisms which determine resist behavior during the exposure, post-exposure bake, and development processes.  The IR absorption bands near 990 and 1070 cm-1 are used to monitor the extent of crosslinking during the bake as a function of bake temperature, bake time, and photogenerated acid concentration.  The post-exposure bake model consists of a primary crosslinking reaction with an order of 1.42 in photogenerated acid and an acid loss reaction to account for dose dependent saturation of the crosslinking.  Resist development is modeled by relating the dissolution rate to the extent of crosslinking during the post-exposure bake and to the number of sites on the crosslinking agent (six for melamine).  Good correlation is obtained between simulated development profiles and experimental results with several post-exposure bake conditions.

AB Purpose: Anthracyclines and taxanes are the most active agents in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer (BC). They can be used simultaneously or sequentially. The optimal schedule and duration for their administration is unknown. We analyzed the efficacy of sequential adjuvant anthracycline and docetaxel administration in node positive BC patients.
   Methods: Node positive BC patients (N=539) from 6 medical oncology centers in Turkey who received sequential adjuvant anthracycline-based regimens and taxane chemotherapy were included in this study between 2006 - 2010. One-hundred and thirty-eight (25%) patients received 3 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by 3 cycles of docetaxel (3+3) and 401 (75%) patients received 4 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by 4 cycles of docetaxel (4+4). Prognostic factors analyzed were estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, tumor grade, and nodal status in relation to disease free survival (DFS) and HER2 status in relation to overall survival (OS).
   Results: The patient median age was 48 years (range 18-79). Most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia, mucositis and arthralgia. No treatment-related toxic deaths were seen. With a median follow up of 26 months (range 1-115) 61 (11.3%) recurrences and 11 (2%) deaths were registered. Three-year DFS was 81% and OS 96% for all patients. There was no statistically significant difference between 3+3 and 4+4 groups in terms of survival (3-year DFS 88% and 79% [p=0.28] and OS 97% and 95% [p=0.60] respectively).
   Conclusion: Sequential chemotherapy with 4+4 cycles of anthracycline and docetaxel every 3 weeks is an acceptable regimen for adjuvant treatment of node positive BC patients. Duration of chemotherapy should be planned depending on prognostic factors. In this study there was no difference between 3+3 and 4+4 groups in DFS and OS despite the presence of good prognostic factors in the 3+3 group.

AB Ethnopharmacological relevance: Chronic renal failure (CRF) is defined as a progressive and irreversible loss of renal function and associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM) is an important Chinese herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for treating cardiovascular diseases. The previous studies showed the SM exhibited significant protective effects on CRF. In this present study, the metabolic profiling changes and action mechanism of SM on CRF were explored.
   Aims of the study: The aims of this study were to illustrate the metabolic profiling changes of adenine induced CRF and analyze the protective effects and action mechanisms of SM ethanol extract (SMEE) and water extract (SMWE).
   Materials and methods: The animals were divided into normal group, CRF model group, Huangkui capsule-treated group, SMEE-treated group and SMWE-treated group. The UPLC - QTOFMS coupled with multivariate statistical methods were used to explore the changes of metabolic profile in plasma, urine and renal tissue from CRF rats simultaneously after treatment with SMEE and SMWE. Hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining and Masson staining were applied to observe pathological changes in renal tissue. Biochemical indicators including serum urea nitrogen (BUN), urine protein (UP) and serum creatinine (Scr) were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions of kits. Furthermore, HK-2 cell damaged model induced by ISF was established to access the protective effects and action mechanism. The dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) assay was used to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Western blot was applied to analyze the expression of pathogenesis-related proteins in different groups.
   Results: The results showed that the ethanol extract (SMEE) and water extract (SMWE) of SM significantly inhibited the elevation of serum creatinine (Scr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), urine protein (UP) and indoxyl sulfate (ISF) in adenine-induced CRF rats, especially SMEE exhibited more significant effects. Moreover, SM extracts obviously improved the symptoms of glomerular and tubular atrophy, focal calcium deposits, interstitial fibrosis, interstitial inflammation, and renal tissues. By metabolomics analysis, fifty-nine metabolites (thirteen in plasma, twenty-seven in urine and nineteen in kidney tissue) were up-regulated or down-regulated and contributed to CRF progress. After treatment of SM extracts, the altered metabolites were restored back to normal level. These potential biomarkers underpinning the metabolic pathways are including phenylalanine metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, purine metabolism and tryptophan metabolism. Furthermore, SM extracts prevent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human renal tubular epithelial (HK-2) cell by inhibiting NADPH oxidase/ROS/ERK and TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways.
   Conclusions: SMEE and SMWE can significantly alleviate adenine-induced CRF via regulation of the metabolic profiling and modulation of NADPH oxidase/ROS/ERK and TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathways, which provided important supports for the development of protective agent of SM for CRF.

AB Drug molecules' therapeutic efficacy depends on their bioavailability and solubility. But more than 70% of the formulated drug molecules show limited effectiveness due to low water solubility. Thus, the water solubility enhancement technique of drug molecules becomes the need of time. One such way is hydrotropy. The solubilizing agent of a hydrophobic molecule is generally referred to as a hydrotrope, and this phenomenon is termed hydrotropy. This method has high industrial demand, as hydrotropes are noninflammable, readily available, environmentally friendly, quickly recovered, cost-effective, and not involved in solid emulsification. The endless importance of hydrotropes in industry (especially in the pharmaceutical industry) motivated us to prepare a feature article with a clear introduction, detailed mechanistic insights into the hydrotropic solubilization of drug molecules, applications in pharma industries, and some future directions of this technique. Thus, we believe that this feature article will become an adequate manual for the pharmaceutical researchers who want to explore all of the past perspectives of the hydrotropic action of hydrotropes in pharmaceutics.

AB Correlated equilibrium (Aumann, 1974, 1987) is an important generalization of the Nash equilibrium concept for multiplayer non-cooperative games. In a correlated equilibrium, players rationally condition their strategies on realizations of a common external randomization device and, as a consequence, can achieve payoffs that Pareto dominate any of the game's Nash equilibria. In this paper we explore whether such correlated equilibria can be learned over time using an evolutionary learning model where agents do not start with any knowledge of the distribution of random draws made by the external randomization device. Furthermore, we validate our learning algorithm findings by comparing the end behavior of simulations of our algorithm with both the correlated equilibrium of the game and the behavior of human subjects that play that same game. Our results suggest that the evolutionary learning model is capable of learning the correlated equilibria of these games in a manner that approximates well the learning behavior of human subjects and that our findings are robust to changes in the specification and parameterization of the model.

AB This paper presents the interfacial response of near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips embedded along a concrete substrate at elevated temperatures. Two types of bonding agents are used: ordinary and high-temperature epoxies. The residual behavior of the interface, including the characteristics of individual constitutive materials, is examined when subjected to a temperature range varying from 25 to 200 degrees C (77 to 392 degrees F). Test results reveal that the residual strength of the concrete and CFRP is not influenced by thermal exposure; however, that of the adhesive is affected. The performance of the interface bonded with the ordinary epoxy is better than that with the high-temperature one without thermal distress, while the latter becomes superior to the former with an increase in temperature. The interaction between the adhesive and concrete controls the interfacial capacity and corresponding failure mode, rather than the individual strength of the materials. Probability-based simulation that can complement the limitation of the experimental investigation in terms of sample numbers is conducted to develop design factors.

AB Wildfire containment is an important but challenging task. The ability to predict fire spread behavior, optimize a plan for firefighting resource dispatch and evaluate such a plan using several firefighting tactics is essential for supporting decision making for containing wildfires. In this article, we present an integrated framework for wildfire spread simulation, firefighting resource optimization and wildfire suppression simulation. We present a stochastic mixed-integer programming model for initial attack to generate firefighting resource dispatch plans using as input fire spread scenario results from a standard wildfire behavior simulator. A new agent-based discrete event simulation model for fire suppression is used to simulate fire suppression based on dispatch plans from the stochastic optimization model, and in turn provides feedback to the optimization model for revising the dispatch plans if necessary. We report on several experimental results, which demonstrate that different firefighting tactics can lead to significantly different fire suppression results for a given dispatch plan, and simulation of these tactics can provide valuable information for fire managers in selecting dispatch plans from optimization models before actual implementation in the field.

AB Excited-state proton transfers have been investigated for several isomeric and homologous N-((dimethylamino)alkyl)-9-aminoacridine carboxamides in a time-correlated single photon counting fluorescence study. The pH behavior of these DNA intercalators' steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra has also been investigated. While the excited-state pK(a)* for removal of a proton from the singly protonated species is close to the ground-state pK(a) in the parent molecule 9-aminoacridine, the presence of the carboxamide substituent renders pK(a)* much lower than pK(a) for the corresponding deprotonation in the present compounds. This fact, along with the presence of an additional deprotonation site at the distal N atom of the side chain, endows these molecules with complex pH dependence in their excited-state kinetics. Triexponential model functions are generally required to fit the experimental fluorescence decays, The pH dependence of the component lifetimes and preexponential factors can be simulated with a kinetic model for sequential deprotonations involving four aminoacridine species in both the ground and fluorescing states. These results provide a baseline study for comparisons with these intercalators' excited-state kinetics in DNA.

AB Corrosion is one of the critical problems for process operations and plant life. Amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture systems are known to be corrosive. This is because of the absorption of CO2 by aqueous amine solution, which makes the system acidic and generates oxidizing agents through ionization leading to corrosion. Corrosion increases with CO2 loading, process temperature, presence of oxygen (O-2), occurrence of sulfur compounds, low pH, velocity of solution and formation of some degradation products. Conducting experimental investigations to determine the rate of corrosion at various parts of process plant under a wide range of operating parameters is difficult and costly. Mathematical models and simulations play an important role in estimating the rate of corrosion under wide range of operating parameters for such systems. This study highlights the process of corrosion for amine-based CO2 capture systems and development of corrosion models with critical analyses on their applications. Study also highlights the outlook of models and simulations.

AB A type of self-recoverable, adjustable amphiphilic graphene aerogel (GA) was prepared and applied to the dye adsorption. The GA with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as its cross-linking agent has the characteristics of adjustable amphiphilicity. By adjusting the PVA content in GA, the later can be used to adsorb dyes with different hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. Four kinds of dyes (Malachite green, Rhodamine B, Methylene blue and Methyl orange) were applied as targets and the saturated adsorption amounts were calculated. The Langmuir adsorption model and the Lagrange pseudo-second-order equation mathematical model were used to study the behavior of dye adsorption by GA, and the experimental data was in full compliance with the mathematical models. The excellent mechanical properties (compressibility and recoverability) make the GA suitable for dye adsorption. A computational simulation was also performed to verify the adsorption energy of GA to dyes. The GA was able to retain 89.5% of its initial removal efficiency (for malachite green) after 10 cycles of application. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Voltage unbalance is one of the main problems in electric distribution systems. The standards limit the level of voltage unbalance in a specific point without considering the agent of the network that produces it. Nevertheless, the identification of the responsible for system unbalance may be very important, for example, to establish the most suitable procedure to mitigate it. To do that, a new index, denominated unbalance current ratio, is proposed in this paper. It is based on decomposing the actual current at the input of the load in three components: the first one is that required by an unbalanced linear load, the second one is that required by a non-linear load, and the third corresponds to a balanced linear load. All of them compose the total current at the input of the analyzed load. The new index can be calculated only from the measurement of the current at the input of the load and the voltage at the point of common connection. Several simulation systems have been considered to check the index behavior, and an experimental platform has been designed to verify its validity in unbalanced non-sinusoidal systems.

AB A main concern in the simulation of adaptive behaviors is the characterization of organizational principles or architectures of adaptive behaviors in animals and synthetic animats. These characterizations are made through experimentation and analysis over well-defined models. In this work, we present a model to study the Vertical Cultural Transmission (VCT), as a catalytic factor over the interaction between individual learning and population evolution. Our model is based on the incorporation of advice, in the form of suggestions, as a way of information transmission between agents. An evolutionary reinforcement learning technique called classifier systems is used as the mechanism for individual learning. In particular, a recent variant based on the accuracy of the predictions made by the rules, called XCS, is applied. In order to control the environmental complexity, the Latent Energy Environments model, LEE, is adopted.
   Finally, we present experimental results comparing three populations that axe differentiated by their adaptation mechanisms: VCT learning, individual learning and evolution. For analise our results, we used self-organizing maps to clusterize two phenotypical traits that characterize our advise VCT model, belief and self-confidence.

AB We conducted a computer-based experiment with over 450 human participants and used a Bayesian model selection approach to explore dynamic exit route choice mechanisms of individuals in simulated crowd evacuations. In contrast to previous work, we explicitly explore the use of time-dependent and time-independent information in decision-making. Our findings suggest that participants tended to base their exit choices on time-dependent information, such as differences in queue lengths and queue speeds at exits rather than on time-independent information, such as differences in exit widths or exit route length. We found weak support for similar decision-making mechanisms under a stress-inducing experimental treatment. However, under this treatment participants were less able or willing to adjust their original exit choice in the course of the evacuation. Our experiment is not a direct test of behaviour in real evacuations, but it does highlight the role different types of information and stress play in real human decision-making in a virtual environment. Our findings may be useful in identifying topics for future study on real human crowd movements or for developing more realistic agent-based simulations.

AB People have a tendency to sell stocks more quickly if their value has increased since the time they were purchased than if their value has decreased during this period. This "disposition effect" can sometimes have negative financial consequences. Based on an analysis of transaction data in a simulated trading environment, Study 1 provides evidence of the disposition effect in a newly emerging Internet-based stock trading ("e-trading") situation. Three laboratory studies then examine the mechanisms that underlie the effect. The magnitude of the disposition effect is unaffected by experimental manipulations of the subjective likelihood of future gains or losses. However, it is eliminated by inducing participants to define gains and losses in similar subjective units. Furthermore, the effect depends on whether participants make selling decisions on their own stocks or serve as an agent for someone else. Thus, the disposition effect is largely a result of differences in the subjective value that participants attach to possible gains and losses rather than of differences in their beliefs that these outcomes will occur. The authors discuss theoretical and managerial implications of the findings.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe and illustrate an outcome-adaptive Bayesian procedure, proposed by Thall and Cook (2004), for assigning doses of an experimental treatment to successive cohorts of patients. The method uses elicited (efficacy, toxicity) probability pairs to construct a family of trade-off contours that are used to quantify the desirability of each dose. This provides a basis for determining a best dose for each cohort. The method combines the goals of conventional Phase I and Phase II trials, and thus may be called a "Phase I-II" design. We first give a general review of the probability model and dose-finding algorithm. We next describe an application to a trial of a biologic agent for treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, including a computer simulation study to assess the design's average behavior. To illustrate how the method may work in practice, we present a cohort-by-cohort example of a particular trial. We close with a discussion of some practical issues that may arise during implementation.

AB Using first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) and total-energy calculations, we demonstrate low-barrier bulk diffusion of Al-bearing species in gamma-NaAlH4, a recently proposed high-entropy polymorph of NaAlH4. For charged AlH4- and neutral AlH3 vacancies, the computed barriers for diffusion are <0.1 eV, and we directly observe the predicted diffusive pathways in FPMD simulations at picosecond time scales. In contrast, such diffusion in the alpha phase is inaccessible to FPMD, consistent with much higher barriers. The transport behavior of gamma-NaAlH4, in addition to key dynamical and structural signatures, is consistent with experimental observations of high-mobility species, strongly supporting the idea that an intermediate transition from the alpha phase to a high-entropy polymorph facilitates the hydrogen-releasing decomposition of NaAlH4. Our results provide an answer to longstanding questions regarding the responsible agent for the experimentally observed efficient Al transport during dehydrogenation and suggest that mass transport and phase transformation kinetics are coupled. Implications for understanding the (de)hydrogenation of undoped and catalyzed NaAlH4 are discussed.

AB Recently, great attention has been focused on using epoxy polymers in different fields such as aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, and electronics, owing to their superior properties. In this study, the classical molecular dynamics (MD) was used to simulate the cross linking of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) with diethylenetriamine (DETA) curing agent, and to study the behavior of resulted epoxy polymer with different conversion rates. The constant-strain (static) approach was then applied to calculate the mechanical properties (Bulk, shear and Young's moduli, elastic stiffness constants, and Poisson's ratio) of the uncured and cross-linked systems. Estimated material properties were found to be in good agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the dependency of mechanical properties on the cross linking density was investigated and revealed improvements in the mechanical properties with increasing the cross linking density. The radial distribution function (RDF) was also used to study the evolution of local structures of the simulated systems as a function of cross linking density.

AB The knowledge on the microscopic reduction behavior of fine iron ore in hot reducing gas flow is indispensable to accurate description of the extremely complex raceway combustion zone induced by PCI(Pulverized Coal Injection) and OI(fine iron Ore Injection) from blast furnace tuyeres. In the studies using the vertical flow reactor and the tube type reactor where fine materials were transported by the pressure difference in the gas chambers, and thereby a short residence time and a rapid heating rate of fine materials in the raceway combustion zone were simulated, the reduction degree of fine iron ore as well as the reduction morphology were investigated in detail under the conditions of the combined injection(PCI+OI) and the carbon coated ore injection. The experimental results revealed that the in-flight reduction degree of fine iron ore was significantly increased mainly by the improved efficiency of contact of fine ore particles with reducing agents. And the carbon coating of the fine ore surface achieved the most excellent condition for promoting the in-flight smelting reduction.

DE coherence; emergence; ergodicity; mesoscopic; meta-structures
ID LOGICAL OPENNESS
AB In this contribution, we consider Collective Behaviours as coherent sequences of spatial configurations adopted by agents interacting through corresponding different structures over time. The approach relates to the one adopted time ago when introducing the concept of multiple systems arising when each composing element can play simultaneously or sequentially different roles. In this case, each element simultaneously or sequentially belongs to different systems. Multiple structures over time and their sequences are considered as meta-structures establishing coherent sequences of different systems. They are intended as coherent when acquiring emergent properties. Such coherence is considered here as being represented by the values adopted by suitable mesoscopic variables and their properties, i.e. meta-structural properties, allowing the researcher to (a) recognise a phenomenon as emergent, (b) induce emergence of collective behaviour in populations of elements collectively interacting, (c) act on collective emergent phenomena with the purpose to change, regulate and maintain acquired properties and (d) merge different collective emergent phenomena. We introduce a formal tool, i.e. the mesoscopic general vector to represent the adoption, over time, of mesoscopic properties by collectively interacting elements. We mention future experimental lines of activities, future lines of research and possible applications.

AB Adequate acoustic coupling between the therapeutic transducer and the patient's body is essential for safe and efficient focused ultrasound surgery (FUS). There is currently no quantitative method for acoustic coupling verification in ultrasound-guided FUS. In this work, a quantitative method was developed and a related metric was introduced: the acoustic coupling coefficient. This metric associates the adequacy of the acoustic coupling with the reflected signals recorded through an imaging probe during a low-energy sonication. The acoustic coupling issue was simulated in silico and validated through in vitro tests. Our results indicated a sigmoidal behavior of the introduced metric as the contact surface between the coupling system and the patient's skin increases. The proposed method could be a safety-check criterion for verifying the adequacy of the acoustic coupling before starting the FUS treatment, thus ensuring efficient energy transmission to the target and preventing damage to both the patient and the instrumentation.

AB For synthesis of ethyl propionate with ethanol and propionic acid as raw materials, n-hexane and cyclohexane are usually used as water-carrying agents. However, ethanol can form the minimum boiling azeotropic mixtures with n-hexane and cyclohexane. For separating the binary azeotropic mixtures (ethanol + n-hexane) and (ethanol + cyclohexane) by extractive distillation, in this work, the suitable entrainers were explored by selectivity and relative volatility, and the influence of the selected entrainers on the azeotropic system phase behaviour was analyzed. Based on the selection results, butyl propanoate and butyl butanoate were adopted as the entainers. The vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data for the four binary mixtures (n-hexane + butyl propanoate), (n-hexane + butyl butanoate), (cyclohexane + butyl propanoate) and (cyclohexane + butyl butanoate) were investigated. Furthermore, the VLE data was validated using the van Ness and Herington tests. Also, the experimental data was fitted by the Wilson, UNIQUAC and NRTL models. The binary interaction parameters were optimized for the separation process design and simulation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigated dissolution processes of cavitation bubbles generated during in vivo shock wave (SW)-induced treatments. Both active cavitation detection (ACD) and the B-mode imaging technique were applied to measure the dissolution procedure of biSpheres contrast agent bubbles by in vitro experiments. Besides, the simulation of SW-induced cavitation bubbles dissolution behaviors detected by the B-mode imaging system during in vivo SW treatments, including extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), were carried out based on calculating the integrated scattering cross-section of dissolving gas bubbles with employing gas bubble dissolution equations and Gaussian bubble size distribution. The results showed that (i) B-mode imaging technology is an effective tool to monitor the temporal evolution of cavitation bubbles dissolution procedures after the SW pulses ceased, which is important for evaluation and controlling the cavitation activity generated during subsequent SW treatments within a treatment period; (ii) the characteristics of the bubbles, such as the bubble size distribution and gas diffusion, can be estimated by simulating the experimental data properly.

AB The anthracycline anticancer agents daunorubicin (DAUN) and doxorubicin (DOX) are reduced by different NADPH-dependent cytosolic reductases into their corresponding alcohol metabolites daunorubicinol (DAUNol) and doxorubicinol (DOXol), which have been implicated in the development of chronic cardiomyopathy. To better understand the individual importance of each enzyme in the reduction and to provide deeper insight into the binding at atomic level we performed molecular docking and dynamics simulations of DAUN and DOX into the active sites of human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and human aldehyde reductase (AKR1A1). Such simulations evidenced a different behavior between the reductases with respect to DAUN and DOX suggesting major contribution of CBR1 in the reduction. The results are in agreement with available experimental data and for each enzyme and anthracycline pair provided the identification of key residues involved in the interactions. The structural models that we have derived could serve as a useful tool for structure-guided drug design studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB A kinetic model incorporating the effects of diffusion-controlled reactions on INIFERTER (initiator-transfer agent-terminator) thermal free-radical polymerization has been developed. Molecular weight development is done using the method of moments. Diffusion-controlled effects are modeled using free-volume theory. The reactions considered to be diffusion-controlled are: monomer propagation, bimolecular radical termination, dormant termination, chain transfer to monomer, and chain transfer to iniferter. Radical, generation by thermal self-initiation is also included in the model. Model predictions indicate that diffusion-controlled propagation reduces the "living" behavior of the system, whereas a diffusion-controlled termination enhances its livingness. The livingness of the system is also enhanced by diffusion-controlled dormant termination. When diffusion-controlled termination is important, our simulations show that the overall effect of the diffusion controlled phenomena in iniferter polymerization is to enhance the livingness of the system. Experimental data from the literature for styrene, and methyl methacrylate homopolymerizations have been used to validate the kinetic model. The agreement is reasonably good.

AB This paper describes an electrochemical stripping procedure for ultratrace measurements of iron, in which preconcentration is achieved by the adsorption of a iron-[2-thiazolylazo)-4- methyl phenol] complex onto a static mercury drop electrode.  Cyclic voltammetry was used to characterize the interfacial and redox behavior.  For a 5 minute preconcentration time, the detection limit found was 1.8 x 10(-9) mol/l.  Optimum experimental conditions were found by the use of a stirred triethanolamine (pH 8.6) solution with 2-[2-thiazolylazo- 4- methyl phenol] concentration of 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l, a preconcentration potential of -0.46V and linear scan mode.  With preconcentration for 30 sec., calibration plots for iron are linear for the 5-29mug/l range.  Possible interferences by masking agents and several trace ions have been investigated.  The interference of copper and uranium are eliminated by addition of CyDTA and carbonate ion respectively.  Simultaneous determination of iron with copper and nickel is possible.  The merits of the aforementioned procedure are demonstrated in the analysis of fresh water.

AB A novel and successful application of ring-closing reactions of aminophenols has been proposed for the formation of a new type of 1,3-benzoxazine ionic derivatives. The optimization of the reaction and detailed computational studies have been reported for the estimation of heterocyclic ring stability and its further transformation, which is crucial in the polymerization process. The molecular structure of the obtained compounds has been fully characterized by applying X-ray analysis and spectroscopic methods. The novel benzoxazines undergo an intriguing thermal reaction leading to classical benzoxazines and chloroalkanes, which is the first step of transformation before polymerization. To gain more insights into the transformation behavior of ionic benzoxazine derivatives, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of gaseous products were recorded in experiments with near simultaneous FT-IR/TGA measurements. The combination of thermogravimetry with FT-IR spectroscopy enables the quantitative and qualitative characterization of thermal transformation products and clarification of the reaction mechanism. The experimental data have been verified by applying DFT(B3LYP) and DFT(M062x) theoretical studies.

ID NATURAL-GAS
AB Co-injection of two or more reducing agents via tuyeres may ensure technological, economic and environmental benefits and enhance the flexibility of use of various reductants. The blast furnace technology with top gas recycling, recently tested in the scope of the ULCOS program aiming at significant mitigation of CO2 emissions, is also based on co-injection of reducing gas, pulverised coal and pure oxygen. This paper presents results of a study on conversion behaviour of pulverised coal while co-injecting further substances with focus on tuyere assembly design. Factors affecting the coal particle conversion in the raceway derived from the combustion mechanism and constructional features of tuyere stock arrangement are firstly discussed. An experimental work was performed using the Multifunctional Injection Rig for Ironmaking (MIRI) at the Department of Ferrous Metallurgy, RWTH Aachen University. Tests simulating different scenarios for injection of coal, carbon monoxide and oxygen were conducted. Conversion degree determined by three methods and microstructural analysis were used to examine the effect of pre-mixing of coal with above mentioned components on its combustion behaviour. Results obtained give hints for optimising the lance arrangement.

TI Dynamics of encapsulated hepatitis B surface antigen: A combined neutron

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL-SPECIAL TOPICS

ID SILICA; WATER; SCATTERING; NMR
AB As a consequence of its ordered pore architecture, mesoporous SBA-15 offers new possibilities for incorporating biological agents. Considering its applicability in oral vaccination, which shows more beneficial features when compared with parenteral vaccines, SBA-15 is also seen as a very promising adjuvant to carry, protect, and deliver entrapped antigens. Recent studies have shown several remarkable features in the immunization of hepatitis B, a viral disease transmitted mainly through blood or serum transfer. However, the surface antigen of the hepatitis B virus, HBsAg, is too large to fit inside the SBA-15 matrix with mean pore diameter around 10 nm, thus raising the question of how SBA-15 can protect the antigen. In this work, thermal analysis combined with neutron spectroscopy allowed us to shed light on the interactions between HBsAg and SBA-15 as well as on the role that these interactions play in the efficiency of this promising oral vaccination method. This information was obtained by verifying how the dynamic behaviour of the antigen is modified under confinement in SBA-15, thus also establishing an experimental method for verifying molecular dynamics simulations.

AB Two highly cross-linked epoxy networks based on two epoxy resin model compounds with similar structures, 2,5-bis[(2-oxiranylmethoxy)-methyl]-furan (BOF) and 2,5-bis[(2-oxiranylmethoxy) methyl]-benzene (BOB), and the same curing agent PACM were constructed by using molecular dynamic simulations. Several thermomechanical properties of these two systems including glass transition temperatures, coefficients of thermal expansion, Young's moduli, and Poisson's ratios were calculated. The simulated values were compared with the available experimental results, and good agreements were obtained. This consistency proved the validity of the atomistic models. The changes of aromatic structures in the epoxy monomers from phenyl to furyl lead to a higher glassy Young's modulus of the cross-linked epoxy network. This phenomenon can be illustrated by the reduced mobility of the polymer chains arising from the increased packing efficiency. These changes are considered to be induced by the higher van der Waals energy within the furan-based epoxy.

AB Simultaneous speciation of lead, mercury, and selenium was carried out by capillary electrophoresis. The method used a polyaminocarboxylic acid, triethylenetetraminehexaacetic acid (TTHA), as an off-column complexing agent to form W-absorbing complexes with the analytes for direct UV detection. TTHA was also added to the background electrolyte for the on-column complexations of the analytes, as well as for improving resolution and detection. To describe the migration behavior of the complexes, a theoretical model, considerating pH value and the concentrations of TTHA and SDS, was proposed. The parameters in the model were calculated on the basis of the experimental data, by nonlinear regression. The results were in good agreement with those from the literature. The model can be used for the prediction of migration behavior and for the optimization of the separation conditions. Field-amplified stacking injection was performed because the complexes were charged. Up to 1500-fold on-line enrichment and down to sub-nanogram-per-milliliter detection limits were obtained for the analytes under the optimal stacking conditions. Finally, the applicability of the method was evaluated on seawater samples.

AB The gasification process is being developed to obtain environmentally clean and efficient syngas from solid (coal, biomass, and municipal solid waste) or liquid (heavy oil and waste lubricant oil) fuels for power generation. An Aspen Plus model of crude oil gasification in presence of steam as a gasifying agent that can predict syngas yield, tar concentration, and performance parameters was developed. Effects of some critical parameters such as gasification temperature, steam-fuel-ratio on hydrogen yield, tar content, and char conversion of three different crude oils were explored. Results showed that the hydrogen yield increases by increasing steam/fuel ratio from 0.5 to 0.7 (wt/wt), and then reduces smoothly due to the endothermic behavior of methane reforming reaction, which releases three hydrogen moles. It also found that as the temperature increases within the range, hydrogen yield increases dramatically, which can be explained according to the Le Chatelier's principle on the endothermic reforming reactions of methane and tar cracking. Modeling results validated against the experimental measurements and found to be in a good agreement.

AB In the context of global aging, how to design traffic facilities for a population with a different age composition is of high importance. For this purpose, we propose a model based on the least effort principle to simulate heterogeneous pedestrian flow. In the model, the pedestrian is represented by a three-disc shaped agent. We add a new parameter to realize pedestrians' preference to avoid changing their direction of movement too quickly. The model is validated with numerous experimental data on unidirectional pedestrian flow. In addition, we investigate the influence of corridor width and velocity distribution of crowds on unidirectional heterogeneous pedestrian flow. The simulation results reflect that widening corridors could increase the specific flow for the crowd composed of two kinds of pedestrians with significantly different free velocities. Moreover, compared with a unified crowd, the crowd composed of pedestrians with great mobility differences requires a wider corridor to attain the same traffic efficiency. This study could be beneficial in providing a better understanding of heterogeneous pedestrian flow, and quantified outcomes could be applied in traffic facility design. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB NiF2/C composites were prepared through high energy mechanical milling, and the cyclic performance was characterized by discharge-charge measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) for NiF2/C electrode were obtained at different potentials during initial discharge-charge cycle. The results revealed the typical EIS characteristics appeared with three semicircles in the Nyquist diagram at 1.6 V. An equivalent circuit was proposed to simulate the experimental EIS data, and it was found that the high frequency semicircle (HFS) is mainly caused by lithium-ion through the SEI film on the electrode surface, the middle frequency semicircle (MFS) should be related to the Schottky contact between NiF2 and conductive agents, which may be the important feature of such composites materials with big band gap, Besides the low frequency arc (LFA) was observed as the charge transfer step. Consequently a modified model was proposed to explain the impedance response of NiF2/C electrode for lithium ion batteries.

DE hot rolling; coefficient of friction; lubrication; simulation testing
AB In order to reduce the rolling force and the roll wear, the lubricants have been used in hot sheet rolling of steel, but the lubrication behavior at the interface between roll and workpiece in hot steel rolling have never been well understood. On the other hand, hot rolling process with high reduction in thickness have been developed to produce the ultra-fine grained steels. The high reduction in hot rolling causes some troubles such as the increase of the rolling force, the occurrence of friction pick up and so on. To solve these problems, the lubrication behavior at the interface between roll and workpiece in hot steel rolling must be quantitatively understood. In this paper, the coefficients of friction were measured by using the newly developed simulation testing machine for hot rolling. The effects of lubricant factors such as the compositions and the viscosity of the base oil and the additive agents on the coefficient of friction were investigated.

AB In order to reduce the rolling force and the roll wear, the lubricants have been used in hot sheet rolling of steel, but the lubrication behavior at the interface between roll and workpiece in hot steel rolling have never been well understood. On the other hand. hot rolling process with high reduction in thickness have been developed to produce the ultra-fine grained steels. The high reduction in hot rolling causes some troubles such as the increase of the rolling force, the occurrence of friction pick up and so on. To solve these problems, the lubrication behavior at the interface between roll and workpiece in hot steel rolling must be quantitatively understood. In this paper, the coefficients of friction were measured by using the newly developed simulation testing machine for hot rolling. The effects of lubricant factors such as the compositions and the viscosity of the base oil and the additive agents on the coefficient of friction were investigated. From these experimental results, the lubrication behavior at the interface between roll and workpiece was investigated and the lubrication mechanism was proposed.

AB The viability of a variety of wheat seeds Mas investigated by use of the EPR technique, Three different types of spin probes (4-Hydroxy-TEMPO (TANOL), 3-Carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolin-1-yloxy, 3-Carbamoyl-PROXYL) were utilized in examining the viability of embryo cells. The penetration of the spin probe across the membrane was observed via the change in signal intensity against time for dry embryos of the variety of wheat seeds soaked in aqueous solutions of spin probe and line broadening agent. From the analysis of the signal intensity-time curves (i.e. rehydration curves) it was observed that the two kinds having different genetic roots (Bezostaya, Kunduru) exhibit similar saturation behaviour whereas Gerek saturates much more easily. The rehydration curves for naturally aged seeds indicates that aging causes rapid saturation and an important decrease in the signal intensity. In order to get better insight on the effect of the signals from polar and nonpolar regions on the experimental spectra, these spectra were simulated by the use of the theoretical models developed.

AB Synthesis of new zeolites involving organic molecules relies heavily on the trial-and-error approach, because it is difficult to interpret the determining effects of organics on zeolite crystal symmetry. Here, the intrinsic relationships among the space-filling of organics, included volume of channels, and zeolite crystal symmetry, are systematically demonstrated by experimental and computational means. Under controlled conditions, the dimer and "monomer" organics of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium selectively direct different, but related, germanosilicates, the ECNU-16 with a new topology and the existing IM-16 with the UOS topology, respectively. The comprehensive computational study reveals that the zeolite phase selectivity is determined by the unique space-filling behavior of the dimer and monomer organics, which is closely correlated to their rotation freedom, as well as the included volume of host zeolite channels. The elucidation of this crucial space-filling effect from the fundamental viewpoint will provide new guidelines for the rational design and synthesis of new zeolites in future.

AB The construction of metro in China is in a period of an unprecedented development in recent years, and the passengers are in high density within the metro during the operation time, the problem of occupant safety in emergencies has attracted more and more attentions. During the design and operation stages, modeling of the metro station evacuation capacity by using the computational models is an effective measure for guaranteeing the metro evacuation safety in the future. In this article, the safety strategy of evacuation in metro stations is first investigated and established, which involves the occupants needed to be evacuated, the evacuation route, and the safety zone. Then, an engineering calculation method for the metro station evacuation time is proposed. Based on the experimental data, simulation of evacuation process in different fire cases is conducted by using an agent-based model, so as to study the features of occupant evacuation behavior, the evacuation time, the passage flow rate, and the strategy of using the escalator as evacuation passage. These conclusions will be helpful for guiding the safe evacuation design of metros in China. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A model to predict refolding of proteins in a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) was developed and compared to a batch refolding process with simple dilution of the protein in a stirred tank reactor. For experimental verification of the model a continuous refolding of a model protein (alpha-lactalbumin) was performed in a CSTR. The refolding process of denatured and fully reduced alpha-lactalbumin could be accurately predicted by a set of differential equations assuming a first order reaction rate for folding and a second order reaction rate for aggregation. The system composed of a CSTR with an additional diafiltration circuit for removal of denaturing agents from the feed solution and to maintain constant refolding conditions. Based on the folding kinetic the dynamic behavior of such a continuous refolding reactor was simulated under different operating conditions. It was shown that the refolding efficiency was higher compared to batch dilution under certain conditions, namely high residence times. The yield of refolded protein could further increased by recycling the outlet stream containing unfolded protein to the reactor entrance. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Three experimental techniques were used to characterize the cure state of an epoxy resin system of DGEBA epoxide and DDS diamine curing agent. Samples were prepared from non-stoichiometric monomer mixtures designed so as to simulate various stages of cure of a stoichiometrically prepared epoxy. Such an approach allows for variable temperature characterization of specimens without concern for ongoing chemical reactions that would cloud interpretation of results. Additional experiments were performed on stoichiometric samples that were isothermally cured. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the heat of reaction and glass transition temperature. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to measure complex modulus, while ultrasonic cure monitoring (UCM) was used to measure longitudinal velocity throughout cure. DSC analysis was found to be insensitive to changes occurring at the latter stage of polymer network development, especially after vitrification. DMA characterization, however, was found to be quite sensitive to the rubbery modulus (and as such, the cure state), but is limited to cure states above gelation. Only the UCM technique was robust enough to accommodate all cure states while providing highly sensitive measurements of mechanical property development.

AB Predominantly heterosexual HIV-1 epidemics like those in sub-Saharan Africa continue to have high HIV incidence in young people. We used a stochastic, agent-based model for age-disparate networks to test the hypothesis that focusing uptake and retention of ART among youth could enhance the efficiency of treatment as prevention (TasP) campaigns. We used the model to identify strategies that reduce incidence to negligible levels (i.e., < 0.1 cases/100 person-years) 20-25 years after initiation of a targeted TasP campaign. The model was parameterized using behavioral, demographic, and clinical data from published papers and national reports. To keep a focus on the underlying age effects we model a generalized heterosexual population with average risks (i.e., no MSM, no PWIDs, no sex workers) and no entry of HIV+ people from other regions. The model assumes that most people (default 95%, range in variant simulations 60-95%) are "linkable"; i.e., could get linked to effective care given sufficient resources. To simplify the accounting, we assume a rapid jump in the number of people receiving treatment at the start of the TasP campaign, followed by a 2% annual increase that continues until all linkable HIV+ people have been treated. Under historical scenarios of CD4-based targeted ART allocation and current policies of untargeted (random) ART allocation, our model predicts that viral replication would need to be suppressed in 60-85% of infected people at the start of the TasP campaign to drive incidence to negligible levels. Under age-based strategies, by contrast, this percentage dropped by 18-54%, depending on the strength of the epidemic and the age target. For our baseline model, targeting those under age 30 halved the number of people who need to be treated. Age-based targeting also minimized total and time-discounted AIDS deaths over 25 years. Age-based targeting yielded benefits without being highly exclusive; in a model in which 60% of infected people were treated, similar to 87% and similar to 58% of those initiating therapy during a campaign targeting those <25 and <30 years, respectively, fell outside the target group. Sensitivity analyses revealed that youth-focused TasP is beneficial due to age-related risk factors (e.g. shorter relationship durations), and an age-specific herd immunity (ASHI) effect that protects uninfected adolescents entering the sexually active population. As testing rates increase in response to UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals, efforts to link all young people to care and treatment could contribute enormously to ending the HIV epidemic.

AB Objective: To model the cumulative probability of pregnancy among couples with subfertility without a definitive diagnosis, according to different treatment strategies.
   Design: A beta distribution of fecundity was fitted that reproduced the cumulative probability of pregnancy in prospective studies of natural fertility, and this distribution was applied to simulated cohorts starting with one million couples each. Probabilities of pregnancy were generated for each cycle of each couple.
   Setting: Simulation study.
   Patient(s): Hypothetic subfertile population.
   Intervention(s): After 2 or 4 years of attempting pregnancy and diagnostic evaluation to exclude anovulation, tubal obstruction, and severe male factor, simulated treatments were applied to the remaining nonpregnant couples, with treatment effects based on published literature.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Simulated cumulative probability of pregnancy.
   Result(s): Initially, the cumulative probability of pregnancy was highest for early treatment with IVF, but over time, conservative treatment or frequent intercourse approached the same cumulative probability.
   Conclusion(s): In couples without clear indications for IVF, the main benefit of early IVF may be to shorten time to pregnancy, a benefit that must be weighed against costs and potential adverse outcomes. Couples should be encouraged to maintain regular intercourse to maximize chances of pregnancy, even after unsuccessful treatment attempts. (Fertil Steril (R) 2010;93:2175-81.

AB The research project GLOWA-Danube, financed by the German Federal Government, is investigating long-term changes in the water cycle of the upper Danube river basin (77,000 km(2)) in light of global climatic change. Its aim is to build a fully integrated decision-support tool "DANUBIA" that combines the competence of 11 different research institutes in domains covering all major aspects governing the water cycle-from the formation of clouds, to groundwater flow patterns, to the behaviour of the water consumer. Both the influence of natural changes in the ecosystem, such as climate change, and changes in human behaviour, such as changes in land use or water consumption, are considered. DANUBIA is comprised of 15 individual disciplinary models that are connected via customized interfaces that facilitate network-based parallel calculations. The strictly object-oriented DANUBIA architecture was developed using the graphical notation tool UML (Unified Modeling Language) and has been implemented in Java code. All models use the same spatial discretisation for the exchange of data (1 x 1 km grid cells) but are using different time steps. The representation of a vast number of relevant physical and social processes that occur at different spatial and temporal scales is a very demanding task. Newly developed up- and downscaling procedures [Rojanschi, V., 2001. Effects of upscaling for a finite-difference flow model. Master's Thesis, Institut fur Wasserbau, Universitat Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany] and a sophisticated time controller developed by the computer sciences group [Hennicker, R., Barth, M., Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2002. DANUBIA: A Web-based modelling and decision support system for integrative global change research in the upper Danube basin. In: GSF (Ed.), GLOWA, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle Status Report 2002. GSF, Munich, pp. 35-38; Kraus, A., Ludwig, M., 2003. GLOWA-Danube Papers Technical Release No. 002 (Danubia Framework), Software-Release No.: 0.9.2, Documentation Version: 0.10, Release Date: 27 March 2003] are required to solve the emerging problems. After a first successful public demonstration of the DANUBIA package (nine models) in May 2002 [Mauser, W., Stolz, R., Colgan, A., 2002. GLOWA-Danube: integrative techniques, scenarios and strategies regarding global change of the water cycle. In: GSF (Ed.), GLOWA, German Program on Global Change in the Hydrological Cycle (Phase I, 2000-2003) Status Report 2002. GSF, Munich, pp. 31-34], the research consortium is now preparing a first validation run of DANUBIA for the period 1995-1999 with all 15 models. After successful completion of the validation, a scenario run based on IPCC climate scenarios [IPCC, 2001. Climate Change 2001: Synthesis Report. In: Watson, R.T., Core Writing Team (Eds.), A Contribution of Working Groups I, II, and III to the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA, 398pp] for a five year period between 2025 and 2040 will follow at the end of 2003.
   The research group "Groundwater and Water Resources Management" at the Institute of Hydraulic Engineering, Universitat Stuttgart, is contributing both a three-dimensional groundwater flow model of the catchment and an agent-based model for simulating water supply and distribution. This paper gives a general overview of the GLOWA-Danube project and describes the groundwater modeling segment. Nickel et al. deal with the water supply model in a second contribution to this special issue.
   A three-dimensional numerical groundwater flow model consisting of four main layers has been developed and is in a continual state of refinement (MODFLOW, [McDonald, M.G., Harbaugh, AW., 1988. A modular three-dimensional finite-difference ground-water flow model: US Geological Survey Techniques of Water-Resources Investigations, Washington, USA (book 6, Chapter A1)]). One main research focus has been on the investigation of upscaling techniques to meet the requirement of a fixed 1 x 1 km cell size. This cell size is compulsory for all models in DANUBIA in order to facilitate a one to one parameter exchange. In a second stage, a transport model (nitrogen) will be added (MT3D): [Zheng, C., Hathaway, D-L., 1991. MT3D: a new modular three-dimensional transport model and its application in predicting the persistence and transport of dissolved compounds from a gasoline spill, with implications for remediation.

AB Background: As a traditional method for the assessment of colon dynamics, radio-opaque markers (ROMs) are limited in clinical use because of their ionizing radiation. We compared the accuracy and applicability of gadolinium-based capsules with ROMs in the measurement of colon dynamics in healthy controls and slow transit constipation (STC) patients.
   Methods: Seven patients with STC and nine healthy controls under a normal diet orally consumed ROMs and gadolinium-based capsules simultaneously. All subjects underwent X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Healthy control images were acquired at 12, 24, and 48 h, and STC patient images were acquired at 24, 48, and 72 h. The scores based on the position of the labeling capsules and ROMs in the colon and the colon transit times (CTTs) in the two groups were compared.
   Key Results: The CTTs obtained via the ROMs were 34.7 +/- 17.4 and 67.3 +/- 6.5 h in the healthy controls and STC patients, respectively (P <.05). The CTTs obtained via MRI were 30.9 +/- 15.9 and 74.1 +/- 7.2 h in the healthy controls and STC patients, respectively (P <.05). The CTTs of the STC patients were significantly longer than the healthy controls. The correlation (r(s)) between the scores based on the position of the labeling capsule and ROMs in the healthy group and the STC patients was .880 (P <.05) and .889 (P <.05), respectively.
   Conclusions and Inferences: As a MRI contrast label, gadolinium-based capsules exhibit results comparable to ROMs in colon motility measurements.

   LOWER-LIMB; BUPIVACAINE; ANALGESIA; LIDOCAINE; MIXTURE; ONSET
AB Background: An ideal local anesthetic with rapid onset and prolonged duration has yet to be developed. Clinicians use mixtures of local anesthetics in an attempt to combine their advantages. We tested the hypothesis that sequential supraclavicular injection of 1.5% mepivacaine followed 90 secs later by 0.5% ropivacaine speeds onset of sensory block and prolongs duration of analgesia compared with simultaneous injection of the same 2 local anesthetics.
   Methods: We enrolled 103 patients undergoing surgery suitable for supraclavicular anesthesia. The primary outcome was time to 4-nerve sensory block onset in each of the 4 major nerve distributions: median, ulnar, radial, and musculocutaneous. Secondary outcomes included time to onset of first sensory block, time to complete motor block, duration of analgesia, pain scores at rest and with movement, and total opioid consumption. Outcomes were compared using the Kaplan-Meier analysis with the log-rank test or the analysis of variance, as appropriate.
   Results: Times to 4-nerve sensory block onset were not different between sequential and combined anesthetic administration. The time to complete motor block onset was faster in the combined group as compared with the sequential. There were not significant differences between the 2 randomized groups in other secondary outcomes, such as the time to onset of first sensory block, the duration of analgesia, the pain scores at rest or with movement, or the total opioid consumption.
   Conclusions: Sequential injection of 1.5% mepivacaine followed 90 secs later by 0.5% ropivacaine provides no advantage compared with simultaneous injection of the same doses.

   Sex-separated model; Hermafroditic model
ID SPECIES FORMATION; RING; EVOLUTION; MODEL
AB The branching of new species from an ancestral population requires the evolution of reproductive isolation between groups of individuals. Geographic separation of sub-populations by natural barriers, if sustained for sufficiently long times, may lead to the accumulation of independent genetic changes in each group and to mating incompatibilities (Mayr, 2001; Fitzpatrick et al., 2009). A similar phenomenon may occur in the absence of barriers via isolation by distance if the population is distributed over large areas (de Aguiar et al., 2009; Etienne and Haegeman, 2011; Gavrilets et al., 2000). The first demonstration of this process was based on computer simulations employing agent-based models. Recently, analytical results were derived combining network theory, to model the spatial structure of the population, and an ansatz that accounts for the effect of forbidding mating between individuals that are too different genetically (de Aguiar and Bar-Yam, 2011). The main result obtained with this approach is an expression that indicates when speciation is possible as a function of the parameters describing the population. The aim of this work is to test this analytical result by comparing it with numerical simulations for a hermaphroditic population (de Aguiar et al., 2009) and for a population whose individuals are explicitly separated into males and females (Baptestini et al., 2013). We show that the analytical formula is indeed a very good overall description of the simulations and that the exponents describing dependence of the critical threshold of speciation with the parameters are in good agreement with the simulations.

AB Variation of subharmonic response from contrast microbubbles with ambient pressure is numerically investigated for non-invasive monitoring of organ-level blood pressure. Previously, several contrast microbubbles both in vitro and in vivo registered approximately linear (5-15 dB) subharmonic response reduction with 188 mm Hg change in ambient pressure. In contrast, simulated subharmonic response from a single microbubble is seen here to either increase or decrease with ambient pressure. This is shown using the code BUBBLESIM for encapsulated microbubbles, and then the underlying dynamics is investigated using a free bubble model. The ratio of the excitation frequency to the natural frequency of the bubble is the determining parameter-increasing ambient pressure increases natural frequency thereby changing this ratio. For frequency ratio below a lower critical value, increasing ambient pressure monotonically decreases subharmonic response. Above an upper critical value of the same ratio, increasing ambient pressure increases subharmonic response; in between, the subharmonic variation is non-monotonic. The precise values of frequency ratio for these three different trends depend on bubble radius and excitation amplitude. The modeled increase or decrease of subharmonic with ambient pressure, when one happens, is approximately linear only for certain range of excitation levels. Possible reasons for discrepancies between model and previous experiments are discussed. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI:10.1121/1.3552884]

AB Background. In acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) antibiotic overprescribing leads to antimicrobial resistance and underprescribing may cause poor patient outcomes.
   Objective. This study aimed to evaluate changes in over-and underprescribing of antibiotics after two interventions to optimize antibiotic prescribing in AECOPD in Spain.
   Methods. In 2008 and 2009, general practitioners (GPs) registered patients in a 3-week period before and after interventions. Two types of intervention were conducted: GPs in the full-intervention group (FIG) were exposed to a multifaceted intervention and given access to C-reactive protein (CRP) rapid test; partial-intervention group (PIG) was only exposed to the multifaceted intervention. Overprescribing was defined as antibiotic given to type III* exacerbation (<= one Anthonisen Criteria); underprescribing was defined as no antibiotic given to type I exacerbation (three Anthonisen Criteria). A multivariate logistic regression model was used, considering antibiotic prescribing as the dependent variable.
   Results. A total of 210 GPs and 70 GPs were assigned to FIG and PIG, respectively, and 952 AECOPD patients were eligible for main analysis. After adjusting for clustering at GP level and for patient age and sex, we found that GPs in FIG significantly reduced antibiotic overprescribing; odds ratio (OR) = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.18-0.68, P = 0.003) and underprescribing was not significantly increased; OR = 0.25 (95% CI: 0.06 to 1.0, P = 0.075). No statistically significant changes were found in the PIG.
   Conclusion. Antibiotic overprescribing was only reduced when CRP test was available. Simultaneously, underprescribing was not significantly increased, but this could be due to sample size limitations.

AB Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting toxicity caused by several chemotherapeutic agents. Currently, CIPN is managed by empirical dose modifications at the discretion of the treating physician. The goal of this research is to quantitate the dose-CIPN relationship to inform the optimal strategies for dose modification. Data were obtained from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 40502 trial, a randomized phase III trial of paclitaxel vs. nab-paclitaxel vs. ixabepilone as first-line chemotherapy for locally recurrent or metastatic breast cancer. CIPN was measured using a subset of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Gynecologic Oncology Group Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) scale. A kinetic-pharmacodynamic (K-PD) model was utilized to quantitate the dose-CIPN relationship simultaneously for the three drugs. Indirect response models with linear and S-max drug effects were evaluated. The model was evaluated by comparing the predicted proportion of patients with CIPN (score >= 8 or score >= 12) to the observed proportion. An indirect response model with linear drug effect was able to describe the longitudinal CIPN data reasonably well. The proportion of patients that were falsely predicted to have CIPN or were falsely predicted not to have CIPN was 20% or less at any cycle. The model will be utilized to identify an early time point that can predict CIPN at later time points. This strategy will be utilized to inform dose adjustments to prospectively manage CIPN.

AB PURPOSE: To compare mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) to methotrexate (MTX) as corticosteroid-sparing therapy for ocular inflammatory diseases.
   DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of cohort study data.
   METHODS: Participants were identified from the Systemic Immunosuppressive Therapy for Eye Diseases Cohort Study. Demographic and clinical characteristics were obtained via medical record review. The study included 352 patients who were taking single-agent immunosuppression with MTX or MMF at 4 tertiary uveitis clinics. Marginal structural models (MSM)-derived statistical weighting created a virtual population with covariates and censoring patterns balanced across alternative treatments. With this methodological approach, the results estimate what would have happened had none of the patients stopped their treatment. Survival analysis with stabilized MSM-derived weights simulated a clinical trial comparing MMF vs MTX for noninfectious inflammatory eye disorders. The primary outcome was complete control of inflammation on prednisone 510 mg/day, sustained for >= 30 days.
   RESULTS: The time to success was shorter (more favorable) for MMF than MTX (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.99). Adjusting for covariates, the proportion achieving success was higher at every point in time for MMF than MTX from 2 to 8 months, then converges at 9 months. The onset of corticosteroid-sparing success took more than 3 months for most patients in both groups. Outcomes of treatment (MMF vs MTX) were similar across all anatomic sites of inflammation. The incidence of stopping therapy for toxicity was similar in both groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, on average, MMF may be faster than MTX in achieving corticosteroid-sparing success in ocular inflammatory diseases. ((C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.)

AB Objectives: To evaluate the effects of a 6% hydrogen peroxide tooth whitener, Xtra White, on sound human enamel microhardness in vitro after an extended and exaggerated simulated 8 weeks of product use. Method and Materials: Polished human enamel specimens were prepared and baseline microhardness and color measurements determined. The enamel specimens were exposed to a fluoride-containing toothpaste for 30 seconds and then exposed to water, Xtra White, a control carbopol gel containing no hydrogen peroxide, or a carbonated beverage (each group, n = 8) for 20 minutes. Specimens were exposed to whole saliva at all other times. In order to simulate 8 weeks of extended product use, quadruple the length of the manufacturer's instructions, 112 treatments, were conducted. Microhardness measurements were taken after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of simulated treatments, and color was measured after 2 and 8 weeks. Results: The Xtra White-treated specimens showed a statistically significant (P < .0001) increase in L-star and decrease in b(star) compared to the water-treated specimens after 2 weeks simulated use, indicating bleaching had occurred. The carbonated beverage-treated specimens were significantly softened (P = .0009) compared to baseline after only 1 treatment. The carbopol gel-treated specimens were significantly softened (P = .0028) after 2 weeks of simulated treatments compared to baseline. There were no statistically significant differences in enamel microhardness between baseline and all treatment times for XW and water groups. Conclusion: Xtra While does not have any deleterious effects on sound human enamel rnicrohardness after an extended and exaggerated simulated 8 weeks of product use.

AB Recently, many studies have been carried out in relation to 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation (RF) emitted from a mobile phone on the brain. However, there is little data concerning possible mechanisms between long-term exposure of RF radiation and biomolecules in brain. Therefore, we aimed to investigate long-term effects of 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation on beta amyloid protein, protein carbonyl, and malondialdehyde in the rat brain. The study was carried out on 17 Wistar Albino adult male rats. The rat heads in a carousel were exposed to 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation emitted from a generator, simulating mobile phones. For the study group (n: 10), rats were exposed to the radiation 2 h per day (7 days a week) for 10 months. For the sham group (n: 7), rats were placed into the carousel and the same procedure was applied except that the generator was turned off. In this study, rats were euthanized after 10 months of exposure and their brains were removed. Beta amyloid protein, protein carbonyl, and malondialdehyde levels were found to be higher in the brain of rats exposed to 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation. However, only the increase of protein carbonyl in the brain of rats exposed to 900 MHz radiofrequency radiation was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). In conclusion, 900 MHz radiation emitted from mobile/cellular phones can be an agent to alter some biomolecules such as protein. However, further studies are necessary.

AB Background: Polypharmacy for schizophrenia treatment is not justified by the available clinical evidence. We evaluated a treatment reduction approach that reduces the dose and number of antipsychotic medications simultaneously prescribed to patients.
   Methods: In a randomized open study of the Safe Correction of Antipsychotic Polypharmacy and High-Dose Prescriptions program funded by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare, we evaluated a drug reduction method consisting of a dose reduction intervention performed on 163 patients with schizophrenia for twelve or 24 weeks. One antipsychotic medication was removed each week from each patient's treatment regimen by reducing the dose by 0 to 50 chlorpromazine equivalents. Data on health-related indices of quality of life, clinical symptoms, and risk of side effects were analyzed using a two-way repeated-measures mixed linear model.
   Results: Despite a 23% reduction in antipsychotic dose, no differences in outcomes were observed between the dose reduction and observation groups (effect size = 0.001 - 0.085, P = .24-.97), despite high statistical power (1-beta = 0.48-0.97). The findings are limited by the nonuniformity of the participants' treatment history, duration, and dose reduction amount. Dose reduction protocol patients exhibited no difference in psychotic symptoms or adverse events compared with the observation group.
   Conclusions: Importantly, the low dropout rate in our study (6.9% of participants withdrew because of patient factors and 23.8% for all secondary reasons) indicates that our "slowly" method is well tolerated. We hope that this approach will result in therapeutic improvements.

AB 1. Long-term facilitation is a respiratory memory expressed as an increase in motor output lasting more than an hour. This change is induced by repeated hypoxia, stimulation of carotid chemoreceptors, or electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve or brainstem mid-line. The present work addressed the hypothesis that persistent changes in medullary respiratory neural networks contribute to long-term facilitation.
   2. Carotid chemoreceptors were stimulated by close arterial injection of CO2-saturated saline solution. Phrenic nerve efferent activity and up to 30 single medullary neurones were recorded simultaneously in nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) including the dorsal respiratory group (DRG), Botzinger-ventral respiratory group (Bot-VRG), and nucleus raphe obscurus of nine adult cats, anaesthetized, injected with a neuromuscular blocking agent, vagotomized and artificially ventilated.
   3. The firing rates of 87 of 105 neurones (83%) changed following induction of long-term facilitation. Nine of eleven DRG and Bot-VRG putative premotor inspiratory neurones had increased firing rates with long-term facilitation. Fourteen of twenty-one raphe obscurus neurones with control firing rates less than 4 Hz had significant long-term increases in activity.
   4. Cross-correlogram analysis suggested that there were changes in effective connectivity of neuron pairs with long-term facilitation. Joint peristimulus time histograms and pattern detection methods used with 'gravity' analysis also detected changes in short time scale correlations associated with long-term facilitation.
   5. The results suggest that changes in firing rates and synchrony of VRG and DRG premotor neurones and altered effective connectivity among other functionally antecedent elements of the medullary respiratory network contribute to the expression of long-term facilitation.

AB Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of cervical cancer and is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Only limited and controversial data are available regarding HPV transmission in male sexual partners of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and the genotype distribution of HPV in penile scrapings of a series of Italian men, who had no visible penile lesions and were partners of women who were affected, or had been affected previously by cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or who were infected with HPV. The concordance of the viral group in the infected partners was determined. A total of 77 penile scrapings were screened for HPV infection by the polymerase chain reaction, while 59 cervicovaginal brushings of their female partners were tested. 35% of evaluable male samples and 64% of female sexual partners were found to be HPV positive. In the 55 simultaneously evaluable couples, a concordance of 45% was found, 11 couples (20%) with both partners being HPV negative and 14 couples (25%) with both partners HPV positive (P=0.001). Six out of the 14 couples (43%), where both partners were HPV positive, harbored the same HPV genotype group. These data, although preliminary, could support further the hypothesis that male HPV infection is more frequent in sexual partners of HPV positive or women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia indicating that men could represent an important source of HPV transmission between sex partners.

AB The membrane phospholipid affinity of ten quinolone antibacterial agents, including both acidic and zwitterionic compounds, was measured by HPLC on two different immobilized artificial membrane (IAM) stationary phases, namely IAM.PC.MG and IAM.PC.DD2; it is expressed as the logarithm of the retention factor measured with (or extrapolated to) 100% aqueous eluent at pH 7.0, log k(w)(IAM).
   Quinolones are a class of highly potent, orally active, broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. For these compounds, lipophilicity values in n-octanol found in the literature, either calculated or measured, are not consistent with each other and are too low to be compatible with their pharmacokinetic properties.
   The log k(w)(IAM) values obtained in this study showed no relation with any of the lipophilicity values in the literature (clog P(a), clog P(b), MLP, log D-7.4). In contrast, they were collinear with a new lipophilicity scale we had previously obtained by an original ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC method set up to estimate the lipophilicity of the neutral forms, logP(N). Moreover, when comparing the retention of quinolones on IAM to the retention of structurally unrelated neutral compounds, we observed that they interact with phospholipids with the same affinity as neutral isolipophilic compounds.
   The use of an eluent at pH 5.5, instead of pH 7.0, increased the retention on IAM not only for acidic, but also for zwitterionic congeners, indicating that phospholipid affinity is enhanced in the experimental conditions that depress the ionization of the acidic function, even when the ionization of the amino function increases simultaneously.
   To gain an insight into the mechanism of quinolones/serum-protein interactions, we investigated about possible relationships between quinolones affinity data for serum proteins and IAM data. Quinolone affinity for both HSA and AGP was already demonstrated poorly related to n-octanol lipophilicity values, probably due to the occurrence of electrostatic interactions. Only poor relationships were found between IAM and HSA affinity data, whereas quite good relationships were found with AGP affinity data. However, IAM.PC.DD2 data correlated better than those on IAM.PC.MG with quinolone affinity for both serum-proteins, mainly due to the fact that IAM.PC.MG phase is scarcely discriminative for the compounds with the highest retention values.
   The results suggest that IAM retention can produce a lipophilicity scale that, unlike Solvent/water partition coefficients, is consistent with the pharmacokinetic behaviour of zwitterionic quinolones. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article seeks to unravel the dual realities represented by the juxtaposition of the recent series of harsh regulatory impositions on Russian nonprofit organizations and the nearly simultaneous enactment of a series of laws and decrees establishing an impressive "tool box'' of positive support programs for a large class of the so-called socially oriented Russian nonprofit organizations. To do so, the discussion proceeds in three steps. First, the article documents the considerable scale of the Russian NPO scene as it is visible through the lens of available empirical research. Next, it outlines the key policy measures affecting nonprofit organizations (NPOs) put in place by the Russian government beginning in the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century. Unlike some accounts, however, this one brings into focus both the interesting "tool box'' of support programs for NPOs enacted during this period as well as the more restrictive regulatory measures, such as the "foreign agents law,'' that also came into force. Finally, the article seeks to unravel the puzzle posed by these apparently competing realities of Russian government policy toward nonprofit organizations by bringing to bear the conceptual lenses that Graham Allison formulated to make sense of the strange series of actions that surrounded the Cuban Missile Crisis a little over 50 years ago.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this in-vitro study was to evaluate the influence of ceramic thickness and type of dental bonding surface on the fracture resistance of non-retentive full-coverage adhesively retained occlusal veneers made from lithium disilicate ceramic.
   Methods. Seventy-two extracted molars were divided into three test groups (N=24) depending on the location of the occlusal veneer preparation: solely within enamel, within enamel and dentin or within enamel and an occlusal composite resin filling. For each test group, occlusal all-ceramic restorations were fabricated from lithium disilicate ceramic blocks (IPS e.max CAD) in three subgroups with different thicknesses ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 mm in the fissures and from 0.6 to 1.0 mm at the cusps. The veneers were etched (5% HF), silanated and adhesively luted using a self etching primer and a composite luting resin (Multilink Primer A/B and Multilink Automix). After water storage at 37 degrees C for 3 days and thermal cycling for 7500 cycles at 5-55 degrees C, specimens were subjected to dynamic loading in a chewing simulator with 600,000 loading cycles at 10 kg combined with thermal cycling. Unfractured specimens were loaded until fracture using a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni-Holm correction for multiple testing.
   Results. Only specimens in the group with the thickest dimension (0.7 mm in fissure, 1.0 mm at cusp) survived cyclic loading without any damage. Survival rates in the remaining subgroups ranged from 50 to 100% for surviving with some damage and from 12.5 to 75% for surviving without any damage. Medians of final fracture resistance ranged from 610 to 3390 N. In groups with smaller ceramic thickness, luting to dentin or composite provided statistically significant (p <= 0.05) higher fracture resistance than luting to enamel only. The thickness of the occlual ceramic veneers had a statistically significant (p <= 0.05) influence on fracture resistance.
   Significance. The results suggest to use a thickness of 0.7-1 mm for non-retentive full-coverage adhesively retained occlusal lithium disilicate ceramic restorations. (C) 2015 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This research examines the specific contribution of occupation and work organization conditions on psychological distress, based on a representative sample of 9501 workers in 419 occupations in Quebec, Canada. Multilevel regression models show that occupational structure accounts for 0.8% of variation in psychological distress. Among the constraints and resources related to work organization condition, physical and psychological demands, irregular schedules. and workplace harassment emerge as important determinants of psychological distress. The effects of work organization conditions do not vary across occupations. Family situation, support available from social networks outside work, and personal characteristics of individuals are also associated with psychological distress, but these factors do not moderate the effects of work organization conditions. Overall, the findings support the hypothesis that occupation and, to an even greater extent, "pathogenic" work organization conditions contribute independently to the experience of psychological distress. They also support the theoretical model conceptualizing psychological distress as the product of stress caused by constraints and resources brought to bear simultaneously by the agent's personality, structures of daily life, and macrosocial structures. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In last five years a relatively high level of experience and knowledge has accumulated related to the application of computer-aided system modelling for the analysis and forecasting of the bioethanol sector. The goal of the current paper is to offer a systematic review of the application of system dynamics models in order to better understand the structure, conduct and performance of the bioethanol sector. Our method has been the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA), based on English-language materials published between 2015 and 2020. The results highlight that system dynamic models have become more and more complex, but as a consequence of the improvement in information technology and statistical systems, as well as the increasing experience gained they offer an efficient tool for decision makers in the business and political spheres. In the future, the combination of traditional system dynamics modelling and agent-based models will offer new perspectives for the preparation of more sophisticated description and forecasting.

AB Sapphire is one of the most widely used electronic substrate materials in the industry. The manufacturing process of sapphire and such hard and brittle materials is extremely time and energy consuming because of their superior material properties in physical and chemical behaviors. In this study, the ultraviolet-curable resin is introduced into the fabrication of the diamond abrasive lapping plate as a bonding agent. A practical manufacturing process is established in the laboratory to develop an ultraviolet-curable resin bond fixed abrasive lapping plate for the precision machining of sapphire substrates, the machining performance of which is examined through a series of comparative experiments among the conventional fixed-abrasive lapping, the slurry-based lapping and this originally developed plate involved lapping. The surface topography and surface roughness of the machined sapphire workpieces are measured to evaluate the surface quality, and the weight loss of the workpieces in each machining process is recorded to estimate the respective machining efficiency. The promising results achieved from the ultraviolet-curable resin plate lapping process, in terms of a relatively higher material removal rate and better surface quality, indicate that the occurrence of a corporate action integrating both the advantages of the fixed abrasive grains and loose abrasive grains. A summarized hypothesis is drawn to describe the dynamically balanced state of the hybrid precision abrasive machining process, in which the 2-body abrasion and 3-body abrasion material removal mechanism participate simultaneously and interconvert to each other continuously.

AB Lipid dosage forms provide an interesting potential for controlled drug delivery. In contrast to frequently used poly(ester) based devices for parenteral administration, they do not lead to acidification upon degradation and potential drug inactivation, especially in the case of protein drugs and other acid-labile active agents. The aim of this article is to give an overview on the current state of the art of mathematical modeling of drug release from this type of advanced drug delivery systems. Empirical and semi-empirical models are described as well as mechanistic theories, considering diffusional mass transport, potentially limited drug solubility and the leaching of other, water-soluble excipients into the surrounding bulk fluid. Various practical examples are given, including lipid microparticles, beads and implants, which can successfully be used to control the release of an incorporated drug during periods ranging from a few hours up to several years. The great benefit of mechanistic mathematical theories is the possibility to quantitatively predict the effects of different formulation parameters and device dimensions on the resulting drug release kinetics. Thus, in silico simulations can significantly speed up product optimization. This is particularly useful if long release periods (e.g., several months) are targeted, since experimental trial-and-error studies are highly time-consuming in these cases. In the future it would be highly desirable to combine mechanistic theories with the quantitative description of the drug fate in vivo, ideally including the pharmacodynamic efficacy of the treatments.

ID SYSTEMS BIOLOGY; EXPERIMENTATION; DYNAMICS; CELLS
AB We present a framework to assist the diagrammatic modelling of complex biological systems using the unified modelling language (UML). The framework comprises three levels of modelling, ranging in scope from the dynamics of individual model entities to system-level emergent properties. By way of an immunological case study of the mouse disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show how the framework can be used to produce models that capture and communicate the biological system, detailing how biological entities, interactions and behaviours lead to higher-level emergent properties observed in the real world. We demonstrate how the UML can be successfully applied within our framework, and provide a critique of UML's ability to capture concepts fundamental to immunology and biology more generally. We show how specialized, well-explained diagrams with less formal semantics can be used where no suitable UML formalism exists. We highlight UML's lack of expressive ability concerning cyclic feedbacks in cellular networks, and the compounding concurrency arising from huge numbers of stochastic, interacting agents. To compensate for this, we propose several additional relationships for expressing these concepts in UML's activity diagram. We also demonstrate the ambiguous nature of class diagrams when applied to complex biology, and question their utility in modelling such dynamic systems. Models created through our framework are non-executable, and expressly free of simulation implementation concerns. They are a valuable complement and precursor to simulation specifications and implementations, focusing purely on thoroughly exploring the biology, recording hypotheses and assumptions, and serve as a communication medium detailing exactly how a simulation relates to the real biology.

AB Resource-based livelihoods are uncertain and potentially unstable due to variability over time, including seasonal variation: this instability threatens marginalised populations who may fall into poverty. However, empirical understanding of trajectories of household well-being and poverty is limited. Here, we present a new household-level model of poverty dynamics based on agents and coping strategies-the Household Economy And Poverty trajectory (HEAP) model. HEAP is based on established economic and social insights into poverty dynamics, with a demonstration of the model calibrated with a qualitative and quantitative household survey in coastal Bangladesh. Economic activity in Bangladesh is highly dependent on natural resources; poverty is widespread; and there is high variability in ecosystem services at multiple temporal scales. The results show that long-term decreases in poverty are predicated more on the stability of, and returns from, livelihoods rather than their diversification. Access to natural resources and ecosystem service benefits are positively correlated with stable income and multidimensional well-being. Households that remain in poverty are those who experience high seasonality of income and are involved in small scale enterprises. Hence, seasonal variability in income places significant limits on natural resources providing routes out of poverty. Further, projected economic trends to 2030 lead to an increase in well-being and a reduction in poverty for most simulated household types.

AB Termites construct complex mounds that are orders of magnitude larger than any individual and fulfil a variety of functional roles. Yet the processes through which these mounds are built, and by which the insects organize their efforts, remain poorly understood. The traditional understanding focuses on stigmergy, a form of indirect communication in which actions that change the environment provide cues that influence future work. Termite construction has long been thought to be organized via a putative 'cement pheromone': a chemical added to deposited soil that stimulates further deposition in the same area, thus creating a positive feedback loop whereby coherent structures are built up. To investigate the detailed mechanisms and behaviours through which termites self-organize the early stages of mound construction, we tracked the motion and behaviour of major workers from two Macrotermes species in experimental arenas. Rather than a construction process focused on accumulation of depositions, as models based on cement pheromone would suggest, our results indicated that the primary organizing mechanisms were based on excavation. Digging activity was focused on a small number of excavation sites, which in turn provided templates for soil deposition. This behaviour was mediated by a mechanism of aggregation, with termites being more likely to join in the work at an excavation site as the number of termites presently working at that site increased. Statistical analyses showed that this aggregation mechanism was a response to active digging, distinct from and unrelated to putative chemical cues that stimulate deposition. Agent-based simulations quantitatively supported the interpretation that the early stage of de novo construction is primarily organized by excavation and aggregation activity rather than by stigmergic deposition.

AB This paper explores the minimal representational and processing requirements for teleological and mentalistic inferences. These inferences are already present in 6- to 12-month-old infants when they judge the goals of moving agents like inanimate shapes, without any cue about human body motion. This precludes the mirror system as a potential explanation for these early inferences. I propose a recurrent connectionist network that represents a spatial grid in which objects are moving along trajectories that avoid potential obstacles. This network can simulate young infants' (a) teleological sensitivity to goals and obstacles blocking these goals, as well as their (b) mentalizing sensitivity, like attributing to an individual a false belief that differs from the child's reality. The model demonstrates how infants choose the most rational or efficient way through the grid towards the goal, a rational choice that emerges from prior familiarization with and generalization from trajectories and situational obstacles. In addition, mentalizing is accomplished by explicitly representing in the network an individual who watches (or not) where an object moves and keeping track of this individual's experiences and knowledge. This model helps to clarify that these rudimentary characteristics seem to be essential ingredients for an early teleological and mentalizing system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Fevicordin-A (FevA) isolated from Phaleria macrocarpa (Scheff) Boerl. seeds was evaluated for its potential anticancer activity by in vitro and in silico approaches. Cytotoxicity studies indicated that FevA was selective against cell lines of human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7) with an IC50 value of 6.4 mu M. At 11.2 mu M, FevA resulted in 76.8% cell death of T-47D human breast cancer cell lines. Critical pharmacophore features amongst human Estrogen Receptor-alpha (hER alpha) antagonists were conserved in FevA with regard to a hypothesis that they could make notable contributions to its pharmacological activity. The binding stability as well as the dynamic behavior of FevA towards the hER alpha receptor in agonist and antagonist binding sites were probed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. Analysis of MD simulation suggested that the tail of FevA was accountable for the repulsion of the C-terminal of Helix-11 (H11) in both agonist and antagonist receptor forms. The flexibility of loop-534 indicated the ability to disrupt the hydrogen bond zipper network between H3 and H11 in hER alpha. In addition, MM/GBSA calculation from the molecular dynamic simulations also revealed a stronger binding affinity of FevA in antagonistic action as compared to that of agonistic action. Collectively, both the experimental and computational results indicated that FevA has potential as a candidate for an anticancer agent, which is worth promoting for further preclinical evaluation.

AB This study investigates the one-step synthesis of functionalized silica nanoparticles using dichlorodimethylsilane (DDS), and examines the statistical effects of process variables on the synthesized silica particle size. This method simultaneously consisted base-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in the presence of a DDS coupling agent. Fractional factorial design (FFD) is used to identify the most significant variables influencing the synthesis process, as well as the effects of different levels of each parameter on the mean silica particle size. The effects of five parameters (concentration of ammonium hydroxide, TEOS, DDS, ethanol, and reaction temperature) were investigated and the catalyst concentration was considered as the key factor influencing the process. Study of morphology and size of silica nanoparticles using particle size analysis (PSA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed successfully synthesis of mono dispersed silica nanoparticles with mean particle size of 65 nm. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed after the addition of DDS, SiCl(CH3)(2) functional group took the place of H on the surface of silica nanoparticles, and the nanoparticles found hydrophobic properties.

AB There is evidence that pentoxifylline may be both a radioprotector of normal tissue and a radiosensitizer of tumor cells. This article reviews this evidence and then describes our own laboratory study to determine whether pentoxifylline is a radiosensitizer of human glioblastoma cells in vitro. Human glioblastoma multiforme cells (SNB19 cell line) were irradiated in vitro with and without pentoxifylline. Regression of the log ratios (quotient of surviving colonies) revealed greater tumor cell kill in the PTX group, and the difference increased as the radiation dose increased (p < 0.01 at the 750 and 1000 cGY doses). Before the hypothesis that PTX is a radiosensitizer of hypoxic tumor cells can be confirmed or denied, it must be determined if the agent also has a separate mechanism of tumoricidal activity. Whereas in vivo models allow the well-documented rheologic, immunologic and oxygen-related effects of PTX to be active simultaneously, the in vitro model described herein excludes the effects of such systemic actions and focuses on mechanisms at the cellular or subcellular level. These data suggest there exists such a mechanism of tumoricidal activity of PTX that has not been previously identified.

AB Drugs that target DNA topoisomerase II, such as the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide, are a clinically important class of anticancer agents. A recently published X-ray structure of a ternary complex of etoposide, cleaved DNA and topoisomerase II beta showed that the two intercalated etoposide molecules in the complex were separated by four DNA base pairs. Thus, using a structure-based design approach, a series of bis-epipodophyllotoxin etoposide analogs with piperazine-containing linkers was designed to simultaneously bind to these two sites. It was hypothesized that two-site binding would produce a more stable cleavage complex, and a more potent anticancer drug. The most potent bis-epipodophyllotoxin, which was 10-fold more growth inhibitory toward human erythroleukemic K562 cells than etoposide, contained a linker with eight methylene groups. All of the mono- and bis-epipodophyllotoxins, in a variety of assays, showed strong evidence that they targeted topoisomerase II. COMPARE analysis of NCI 60-cell GI(50) endpoint data was also consistent with these compounds targeting topoisomerase II. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Insufficient coating strength can lead to various problems in printing and converting of pigment-coated paper and paperboard. The loss in strength, especially in the presence of printing liquids, can result from poor adhesion between the binder and the coating pigments. Experiments and numerical simulations were used to better understand the microscopic and molecular level interactions between the latex-binder and dispersant-covered coating pigments used in paper coating. Micromechanical simulations were carried out to identify the microstructural variables most influential to strength. Several new pigment dispersing agents were synthesized with the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization technique, and their dispersing effect and influence on dry and wet strength of pigment coating were evaluated. Molecular level interactions between binders, coating pigments, and various functional groups used in the dispersants were studied with molecular modeling. Furthermore, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis was used to examine the influence of both commercial and novel dispersants on the pigment-latex interactions. Some of the novel dispersants synthesized and tested show promise in improving the wet strength of the coating while providing as good as or better dispersing effect when compared to a sodium polyacrylate-based commercial dispersant.

In this model we distinguish units for "rational" inference (r-scripts) and units for "emotional" processing of meaning (d-scripts). Basing on a psycholinguistics study we demonstrate relations between classes of emotional utterances in d-script model and psychological characteristics of informants. The study proposes a theoretical framework for an affective agent simulating given psychological characteristics in it's emotional speech behaviour.

AB Monte Carlo computer simulations are used to study the segregation behaviour of two polymers under cylindrical confinement. Using a multiple-histogram method, the conformational free energy, F, of the polymers was measured as a function of the centre-of-mass separation distance, lambda. We examined the scaling of the free energy functions with the polymer length, the length and diameter of the confining cylinder, the polymer topology (i.e. linear vs. ring polymers), and the packing fraction and size of mobile crowding agents. In the absence of crowders, the observed scaling of F(lambda) is similar to that predicted using a simple model employing the de Gennes blob model and the approximation that the free energy of overlapping chains in a tube is equal to that of two isolated chains each in a tube of half the crosssectional area. Simulations were used to test the latter approximation and reveal that it yields poor quantitative predictions. This, along with generic finite-size effects, likely gives rise to the discrepancies between the predicted and measured values of scaling exponents for F(lambda). For segregation in the presence of crowding agents, the free energy barrier generally decreases with increasing crowder packing fraction, thus reducing the entropic forces driving segregation. However, for fixed packing fraction, the barrier increases as the crowder/monomer size ratio decreases.

ID SELECTION
AB Religious people talk about things that cannot be seen, stories that cannot be verified, and beings and forces beyond the ordinary. Perhaps their gods are truly at work, or perhaps in human nature there is an impulse to proclaim religious knowledge. If so, it would have to have arisen by natural selection. It is hard to imagine how natural selection could have produced such an impulse. There is a debate among evolutionary scientists about whether or not there is any adaptive advantage to religion at all (Bulbulia 2004a; Atran and Norenzayan 2004). Some believe that it has no adaptive value itself and that it is just a hodge podge of of behaviors that have evolved because they are adaptive in other non-religious contexts. The agent-based simulation described in this article shows that a central unifying feature of religion, a belief in an unverifiable world, could have evolved along side of verifiable knowledge. The simulation makes use of an agent-based communication model with two types of information: verifiable information (real information) about a real world and unverifiable information (unreal information) about about an imaginary world. It examines the conditions necessary for the communication of unreal information to have evolved along side the communication of real information. It offers support for the theory that religion is an adaptive complex and it disputes the theory that religion is a byproduct of unrelated adaptive processes.

AB A crucial skill for fluent action meshing in human team activity is a learned and calculated selection of anticipatory actions.We believe that the same holds for robotic teammates, if they are to perform in a similarly fluent manner with their human counterparts. In this work, we describe a model for human-robot joint action, and propose an adaptive action selection mechanism for a robotic teammate, which makes anticipatory decisions based on the confidence of their validity and their relative risk. We conduct an analysis of our method, predicting an improvement in task efficiency compared to a purely reactive process. We then present results from a study involving untrained human subjects working with a simulated version of a robot using our system. We show a significant improvement in best-case task efficiency when compared to a group of users working with a reactive agent, as well as a significant difference in the perceived commitment of the robot to the team and its contribution to the team's fluency and success. By way of explanation, we raise a number of fluency metric hypotheses, and evaluate their significance between the two study conditions.

AB This paper investigates the distributed finite-time trajectory tracking control for a group of nonholonomic mobile robots with time-varying unknown parameters and external disturbances. At first, the tracking error system is derived for each mobile robot with the aid of a global invertible transformation, which consists of two subsystems, one is a first-order subsystem and another is a second-order subsystem. Then, the two subsystems are studied respectively, and finite-time disturbance observers are proposed for each robot to estimate the external disturbances. Meanwhile, distributed finite-time tracking controllers are developed for each mobile robot such that all states of each robot can reach the desired value in finite time, where the desired reference value is assumed to be the trajectory of a virtual leader whose information is available to only a subset of the followers, and the followers are assumed to have only local interaction. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is finally illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB Physical refining, also known as deacidification by steam distillation, is a process in which free fatty acids and other volatile compounds are distilled off from the oil, using an effective stripping agent (usually steam) and suitable processing conditions. In general, vegetable oils are formed by triacylglycerols, free fatty acids, partial acylglycerols and some minor compounds, constituting a complex mixture.
   This work presents the implementation of a simulation program applied to the physical refining of edible oils, following a multicomponent-stripping tray-column design. Two singular vegetable oils, from palm and coconut, were selected. Their entire compositions were considered within the simulations, including acylglycerols and free fatty acids. To describe the required physical properties, group contribution methods and empirical equations were selected. The results were analyzed and compared with the literature in terms of neutral oil loss and final oil acidity, as a function of the processing conditions. Murphree efficiencies and entrainment were considered for each plate. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of small molecules is important for developing probes and novel therapeutic agents in chemical biology and drug discovery. Increasingly, multiplexed small-molecule profiling assays allow simultaneous measurement of many biological response parameters for the same compound (e. g., expression levels for many genes or binding constants against many proteins). Although such methods promise to capture SARs with high granularity, few computational methods are available to support SAR analyses of high-dimensional compound activity profiles. Many of these methods are not generally applicable or reduce the activity space to scalar summary statistics before establishing SARs. In this article, we present a versatile computational method that automatically extracts interpretable SAR rules from high-dimensional profiling data. The rules connect chemical structural features of compounds to patterns in their biological activity profiles. We applied our method to data from novel cell-based gene-expression and imaging assays collected on more than 30,000 small molecules. Based on the rules identified for this data set, we prioritized groups of compounds for further study, including a novel set of putative histone deacetylase inhibitors.

AB Statement of problem: How cement type and the surface treatment of a titanium base affect the retention of zirconia copings on titanium bases is unclear.
   Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the dislodging forces of zirconium oxide copings cemented on implant-supported titanium bases with different luting agents and to examine the influence of airborne-particle abrasion on titanium surfaces.
   Material and methods: Thirty implant laboratory analogs (BioHorizons) were fixed in metal blocks, and 30 prosthetic titanium bases (BioHorizons) were tightened with 35 Ncm of torque. Zirconium oxide copings with a luting-gap size of 30 mu m were produced by using the Lava (3M ESPE) technology. The specimens were bonded to the titanium bases with 3 different resin cements (G-CEM LinkAce, RelyX U200, and Ceka Site). The specimens were kept in artificial saliva at 37 degrees C for 24 hours and then subjected to a dynamic loading of 5000 cycles with a mastication simulator (SD Mechatronic) with thermocycling between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C. The tensile force was measured by using a universal testing machine (Zwick/Roell) at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. After the measurement, the cement was cleaned from the titanium bases and zirconia copings. The titanium bases were airborne-particle abraded with 50-mu m aluminum oxide (Al2O3) particles, and the bonding process was repeated. The statistical analysis included descriptive analysis, 2-way ANOVA, the Tukey post hoc, and simple main effect tests (alpha=.05).
   Results: Bond strengths were significantly different according to the cement type used and before and after airborne-particle abrasion (P<.05). The cement retentiveness before airborne-particle abrasion was as follows: G-CEM LinkAce (1338 +/- 69 N)>RelyX U200 (665 +/- 36 N)>Ceka Site (469 +/- 22 N). The differences among all the cement types before airborne-particle abrasion were statistically significant (P<.05). After airborne-particle abrasion, retention decreased in all the groups, and the ranking of the cements' retentiveness remained the same: G-CEM LinkAce (662 +/- 65 N)>RelyX U200 (352 +/- 21 N)>Ceka Site (122 +/- 17 N). After airborne-particle abrasion, the differences among all the cements remained statistically significant (P<.05). The comparison within the groups before and after airborne-particle abrasion revealed that abrading the titanium bases with 50-mu m Al2O3 decreased the bond strength for all the tested cements.
   Conclusion: The cement type had a significant influence on the retention of the zirconia copings, and abrading the titanium bases with 50-mu m Al2O3 significantly decreased the dislodging force of the coping from the titanium base.

AB Electronic fare payment systems have gained much popularity in large public transport systems across the world. Though their main purpose is to collect the revenue and improve passenger's comfort, they also generate huge amount of detailed and accurate data on onboard transactions which is of extreme importance for transit planners for efficient short-term and long-term transit operation and service planning. This paper attempts to utilize the smart card data as an input for large-scale activity based public transport simulation for analyzing travel behavior pertaining to transit users, using an open source agent-based transport simulation package, MATSim. Transit vehicles are optimized based on input demand generated by smart card and a high temporal resolution of waiting time and its components at different stations is extracted which is very important in managing the frequency and headway of transit vehicles. Since no card swipe is needed for transfers within subway system in Seoul, the data is not readily available to detect frequent transfer locations. However, after validating the boarding and alighting volumes at different stations, a methodology is presented to calculate within subway transfer volumes at different stations. We suggest that by improving the statistical analysis and utilizing advanced data mining techniques, smart cards can effectively generate the microsimulation travel demand models.

AB Deployment of multiple unmanned agent systems to perform missions in a collaborative manner has become a research hotspot in recent years, and the same is true for multiple unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Therefore, this present paper mainly focuses on the coordination control for multiple USVs in the dynamic maritime environment. Approach used in this paper is principally the behavior-based method, which is useful to guide the unmanned agent system in an unknown or dynamically changing environment. The hybrid behavior-based (HB) method, combining the null-space-based behavioral (NSB) approach and behaviors complied with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs), is proposed to achieve the coordination control of multiple USVs. Using the HB method, all aspects of the coordination control problem, including the rendezvous issue, formation keeping and collision avoidance of both static and dynamic obstacles, can be accomplished at the same time. Furthermore, the Kalman filter (KF) algorithm is incorporated into the proposed HB method to compensation for navigation information of other traffic ships in the dynamic environment. So that a more practical coordination control for multiple USVs in the realistic applications can be achieved. Through the verification by numerical simulations, the proposed HB method can effectively achieve the coordination control for multiple USVs in the dynamic environment.

AB From the backgrounds of the recent trend towards low reducing agent operation of large blast furnace and application of diversified charging modes of various burdens, an advanced mathematical model of blast furnace is required. Although conventional models based on the continuum model have been widely used, these models are not suitable for the recent demands. The discrete models such as discrete element model (DEM) and particle method are expected to precisely simulate the discontinuous and inhomogeneous phenomena in the recent operation conditions. With the discrete model, the microscopic information on each particle in the packed bed can be obtained besides the overall phenomena in blast furnace. The visual information can be obtained to understand the in-furnace phenomena with high spatial resolution. The liquid dripping and movement of fines in the lower part of blast furnace can be well simulated with DEM and particle method such as Moving Particle Semi-implicit Method (MPS). Moreover, the optimum bed structure for low reducing agent operation is being clarified by application of Eulerian-Lagrangian method. This review summarizes the recent progress on the mathematical model based on the discrete model.

AB We study two models of pedestrian evacuation based on cellular automata and intelligent agents. We use the static floor field approach and augment it with additional transition rules (random movement and preservation of personal space) in order to model various aspects of human behaviour. Through numerical simulations we investigate pedestrian evacuation from rooms with various geometries (e.g. empty room, classroom). Using heatmaps (density diagrams of pedestrians), average evacuation times, velocity and other parameters we study the effectiveness of evacuation and potential dangers pedestrians may encounter.

AB Sound scientific principles must be prerequisites for sustaining the levels of service and efficiency of modem call center, and these principles, in turn, better is based on real-world data. For example, in order to determine the least number of agents that could provide a given service level, it is critical to understand customers' impatience while waiting at the phone to be served. In this paper, we use stochastic models to plan call center operations and analyze projected performance focusing on the impatience of customers through simulation experiments.

AB Research in skin decontamination and therapy of chemical warfare agents has been a difficult problem due to the simultaneous requirement of rapid action and non-aggressive behaviour. The aim of this study was to compare the performance of two decontaminating systems: the Canadian Reactive Skin Decontaminant Lotion (RSDL) and the Fuller's Earth (FE). The experiment was conducted with domestic swine, as a good model for extrapolation to human skin. RSDL and FE were tested against sulphur mustard (SM), a powerful vesicant, and VX, a potent and persistent cholinesterase inhibitor. When used 5 min after contamination, the results clearly showed that both systems were active against SM (10.1 mg/cm(2)) and VX (0.06 mg/cm(2)). The potency of the RSDL/sponge was statistically better than FE against skin injury induced by SM, observed 3 days post-exposure. RSDL was rather more efficient than FE in reducing the formation of perinuclear vacuoles and inflammation processes in the epidermis and dermis. Against a severe inhibition (67%) of plasmatic cholinesterases induced by VX poisoning, the potencies of the RSDL/sponge and FE were similar. Both systems completely prevented cholinesterase inhibition, which indirectly indicates a prevention of toxic absorption through the skin.

AB Syndromic surveillance is an incipient approach to early wildlife disease detection. Consequently, systematic assessments are needed for methodology validation in wildlife populations. We evaluated the sensitivity of a syndromic surveillance protocol for respiratory disease detection among chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania. Empirical health, behavioural, and demographic data were integrated with an agent-based, network model to simulate disease transmission and surveillance. Surveillance sensitivity was estimated as 66% (95% CI: 63.1, 68.8%) and 59.5% (95% CI: 56.5%, 62.4%) for two monitoring methods (weekly count and prevalence thresholds respectively), but differences among calendar quarters in outbreak size and surveillance sensitivity suggest seasonal effects. We determined that a weekly detection threshold of >= 2 chimpanzees with clinical respiratory disease leading to outbreak response protocols (enhanced observation and biological sampling) is an optimal algorithm for outbreak detection in this population. Synthesis and applications. This is the first quantitative assessment of syndromic surveillance in wildlife, providing a model approach to detecting disease emergence. Coupling syndromic surveillance with targeted diagnostic sampling in the midst of suspected outbreaks will provide a powerful system for detecting disease transmission and understanding population impacts.

AB From the backgrounds of the recent trends towards low reducing agent operation of large blast furnaces and application of diversified charging modes for various burdens, an advanced mathematical model of the blast furnace is required. Although conventional models based on the continuum model have been widely used, these models are not sufficient for the recent demands. Discrete models such as discrete element model (DEM) and particle method are expected to enable precisely simulation of the discontinuous and inhomogeneous phenomena in the recent operating conditions. With discrete models, microscopic information on each particle in the packed bed can be obtained in addition to the overall phenomena in the blast furnace. Visual information for understanding in-furnace phenomena can be also obtained with high spatial resolution. Liquid dripping and the movement of fines in the lower part of the blast furnace can be simulated with high accuracy by using DEM and particle methods such as the Moving Particle Semi-implicit Method (MPS). Moreover, the optimum bed structure for low reducing agent operation is being clarified by application of the Eulerian-Lagrangian method. This review summarizes recent progress on the mathematical models based on the discrete model.

AB We have previously tried to explain perceptual inference and learning under a free-energy principle that pursues Helmholtz's agenda to understand the brain in terms of energy minimization. It is fairly easy to show that making inferences about the causes of sensory data can be cast as the minimization of a free-energy bound on the likelihood of sensory inputs, given an internal model of how they were caused. In this article, we consider what would happen if the data themselves were sampled to minimize this bound. It transpires that the ensuing active sampling or inference is mandated by ergodic arguments based on the very existence of adaptive agents. Furthermore, it accounts for many aspects of motor behavior; from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking. In particular, it suggests that motor control can be understood as fulfilling prior expectations about proprioceptive sensations. This formulation can explain why adaptive behavior emerges in biological agents and suggests a simple alternative to optimal control theory. We illustrate these points using simulations of oculomotor control and then apply to same principles to cued and goal-directed movements. In short, the free-energy formulation may provide an alternative perspective on the motor control that places it in an intimate relationship with perception.

AB In order to analyze the evacuation capacity of parallel double running stairs, a dozen stairs merging forms are set by investigation and statistics, and the improved agent-based evacuation model that considers the merging behavior is used to simulate the process of merging and evacuation in the stairs. The stairs evacuation capacity is related to the evacuation time and the robustness of stairs, and the evacuation time can be calculated by using the unproved agent-based model based on computer simulation. The robustness of each merging form can be obtained according to the fluctuation degree of evacuation time under the different pedestrian flow. The evaluation model of stairs evacuation capacity is established by fusing the evacuation time and the robustness of stairs. Combined with the specific example to calculate the evacuation capacity of each stairs form, it is found that every merging form has different evacuation time and different robustness, and the evacuation time has not positive correlation with the robustness for the same form stairs. Meanwhile, the evacuation capacity of stairs is not related to the number of the floor entrances. Finally, the results show that the evacuation capacity of stairs is optimal when the floor entrances are close to out stairs in parallel double running stairs and suitable to the case where pedestrian flow and the change of pedestrian flow are large.

AB The epidemic spread of infectious diseases is ubiquitous and often has a considerable impact on public health and economic wealth. The large variability in the spatio-temporal patterns of epidemics prohibits simple interventions and requires a detailed analysis of each epidemic with respect to its infectious agent and the corresponding routes of transmission. To facilitate this analysis, we introduce a mathematical framework which links epidemic patterns to the topology and dynamics of the underlying transmission network. The evolution, both in disease prevalence and transmission network topology, is derived from a closed set of partial differential equations for infections without allowing for recovery. The predictions are in excellent agreement with complementarily conducted agent-based simulations. The capacity of this new method is demonstrated in several case studies on HIV epidemics in synthetic populations: it allows us to monitor the evolution of contact behavior among healthy and infected individuals and the contributions of different disease stages to the spreading of the epidemic. This gives both direction to and a test bed for targeted intervention strategies for epidemic control. In conclusion, this mathematical framework provides a capable toolbox for the analysis of epidemics from first principles. This allows for fast, in silico modeling - and manipulation - of epidemics and is especially powerful if complemented with adequate empirical data for parameterization.

AB We study the q-voter model driven by stochastic noise arising from one out of two types of nonconformity: anticonformity or independence. We compare two approaches that were inspired by the famous psychological controversy known as the person-situation debate. We relate the person approach with the quenched disorder and the situation approach with the annealed disorder, and investigate how these two approaches influence order-disorder phase transitions observed in the q-voter model with noise. We show that under a quenched disorder, differences between models with independence and anticonformity are weaker and only quantitative. In contrast, annealing has a much more profound impact on the system and leads to qualitative differences between models on a macroscopic level. Furthermore, only under an annealed disorder may the discontinuous phase transitions appear. It seems that freezing the agents' behavior at the beginning of simulation-introducing quenched disorder-supports second-order phase transitions, whereas allowing agents to reverse their attitude in time-incorporating annealed disorder-supports discontinuous ones. We show that anticonformity is insensitive to the type of disorder, and in all cases it gives the same result. We precede our study with a short insight from statistical physics into annealed vs. quenched disorder and a brief review of these two approaches in models of opinion dynamics.

AB High-fidelity models are increasingly used to predict, and guide decision making. Prior work has emphasized the importance of replication in ensuring reliable modeling, and has yielded important replication strategies. However, this work is based on relatively simple theory generating models, and its lessons might not translate to high-fidelity models used for decision support. Using NetLogo we replicate a recently published high-fidelity model examining the effects of a HIV biomedical intervention. We use a modular approach to build our model from the ground up, and provide examples of the replication process investigating the replication of two sub-modules as well as the overall simulation experiment. For the first module, we achieved numerical identity during replication, whereas we obtained distributional equivalence in replicating the second module. We achieved relational equivalence among the overall model behaviors, with a 0.98 correlation across the two implementations for our outcome measure even without strictly following the original model in the formation of the sexual network. Our results show that replication of high-fidelity models is feasible when following a set of systematic strategies that leverage the modularity, and highlight the role of replication standards, modular testing, and functional code in facilitating such strategies.

AB Conventional kinesin (kinesin-1) is a motor protein that performs a vital function in the eukaryotic cell: it actively transports cargo to required destinations. Kinesin pulls cargo along microtubule tracks using twin linked motor domains (heads) that bind the microtubule, hydrolyse ATP, and alternately step forward. The detail of the kinesin walk has yet to be discovered but a prominent theory is that the mechanism is rectified Brownian motion (RBM) biased by linker zippering. There is evidence that an ATP binding gate coordinates the heads. The hypothesis proposed here is that the gate is unnecessary, that entropic linker strain is sufficient to enable procession. An agent-based computer simulation has been devised to explore head coordination in the RBM model. Walking was found to emerge in silico without a gate to synchronise the heads. Further investigation of the model by applying a range of hindering loads resulted in backstepping or detachment with similar characteristics to behaviour observed in vitro. It is unclear whether kinesin waits at an obstacle but adding an ATP hydrolysis gate to the model in order to force waiting resulted in the model behaving less realistically under load. It is argued here that an RBM model free of gating is a good candidate for explaining kinesin procession. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Empirical analysis of the foreign exchange market is conducted based on methods to quantify similarities among multidimensional time series with spectral distances introduced in [A.-H. Sato, Physica A 382 (2007) 258-270]. As a result it is found that the similarities among currency pairs fluctuate with the rotation of the earth, and that the similarities among best quotation rates are associated with those among quotation frequencies. Furthermore, it is shown that the Jensen-Shannon spectral divergence is proportional to a mean of the Kullback-Leibler spectral distance both empirically and numerically. It is confirmed that these spectral distances are connected with distributions for behavioural parameters of the market participants from numerical simulation. This concludes that spectral distances of representative quantities of financial markets are related into diversification of behavioural parameters of the market participants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB Al-Cenosphere-SWCNTs closed cell hybrid foams (HFs) of varying relative densities (rho(rd)) were synthesized through stir casting technique using TiH2 (0.6 wt % of alloy) as a foaming agent, processed SWCNTs (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 wt %) and cenosphere (4.25 wt % or 15 vol %) as thickening agent. Cenosphere particles provided micro-porosity within the cell wall and its shells act as reinforcement. It was noted that the addition of SWCNTs and Cenosphere improved the mechanical properties such as elastic modulus (E-f), plastic collapse stress (sigma(pc)), plateau stress (sigma(pt)) and, energy absorption capabilities (E-ab) of HFs. In HFs these properties increases with increase in SWCNTs up to 0.3 wt % and a further increase in SWCNTs content leads to the reduction of these properties of HFs. It is interestingly observed that the densification strain (eD) for a constant p,d is almost invariant to the SWCNTs content. The mechanical properties of the AFs and HFs foamsareempirically simulated and also compared with standard existing models for the different SWCNTs contents and prd. The deformation has been examined during compression test.

ID BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB We present an information-theoretic method to measure the similarity between a given set of observed, real-world data and visual simulation technique for aggregate crowd motions of a complex system consisting of many individual agents. This metric uses a two-step process to quantify a simulator's ability to reproduce the collective behaviors of the whole system, as observed in the recorded real-world data. First, Bayesian inference is used to estimate the simulation states which best correspond to the observed data, then a maximum likelihood estimator is used to approximate the prediction errors. This process is iterated using the EM-algorithm to produce a robust, statistical estimate of the magnitude of the prediction error as measured by its entropy (smaller is better). This metric serves as a simulator-to-data similarity measurement. We evaluated the metric in terms of robustness to sensor noise, consistency across different datasets and simulation methods, and correlation to perceptual metrics.

AB Congestion in capacity-constrained urban environments is essentially the aggregate outcome of choices that individuals make in self-interest while assuming that others do the same. Existing models in transportation do typically no take the interaction and dependencies between different travellers into account. In this study, a new modelling approach was developed that incorporates an endogenous interaction term in a discrete choice model to describe the strategic choice behaviour of individuals. The approach accounts for different degrees of rationality, and choice situations, reflecting the extent of previous experiences. The choice models are linked to a model of how a control agent acts strategically, dependent on different objectives in optimizing usage of capacity-constrained facilities. The paper summarizes the approach, discusses the results of numerical simulations to assess its face validity and reports some main findings from two experiments that were conducted to empirically estimate the models.

AB In this study, we present and analyze a framework for geometric and topological estimation for mapping of unknown environments. We consider agents mimicking motion behaviors of cyborg insects, known as biobots, and exploit coordinate-free local interactions among them to infer geometric and topological information about the environment, underminimal sensing and localization constraints. A metric estimation procedure is presented over a graphical representation referred to as the encounter graph in order to construct a geometric point cloud using manifold learning techniques. Topological data analysis (TDA) along with the proposed classification method is used to infer robust topological features of the space (e.g., existence of obstacles). We examine the asymptotic behavior of the proposed metric in terms of the convergence to the geodesic distances in the underlying manifold of the domain, and provide stability analysis results for the topological persistence. The proposed framework and its convergences and stability analysis are demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments with Hexbugs.

AB The concept of action as basic motor control unit for goal-directed movement behavior has been used primarily for private or non-communicative actions like walking, reaching, or grasping. In this paper, literature is reviewed indicating that this concept can also be used in all domains of face-to-face communication like speech, co-verbal facial expression, and co-verbal gesturing. Three domain-specific types of actions, i.e. speech actions, facial actions, and hand-arm actions, are defined in this paper and a model is proposed that elucidates the underlying biological mechanisms of action production, action perception, and action acquisition in all domains of face-to-face communication. This model can be used as theoretical framework for empirical analysis or simulation with embodied conversational agents, and thus for advanced human-computer interaction technologies.

AB The goal of engineering self-organising emergent systems is to acquire a macroscopic system behaviour solely from autonomous local activity and interaction. Due to the non-deterministic nature of such systems, it is hard to guarantee that the required macroscopic behaviour is achieved and maintained. Before even considering a self-organising emergent system in an industrial context, e.g. for Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) transportation systems, such guarantees are needed. An empirical analysis approach is proposed that combines realistic agent-based simulations with existing scientific numerical algorithms for analysing the macroscopic behaviour. The numerical algorithm itself obtains the analysis results on the fly by steering and accelerating the simulation process according to the algorithm's goal. The approach is feasible, compared to formal proofs, and leads to more reliable and valuable results, compared to mere observation of simulation results. Also, the approach allows to systematically analyse the macroscopic behaviour to acquire macroscopic guarantees and feedback that can be used by an engineering process to iteratively shape a self-organising emergent solution.

AB Background: The transmission through contacts among MSM (men who have sex with men) is one of the dominating contributors to HIV prevalence in industrialized countries. In Amsterdam, the capital of the Netherlands, the MSM risk group has been traced for decades. This has motivated studies which provide detailed information about MSM's risk behavior statistically, psychologically and sociologically. Despite the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of HIV among MSM increases. In the long term the contradictory effects of risk behavior and effective therapy are still poorly understood.
   Methods: Using a previously presented Complex Agent Network model, we describe steady and casual partnerships to predict the HIV spreading among MSM. Behavior-related parameters and values, inferred from studies on Amsterdam MSM, are fed into the model; we validate the model using historical yearly incidence data. Subsequently, we study scenarios to assess the contradictory effects of risk behavior and effective therapy, by varying corresponding values of parameters. Finally, we conduct quantitative analysis based on the resulting incidence data.
   Results: The simulated incidence reproduces the ACS historical incidence well and helps to predict the HIV epidemic among MSM in Amsterdam. Our results show that in the long run the positive influence of effective therapy can be outweighed by an increase in risk behavior of at least 30% for MSM.
   Conclusion: We recommend, based on the model predictions, that lowering risk behavior is the prominent control mechanism of HIV incidence even in the presence of effective therapy.

TI Dynamic region-based mobile multicast
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING

DT Article
DE mobile multicast; average multicast tree configuration cost; average
   multicast packet delivery cost
AB Traditional mobile multicast schemes have higher multicast tree reconfiguration cost or multicast packet delivery cost. Two costs are very critical because the former affects the service disruption time during handoff while the latter affects the packet delivery delay. Although the range-based mobile multicast (RBMoM) scheme and its similar schemes offer the trade-off between two costs to some extent, most of them do not determine the size of service region, which is critical to the network performance. Hence, we propose a dynamic region-based mobile multicast (DRBMoM) to dynamically determine the optimal service region for reducing the multicast tree reconfiguration and multicast packet delivery costs. DRBMoM provides two versions: (i) the per-user version, named DRBMoM-U, and (ii) the aggregate-users version, named DRBMoM-A. Two versions have different applicability, which are the complementary technologies for pursuing efficient mobile multicast. Though having different data information and operations, two versions have the same method for finding the optimal service region. To that aim, DRBMoM models the users' mobility with arbitrary movement directional probabilities in 2-D mesh network using Markov Chain, and predicts the behaviors of foreign agents' (FAs') joining in a multicast group. DRBMoM derives a cost function to formulate the average multicast tree reconfiguration cost and the average multicast packet delivery cost, which is a function of service region. DRBMoM finds the optimal service region that can minimize the cost function. The simulation tests some key parameters of DRBMoM. In addition, the simulation and numerical analyses show the cost in DRBMoM is about 22 similar to 50% of that in RBMoM. At last, the applicability and computational complexity of DRBMoM and its similar scheme are analyzed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB A two-step chemical vapor deposition method is recently developed in industries for fabricating low-hydroxyl quartz glass. In this technique, bubbles are often trapped in molten quartz due to its highly viscous feature. Main purpose of this study is to analyze the bubble-group transport behavior in molten quartz and to explore effective methods for accelerating bubble rising and removal using simulation methods. An integrated numerical model is established with considering detailed heat transfer and fluid flow in the melting furnace, as well as discrete bubble tracking in molten quartz. Reliability of the simulation results is qualitatively validated by comparing with the theoretical calculations using classical Stokes and Hadamard-Rybczynski equations. Based on the results, it takes hundreds of hours for bubbles to escape from molten quartz in a typical heating furnace, which is unacceptable in practical fabrication. The temperature influence on bubble rising is studied in detail, which shows that increasing temperature could greatly enhance the fining efficiency through decreasing the melt viscosity. Finally, a novel method for accelerating bubble rising is put forward by using a rotating cone stirrer. Under the stirring effect, bubbles rise rapidly in molten quartz at the early stage, which is helpful for reducing the fining time. The rotating speed and size parameters of cone stirrer are further studied for their influences on the bubble rising behavior. Based on these findings, efficient fining of molten quartz is obtained by proper controlling of the stirrer. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aquaculture expansion is a political priority in Norway, despite simmering conflicts, and competing claims. We expand on this hypothesis and analyze the Norwegian governance system by adding stakeholder theory in case of a simulated model of the effects of municipal coastal zone planning in the municipality of Froya, Norway. One cannot analyze the governance system in Norway without fully comprehending the perspectives of the stakeholders involved. Different stakeholders will react and respond differently and have conflicting presumptions basing their actions toward the planning process for coastal areas. They will also have different levels of power and abilities to influence the system. The article presents the interdisciplinary, first generation development of an agent based simulation model that mimics the outcomes of coastal zone planning for a stakeholder groups, the commercial fishers and the aquaculture industry, based on qualitative input from legislation, regulations, and stakeholder workshops. We proceed with verifying the applicability of this simulator in light of the key actors involved, namely the commercial fishers. We found that the simulator had two outcomes for the commercial fishers that were consistently recurring, namely "collapse" and "stability," based on the simulated occurrences of complaints by the stakeholders, with the latter being the de facto perceptions of actuality by the commercial fishers. Using stakeholder theory, we argue that the aquaculture industry's role has the saliency of an Important Stakeholder in Froya has steered the commercial fishers, who has the role of Dependent Stakeholders according to stakeholder theory, to no longer see any legitimacy in the process in that their complaints were never upheld because of their lack of the attribute Power.

AB Cholinergic neurons of the mesopontine nuclei are strongly implicated in behavioral state regulation. One population of neurons in the cholinergic zone of the laterodorsal tegmentum and the pedunculopontine nuclei, referred to as rapid eye movement (REM)-on neurons, shows preferential discharge activity during REM sleep, and extensive data indicate a key role in production of this state. Another neuronal group present in the same cholinergic zone of the laterodorsal tegmentum and the pedunculopontine nuclei, referred to as Wake/REM-on neurons, shows preferential discharge activity during both wakefulness and REM sleep and is implicated in the production of electroencephalographic activation in both of these states. To test the hypothesis of differential serotonergic inhibition as an explanation of the different state-related discharge activity, we developed a novel methodology that enabled, in freely behaving animals, simultaneous unit recording and local perfusion of neuropharmacological agents using a microdialysis probe adjacent to the recording electrodes. Discharge activity of REM-on neurons was almost completely suppressed by local microdialysis perfusion of the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), although this agonist had minimal or no effect on the Wake/REM-on neurons. We conclude that selective serotonergic inhibition is a basis of differential state regulation in the mesopontine cholinergic nuclei, and that the novel methodology combining neurophysiological and neuropharmacological information from the freely behaving animal shows great promise for further insight into the neural basis of behavioral control.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to examine the complex role of consumer participation by empirically testing a theoretical model within the online context of consumer using product recommendation agents (RAs) that integrates consumer participation into the technology acceptance model (TAM). Recent research starts questioning whether consumer participation is a double-edged sword, although its positive effects have been widely documented in the services marketing literature.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 243 respondents comprising both genders with varied age groups, education levels, household income and ethnicities. Participants interacted with an existing RA, searching product information for a simulated purchase involving either high or low financial risk. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and Structural equations modeling (SEM) were used for assessing construct validity and testing hypotheses, respectively.
   Findings - Consumer participation was found to positively affect enjoyment but negatively affect perceived ease of use of an RA, which was exacerbated when the purchase was of high financial risk. Predictions based on TAM were all supported in this study.
   Research limitations/implications - This research evidenced consumer participation's dual-effect and identified financial risk as a moderator of consumer participation' negative effect. Future research could employ a different design such as using controlled lab settings and conducting longitudinal studies to replicate the study.
   Practical implications - Findings from this research provide guidance to RA design regarding the amount of consumer participation, consumer perceptions of RA use (ease of use, usefulness and enjoyment) and financial risk involved in the purchase.
   Originality/value - This research sheds new light on the role of consumer participation through uncovering its dual-effect, thus complementing the services marketing and RA literature.

AB Background: Orange juice (OJ) is rich in polyphenols with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. After myocardial infarction (MI), complex changes occur in cardiac structure and function, which is known as cardiac remodeling (CR). Oxidative stress and inflammation can modulate this process. We hypothesized that the consumption of OJ attenuates the CR after MI.
   Objectives: To evaluate the influence of OJ on CR after MI by analysis of functional, morphological, oxidative stress, inflammation, and energy metabolism variables.
   Methods: A total of 242 male rats weighing 200-250 g were submitted to a surgical procedure (coronary artery ligation or simulated surgery). Seven days after surgery, survivors were assigned to one of the four groups 1) SM, sham animals with water and maltodextrin (n=20); 2) SOJ, sham animals with OJ (n=20); 3) IM, infarcted animals with water and maltodextrin (n=40); and 4) IOJ, infarcted animals with OJ (n = 40). Statistical analysis was performed by the two-way ANOVA supplemented by Holm-Sidak. Results are presented as mean +/- standard deviation, the level of significance adopted was 5%.
   Results: After 3 months, MI led to left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, with systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. OJ intake reduced LV cavity and improved systolic and diastolic function. The OJ animals presented lower activity of glutathione peroxidase and higher expression of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1).
   Conclusion: OJ attenuated CR in infarcted rats and HO-1 may be play an important role in this process.

AB Background: MicroRNAs are believed to influence breast cancer cell tumorgenicity by interacting with the production of tumor associated macrophages. At this stage, this hypothesis lacks sufficient empirical evidence. Our study is an investigation of the effects of let-7a on the function of human breast cancer cell lines that had undergone chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) stimulation.
   Methods: Two breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were transfected with let-7a mimics with or without CCL18 simulation. The expression level of let-7a was evaluated with qRT-PCR. Our study examined cell proliferation, migration and cell cycles following let-7a treatment. The predicted target of let-7a was identified and confirmed in vitro by a dual luciferase reporter system. The associations between let-7a, CCL18 and target gene expression were evaluated using RT-PCR and the Western blotting method.
   Results: The downregulated expression level of let-7a was observed in both breast cancer cell lines. When compared to the control and CCL18 stimulation groups, cell proliferation and migration in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7 cells were significantly inhibited by let-7a. Furthermore, the cell cycle was dramatically blocked at the G2/M phase. The luciferase reporter identified Lin28 as the direct binding target of let-7a in both breast cancer cell lines.
   Conclusion: Upregulation of let-7a carries the potential to reverse CCL18 induced cell proliferation and migration alteration in breast cancer cells by regulating Lin28 expression. Our results provided evidence which suggests the use of let-7a as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Increased rates of carbapenem-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii have forced clinicians to rely upon last-line agents, such as the polymyxins, or empirical, unoptimized combination therapy. Therefore, the objectives of this study were: (a) to evaluate the in vitro pharmacodynamics of meropenem and polymyxin B (PMB) combinations against A. baumannii; (b) to utilize a mechanism-based mathematical model to quantify bacterial killing; and (c) to develop a genetic algorithm (GA) to define optimal dosing strategies for meropenem and PMB.
   Methods: A. baumannii (N16870; MICmeropenem = 16 mg/L, MICPMB = 0.5 mg/L) was studied in the hollow-fibre infection model (initial inoculum 10(8) cfu/mL) over 14 days against meropenem and PMB combinations. A mechanism-based model of the data and population pharmacokinetics of each drug were used to develop a GA to define the optimal regimen parameters.
   Results: Monotherapies resulted in regrowth to similar to 10(10) cfu/mL by 24 h, while combination regimens employing high-intensity PMB exposure achieved complete bacterial eradication (0 cfu/mL) by 336 h. The mechanism-based model demonstrated an SC50 (PMB concentration for 50% of maximum synergy on meropenem killing) of 0.0927 mg/L for PMB-susceptible subpopulations versus 3.40 mg/L for PMB-resistant subpopulations. The GA had a preference for meropenem regimens that improved the % T > MIC via longer infusion times and shorter dosing intervals. The GA predicted that treating 90% of simulated subjects harbouring a 108 cfu/mL starting inoculum to a point of 10(0) cfu/mL would require a regimen of meropenem 19.6 g/day 2 h prolonged infusion (2 hPI) q5h thorn PMB 5.17 mg/kg/day 2 hPI q6h (where the 0 h meropenem and PMB doses should be 'loaded' with 80.5% and 42.2% of the daily dose, respectively).
   Conclusion: This study provides a methodology leveraging in vitro experimental data, a mathematical pharmacodynamic model, and population pharmacokinetics provide a possible avenue to optimize treatment regimens beyond the use of the 'traditional' indices of antibiotic action.

ID FOAMY OIL; PETROLEUM DEMULSIFIERS; FLOW
AB The study and development of non-silicon-based defoamers for crude oils have been slightly investigated worldwide, despite urgent requirements of the petroleum industry. The suppression of crude oils has usually been resolved using commercial silicone defoamers (polysiloxanes), but these compounds cause serious problems such as catalyst poisoning in petroleum refining processes. In this study, an acrylic homopolymer series with different molecular structures was synthesized by emulsion polymerization, to determine the influence of the chemical repetitive unit on the defoaming capability. The following acrylic homopolymers were considered: poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA), poly(hexyl acrylate) (PHA), poly(2-ethylhexyl acrylate) (PEHA), and poly(dodecyl acrylate) (PDA). These polyacrylates were evaluated as foam suppressors in heavy crude oil, by means of a static method based on the sudden pressure drop of the system, which has the advantage of mimicking the gas/crude oil conditions in a biphasic separation tank. PHA, PEHA, and PDA showed greater antifoaming activity than that of silicones to suppress crude oil foam but only at an appropriate weight-average molecular weight ((M) over bar (w)). The strong influence of the length of pendant groups in the repetitive unit, which constitutes polyacrylates, could be evidenced by this way. The defoaming activity of the series of acrylic homopolymers was correlated with two series of physicochemical parameters obtained by theoretical calculations using HyperChem software and by molecular dynamics simulations. A "pitching off" mechanism of bubble collapse could be clearly established by this last simulation method. These novel antifoaming agents, based on a variety of polyacrylates, are innocuous during crude oil refining, and their fabrication cost is economically competitive, so they can be applied in industrial separation tanks to eliminate petroleum foams.

AB BackgroundBovine babesiosis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Babesia and presents a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. Disease severity depends on the type of Babesia species infection. Generally, B. bovis and B. bigemina are considered as the causative agents of bovine babesiosis; in addition, Babesia ovata and B. major are a group of benign bovine piroplasms. Therefore, species identification is important for diagnosis, epidemiological investigations and follow-up management.MethodsReal-time PCR combined with high resolution melting (RT-PCR-HRM) analysis was used to detect and discriminate four Babesia species infective to cattle, including Babesia bovis, B. bigemina, B. major and B. ovata. The melting profiles and melting temperatures (Tm) of the amplicon targeting 18S rRNA revealed differences that can discriminate the four Babesia spp. Sensitivity and specificity of the analytical method were evaluated using 50 blood samples collected from experimentally infected cattle and 240 blood samples from areas where bovine babesiosis is an issue.ResultsRT-PCR-HRM analysis allowed to detect and discriminate four Babesia spp. (B. bovis, B. bigemina, B. major and B. ovata), which were responsible for bovine babesiosis in China. The protocol was validated with DNA samples from experimentally infected cattle and field infection in cattle.ConclusionsOur results indicate that RT-PCR-HRM is a fast and robust tool for the simultaneous detection and discrimination of four Babesia species that are responsible for bovine babesiosis in China. This approach is applicable for both field and experimental samples, thus it could be useful in epidemiological investigations and diagnoses of bovine babesiosis.

AB This article summarizes the overall issues surrounding cancer for the general audience. Individual differences between patients include genetic and non-genetic differences manifested in various cellular pathways, tumor heterogeneity and variability, differing contribution of tumor microenvironment and potential toward metastasis. Successful treatment of individuals depends on correctly interpreting all these factors and appropriately addressing the actual features by using customized therapy strategies, simultaneously or sequentially. Currently used chemotherapy agents are cytotoxic and typically target one of the major pathways; therefore they have to be applied in combination regimes. Nanomedicines however, have the potential advantage that more than one feature can be built into a complex nanodevice. This yet untapped potential is illustrated on the example of a gadolinium fullerenol cage molecule. Gd@C-82(OH)(22) has low toxicity, influences several biologic features simultaneously, displays tumoristatic properties, and is effective against triple-negative breast cancer cells. A deeper understanding of the exact relations between the physicochemical characteristics of this system and the biologic events may lead to a new class of efficient anticancer pharmaceutics.
   From the Clinical Editor: The search for the magic bullet in the treatment of cancer has long been the dream of clinicians and researchers worldwide. Inherent cellular characteristics of cancer cells have made this task extremely hard to reach. In this article, the author provided a concise summary on the understanding and challenges in the current battle and also illustrated the potential usefulness of the recently developed gadolinium fullerenol cage molecule by describing experimental data from various research groups.

AB Reversible and irreversible covalent ligands are advanced cysteine protease inhibitors in the drug development pipeline. K777 is an irreversible inhibitor of cruzain, a necessary enzyme for the survival of the Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) parasite, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Despite their importance, irreversible covalent inhibitors are still often avoided due to the risk of adverse effects. Herein, we replaced the K777 vinyl sulfone group with a nitrile moiety to obtain a reversible covalent inhibitor (Neq0682) of cysteine protease. Then, we used advanced experimental and computational techniques to explore details of the inhibition mechanism of cruzain by reversible and irreversible inhibitors. The isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis shows that inhibition of cruzain by an irreversible inhibitor is thermodynamically more favorable than by a reversible one. The hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore the mechanism of the reaction inhibition of cruzain by K777 and Neq0682. The calculated free energy profiles show that the Cys25 nucleophilic attack and His162 proton transfer occur in a single step for a reversible inhibitor and two steps for an irreversible covalent inhibitor. The hybrid QM/MM calculated free energies for the inhibition reaction correspond to -26.7 and -5.9 kcal mol(-1) for K777 and Neq0682 at the MP2/MM level, respectively. These results indicate that the.G of the reaction is very negative for the process involving K777, consequently, the covalent adduct cannot revert to a noncovalent protein-ligand complex, and its binding tends to be irreversible. Overall, the present study provides insights into a covalent inhibition mechanism of cysteine proteases.

AB Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) suppresses the generation of prostaglandin H2, which is the precursor of thromboxane A2. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent in which its acetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue (S530) in the active site of the cyclooxygenase-1 enzyme. The exact reaction mechanism has not been revealed by experimental methods.
   In this study the putative structure of human cyclooxygenase-1 was constructed from ovine cyclooxygenase-1 by homology modeling, and the acetylsalicylic acid was docked into the arachidonic acid binding cavity of the enzyme. To characterize the shape of the potential energy surface of the acetylating reaction and to determine the relative energies of the stationary points on the surface, a series of ONIOM-type quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations were carried out at different QM levels of theories applying electronic embedding approximations. The acetylsalicylic acid and the surrounding amino acids were included in these calculations. Frequency analyses were performed to prove the existence of first order saddle points (representing transition states) and local minima on the potential energy surface.
   It was found that all levels of theories predicted similar transition state geometries. The activation energy values, however, demonstrated significant dependence on the methods that were applied. All the applied "dependable" ab initio and DFT methods predicted that the breakage of the O gamma-H gamma and formation of the O gamma-C(acetylsalicylic acid carbonyl) bonds occur in a single elementary step.

AB Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) is a cytosolic monomeric enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of the myristoyl group from myristoyl-CoA to the N-terminal glycine of a number of eukaryotic cellular and viral proteins. Recent experimental data suggest NMT from parasites could be a promising new target for the design of novel antiparasitic agents with new mode of action. However, the active site topology and inhibitor specificity of these enzymes remain unclear. In this study, three-dimensional models of NMT from Plasmodium falciparum (PfNMT), Leishmania major (LmNMT) and Trypanosoma brucei (TbNMT) were constructed on the basis of the crystal structures of fungal NMTs using homology modeling method. The models were further refined by energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations. The active sites of PfNMT, LmNMT and TbNMT were characterized by multiple copy simultaneous search (MCSS). MCSS functional maps reveal that PfNMT, LmNMT and TbNMT share a similar active site topology, which is defined by two hydrophobic pockets, a hydrogen-bonding (HB) pocket, a negatively-charged HB pocket and a positively-charged HB pocket. Flexible docking approaches were then employed to dock known inhibitors into the active site of PfNMT. The binding mode, structure-activity relationships and selectivity of inhibitors were investigated in detail. From the results of molecular modeling, the active site architecture and certain key residues responsible for inhibitor binding were identified, which provided insights for the design of novel inhibitors of parasitic NMTs.

AB The discovery of selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors represents a major achievement of the efforts over the past few decades to develop therapeutic treatments for inflammation. To gain insights into designing new COX-2-selective inhibitors, we address the energetic and structural basis for the selective inhibition of COX isozymes by means of a combined computational protocol involving docking experiment, force field design for the heme prothetic group, and free energy perturbation (FEP) simulation. We consider both COX-2- and COX-1-selective inhibitors taking the V523I mutant of COX-2 to be a relevant structural model for COX-1 as confirmed by a variety of experimental and theoretical evidences. For all COX-2-selective inhibitors under consideration, we find that free energies of binding become less favorable as the receptor changes from COX-2 to COX-1, due to the weakening and/or loss of hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the inhibitors in the COX-2 active site. On the other hand, COX-1-selective oxicam inhibitors gain extra stabilization energy with the change of residue 523 from valine to isoleucine because of the formations of new hydrogen bonds in the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. The utility of the combined computational approach, as a valuable tool for in silico screening of COX-2-selective inhibitors, is further exemplified by identifying the physicochemical origins of the enantiospecific selective inhibition of COX-2 by alpha-substituted indomethacin ethanolamide inhibitors.

AB Liposomal cytarabine, DepoCyt, is a chemotherapy agent which is used in cancer treatment. This form of cytarabine has more efficacy and fewer side effects relative to the other forms. Since DepoCyt contains the cytarabine encapsulated within phosphatidylcholine and the sterol molecules, we modeled dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)/cholesterol bilayer membrane as a carrier for cytarabine to study drug-bilayer interactions. For this purpose, we performed a series of united-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for 25 ns to investigate the interactions between cytarabine and cholesterol-containing DOPC lipid bilayers. Only the uncharged form of cytarabine molecule was investigated. In this study, different levels of the cholesterol content (0, 20, and 40%) were used. MD simulations allowed us to determine dynamical and structural properties of the bilayer membrane and to estimate the preferred location and orientation of the cytarabine molecule inside the bilayer membrane. Properties such as membrane thickness, area per lipid, diffusion coefficient, mass density, bilayer packing, order parameters, and intermolecular interactions were examined. The results show that by increasing the cholesterol concentration in the lipid bilayers, the bilayer thickness increases and area per lipid decreases. Moreover, in accordance with the experiments, our calculations show that cholesterol molecules have ordering effect on the hydrocarbon acyl chains. Furthermore, the cytarabine molecule preferentially occupies the polar region of the lipid head groups to form specific interactions (hydrogen bonds). Our results fully support the experimental data. Our finding about drug-bilayer interaction is crucial for the liposomal drug design.

AB Hormetic effects have been observed at low exposure levels based on the dose-response pattern of data from developmental toxicity studies. This indicates that there might actually be a reduced risk of exhibiting toxic effects at low exposure levels. Hormesis implies the existence of a threshold dose level and there are dose-response models that include parameters that account for the threshold. We propose a function that introduces a parameter to account for hormesis. This function is a subset of the set of all functions that could represent a hormetic dose-response relationship at low exposure levels to toxic agents. We characterize the overall dose-response relationship with a piecewise function that consists of a hormetic u-shape curve at low dose levels and a logistic curve at high dose levels. We apply our model to a data set from an experiment conducted at the National Toxicology Program (NTP). We also use the beta-binomial distribution to model the litter response data. It can be seen by observing the structure of these data that current experimental designs for developmental studies employ a limited number of dose groups. These designs may not be satisfactory when the goal is to illustrate the existence of hormesis. In particular, increasing the number of low-level doses improves the power for detecting hormetic effects. Therefore, we also provide the results of simulations that were done to characterize the power of current designs in detecting hormesis and to demonstrate how this power can be improved upon by altering these designs with the addition of only a few low exposure levels.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro reactivation of the various molecular forms of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase by oximes such as HI-6, toxogonin and PAM, in striated muscle tissue from three species-rat, monkey and human. To simulate the various in vivo conditions the oxime was present either 5 min before and after (Pre-Post) or 5 min after (Post) exposure to the nerve agent soman. In the Pre-Post mode the oxime effects would result from a combination of not only shielding of acetylcholinesterase from soman inhibition but also from immediate reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinnesterase. In the Post experimental group the increase in soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity was due to reactivation. HI-6 (Pre-Post) increased significantly the activity of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the rat, human and monkey muscle. HI-6 (Post) was a highly effective reactivator of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the rat muscle and moderately so in the human and monkey muscle. Toxogonin (Pre-Post) and toxogonin (Post) were effective in increasing soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in rat muscle but were relatively ineffective in the human and monkey muscle. PAM (Pre-Post) and PAM (Post) were ineffective in increasing soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle from all species examined. Effectiveness of oxime-induced reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase could be estimated from the total acetylcholinesterase activity which appears to reflect the results found with the individual molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase. In addition, SAD-128, a non-oxime bispyridinium compound, appeared to enhance significantly the HI-6 induced reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in human but not rat striated muscle.

AB Objectives: Traditional microbiology identification takes 48-72 h to complete. This lag forces clinicians to rely on broad-spectrum empiric coverage. To address this gap, manufacturers are developing rapid molecular diagnostics (RMD). We hypothesised that RMD's accuracy is more dependent upon population risk of harbouring the culprit pathogen than to their sensitivity and specificity.
   Design: A mathematical model.
   Setting and participants: We used the range of risks (5-50%) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) among patients hospitalised with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), pneumonia or sepsis.
   Main outcome measures: We modelled the impact of changing a test's characteristics on its positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values, and hence the risk of overtreatment or undertreatment, within strata of an organism's population prevalence. MRSA diagnostics provided assumptions for the test sensitivity and specificity (95-99%). Scenarios with low sensitivity and specificity (90%), and best-case and worst-case scenarios normalised to the annual universe of populations of interest, were examined.
   Results: With a low prevalence (5%) and high test specificity, the PPV was 84%. Conversely, with 50% prevalence and 95% test specificity the PPV rose to >= 95%. Even when the test's specificity and sensitivity were both 90%, in a high-risk population both PPV and NPV were similar to 90%. In the worst-case scenario, 150 000 patients with cSSSI, pneumonia and sepsis annually were at risk for inappropriate treatment, 91% of these at risk for over-treatment. In the best-case scenario, 81% of 18 000 patients at risk for inappropriate coverage were subject to overtreatment.
   Conclusions: Although promising for limiting exposure to excessive antimicrobial coverage, RMDs alone will not solve the issue of inappropriate, and particularly overtreatment. Increasing pretest probability as a strategy to minimise antibiotic abuse results in more accurate patient classification than does developing a test with near-perfect characteristics. The healthcare community must build robust evidence and information technology infrastructure to guide appropriate use of such testing.

TI Ferromagnetic and spin-glass-like transition in the majority vote model

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B

ID SOLVABLE MODEL; SQUARE
AB Ferromagnetic and spin-glass-like transitions in nonequilibrium spin models in contact with two thermal baths with different temperatures are investigated. The models comprise the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and the dilute spin glass model which are the Ising models on complete and random graphs, respectively, with edges corresponding, with certain probability, to positive and negative exchange integrals. The spin flip rates are combinations of two Glauber rates at the two temperatures, and by varying the coefficients of this combination probabilities of contact of the model with each thermal bath and thus the level of thermal noise in the model are changed. Particular attention is devoted to the majority vote model in which one of the two above-mentioned temperatures is zero and the other one tends to infinity. Only in rare cases such nonequilibrium models can be mapped onto equilibrium ones at certain effective temperature. Nevertheless, Monte Carlo simulations show that transitions from the paramagnetic to the ferromagnetic and spin-glass-like phases occur in all cases under study as the level of thermal noise is varied, and the phase diagrams resemble qualitatively those for the corresponding equilibrium models obtained with varying temperature. Theoretical investigation of the model on complete and random graphs is performed using the TAP equations as well as mean-field and pair approximations, respectively. In all cases theoretical calculations yield reasonably correct predictions concerning location of the phase border between the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases. In the case of the spin-glass-like transition only qualitative agreement between theoretical and numerical results is achieved using the TAP equations, and the mean-field and pair approximations are not suitable for the study of this transition. The obtained results can be interesting for modeling opinion formation by means of the majority-vote and related models and suggest that in the presence of negative interactions between agents, apart from the ferromagnetic phase corresponding to consensus formation, spin-glass-like phase can occur in the society characterized by local rather than long-range ordering.

AB In the present study, a group of microcapsule-based smart coatings has been investigated to decrease the corrosion rate in oil and gas transmission lines. The microcapsules are made of epoxy resin and self-healing materials such as oil, which acts as a repairing agent. In this study, the parameters affecting the coating performance such as agitation rate in the micro capsulation process, microcapsule size, and percentage of microcapsule used in the coating structure have been investigated and optimized. Also, other properties of the smart coating, such as the ability to protect against corrosion and adhesion of the coating to the substrate, are examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis, and pull-off test. The use of microcapsules indicates that as the microcapsules become smaller, the corrosion resistance, as well as the adhesion of the coating to the substrate, is improved. Also, the use of microcapsules in the structure improves the protective capability significantly. The best percentage of microcapsules is the sample with 40 wt%, which increases the corrosion resistance of the coating, although the polymers increase the results of electrochemical and water absorption tests. The formation of microcracks is a serious problem in the use of polymers composites. The creation and spread of these microcracks cause the destruction of these materials and reduces the lifetime of the polymeric material. Above for the synthesis of microcapsules, the method of preparing self-healing polymers and adding them to the containing 40% of microcapsules may provide a suitable coating for carbon steels of oil and gas industries along with a suitable model of its molecular dynamics simulation (MDs).

AB Chemotherapy-induced nail toxicity is a widely spread phenomenon. Cooling the patient's hands can reduce blood flow to the fingers and consequently reducing the amount of chemical agents reaching the nails. This paper is aiming at developing a model-based controller of the finger's skin temperatures and blood flow to reduce the risk of nail toxicity during chemotherapy. Experiments were conducted to model the dynamic response of the fingers skin temperature and blood flow using an ad hoc experimental device. The device was designed to provide a localised cooling of the fingers. The experiments were performed on a homogeneous test group of 11 middle-aged women. The fingers' skin temperatures and blood flow were measured continuously. A second order discrete time transfer function model was suitable (R-2=0.91 +/- 0.18) in all the cases to model the dynamic responses of the fingers' skin temperatures. The model estimation results have shown that the a- and b-parameters were varying among different test subjects and within the same subject. The resulted models were employed in designing a model-based proportional-integral-plus controller. Simulations of the closed-loop systems were performed based on the identified models for each test subject. The simulation results have shown that the designed controller is able to regulate the finger's skin temperatures tightly about the desired level and yet, is still quite simple to implement in practice. Controlled active cooling with an online parameter estimation algorithm and continuous feedback of the patient finger temperatures is a promising solution to reduce nail toxicity during chemotherapy.

AB Purpose: To determine if pulsed-high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) could effectively serve as a source of hyperthermia with thermosensitive liposomes to enhance delivery and efficacy of doxorubicin in tumors.
   Experimental Design: Comparisons in vitro and in vivo were carried out between non thermosensitive liposomes (NTSL) and low temperature - Sensitive liposomes (LTSL). Liposomes were incubated in vitro over a range of temperatures and durations, and the amount of doxorubicin released was measured. For in vivo experiments, liposomes and free doxorubicin were injected i.v. in mice followed by pulsed-HIFU exposures in s.c. murine adenocarcinoma tumors at 0 and 24 h after administration. Combinations of the exposures and drug formulations were evaluated for doxorubicin concentration and growth inhibition in the tumors.
   Results: In vitro incubations simulating the pulsed-HIFU thermal dose (42 degrees C for 2 min) triggered release of 50% of doxorubicin from the LTSLs; however, no detectable release from the NTSLs was observed. Similarly, in vivo experiments showed that pulsed-HIFU exposures combined with the LTSLs resulted in more rapid delivery of doxorubicin as well as significantly higher i.t. concentration when compared with LTSLs alone or NTSLs, with or without exposures. Combining the exposures with the LTSLs also significantly reduced tumor growth compared with all other groups.
   Conclusions: Combining low-temperature heat-sensitive liposomes with noninvasive and non-destructive pulsed-HIFU exposures enhanced the delivery of doxorubicin and, consequently, its antitumor effects. This combination therapy could potentially produce viable clinical strategies for improved targeting and delivery of drugs for treatment of cancer and other diseases.

AB Clinical and laboratory investigations have demonstrated the involvement of viruses and bacteria as potential causative agents in cardiovascular disease and have specifically found coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to be a leading cause. Experimental data indicate that cytokines are involved in controlling CVB3 replication. Therefore, recombinant CVB3 (CVB3rec) variants expressing the T-helper-1 (T(H)1)-specific gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) or the T(H)2-specific interleukin-10 (IL-10) as well as the control virus CVB3(muIL-10), which produce only biologically inactive IL-10, were established. Coding regions of murine cytokines were cloned into the 5' end of the CVB3 wild type (CVB3wt) open reading frame and were supplied with an artificial viral 3Cpro-specific Q-G cleavage site. Correct processing releases active cytokines, and the concentration of IFN-gamma and IL-10 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and bioassays. In mice, CVB3wt was detectable in pancreas and heart tissue, causing massive destruction of the exocrine pancreas as well as myocardial inflammation and heart cell lysis. Most of the CVB3wt-infected mice revealed virus-associated symptoms, and some died within 28 days postinfection. In contrast, CVB3rec variants were present only in the pancreas of infected mice, causing local inflammation with subsequent healing. Four weeks after the first infection, surviving mice were challenged with the lethal CVB3H3 variant, causing casualties in the CVB3wt- and CVB3(muIL-10)-infected groups, whereas almost none of the CVB3(IFN-gamma)- and CVB3(IL-10)-infected mice died and no pathological disorders were detectable. This study demonstrates that expression of immunoregulatory cytokines during CVB3 replication simultaneously protects mice against a lethal disease and prevents virus-caused tissue destruction.

AB 19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) is one of the mostly recurrent anabolic agents on the black market of illicit drugs. Dexamethasone (DEXA) is licensed for therapy in veterinary practice but its misuse, although often suspected, has seldom been demonstrated. The excretion of 19-NT and DEXA is well documented when the compounds are administered independently but poor information is available in literature for instances when both drugs are administered as a mixture. To evaluate a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for anabolic residues in urine, blood and faeces, the effect of the simultaneous administration and the subsequent elimination of the two drugs, two animals were injected (4 times) with 19-NT and another two (4 times) with 19-NT-DEXA. After preparation and a sequential clean-up on C-18 and alumina columns, the samples were analysed by means of a specific 19-NT radioimmunoassay kit and an anti-DEXA antibody. Detection limits for both drugs were 0.5 ppb in blood samples and 2.0 ppb in urine and faecal samples. After the final treatment, positive 19-NT results were recorded at 14 and 21 d in urine and faecal samples, respectively. In the same matrices, positive DEXA values were found at 11 and 28 d, respectively. Urinary excretion was the main metabolic path both for 19-NT and DEXA; only 30% of the residues were excreted via the faeces. The simultaneous injection of DEXA and 19-NT increased the urinary excretion of 19-NT; however, the excretion of 19-NT via faecal matter was similar for both groups.

AB Although there is acute concern that insect-caused tree mortality increases the likelihood or severity of subsequent wildfire, previous studies have been mixed, with findings typically based on stand-scale simulations or individual events. This study investigates landscape-and regional-scale wildfire likelihood following outbreaks of the two most prevalent native insect pests in the US Pacific Northwest (PNW): mountain pine beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) and western spruce budworm (WSB; Choristoneura freemani). We leverage seamless census data across numerous insect and fire events to (1) summarize the interannual dynamics of insects (1970-2012) and wildfires (1984-2012) across forested ecoregions of the PNW; (2) identify potential linked disturbance interactions with an empirical wildfire likelihood index; (3) quantify this insect-fire likelihood across different insect agents, time lags, ecoregions, and fire sizes. All three disturbance agents have occurred primarily in the drier, interior conifer forests east of the Cascade Range. In general, WSB extent exceeds MPB extent, which in turn exceeds wildfire extent, and each disturbance typically affects less than 2% annually of a given ecoregion. In recent decades across the PNW, wildfire likelihood does not consistently increase or decrease following insect outbreaks. There is evidence, however, of linked interactions that vary across insect agent (MPB, WSB), space (ecoregion), and time (interval since insect onset). Specifically, in most cases following MPB activity, fire likelihood is neither higher nor lower than in non-MPB-affected forests. In contrast, fire likelihood is lower following WSB activity across multiple ecoregions and time lags. In addition, insect-fire likelihood is not consistently associated with interannual fire extent, suggesting that other factors (e.g., climate) control the disproportionately large fire years accounting for regional fire dynamics. Thus, although both bark beetles and defoliators alter fuels and associated fire potential, the windows of opportunity for increased or decreased fire likelihood are too narrow-or the phenomena themselves too rare-for a consistent signal to emerge across PNW conifer forests. These findings suggest that strategic plans should recognize (1) the relative rarity of insect-fire interactions and (2) the potential ecosystem restoration benefits of native insect outbreaks, when they do occur.

AB The possibility of use of chemical weapons has increased in recent years, both as a result of potential terrorist attacks as well as of ongoing international conflicts. The successful application of a flow-through catalytic membrane reactor (FTCMR) as an individual protection system for the destruction of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), which is known as a chemical precursor (and used to simulate its characteristics) for Sarin (GB), a toxic chemical warfare agent (CWA) was previously investigated and reported by this group. As part of the study, the effect of the DMMP concentration in the teed On its complete combustion in the FTCMR was investigated. The studies indicate that the protection (complete conversion) time is a function of the DMMP concentration, with longer times observed for the lower concentrations, and shorter protection times associated with the higher concentrations. In this study a novel hybrid system is being developed that combines the FTCMR with a surface-flow membrane system (SFUS). Preliminary experimental results presented here manifest the main advantage of this hybrid system, combining the SFMS, capable of the physical removal of a large fraction of the CWA from contaminated air streams, and the FICMR which completely oxidizes the remaining amount, which is the continuous CWA destruction for extended time periods which are appropriate for both individual and collective protection applications. The study investigates the impact on performance of the membrane characteristics, the transmembrane pressure gradient and the sweep ratio. Hybrid system performance is also compared with that of a sole FTCMR showing the superiority of the hybrid system in terms of offering higher destruction rates for DMMP and prolonged protection times.

AB It has proven challenging to investigate the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy, due to difficulties with culturing of the organism and a lack of genetic heterogeneity between strains. Recently, a cost-effective panel of variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) markers has been developed. Use of this panel allows some of those limitations to be overcome and has allowed the genotyping of 475 M. leprae strains from six different countries. In the present report, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the relationships among the strains in order to investigate the patterns of transmission and migration of M. leprae. We find phylogenetic analysis to be inadequate and have developed an alternative method, structure-neighbor clustering, which assigns isolates with the most similar genotypes to the same groups and, subsequently, subgroups, without inferring how the strains descended from a common ancestor. We validate the approach by using simulated data and detecting expected epidemiological relationships from experimental data. Our results suggest that most M. leprae strains from a given country cluster together and that the occasional isolates assigned to different clusters are a consequence of migration. We found three genetically distinguishable populations among isolates from the Philippines, as well as evidence for the significant influx of strains to that nation from India. We also report that reference strain TN originated from the Philippines and not from India, as was previously believed. Lastly, analysis of isolates from the same families and villages suggests that most community infections originate from a common source or person-to-person transmission but that infection from independent sources does occur with measurable frequency.

AB Purpose The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib may be effective in combination with cytarabine and anthracyclines in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by virtue of targeting aberrantly activated NF-kappa B in AML stem cells. We tested whether bortezomib cytotoxicity is affected by multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins expressed in AML cells. We also tested whether bortezomib interactions with cytarabine and anthracyclines are affected by p53, because proteasome inhibition stabilizes p53 and may thus cause cell cycle arrest.
   Experimental design Bortezomib sensitivity of cell lines overexpressing P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance protein-1, breast cancer resistance protein and lung resistance protein was studied in the presence and absence of established modulators of these transport proteins. Drug interactions during simultaneous and sequential exposure to bortezomib and anthracyclines or cytarabine in diverse ratios were evaluated by isobologram and combination index analyses in AML cell lines with wild type and inactive p53 and were correlated with cell cycle perturbations induced by bortezomib.
   Results Of the MDR mechanisms studied, only P-glycoprotein conferred resistance to bortezomib, and resistance was only twofold. Interactions between bortezomib and anthracylines and cytarabine changed from antagonistic to additive or synergistic with increasing drug activity levels and were not affected by p53 status.
   Conclusions MDR proteins and p53 do not affect bortezomib cytotoxicity or in vitro interactions with anthracyclines or cytarabine, but these interactions are concentration-dependent, and this concentration-dependency should be considered in the design of combination regimens.

SO ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY

ID ALKYLATING-AGENTS; EXPOSURE; WORKERS; RAT
AB Acrylamide (AA) is a carcinogen in experimental animals. Glycidamide (GA), formed by metabolic epoxidation of AA, is believed to be responsible for the carcinogenicity of AA. Occupational exposure to AA has been assessed earlier by measurement of its adducts with N-terminal valine in hemoglobin. A background of AA adducts [N-(2-carbamoylethyl) valine (AAVal), about 30 pmol/g globin] was found in individuals without known exposure to the compound. The method previously available for adducts of GA only allowed analysis of samples from highly exposed individuals and showed similar levels of AAVal and adducts of GA [N-(2-hydroxy-2-carbamoylethyl)valine (GAVal)]. We have developed a sensitive method for simultaneous quantification of adducts of GA and AA, which is suitable down to low exposure levels. The method is based on the so-called modified Edman method, where globin is reacted with pentafluorophenyl isothiocyanate under neutral conditions, The valine adducts are then extracted in the form of pentafluorophenylthiohydantoin (PFPTH) derivatives, The analytical procedure included reaction of the PFPTH derivatives with acetic anhydride in order to protect the hydroxyl group of GAVal, The PFPTH derivatives of AAVal and GAVal were analyzed by gas chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, (H-2(2))AAVal-PFPTH was used as the internal standard. The method was applied to samples from 11 workers at an AA production plant, 1 nonexposed nonsmoker, and a few participants of a smoking cessation program. AAVal levels were in the range 27-1854 pmol/g globin, Recorded levels of GAVal were 3-12% of those of AAVal, suggesting that previous measurements of GAVal overestimate GAVal at low levels Of exposure to AA.

AB Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) enables detection of molecules such as glycogen, whose concentrations are too low to impact the signal intensity of standard MR imaging. Detection of these molecules is achieved by selectively saturating a molecule of interest and by measuring the reduction in water signal due to saturation transfer. CEST effects are dependent on parameters such as CEST agent concentration, pH, temperature, relaxation rate, magnetic field strength as well as on experimental parameters such as repetition time, RF irradiation amplitude, and the imaging readout scheme. Measurement of molecules with exchangeable protons that resonate very close to water, e.g., hydroxyl groups in glycogen, is challenging especially at lower magnetic field strengths, mainly due to the effect of direct water saturation. Therefore, optimal RF irradiation parameters that maximize the CEST signal and reduce the competing factors are important for better quantification of glycogen-weighted CEST effects. In this study, analytical solution of the Bloch-McConnell equations was used to find optimal continuous wave RF irradiation parameters for detection of glycogen. In vivo tests were performed on a human calf muscle at different saturation powers to validate the optimal saturation parameters determined via simulation. The selected parameters were applied in vitro to CEST measurements in a phantom with varying glycogen concentrations and also in vivo in a human calf muscle. Our results show the possibility of detecting glycogen using CEST MRI at 3 T. It is further shown that the glycoCEST signal can be maximized by optimizing the RF pulse irradiation parameters (duration and power) and that different glycogen concentrations can be identified when applying the optimized saturation pulse.

AB Wheat straw-supported Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron particles (WS-NZVI) were successfully synthesized, which were used for Ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) removal in simulation wastewater. The structure, chemical composition and micro-morphology of WS-NZVI and Nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron (NZVI) were characterized by scanning electron microscopy analysis (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), as well as the Fourier Transformed IR spectra (FT-IR). XRD results proved the existence of Fe degrees, and SEM images indicated that the agglomeration of NZVI was effectively inhibited when loaded on wheat straw. Besides, the effects of initial solution pH, CIP concentration, adsorbents dosage and contacting time on the removal efficiency of CIP by WS-NZVI and NZVI were investigated. The experimental results showed that, compared with NZVI and wheat straw, WS-NZVI possessed higher removal efficiency for CIP, and the maximum removal capacity of CIP by WS-NZVI was 363.63 mg g(-1) (25 degrees C). Furthermore, WS-NZVI was suitable for wider pH range (pH = 4-10) in comparison with NZVI. For the WS-NZVI, the kinetic was better fitted with pseudo-second-order equation, rather than pseudo first-order equation. The Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis deduced that the degradation reaction mainly occurred on quinolone groups piperazinyl ring. Therefore, it is feasible that using wheat straw as a support material to enhance the performance of NZVI, and the synthesized WS-NZVI has a potential in the organic compounds elimination because of its redox reaction activity.

AB CYP164 family P450 enzymes are found in only a subset of mycobacteria and include CYP164A1, which is the sole P450 found in Mycobacterium leprae, the causative agent of leprosy. This has previously led to interest in this enzyme as a potential drug target. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a CYP164 enzyme, CYP164A2 from Mycobacterium smegmatis. CYP164A2 has a distinctive, enlarged hydrophobic active site that extends above the porphyrin ring toward the access channels. Unusually, we find that CYP164A2 can simultaneously bind two econazole molecules in different regions of the enlarged active site and is accompanied by the rearrangement and ordering of the BC loop. The primary location is through a classic interaction of the azole group with the porphyrin iron. The second econazole molecule is bound to a unique site and is linked to a tetracoordinated metal ion complexed to one of the heme carboxylates and to the side chains of His 105 and His 364. All of these features are preserved in the closely homologous M. leprae CYP164A1. The computational docking of azole compounds to a homology model of CYP164A1 suggests that these compounds will form effective inhibitors and is supported by the correlation of parallel docking with experimental binding studies of CYP164A2. The binding of econazole to CYP164A2 occurs primarily through the high-spin "open" conformation of the enzyme (K-d[dissociation constant] of 0.1 mu M), with binding to the low-spin "closed" form being significantly hindered (K-d of 338 mu M). These studies support previous suggestions that azole derivatives may provide an effective strategy to improve the treatment of leprosy.

Because of its solubility, this drug is usually administered ria an intravenous bolus followed by infusion. The purpose of this study was to determine the pharmacokinetics of argatroban after intravenous bolus injection in primates.
   Methods. Parallel in vitro studies in primate whole blood were carried out to simulate a one-compartment system. Argatroban (range 1.0-7.5 mg/kg) was administered to four groups of primates and blood samples were drawn at various time periods. Argatroban measurements were made in plasma using functional (aPTT, Heptest, TT) and HPLC methods.
   Results. In vitro, argatroban primarily distributed in the plasma in proportionate amounts. Relative uptake of argatroban to the blood cells (leukocytes and erythrocytes) was minimum. However, in vitro, argatroban followed a complex pharmacokinetics, Within 5 min after the bolus administration, only <20% of argatroban was recovered. The recovered amount tvas proportionate to the dosage and followed the expected kinetics with a half-life of <20 min. Simultaneous quantitation of M1-metabolite of argatroban revealed only a fraction of recovered argatroban (similar to 25%) converted into M1 in these experimental settings. Results obtained from the functional and absolute methods correlated well. HPLC profile did not reveal the presence of any other metabolite(s),
   Conclusions. These observations suggest that argatroban mag be endogenously taken up by the vascular or other sites and may exhibit a complex kinetics. In acute settings, the metabolic transformation of argatroban to M1 is relatively low. To further clarify the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of this drug, additional studies are warranted.

AB Drug delivery systems are based on reversible interactions between carriers and drugs. Spacers are often introduced to tailor the type of interaction and to keep drugs intact. Here, we model a drug delivery system based on a functionalized curved TiO2 nanoparticle of realistic size (700 atoms - 2.2 nm) by the neurotransmitter dopamine to carry the anticancer chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin (DOX). The multiscale quantum chemical study aims at unraveling the nature and mechanism of the interactions between the components and the electronic properties of the composite system. We simulate the temperature effect through molecular dynamics runs of thermal annealing. Dopamine binds preferentially to low coordinated Ti sites on the nanoparticle through dissociated bidentate and chelate modes involving the diol groups. DOX is tethered by H-bonds, pi-pi stacking, dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces. Comparing different coverage densities of the spacer on the nanoparticle surface, we assess the best conditions for an effective drug transport and release: only at full coverage, DOX does not slip among the dopamine molecules to reach the nanoparticle surface, which is crucial to avoid the formation of stable coordinative bonds with under-coordinated Ti atoms. Finally, given the strong absorption properties and fluorescence of DOX and of the TiO2 photocatalyst, we model the effect of light irradiation through excited state calculations to localize excitons and to follow the charge carrier's life path. This fundamental study on the nature and mechanism of drug/carrier interaction provides a solid ground for the rational design of new experimental protocols for a more efficient drug transport and release and its combination with photodynamic therapy.

AB Cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase is involved in the phosphorylation of several purine nucleoside analogs, used as antiviral and chemotherapeutic agents. In order to assess its role in the mechanisms of activation and inactivation of purine prodrugs, it is essential to study the regulation of both hydrolase and phosphotransferase activities of the enzyme. Using a zone capillary electrophoresis apparatus, we were able to separate substrates and products of the reactions catalyzed by cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase. The method overcomes the frequent unavailability of radiolabeled substrates, and allows the influence of possible effecters and/or experimental conditions on both enzyme activities to be evaluated simultaneously. Results showed that the enzyme was able to phosphorylate several nucleosides and nucleoside analogs with the following efficiency: inosine and 2'-deoxyinosine > 2',3'-dideoxyinosine > 6-chloropurineriboside > 6-hydroxylaminepurine riboside > 2,6-diaminopurine riboside > adenosine > cytidine > deoxycoformycin > 2'-deoxyadenosine. This is the first report of deoxycoformycin phosphorylation catalyzed by a 5'-nucleotidase purified from eukaryotic cells. The optimum pH for nucleoside monophosphate hydrolysis was 6.5, slightly more acidic than the optimum pH for the transfer of the phosphate, which was 7.2. Finally, the presence of a suitable substrate for the phosphotransferase activity of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase caused a stimulation of the rate of formation of the nucleoside. The results suggest the requirements for phosphorylation of nucleoside analogs are a purine ring and the presence of an electronegative group in the 6-position. The stimulation of the rate of nucleoside monophosphate disappearance exerted by the phosphate acceptor suggests that the hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme intermediate is the rate-limiting step of the process.

AB Background and purpose: Among the agents employed to manage osteoarthritis, chondroitin sulphate (CS) is a natural glycosaminoglycan with an anti-inflammatory effect on joint cells. CS might also influence the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis. Our aim was to examine the effect of CS administration on vascular injury and on markers of systemic inflammation in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis aggravated by systemic inflammation provoked by chronic antigen-induced arthritis.
   Experimental approach: Atherosclerosis was induced in rabbits by maintaining them on a hyperlipidaemic diet after producing an endothelial lesion in the femoral arteries. Simultaneously, chronic arthritis was induced in these animals by repeated intraarticular injections of ovalbumin in previously immunized rabbits. A group of these rabbits were treated prophylactically with CS (100mgkg(-1) day(-1)) and when the animals were killed, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated. Furthermore, femoral arteries and thoracic aorta were used for gene expression studies and histological examination.
   Key results: CS administration reduced the concentration of the proinflammatory molecules C-reactive protein and IL-6 in serum. Likewise, CS inhibited the expression of CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in PBMC, and reduced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B. In the femoral lesion, CS also diminished the expression of CCL2 and COX-2, as well as the ratio of the intima/media thickness. Moreover, CS decreased the percentage of rabbits with atherosclerosis and chronic arthritis that developed vascular lesions in the aorta.
   Conclusions and implications: These findings suggest that CS treatment may to some extent impede the progression of atherosclerosis.

AB With the global rise in incidence of cancer and infectious diseases, there is a need for the development of techniques to diagnose, treat, and monitor these conditions. The ability to efficiently capture and isolate cells and other bio-molecules from peripheral whole blood for downstream analyses is a necessary requirement. Graphene oxide (GO) is an attractive template nanomaterial for such biosensing applications. Favorable properties include its two-dimensional architecture and wide range of functionalization chemistries, offering significant potential to tailor affinity toward aromatic functional groups expressed in biomolecules of interest. However, a limitation of current techniques is that as-synthesized GO nanosheets are used directly in sensing applications, and the benefits of their structural modification on the device performance have remained unexplored. Here, we report a microfluidic-free, sensitive, planar device on treated GO substrates to enable quick and efficient capture of Class-II MHC-positive cells from murine whole blood. We achieve this by using a mild thermal annealing treatment on the GO substrates, which drives a phase transformation through oxygen clustering. Using a combination of experimental observations and MD simulations, we demonstrate that this process leads to improved reactivity and density of functionalization of cell capture agents, resulting in an enhanced cell capture efficiency of 92 +/- 7% at room temperature, almost double the efficiency afforded by devices made using as-synthesized GO (54 +/- 3%). Our work highlights a scalable, cost-effective, general approach to improve the functionalization of GO, which creates diverse opportunities for various next-generation device applications.

ID RESPONSIVENESS
AB Phosphoflow cytometry is increasingly being used as a tool for the discovery of biomarkers used in the treatment and monitoring of disease and therapy. The ability to measure numerous phospho-protein targets simultaneously at a single cell level accurately and rapidly provides significant advantages over other methods. We here discuss important considerations required to successfully implement these methods. Three different blood collection tubes (lithium-heparin tubes, CPT with sodium citrate and CPT with sodium heparin) were evaluated, with PBMC isolated through lithium-heparin tubes/lymphoprep displaying reduced basal and increased stimulation induced phosphorylation compared to the other two methods. Further, we provide a protocol outlining an 8 color assay developed for the study of intracellular signaling in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The assay allows for the quantitative measurement of the phospho-proteins ERK1/2, NF-kappa B p65, Stan (Y701), Stat1 (S727), Stat3 (Y705), Stat3 (S727), Stat4 (Y693), p38 and Stat5 (Y694), as well as the identification of T cells, B cells, natural killer cells and monocytes. The assay additionally incorporates fluorescent cell barcoding, reducing assay costs and increasing throughput while increasing data robustness. Inter-assay precision was assessed over a month long period for all experimental variables (phospho-protein measured, cell type and stimulant). Coefficient of variations (CVs) calculated from process triplicates of normalized median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the phospho-proteins displayed median CVs under 10% when grouped according to cell type, stimulation agent and phospho-protein measured, while the CV for each triplicate did not exceed 20%.

DT Article
ID FLUID-DRIVEN FRACTURES; NETWORK PROPAGATION; NATURAL FRACTURE;
   CONDUCTIVITY; MECHANISM
AB Temporary-plugging fracturing (TPF) is becoming a promising technique for maximizing the stimulated-reservoir volume in tight reservoirs by injecting diverting agents to plug the preferred perforations and/or hydraulic fractures (HFs). Previous work has developed diverting agents and evaluated their blocking efficiency. However, the mechanism and dominant influence factors of HF growth during TPF remain poorly understood to date, which restricts the application of this technique. To understand the problem and help improve the TPF design, this study simulated the HF-propagation process during TPF in a naturally fractured formation using a previously developed 3D discrete-element-method (DEM)-based complex fracture model. Plugged fracture elements with negligible permeability were incorporated into the model to characterize the blocking intervals of diverting agents within HFs. Parameters, including horizontal differential stress (Delta sigma(h)), natural-fracture (NF) properties, the number of pluggings, plugging positions, and pumping rate, were investigated to determine their effects on the HF/NF-interaction behavior and the resulting HF geometry. The change in injection pressure before and after plugging under different conditions was also recorded in detail. Modeling results show that the HF/NF-interaction behavior might surprisingly change before and after plugging the preferred HF, ranging from HF crossing of NFs to HF opening of NFs. Notably, Delta sigma( )(h)is still the most influential geological parameter that governs the HF-growth behavior during TPF. For a moderate Delta sigma(h) (=8 MPa), the growth of a single planar HF before plugging can be changed easily into a complex HF network (HFN) through opening of NFs after plugging in the target stimulated region (TSR). In this case, the complexity and covering area of the resulting HFN is closely related to the NF density (positive correlation) and plugging positions. However, for a high Delta sigma(h) (=12 MPa), opening (usually partially) the NFs after plugging is difficult even in formations with a high density of NFs. In such a case, a large volume of fluid, a high pumping rate, and several repeat pluggings during TPF are necessary. The results of this study help to understand the HF-growth mechanism during TPF and help to optimize the treatment design of TPF and to adjust it in a timely manner.

AB Self-propelled bacteria can exhibit a large variety of non-equilibrium self-organized phenomena. Swarming is one such fascinating dynamical scenario where a number of motile individuals group into dynamical clusters and move in synchronized flows and vortices. While precedent investigations into rod-like particles confirm that an increased aspect-ratio promotes alignment and order, recent experimental studies in bacteria Bacillus subtilis show a non-monotonic dependence of the cell-aspect ratio on their swarming motion. Here, by computer simulations of an agent-based model of self-propelled, mechanically interacting, rod-shaped bacteria under overdamped conditions, we explore the collective dynamics of a bacterial swarm subjected to a variety of cell-aspect ratios. When modeled with an identical self-propulsion speed across a diverse range of cell aspect ratios, simulations demonstrate that both shorter and longer bacteria exhibit slow dynamics whereas the fastest speed is obtained at an intermediate aspect ratio. Our investigation highlights that the origin of this observed non-monotonic trend of bacterial speed and vorticity with the cell-aspect ratio is rooted in the cell-size dependence of motility force. The swarming features remain robust for a wide range of surface density of the cells, whereas asymmetry in friction attributes a distinct effect. Our analysis identifies that at an intermediate aspect ratio, an optimum cell size and motility force promote alignment, which reinforces the mechanical interactions among neighboring cells leading to the overall fastest motion. Mechanistic underpinning of the collective motions reveals that it is a joint venture of the short-range repulsive and the size-dependent motility forces, which determines the characteristics of swarming.

AB Antiarrhythmics are a group of drugs that manage the irregular electrical activity of the heart. Their use in the clinic is made difficult by their narrow therapeutic index. The disposition of antiarrhythmics is dependent on many factors, such as administration route, stereoselectivity in the first-pass effect, inhibition of enzymes, polymorphisms, etc. Consequently, the pharmacological activity of drugs may be interindividually variable.
   Experiments using organ homogenates or hepatic microsome fractions were used for simulating the biotransformation of the drug in vivo. The classical approaches, such as correlation analysis, specifically the inhibitory effect, or induction of chemicals, and immuno inhibition, may be combined with the use of recombinant enzymes for identifying the enzymes involved in the drug metabolism. The fate of the antiarrhythmics may also be investigated in live animals. A species-dependent metabolism was often observed. The pre-treatment with chemicals, which influences the change (inhibition or induction) in the drug disposition, may provide insights into the enzymes involved in vivo. However, published data indicated that the data obtained from animals should not be extrapolated directly to humans. Nevertheless, animal models are useful for investigating the mechanism of clinical observations.
   The clinical use of the antiarrhythmics becomes complex, when the drug metabolism is genetically/phenotypically dependent and active metabolites are formed. Furthermore, the stereoselectivity may also modify the disposition and the pharmacodynamic profile of a therapeutic agent. Only the knowledge of the drug metabolism and the status of each individual may allow the use of antiarrhythmics safely.

AB Understanding how anthropogenic disturbances affect plant-pollinator systems has important implications for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Previous laboratory studies show that pesticides and pathogens, which have been implicated in the rapid global decline of pollinators over recent years, can impair behavioral processes needed for pollinators to adaptively exploit floral resources and effectively transfer pollen among plants. However, the potential for these sublethal stressor effects on pollinator-plant interactions at the individual level to scale up into changes to the dynamics of wild plant and pollinator populations at the system level remains unclear. We developed an empirically parameterized agent-based model of a bumblebee pollination system called SimBee to test for effects of stressor-induced decreases in the memory capacity and information processing speed of individual foragers on bee abundance (scenario 1), plant diversity (scenario 2), and bee-plant system stability (scenario 3) over 20 virtual seasons. Modeling of a simple pollination network of a bumblebee and four co-flowering bee-pollinated plant species indicated that bee decline and plant species extinction events could occur when only 25% of the forager population showed cognitive impairment. Higher percentages of impairment caused 50% bee loss in just five virtual seasons and system-wide extinction events in less than 20 virtual seasons under some conditions. Plant species extinctions occurred regardless of bee population size, indicating that stressor-induced changes to pollinator behavior alone could drive species loss from plant communities. These findings indicate that sublethal stressor effects on pollinator behavioral mechanisms, although seemingly insignificant at the level of individuals, have the cumulative potential in principle to degrade plant-pollinator species interactions at the system level. Our work highlights the importance of an agent-based modeling approach for the identification and mitigation of anthropogenic impacts on plant-pollinator systems.

AB The ability of fish to swim upstream through regions of swiftly flowing water is ultimately dependent on their physiological capacity. Swimming performance, the relationship between swim speed and time-to-fatigue, has been used to design fishways and identify barriers to fish movement. However, existing numerical models do not all capture the variability in swimming abilities nor the turbulent, unsteady, and three-dimensional aspect of natural flows. This deficiency is particularly problematic for fish species whose behavior is poorly understood (i.e., invasive fish) and at sites with complex flow patterns. Here, we combine species-specific swimming performance with high resolution abstractions of fluid flow in a new agent-based framework to model fatigue of upstream swimming fish under turbulent flow conditions. Our model simulates fish paths, in the absence of information on their behavioral tendencies, based on a rules-set aimed at fish swimming as far upstream as possible before complete exhaustion by selecting the path of least fatigue. We demonstrate how this model functions by examining theoretical passage of invasive silver carp, Hypopthalmichthys molitrix, and bighead carp, H. nobilis, as well a native fish, the lake sturgeon, Acipenser fulvescens, through a typical Mississippi River lock-and-dam (Lock-and-Dam #8 near Genoa, WI). The model then tests whether passage could be reduced by altering spillway gate operations. Model results suggest that passage of all three species is low under current gate operations and that passage of both carp species could be further reduced by about half through minor changes in spillway gate operation without apparent impacts on navigation, scour, or lake sturgeon passage. Model results are qualitatively consistent with observed passage rates monitored by other studies at similar lock-and-dams and are consistent with the possibility that the model likely overestimates passage rates by relying on physiological data only. This approach could be exported to other applications and fish species to help manage and control fish migration and dispersal, especially for fish whose behavior and ecology are poorly understood and not presently quantifiable.

AB PurposeThis study aimed to quantitatively investigate two main magnetization transfer effects at low B-1: the nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) and amide proton transfer in the human brain at 7 T.
   MethodsThe magnetization transfer effects in the human brain were characterized using a four-pool proton model, which consisted of bulk water, macromolecules, an amide group of mobile proteins and peptides, and NOE-related protons resonating upfield. The pool sizes, exchange rates, and relaxation times of these proton pools were investigated quantitatively by fitting, and the net signals of amide proton transfer and NOE were simulated based on the fitted parameters.
   ResultsThe results showed that the four-pool model fitted the experimental data quite well, and the NOE effects in human brain at 7 T had a broad spectrum distribution. The NOE effects peaked at a B-1 of approximate to 1-1.4 T and were significantly stronger in the white matter than in the gray matter, corresponding to a pool-size ratio approximate to 2:1. As the amide proton transfer effect was relatively small compared with the NOE effects, magnetization transfer asymmetry analysis yielded an NOE-dominated contrast in the healthy human brain in this range of B-1.
   ConclusionThese findings are important to identify the source of NOE effects and to quantify amide proton transfer effects in human brain at 7 T. Magn Reson Med, 70:1070-1081, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB We advance the theory that the distribution of beliefs in the market is the most important propagation mechanism of economic volatility. Our model is based on the theory of Rational Beliefs (RB) and Rational Belief Equilibrium (RBE) developed by Kurz (1994, 1997). We argue that the diverse market puzzles which are examined, such as the equity premium puzzle, are all driven by the structure of market expectations. In support of our view, we present an RBE model with which we study financial markets. The model is able to simulate the correct order of magnitude of: (i) the long term mean and standard deviation of the price\dividend ratio: (ii) the long term mean and standard deviation of the risky rate of return on equities; (iii) the long term mean and standard deviation of the riskless rate, (iv) the long term mean equity premium. In addition, the model predicts (v) the GARCH property of risky asset returns: (vi) the observed pattern of the predictability of long returns on assets, and (vii) the Forward Discount Bias in foreign exchange markets.
   The common economic explanation for these phenomena is the existence of heterogenous agents with diverse but correlated beliefs such that some agents are optimistic and some pessimistic about future capital gains. The model has a unique parameterization under which the model makes all the above predictions simultaneously. The parameterization requires the optimists to be in the majority but the rationality of belief conditions: of the RBE require the pessimists to have a higher intensity level. In simple terms, the large equity premium and the low equilibrium riskless rate are the result of the fact that at any moment of time there are agents who hold extreme pessimistic beliefs and they have a relatively stronger impact on the market. The paper also studies the effect of correlation of beliefs among investors. it shows that the main effect of such correlation is on the dynamic patterns of asset prices and returns and is hence important for studying such phenomena as stochastic volatility.

AB To survive, animals have to quickly modify their behaviour when the reward changes. The internal representations responsible for this are updated through synaptic weight changes, mediated by certain neuromodulators conveying feedback from the environment. In previous experiments, we discovered a form of hippocampal Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) that is sequentially modulated by acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine facilitates synaptic depression, while dopamine retroactively converts the depression into potentiation. When these experimental findings were implemented as a learning rule in a computational model, our simulations showed that cholinergic-facilitated depression is important for reversal learning. In the present study, we tested the model's prediction by optogenetically inactivating cholinergic neurons in mice during a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task with changing rewards. We found that reversal learning, but not initial place learning, was impaired, verifying our computational prediction that acetylcholine-modulated plasticity promotes the unlearning of old reward locations. Further, differences in neuromodulator concentrations in the model captured mouse-by-mouse performance variability in the optogenetic experiments. Our line of work sheds light on how neuromodulators enable the learning of new contingencies.
   Author summary Reversal learning likely involves changes in synaptic connections, a neural mechanism known as synaptic plasticity, so old information can be updated. We previously discovered that acetylcholine, an important neuromodulator in the brain, changes synaptic connections in a way that favours reversal learning. Specifically, acetylcholine weakens active synapses in brain slices, but these synapses can later be strengthened by a reward signal. Based on this result in slices, we used a computational model to propose a behavioural function for the action of acetylcholine on synaptic connections. In the model, acetylcholine would weaken synaptic connections associated with an old reward, allowing an agent to quickly learn a new reward location. We tested this hypothesis here by silencing acetylcholine neurons in mice while they navigated a maze for food rewards. These animals were able to learn the location of the first food reward, but were impaired when the reward was shifted to a new location. The behavioural results of this study suggest that acetylcholine indeed facilitates reversal learning, which the computational model attributes to a weakening of synaptic connections that do not lead to reward. Taken together, our experimental and computational work show how synaptic strength changes, gated by neuromodulators, affect learning behaviour.

AB Engineered nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment can act both as contaminants, when they are unintentionally released, and as remediation agents when injected on purpose at contaminated sites. In this work two carbon based NPs are considered, namely CARBO-IRON, a new material developed for contaminated site remediation, and single layer graphene oxide (SLGO), a potential contaminant of the next future. Understanding and modeling the transport and deposition of such NPs in aquifer systems is a key aspect in both cases, and numerical models capable to simulate NP transport in groundwater in complex 3D scenarios are necessary. To this aim, this work proposes a modeling approach based on modified advection-dispersion-deposition equations accounting for the coupled influence of flow velocity and ionic strength on particle transport. A new modeling tool (MNM3D - Micro and Nanoparticle transport Model in 3D geometries) is presented for the simulation of NPs injection and transport in 3D scenarios. MNM3D is the result of the integration of the numerical code MNMs (Micro and Nanoparticle transport, filtration and clogging Model - Suite) in the well-known transport model RT3D (Clement et al., 1998). The injection in field-like conditions of CARBO-IRON (R) (20 g/I) amended by CMC (4 g/I) in a 2D vertical tank (0.7 x 1.0 x 0.12 m) was simulated using MNM3D, and compared to experimental results under the same conditions. Column transport tests of SLGO at a concentration (10 mg/I) representative of a possible spill of SLGO-containing waste water were performed at different values of ionic strength (0.1 to 35 mM), evidencing a strong dependence of SLGO transport on IS, and a reversible blocking deposition. The experimental data were fitted using the numerical code MNMs and the ionic strength-dependent transport was up-scaled for a full scale 3D simulation of SLGO release and long-term transport in a heterogeneous aquifer. MNM3D showed to potentially represent a valid tool for the prediction of the long-term behavior of engineered nanoparticles released in the environment (e.g. from landfills), and the preliminary design of in situ aquifer remediation through injection of suspensions of reactive NPs.

AB Between 1990 and 2002, more than 200 moose-vehicle collisions occurred each year in Quebec, including about 50/yr in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve. One cause is the presence of roadside salt pools that attract moose near roads in the spring and summer. Using the computer simulation technique of agent-based modeling, this study investigated whether salt pool removal and displacement, i.e., a compensatory salt pool set up 100 to 1500 m away from the road shoulder, would reduce the number of moose-vehicle collisions. Moose road crossings were used as a proxy measure. A GPS telemetry data set consisting of approximately 200,000 locations of 47 moose over 2 yr in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve was used as an empirical basis for the model. Twelve moose were selected from this data set and programmed in the model to forage and travel in the study area. Five parameters with an additional application of stochasticity were used to determine moose movement between forest polygons. These included food quality; cover quality, i.e., protection from predators and thermal stress; proximity to salt pools; proximity to water; and slope. There was a significant reduction in road crossings when either all or two thirds of the roadside salt pools were removed, with and/or without salt pool displacement. With 100% salt pool removal, the reduction was greater (49%) without compensatory salt pools than with them (18%). When two thirds of the salt pools were removed, the reduction was the same with and without compensatory salt pools (16%). Although moose-vehicle collisions are not a significant mortality factor for the moose population in the Laurentides Wildlife Reserve, in areas with higher road densities, hunting pressure, and/or predator densities it could mean the difference between a stable and a declining population, and salt pool removal could be part of a good mitigation plan to halt population declines. This model can be used, with improvements such as spatial memory of salt pool locations and the addition of a road avoidance behavior, to assess the effectiveness of mitigation measures intended to reduce moose-vehicle collisions.

AB Because of their chemical similarity to the mineral phase of bone and teeth, calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) are extensively investigated for applications in biomedicine. Nevertheless, their applicability in load-bearing anatomical sites is restricted by their brittleness. Reinforcement of calcium phosphate cements with polymeric fibers can overcome this mechanical limitation provided that the affinity between these fibers and the surrounding matrix is optimal. To date, the effects of the fiber-matrix affinity on the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced calcium phosphate cements are still poorly understood. The goal of this study is therefore to investigate the interfacial properties and bond-slip response between the CPC matrix and polymeric fibers. To this end, we selected poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) fibers as reinforcing agents because of their high strength and stiffness and their effective reinforcement of cementitious matrices. Micromechanical pull-out experiments were combined with numerical simulations based on an dedicated constitutive interfacial law to characterize the interfacial properties of PVA fibers embedded in a CPC matrix at the single fiber pull-out level. The computational model developed herein is able to predict all three main phases of pull-out response, i.e. the elastic, debonding and frictional pull-out phases. The resulting interfacial constitutive law is validated experimentally and predicts the pull-out response of fibers with different diameters and embedded lengths.
   Statements of Significance
   To date, the effects of the fiber-matrix affinity on the mechanical properties of fiber-reinforced calcium phosphate cements are still poorly understood. In this study, we present a novel experimental protocol to investigate the affinity between poly (vinyl alcohol) PVA fibers and the calcium phosphate cement (CPC) matrix by means of single-fiber pull out tests. We determine the critical embedded length for PVA fibers with two different diameters; and we design a numerical FE model including a distinct representation of fiber, matrix and interface with a predictive interfacial constitutive law which is capable of capturing all three main phases of single-fiber pull-out, i.e. elastic, debonding and frictional stages. The resulting interfacial constitutive law is validated experimentally and predicts the pull-out response of fibers with different diameters and embedded lengths. (C) 2019 Acta Materialia Inc.

AB Health risks from galactic cosmic rays (GCR) in space travel above low earth orbit remain a concern. For many years accelerator experiments investigating space radiation induced prevalence of murine Harderian gland (HG) tumorigenesis have been performed to help estimate GCR risks. Most studies used acute, relatively low fluence, exposures. Results on a broad spectrum of individual ions and linear energy transfers (LETs) have become available. However, in space, the crew are exposed simultaneously to many different GCR. Recent upgrades at the Brookhaven NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) now allow mixtures in the form of different one-ion beams delivered in rapid sequence. This paper uses the results of three two-ion mixture experiments to illustrate conceptual, mathematical, computational, and statistical aspects of synergy analyses and also acts as an interim report on the mixture experiments' results. The results were interpreted using the following: (a) accumulated data from HG one-ion accelerator experiments; (b) incremental effect additivity synergy theory rather than simple effect additivity synergy theory; (c) parsimonious models for one-ion dose-effect relations; and (d), computer-implemented numerical methods encapsulated in freely available open source customized software. The main conclusions are the following. As yet, the murine HG tumorigenesis experimental studies show synergy in only one case out of three. Moreover, some theoretical arguments suggest GCR-simulating mixed beams are not likely to be synergistic. However, more studies relevant to possible synergy are needed by various groups that are studying various endpoints. Especially important is the possibility of synergy among high-LET radiations, since individual high-LET ions have large relative biological effectiveness for many endpoints.

AB In the automatic imitation task (AIT) participants make a cued response during simultaneous exposure to a congruent or incongruent action made by another agent. Participants are slower to make the cued response on incongruent trials, which is thought to reflect conflict between the motor representation activated by the cue and the motor representation activated by the observed action. On incongruent trials, good performance requires the capacity to suppress the imitative action, in favor of producing the cued response. Here, we introduce a new experimental paradigm that complements the AIT, and is therefore a useful task for studying the control of self and other activated representations. In what we term the "Controlled Imitation Task (CIT)", participants are cued to make an action, but on 50% of trials, within 100 ms of this cue, an on-screen hand makes a congruent or incongruent action. If the onscreen hand moves, the participant must suppress the cued response, and instead imitate the observed action as quickly and accurately as possible. In direct contrast to the AIT, the CIT requires suppression of a self-activated motor representation, and prioritization of an imitative response. In experiment 1, we report a robust pattern of interference effects in the CIT, such that participants are slower to make the imitative response on incongruent compared to congruent trials. In experiment 2, we replicate this effect while including a non-imitative spatial-cue control condition to show that the effect is particularly robust for imitative response tendencies per se. Owing to the essentially opposite control requirements of the CIT versus the AIT (i.e., suppression of self-activated motor representations instead of suppression of other-activated motor representations), we propose that this new task is a potentially informative complementary paradigmto the AIT that can be used in studies of self-other control processes.

TI Could Mesophases Play a Role in the Nucleation and Polymorph Selection

AB Zeolites and mesoporous silicas are porous materials with important applications in catalysis, gas storage, and separation. Zeolite crystals form in the presence of cationic surfactants that act as structure directing agents (SDAs). The way SDAs control the nucleation and polymorphs selection in zeolites is not fully understood. The formation of mesoporous silica is templated by liquid crystalline mesophases that result from frustrated attraction between silicates and long-chain SDAs. Experiments indicate that surfactants CnH2n+1(CH3)(3)N+ with n > 6 yield mesoporous silicas, and the one with n = 6 produces a zeolite. This suggests that the driving force toward mesophase formation is also present for small organocations, but is overcome by the ability of silica to wrap a crystal lattice around them. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate whether the existence of metastable mesophases can play a role in the nucleation and polymorph selection of zeolitic crystals. As a proof of concept, we investigate the phase behavior of simple mesogenic mixtures of SDAs and a network former T that favors tetracoordinated crystals. We represent the network-former T by Stillinger-Weber models of water and silicon, in lieu of silica, because a computationally efficient silica potential that would allow for the spontaneous nucleation of zeolites in molecular dynamics simulations is not yet available. The mixtures of T and SDA produce a rich phase diagram that encompasses the sII clathrate and at least six zeolites, including sigma-2 (SGT). We find that the nucleation of SGT is not assisted by a mesophase. The nucleation of the other five zeolites of this study, however, is facilitated by the existence of metastable mesophases that decrease the nucleation barriers and direct the selection of the crystal polymorph. Together with the experimental support for mesophases in mixtures of silicates and SDAs, our results for model systems suggest that metastable mesophases could play a prominent role in promoting the nucleation and polymorph selection of some zeolites.

AB Solubilizing agents are widely used to extract poorly soluble compounds from biological matrices. Aqueous solutions of surfactants and hydrotropes are commonly used as solubilizers, however, the underlying mechanism that determines their action is still roughly understood. Among these, ionic liquids (IL) are often used not only for solubilization of a target compound but in liquid-liquid extraction processes. Molecular dynamics simulations can shed light into this issue by providing a microscopic insight of the interactions between solute and solubilising agents. In this work, a new coarse-grained (CG) model was developed under the MARTINI framework for gallic acid (GA) while the CG models of three quaternary ammonium ionic liquids and salts (QAILS) were obtained from literature. Three QAILS were selected bearing in mind their potential solubilising mechanisms: trimethyl-tetradecylammonium chloride ([N-1,N-1,N-1,N-14]Cl) as a surfactant, tetrabutylammonium chloride ([N-4,N-4,N-4,N-4]Cl) as a hydrotrope, and tributyl-tetradecylammonium chloride ([N-4,N-4,N-4,N-14]Cl) as a system combining the characteristics of the other compounds. Throughout this hydrotrope-to-surfactant spectrum and considering the most prevalent GA species across the pH range, the solvation of GA at two concentration levels in aqueous QAILS solutions were studied and discussed. The results of this study indicate that dispersive interactions between the QAILS and GA are generally the driving force in the GA solubilization. However, electrostatic interactions play an increasingly significant role as the GA becomes deprotonated, affecting their placement within the micelle and ultimately the solvation mechanism. The hydrotropic mechanism seen in [N-4,N-4,N-4,N-4]Cl corroborates recent models based on the formation of a hydrotrope-solute aggregates driven by dispersive forces. This work contributes to the application of a transferable approach to partition and solubilization studies using molecular dynamics, which could complement experimental assays and quickly screen molecular candidates for these processes.

AB The capacity of pluripotent embryonic stem cells to differentiate into any cell type in the body makes them invaluable in the field of regenerative medicine. However, because of the complexity of both the core pluripotency network and the process of cell fate computation it is not yet possible to control the fate of stem cells. We present a theoretical model of stem cell fate computation that is based on Halley and Winkler's Branching Process Theory (BPT) and on Greaves et al.'s agent-based computer simulation derived from that theoretical model. BPT abstracts the complex production and action of a Transcription Factor (TF) into a single critical branching process that may dissipate, maintain, or become supercritical. Here we take the single TF model and extend it to multiple interacting TFs, and build an agent-based simulation of multiple TFs to investigate the dynamics of such coupled systems. We have developed the simulation and the theoretical model together, in an iterative manner, with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of stem cell fate computation, in order to influence experimental efforts, which may in turn influence the outcome of cellular differentiation. The model used is an example of self-organization and could be more widely applicable to the modelling of other complex systems. The simulation based on this model, though currently limited in scope in terms of the biology it represents, supports the utility of the Halley and Winkler branching process model in describing the behaviour of stem cell gene regulatory networks. Our simulation demonstrates three key features: (i) the existence of a critical value of the branching process parameter, dependent on the details of the cistrome in question; (ii) the ability of an active cistrome to "ignite" an otherwise fully dissipated cistrome, and drive it to criticality; (iii) how coupling cistromes together can reduce their critical branching parameter values needed to drive them to criticality.

AB As proven from field practices in North America and Northwest China, temporary plugging and diverting acid fracturing is an indispensable technology to enhance stimulation effect and hydrocarbon production of complex carbonate reservoirs. It's well-known that the key to the success of this technology lies in creating a temporary plugging within the previously created fractures. Consequently, many scholars have conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the plugging behavior of fibers and particulates. However, the current devices nearly have certain limitations in simulating temporary plugging experiments. Aiming at this problem, this paper introduced the fracture temporary plugging evaluation system with large fracture size, and high-pressure resistance, which can meet the requirement of temporary plugging experiment. In addition, 3D printing technology was used to reproduce the roughness of acid-etched fracture surface, improving the experimental accuracy. Based on the device, a series of experiments were performed to study the effect of carrier fluids type, the injection rate, the fracture width, and the fracture morphology on plugging behavior of fibers and particulates. Experimental results show that the plugging effect of HPG fracturing fluid is better than that of slick water. Moreover, the effect of temporary plugging deteriorates with the decrease of injection rate, which can be attributed to the fact that high injection rate increases the probability of bridging and plugging. When it comes to the fracture width, only fibers have favorable plugging effect under the condition of 2 mm fracture width. However, a single type of temporary plugging agent (only fibers or particulates) cannot achieve effective plugging under the condition of 4 mm fracture width. The combination of fibers and particulates can obtain favorable plugging effect. When the fracture width increases to 6 mm, it's difficult to obtain favorable plugging effect if the diameter of particulates is less than 50% of fracture width. Hence, it is recommended to add big particulates whose diameters are at least 50% of the fracture width to improve the plugging effect. Moreover, the fracture surface morphology affects the formation time of temporary plugging, but does not affect whether temporary plugging is formed or not. This study deepens the understanding the plugging behavior of fibers and particulates within acid-etched fracture and provides fundamental for field treatment design.

AB Over the last years the important role of nitric oxide (NO) as endogenous modulator of numerous physiological functions has been shown. NO is involved in the regulation of blood flow, maintenance of vascular tone, control of platelet aggregation, and modulation of the activity of the mastocytes. It also plays a key role as neurotransmitter in the central and peripheric nervous system (non adrenergic non colinergic, NANC, neurons), in the nervous control of the cerebral blood flow and in the neuroendocrine regulation or synaptic plasticity. However, NO shows a dual behavior: at physiological concentrations, released through the constitutive synthase (cNOS), it regulates house-keeping functions, whereas its overproduction by the inducible isoenzyme (iNOS) exhibits cytotoxic activity because interacting with reactive species producing peroxinitrites (ONOO.) and other compounds, which are highly damaging for the tissues.
   In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) NO participates in the modulation of the smooth musculature tone, such as the regulation of intestinal peristaltism, gastric emptying and antral motor activity. It also regulates acid and gastric mucus secretion, alkaline production, and is involved in the maintenance of mucosal blood flow. In physiological conditions, NO acts as an endogenous mediator modulating both, the repairing and integrity of the tissues, and exhibits gastroprotective properties against different types of aggressive agents. However, high concentrations of NO are related to numerous pathological processes of GIT including peptic ulcer, chronic gastritis, gastrointestinal cancer, bacterial gastroenteritis, celiac or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. Recently, this hypothesis that cNOS is always beneficial and iNOS is always deleterious, has been questioned, since that a series of data suggest that the increase of cNOS activity could be responsible for the derived pathological changes and, by contrast, NO liberated by the inducible isoenzyme might play a repairing effect in certain pathological disorders.
   The pharamceutical industry is really interested in proving the clinical benefits of the mediator. Numerous NO-donor drugs, nitrite derivatives, have been frequently used in the cardiovascular diseases due to their vasodilating properties, which allow an enhancement of coronary blood flow. More recently, the protective effect of NO against non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID)-gastroenteropathy has been shown, because its vasodilating and antioxidant properties render it a potentially useful agent. Different NSAID, including acetyl salicylic acid, diclofenac or naproxen, have been formulated by attaching a NO releasing-moiety. These NO-NSAID, antiinflammatories combined with precursors of the mediator, or with inhibitors of the inducible synthase, are currently being evaluated. However, although the pharmacotherapeutical possibilities of NO are considerable, it is necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms derived from simulation/inhibition of the isoenzymes in order to determine the clinical utility of NO-donors.

ID ORIGIN; AGENT
AB Explosive volcanic eruptions can release vast quantities of pyroclastic material into Earth's atmosphere, including volcanic ash, particles with diameters less than two millimeters. Ash particles can cluster together to form aggregates, in some cases reaching up to several centimeters in size. Aggregation alters ash transport and settling behavior compared to un-aggregated particles, influencing ash distribution and deposit stratigraphy. Accretionary lapilli, the most commonly preserved type of aggregates within the geologic record, can exhibit complex internal stratigraphy. The processes involved in the formation and preservation of these aggregates remain poorly constrained quantitatively. In this study, we simulate the variable gas-particle flow conditions which may be encountered within eruption plumes and pyroclastic density currents via laboratory experiments using the ProCell Lab System (R) of Glatt Ingenieurtechnik GmbH. In this apparatus, solid particles are set into motion in a fluidized bed over a range of well-controlled boundary conditions (particle concentration, air flow rate, gas temperature, humidity, liquid composition). Experiments were conducted with soda-lime glass beads and natural volcanic ash particles under a range of experimental conditions. Both glass beads and volcanic ash exhibited the capacity for aggregation, but stable aggregates could only be produced when materials were coated with high but volcanically-relevant concentrations of NaCl. The growth and structure of aggregates was dependent on the initial granulometry, while the rate of aggregate formation increased exponentially with increasing relative humidity (12-45% RH), before overwetting promoted mud droplet formation, Notably, by use of a broad granulometry, we generated spherical, internally structured aggregates similar to some accretionary pellets found in volcanic deposits. Adaptation of a powder-technology model offers an explanation for the origin of natural accretionary pellets, suggesting them to be the result of a particular granulometry and fast-acting selective aggregation processes. For such aggregates to survive deposition and be preserved in the deposits of eruption plumes and pyroclastic density currents likely requires a significant pre-existing salt load on ash surfaces, and rapid aggregate drying prior to deposition or interaction with a more energetic environment. Our results carry clear benefits for future efforts to parameterize models of ash transport and deposition in the field. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Cysteine protease is known to degrade amyloid beta peptide which is a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease. This cleavage mechanism has not been studied in detail at the atomic level. Hence, a three-dimensional structure of cysteine protease from Xanthomonas campestris was constructed by homology modeling using Geno3D, SWISS-MODEL, and MODELLER 9v7. All the predicted models were analyzed by PROCHECK and PROSA. Three-dimensional model of cysteine protease built by MODELLER 9v7 shows similarity with human cathepsin B crystal structure. This model was then used further for docking and simulation studies. The molecular docking study revealed that Cys17, His87, and Gln88 residues of cysteine protease form an active site pocket similar to human cathepsin B. Then the docked complex was refined by molecular dynamic simulation to confirm its stable behavior over the entire simulation period. The molecular docking and MD simulation studies showed that the sulffiydryl hydrogen atom of Cys17 of cysteine protease interacts with carboxylic oxygen of Lys16 of A beta peptide indicating the cleavage site. Thus, the cysteine protease model from X. campestris having similarity with human cathepsin B crystal structure may be used as an alternate approach to cleave A beta peptide a causative agent of Alzheimer's disease.

We analyze properties of the macroscopic model in the stationary case and study the behavior of the slime mold between food sources. The efficient numerical simulation of the aggregation-diffusion equation allows for a detailed analysis of the interplay between the different regimes drift, interaction and diffusion.

AB Increasing alcohol outlet density is well-documented to be associated with increased alcohol use and problems, leading to the policy recommendation that limiting outlet density will decrease alcohol problems. Yet few studies of decreasing problematic outlets and outlet density have been conducted. We estimated the association between closing alcohol outlets and alcohol use and alcohol-related violence, using an agent-based model of the adult population in New York City. The model was calibrated according to the empirical distribution of the parameters across the city's population, including the density of on- and off-premise alcohol outlets. Interventions capped the alcohol outlet distribution at the 90th to the 50th percentiles of the New York City density, and closed 5% to 25% of outlets with the highest levels of violence. Capping density led to a lower population of light drinkers (42.2% at baseline vs. 38.1% at the 50th percentile), while heavy drinking increased slightly (12.0% at baseline vs. 12.5% at the 50th percentile). Alcohol-related homicides and nonfatal violence remained unchanged. Closing the most violent outlets was not associated with changes in alcohol use or related problems. Results suggest that focusing solely on closing alcohol outlets might not be an effective strategy to reduce alcohol-related problems.

ID MARKET
AB The influence of the behavior and strategies of traders on stock price formation has attracted much interest. It is assumed that there is a positive correlation between the total net demand and the price change. A buy order is expected to increase the price, whereas a sell order is assumed to decrease it. We perform data analysis based on a recently proposed stochastic model for stock prices. The model involves long-range dependence, self-similarity, and no arbitrage principle, as observed in real data. The arrival times of orders, their quantity, and their duration are created by a Poisson random measure. The aggregation of the effect of all orders based on these parameters yields the log-price process. By scaling the parameters, a fractional Brownian motion or a stable Levy process can be obtained in the limit. In this paper, our aim is twofold; first, to devise statistical methodology to estimate the model parameters with an application on high-frequency price data, and second, to validate the model by simulations with the estimated parameters. We find that the statistical properties of agent level behavior are reflected on the stock price, and can affect the entire process. Moreover, the price model is suitable for prediction through simulations when the parameters are estimated from real data. The methods developed in the present paper can be applied to frequently traded stocks in general. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Purpose: To characterize and optimize F-19 MRI for different perfluorocarbons (PFCs) at 3T and quantify the loss of acquisition efficiency as a function of different temperature and cellular conditions.
   Methods: The T-1 and T-2 relaxation times of the commonly used PFCs perfluoropolyether (PFPE), perfluoro-15-crown-5-ether (PFCE), and perfluorooctyl bromide (PFOB) were measured in phantoms and in several different conditions (cell types, presence of fixation agent, and temperatures). These relaxation times were used to optimize pulse sequences through numerical simulations. The acquisition efficiency in each cellular condition was then determined as the ratio of the signal after optimization with the reference relaxation times and after optimization with its proper relaxation times. Finally, PFC detection limits were determined.
   Results: The loss of acquisition efficiency due to parameter settings optimized for the wrong temperature and cellular condition was limited to 13%. The detection limits of all PFCs were lower at 24 degrees C than at 37(degrees)C and varied from 11.8 +/- 63.0 mM for PFCE at 24 degrees C to 379.9 +/- 651.8 mM for PFOB at 37 degrees C.
   Conclusion: Optimizing F-19 pulse sequences with a known phantom only leads to moderate loss in acquisition efficiency in cellular conditions that might be encountered in in vivo and in vitro experiments. (C) 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

AB For the failure mechanism of the anchor cable lags behind the demand for theoretical models, Abaqus technique was used to analyze the anchoring performances of the grouted anchor under the conditions of free and non-free rotating. The tension-torsion coupling characteristics and the progressive failure mechanism of the anchorage segment were studied during the pull-out test. The torsion response of the anchorage segment and the internal horizontal and vertical strain changes in the anchoring concrete were also analyzed. Results show that the proposed calculation model of the anchor cable is verified. With the increase of the pulling-out displacement, the load response of the anchored section is gradually transferred from the inside to the outside. The anchoring stress in the concrete undergoes the evolution process of rod shape-bell shape-aquarium shape-spear shape. As an intermediate transition layer, the anchoring agent will break before the concrete and at the same time play a buffering effect. Under the action of tension-torsion coupling, the anchoring agent is prone to tensile-shear composite failure. There are two different ways of transmitting force for the grouted anchor under rotating and nonrotating conditions, and the anchoring force of the anchor cable will be reduced in the state of free rotation. The obtained conclusions can provide a reference for the similar anchoring practice.

AB By increasing the spinning reserve capacity, reliability of the power system is improved, however, total cost is increased. Therefore to supply the spinning reserve of power system, a compromise between reliability and cost should be considered. In this study, by considering the value of lost load for each important customer, the spinning reserve capacity is determined based on minimisation of total cost of problem. In addition, to supply the spinning reserve of power system, a new market player called plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) aggregator is proposed. In this base, the aggregator's self-scheduling problem for participating in spinning reserve market is modelled using an agent-based model and behaviour of the PEVs fleet is modelled from the aggregator's point of view. To improve the accuracy of results, the market players are considered as price makers and their offers to the market are modelled using a dynamic game theory simulation. The numerical results show that the presence of PEVs aggregator in spinning reserve market has desired impacts on power system reliability and total cost of system.

In this work, a new model is proposed to describe the complicated rheological behaviors in an encapsulating shell of UCA microbubbles by applying the nonlinear 'Cross law' to the shell viscous term in the Marmottant model. The proposed new model was verified by fitting the dynamic responses of UCAs measured with either a highspeed optical imaging system or a light scattering system. The comparison results between the measured radius-time curves and the numerical simulations demonstrate that the 'compression-only' behavior of UCAs can be successfully simulated with the new model. Then, the shell elastic and viscous coefficients of SonoVue microbubbles were evaluated based on the new model simulations, and compared to the results obtained from some existing UCA models. The results confirm the capability of the current model for reducing the dependence of bubble shell parameters on the initial bubble radius, which indicates that the current model might be more comprehensive to describe the complex rheological nature (e. g., 'shear-thinning' and 'strain-softening') in encapsulating shells of UCA microbubbles by taking into account the nonlinear changes of both shell elasticity and shell viscosity.

TI Active Vision for Robot Manipulators Using the Free Energy Principle

LA English
DT Article
DE active vision; active inference; deep learning; generative modeling;
   robotics
AB Occlusions, restricted field of view and limited resolution all constrain a robot's ability to sense its environment from a single observation. In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.

AB Background
   Incarceration and HIV disproportionately impact African American communities. The mass incarceration of African American men is hypothesized to increase HIV acquisition risk for African American women. Interventions optimizing HIV care engagement and minimizing sexual risk behaviors for men living with HIV post-incarceration may decrease HIV incidence.
   Methods
   Using an agent-based model, we simulated a sexual and injection drug using network representing the African American population of Philadelphia. We compared intervention strategies for men living with HIV post-incarceration by the number of averted HIV transmissions to women within the community. Three interventions were evaluated: a 90-90-90 scenario scaling up HIV testing, ART provision, and ART adherence; a behavioral intervention decreasing sexual risk behaviors; and a combination intervention involving both.
   Results
   The status quo scenario projected 2,836 HIV transmissions to women over twenty years. HIV transmissions to women decreased by 29% with the 90-90-90 intervention, 23% with the behavioral intervention, and 37% with both. The number of men living with HIV receiving the intervention needed in order to prevent a single HIV transmission ranged between 6 and 10.
   Conclusion
   Interventions to improve care engagement and decrease sexual risk behaviors post-incarceration for men living with HIV have the potential to decrease HIV incidence within African American heterosexual networks.

ID DYNAMICS; PATTERNS; FLOWS
AB Based on the results of a large-scale survey, we construct an agent-based network model for the China independent inbound tourism system and, by the approach of numerical simulation, investigate the responses of the tourist behaviors to perturbations in different scenarios, including the closure of a tourism city, the opening of a new port city in western China, and the increase of the tourism attractiveness of a specific city. Numerical results show that: (1) the closure of a single city in general will affect the tourist visitations of many other cities and, comparing to the non-port cities, the overall visitation volume of the system is more influenced by closing a port city; (2) the opening of a new port city in western China will attract more tourists to the western cities, but has a negligible impact on either the overall visitation volume or the imbalanced tourist distribution; and (3) the increase of the tourism attractiveness of a non-port (port) city normally increases (decreases) the overall visitation volume, yet there are exceptions due to the spillover effect. Furthermore, by increasing the tourism attractiveness of a few cities simultaneously, we investigate also the strategy of multiple-city-upgrade in tourism development. We find that the overall tourist volume is better improved by upgrading important non-port cities that are geographically distant from each other. The study reveals the rich dynamic inherent in complex tourism network, and the findings could be helpful to the development and management of China inbound tourism.

AB A coupled analysis of agent behavior and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model is applied to investigate the fire evacuation effectiveness in a popular metro station in Guangzhou, China. Due to the high density and complexity of traffic, the concept of Required Safe Escape Time and Available Safe Escape Time (RSET/ASET), which is more flexible and adaptable than the "6 minutes" principle, is applied in the safety assessment of fire evacuation. To pursue a stable simulation of the coupled model, the standard Critical Radiant Flux is used to deter the tenability criteria for exposure to fire and heat. Various related factors, including the fire location, the Heat Release Rate (HRR) of fire, the crowd density, and the operation mode of escalators, are analyzed through a series of simulations. Results indicate that the interaction between fire and humans should not be neglected in the evacuation simulation. Both the fire location and the crowd density have a significant effect on the evacuation, while the HRR of fire has a minor impact. When the accident happens at the entrance of an escalator, RSET is 58.3% longer than that when the accident occurs in the middle of the platform. RSET grows with the increase of the crowd density linearly. Besides, the evacuation efficiency could be partly improved by changing escalators that usually operate in the descending mode into ascending mode.

ID MOTOR IMAGERY; PARIETAL; HANDS; FMRI; AREA; REPRESENTATION; EXPECTATION;
   SIMULATION; MOVEMENTS; INFERENCE
AB Recent studies have highlighted cognitive and neural similarities between planning and perceiving actions. Given that action planning involves a simulation of potential action plans that depends on the actor's body posture, we reasoned that perceiving actions may also be influenced by one's body posture. Here, we test whether and how this influence occurs by measuring behavioral and cerebral (fMRI) responses in human participants predicting goals of observed actions, while manipulating postural congruency between their own body posture and postures of the observed agents. Behaviorally, predicting action goals is facilitated when the body posture of the observer matches the posture achieved by the observed agent at the end of his action (action's goal posture). Cerebrally, this perceptual postural congruency effect modulates activity in a portion of the left intraparietal sulcus that has previously been shown to be involved in updating neural representations of one's own limb posture during action planning. This intraparietal area showed stronger responses when the goal posture of the observed action did not match the current body posture of the observer. These results add two novel elements to the notion that perceiving actions relies on the same predictive mechanism as planning actions. First, the predictions implemented by this mechanism are based on the current physical configuration of the body. Second, during both action planning and action observation, these predictions pertain to the goal state of the action.

DE freshwater sustainability; commercial water consumption; intermittent

AB The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is confronted with a severe freshwater crisis shaped by excess water demand and intermittent public supply. In Jordan's capital and most populous city, Amman, the pervasive water shortage gave rise to private tanker water operations, which transport groundwater from wells in the vicinity of the city and sell it to urban consumers. These tanker water markets have received little attention in the literature up to date, particularly with regard to their relevance for commercial water users. This paper aims to empirically estimate the water demand of commercial establishments in Amman under public supply rationing and to assess to which extent tanker operations contribute to meeting commercial water needs. Building on a prior simulation model of residential water consumption, the results of three extensive surveys concerned with tanker water markets and various geographic data, we develop a spatial agent-based model of the water consumption behavior of commercial establishments in different sizes. According to our estimation, 35-45% of the overall water volume consumed by the commercial sector stems from tanker operations, depending on the season. We find that the local disparities in access to affordable network water, along with the dispersion of groundwater wells around the city, result in considerable spatial differences in tanker water consumption. The outcome of this analysis could be relevant for policy attempting to enhance freshwater sustainability in Jordan.

AB Animal learning is driven not only by biological needs but also by intrinsic motivations (IMs) serving the acquisition of knowledge. Computational modeling involving IMs is indicating that learning of motor skills requires that autonomous agents self-generate tasks/goals and use them to acquire skills solving/leading to them. We propose a neural architecture driven by IMs that is able to self-generate goals on the basis of the environmental changes caused by the agent's actions. The main novelties of the model are that it is focused on the acquisition of attention (looking) skills and that its architecture and functioning are broadly inspired by the functioning of relevant primate brain areas (superior colliculus, basal ganglia, and frontal cortex). These areas, involved in IM-based behavior learning, play important functions for reflexive and voluntary attention. The model is tested within a simple simulated pan-tilt camera robot engaged in learning to switch on different lights by looking at them, and is able to self-generate visual goals and learn attention skills under IM guidance. The model represents a novel hypothesis on how primates and robots might autonomously learn attention skills and has a potential to account for developmental psychology experiments and the underlying brain mechanisms.

TI Antimicrobial Agents Used in the Treatment of Peri-Implantitis Alter the

AB Background: Chemotherapeutic agents (ChAs) are considered an integral part of current treatment protocols for the decontamination of titanium implants with peri-implantitis, based on their antimicrobial effect. Despite the proven antimicrobial effect of ChAs on titanium-bound biofilms, previous studies have elucidated an unexpected disassociation between bacterial reduction and biologically acceptable treatment outcomes. In this study, the authors hypothesize that ChAs residues alter titanium physicochemistry and thus compromise cellular response to decontaminated surfaces.
   Methods: Grit-blasted acid-etched titanium disks were contaminated with multispecies microcosm biofilms grown from in vivo peri-implant plaque samples. To simulate implant decontamination, the contaminated disks were burnished with 0.12% chlorhexidine, 20% citric acid, 24% EDTA/1.5% NaOCl, or sterile saline and assessed surface physicochemical properties. Sterile untreated surfaces were the controls. The biologic effects of decontamination were assessed via cell proliferation and differentiation assays.
   Results: Bacterial counts after decontamination confirmed that the ChAs were antimicrobial. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy invariably detected elemental contaminants associated with each ChA molecule or salt that significantly altered wettability compared with controls. Notably, all surfaces with ChA residues showed some cytotoxic effect compared with controls (P < 0.05). Increased cell counts were consistently found in the saline-treated group compared with chlorhexidine (P = 0.03). Interestingly, no association was found between antimicrobial effect and cell counts (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: ChA-specific residues left on the titanium surfaces altered titanium physical properties and adversely affected the osteoblastic response irrespective of their observed antimicrobial effect. Chlorhexidine may compromise the biocompatibility of titanium surfaces, and its use is not recommended to detoxify implants. Sterile saline, citric acid, and NaOCl-EDTA may be proposed for use in the treatment of peri-implantitis. Contrary to previous studies that recommended the selection of ChAs for the decontamination of titanium implants according to their antimicrobial effects, the present study demonstrated that the restoration of the biocompatibility of contaminated titanium surfaces is also contingent on the preservation of titanium material properties.

AB Supply chain systems are becoming more complex and dynamic as a result of globalization and the development of information technology. This complexity is characterized by an overwhelming number of relations and their interdependencies, resulting in highly nonlinear and complex dynamic behaviors. Supply chain networks grow and self-organize through complex interactions between their structure and function. The complexity of supply-chain networks creates unavoidable difficulty in prediction making it difficult to manage and control them using a linearized set of models. The aim of this article is to design resilient supply chain network from the perspective of complex network topologies. In this paper, various resilience metrics for supply chains are developed based on a complex network theory, then a resilient supply chain growth algorithm is also developed for designing a resilient supply chain network. An agent-based simulation analysis is carried out to test the developed model based on the resilience metrics. The results of the proposed resilient supply chain growth algorithm are compared with major complex network models. A simulation result shows that a supply chain network can be designed based on complex network theory, especially as a scale-free network. It is also concluded that the proposed model is more suitable than general complex network models for the design of a resilient supply chain network.

AB Background. Only one tumor site is usually biopsied to determine the histologic features of that patient's entire tumor burden. We hypothesized that there are significant histologic and functional differences in primary neuroendocrine tumors (NETS) and their nodal or organ metastases. We also hypothesized that limited tumor sampling could lead to erroneous assumptions about the tumor's histologic characteristics and clinical behavior.
   Materials and Methods. Thirteen patients with metastatic well differentiated midgut NETS underwent simultaneous removal of their primary tumor, nodal metastasis, and organ metastasis. Each tumor site was stained quantitatively for Ki-67, chromogranin A (CGA), synaptophysin, CD31, and Factor VIII. Samples were also evaluated with in vitro tumor angiogenesis and drug chemoresistance assays.
   Results. Ki-67 staining was nearly identical at all sites tested. Quantitative stains for CGA, synaptophysin, cluster of differentiation 31 (CD31), and Factor VIII varied considerably among the patient's three tissue site samples. Only 6% of the tissue samples tested against a battery of chemotherapeutic agents exhibited susceptibility to a single drug at all three tumor sites. In contrast, several antiangiogenic agents exhibited uniform effectiveness across all three tissue sites in multiple patients.
   Conclusions. Sampling only one NET tumor site may lead to erroneous assumptions about the tumor's histologic features and functional behavior. Evaluation of primary tumors and their nodal and organ metastasis may be necessary to optimize clinical decision making. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The use of corrosion-resistant metal materials in highly aggressive environments contributes to the preservation of the environment because it reduces the use of protective agents and coatings. Most metal objects are produced by some metal-forming process. It is well-known that plastic deformation affects the corrosion resistance of different metal materials in different ways. As a rule, austenitic stainless steels show a positive impact of plastic deformation on corrosion resistance, especially when hot deformed with protective surface oxide layers. However, most research carried out on these metals involves a carefully prepared surface which is either finely ground or polished. This paper investigates the corrosion resistance of cold-formed (open die forged) austenitic stainless steel in three different surface states for three different degrees of deformation. In doing so, we simulate possible damage to the treated surface and evaluate the stability of the material with respect to corrosion. Good corrosion resistance is shown for all three stages of deformation and for all three surface states, with some differences in the obtained results. Although the polished surface shows the highest corrosion resistance, as expected, the other two surfaces also demonstrate good results when exposed to aggressive environments. All of the results were statistically processed and presented. The results demonstrate the high usability of such materials in corrosion-aggressive environments with minimal danger of corrosion and minimal need to include additional surface protection agents, even against possible surface damage.

AB The manual shift of residential wet appliances (dishwashers and washing machines) in French households that have subscribed to a Time of Use (ToU) tariff represents a flexibility potential available already today and at zero-cost. In this paper we quantify, for the first time, this potential by building a national representative synthetic population for France and using a novel bottom-up model. This includes a stochastic occupant behaviour model for predicting the use of the wet appliances and an overlying agent-based model for predicting their manual shifting under a ToU tariff system. The two models are calibrated and validated using empirical data collected over two recent monitoring campaigns, each carried out in more than 100 French households. By using the new model we observe that a 100% penetration rate of the ToU tariff together with an improved (but practically feasible) households' flexibility could lead, between 19:00 and 20:00, to a mean hourly load reduction of 0.48 GW, which represents around 0.5% of the typical French annual peak load. This flexibility potential, which is today only partially exploited, could be achieved with zero additional costs for new infrastructures, by encouraging eco practices and/or making the ToU tariff more economically attractive for the households.

AB We have previously developed an agent-based computational model to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel hypothesis we term the inflammatory twitch. This hypothesis potentially explains the dynamics of the normal response to allergic inflammation in the lung (Pothen JJ, Poynter ME, Bates JH. J Immunol 190: 3510-3516, 2013) on the basis that antigenic stimulation sets in motion both the onset of inflammation and its subsequent resolution. The result is a self-limited inflammatory event that is similar in a formal sense to a skeletal muscle twitch. We hypothesize here that the chronic airway inflammation characteristic of asthma may represent the failure of the inflammatory twitch to resolve back to baseline. Our model provides a platform with which to perform virtual experiments aimed at investigating possible mechanisms leading to accentuation and/or prolongation of the inflammatory twitch. We used our model to determine how the inflammatory twitch is modified by knocking out certain cell types, interfering with cell activity, and altering cell lifetimes. Increasing the duration of activation of proinflammatory cells (considered to be chiefly neutrophils and eosinophils) markedly accentuated and prolonged the inflammatory twitch. This aberrant twitch behavior was largely abrogated by knocking out T-helper cells (simulating the effect of corticosteroids). The aberrant inflammatory twitch was also normalized by reducing the lifetime of the proinflammatory cells, suggesting that increasing apoptosis of these cells may be a therapeutic target in asthma.

AB Background. Preconditioning protects the heart from ischemic injury, but some of its effects are reversed by beta-adrenergic blockade. We hypothesize that because nitric oxide is known to precondition the heart, the nitric oxide-generating beta-blocker nipradilol may simultaneously precondition and provide clinically relevant beta-blockade.
   Methods. Isolated, crystalloid-perfused rabbit hearts underwent 1 hour of left anterior descending coronary artery ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. Before ischemia, six hearts received nipradilol, six received the nitric oxide donor L-arginine, four hearts received the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester before L-arginine, nine underwent ischemic preconditioning, and six received beta-blockade by esmolol before ischemic preconditioning. Seven hearts received no pretreatment (control). Action potential duration and ventricular pressure were measured. Infarct size was determined at the end of reperfusion.
   Results. Both L-arginine and ischemic preconditioning prolonged action potential duration significantly at 60 minutes of reperfusion. Compared with control, infarct size was reduced by ischemic preconditioning (26% +/- 4% versus 49% +/- 3%, IPC versus control; p < 0.01), L-arginine (24% +/- 2%; p < 0.01 versus control), and nipradilol (24% +/- 2% p < 0.01 versus control). Only nipradilol preserved peak developed pressure during reperfusion.
   Conclusions. Despite its properties as a beta-adrenergic blocking agent, nipradilol was able to precondition the heart, probably as a result of its ability to produce nitric oxide. (Ann Thorac Surg 1999;68:844-9) (C) 1999 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

ID CLIMATE; POLICY
AB The use of scenarios has proven valuable for global change analysis as a means for organizing and communicating information about uncertain future socioeconomic conditions. A small group of well-defined scenarios can provide a set of standard reference cases for assessing the performance of candidate policies under alternative futures. However, traditional methods of defining scenarios may yield storylines that do not align well with the capabilities of downstream models. It can also be difficult to assess whether the number and scope of constructed scenarios most effectively cover the space of possible outcomes. Model-based methods of 'scenario discovery' have recently been proposed that apply statistical data-mining algorithms to a large number of model simulations to identify regions of the stochastic parameter space that lead to unacceptable policy performance. These regions then delineate practically relevant and internally consistent 'discovered scenarios'. To distinguish 'acceptable' from 'unacceptable' policy outcomes, existing methods require pre-specification of a threshold value on a single performance metric. We believe this requirement may present a barrier when decision-makers hold differing views on the relative importance of multiple policy objectives. Therefore, we describe a scenario discovery method that is multidimensional in the outcome space, thus precluding the need for users to agree on a single performance threshold or set of tradeoff weights. We demonstrate application of our approach to the results of ENGAGE, an agent-based model (ABM) of economic growth, energy technology, and carbon emissions. We believe that scenario discovery can add particular value to agent-based modeling, as ABMs typically generate a wider array of possible futures than aggregate-scale models. For this reason, a systematic method for sorting through the many stochastic model simulations to identify policy vulnerabilities and opportunities is essential. We conclude by discussing how our methodology might be applicable to the development of socioeconomic scenarios under the 'representative concentration pathways' (RCP) framework.

AB 9-Aminocamptothecin (9-AC) is a topoisomerase I inhibitor currently being developed as an antineoplastic agent, The aim of these preclinical studies was to assess the activity of 9-AC against prostate cancer, a malignancy notoriously insensitive to most cytotoxic agents in the clinic, The activity of 9-AC was first tested in vitro against one hormone-sensitive (LNCaP) and three hormone-resistant (PC-3, PC-3M, and DU145) human prostate cancer cell lines, After 96 h of drug exposure, concentrations required to inhibit cell viability to 50% of control values (IC(50)s) were 34.1, 10, 6.5, and 8.9 nhr for PC-3, PC-3M, DU145, and LNCaP, respectively. Because 9-AC is known to undergo rapid hydrolysis, we assayed lactone levels in tissue culture medium over 24 h and found that the half-life was 20 min, with only 15% of the drug remaining as lactone at steady state, Consequently, the IC(50)s calculated from a single dose of the drug may represent overestimates, Subsequently, we tested the activity of a colloidal dispersion formulation of 9-AC against PC-3 implanted into flanks of nude mice, 9-AC was given for a total of 3 weeks by daily oral gavage (excluding weekends) or by twice weekly s.c. injections. 9-AC inhibited tumor growth at the lowest oral dose (0.35 mg/kg/day), whereas higher oral doses (0.75 and 1 mg/kg/day) and s.c. administration (4 mg/kg/week) caused tumor regression, 9-AC was well tolerated at all doses, with no toxic death or weight loss of more than 10% observed in any group. Finally, we considered that the activity of 9-AC seen in the mouse xenograft model might he explained, in part, by the relatively acidic tumor microenvironment, which would favor the formation of the more potent lactone, Simultaneous determination of plasma and tumor 9-AC lactone concentrations confirmed this hypothesis. Taken together, these studies suggest that 9-AC should be submitted for clinical trials in patients with prostate cancer.

AB Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm overlap syndrome characterized by monocytic proliferation in the presence of dysplastic bone marrow changes, inflammatory symptoms, and propensity for transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Unlike the alpha and beta isoforms, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-delta signaling protein is predominantly expressed by hematopoietic cells and therefore has garnered interest as a potential target for the treatment of lymphomas and leukemias. We revealed a pattern of increased PIK3CD:PIK3CA ratio in monocytic M5 AML patients and cell lines, and this ratio correlated with responsiveness to pharmacological PI3K-delta inhibition in vitro. Because CMML is a disease defined by monocytic clonal proliferation, we tested the PI3K-d inhibitor umbralisib as a single agent and in combination with the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, in CMML. Our ex vivo experiments with primary CMML patient samples revealed synergistic inhibition of viability and clonogenicity with this combination. Phospho-specific flow cytometry revealed that dual inhibition had the unique ability to decrease STAT5, ERK, AKT, and S6 phosphorylation simultaneously, which offers a mechanistic hypothesis for the enhanced efficacy of the combination treatment. These preclinical data indicate promising activity by co-inhibition of PI3K-d and JAK1/2 and support the use of ruxolitinib + umbralisib combination therapy in CMML under active clinical investigation.

AB The onset and distribution of infectivity and disease-specific prion protein (PrPd) accumulation was studied in Romney and Suffolk sheep of the ARQJARQ, ARQ/ARR and ARR/ARR prion protein gene (Prnp) genotypes (where A stands for alanine, R for arginine and Q for glutamine at codons 136, 154 and 171 of PrP), following experimental oral infection with cattle-derived bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent. Groups of sheep were killed at regular intervals and a wide range of tissues taken for mouse bioassay or immunohistochemistry (IHC), or both. Bioassay results for infectivity were mostly coincident with those of PrPd detection by IHC both in terms of tissues and time post infection. Neither PrPd nor infectivity was detected in any tissues of BSE-dosed ARQ/ARR or ARR/ARR sheep or of undosed controls. Moreover, four ARQ/ARQ Suffolk sheep, which were methionine (M)/threonine heterozygous at codon 112 of the Prnp gene, did not show any biological or immunohistochemical evidence of infection, while those homozygous for methionine(MARQ/MARQ) did. In MARQ/MARQ sheep of both breeds, initial PrPd accumulation was identified in lymphoreticular system (LRS) tissues followed by the central nervous system (CNS) and enteric nervous system (ENS) and finally by the autonomic nervous system and peripheral nervous system and other organs. Detection of infectivity closely mimicked this sequence. No PrPd was observed in the ENS prior to its accumulation in the CNS, suggesting that ENS involvement occurred simultaneously to that of, or followed centrifugal spread from, the CNS. The distribution of PrPd within the ENS further suggested a progressive spread from the ileal plexus to other ENS segments via neuronal connections of the gut wall. Differences between the two breeds were noted in terms of involvement of LRS and ENS tissues, with Romney sheep showing a more delayed and less consistent PrPd accumulation than Suffolk sheep in such tissues. Whether this accounted for the slight delay (similar to 5 months) in the appearance of clinical signs in Romney sheep is debatable since by the last scheduled kill before animals reached clinical end point, both breeds showed widespread accumulation and similar magnitudes of PrPd accumulation in the brain.

AB Pancreatic cancer (PCa) is one of the most lethal malignancies, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 8%. Current treatment regiments have a low response rate in unselected patients. However, the subgroup of PCa patients with BRCA mutations may benefit from poly-ADP-ribose polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) due to their biological properties in DNA repair. Dose limiting toxicity in normal tissues is frequently observed when PARPi are combined with other chemotherapies, and the co-delivery of two drugs to tumor sites at an adequate concentration is challenging. To address this issue, we have engineered an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting (with GE11 peptide) self-assembly amphiphilic peptide nanoparticle (GENP) to co-deliver gemcitabine and the PARPi olaparib to treat BRCA mutant PCa. The GENP was relatively stable, exhibited high encapsulation efficiency, and could coordinately release the two drugs in tumor milieu. Gemcitabine and olaparib showed strong synergistic actions in optimized conditions in vitro. The nanoparticle prolonged the half-life of both drugs and resulted in their tumor accumulation at the optimal therapeutic ratio in vivo. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were able to significantly suppress tumor growth in a murine PCa model with minimal side effects. Drug co-delivery of DNA damaging agents and PARP inhibitors via the GENP represents a promising approach for treatment of pancreatic cancers with molecular defects in the DNA repair pathway.

AB Examining the different stages of learning through play in humans during early life has been a topic of interest for various scholars. Play evolves from practice to symbolic and then later to play with rules. During practice play, infants go through a process of developing knowledge while they interact with the surrounding objects, facilitating the creation of new knowledge about objects and object related behaviors. Such knowledge is used to form schemas in which the manifestation of sensorimotor experiences is captured. Through subsequent play, certain schemas are further combined to generate chains able to achieve behaviors that require multiple steps. The chains of schemas demonstrate the formation of higher level actions in a hierarchical structure. In this work we present a schema-based play generator for artificial agents, termed Dev-PSchema. With the help of experiments in a simulated environment and with the iCub robot, we demonstrate the ability of our system to create schemas of sensorimotor experiences from playful interaction with the environment. We show the creation of schema chains consisting of a sequence of actions that allow an agent to autonomously perform complex tasks. In addition to demonstrating the ability to learn through playful behavior, we demonstrate the capability of Dev-PSchema to simulate different infants with different preferences toward novel vs. familiar objects.

AB Voriconazole is a first-line agent for the treatment of invasive fungal infections. The pharmacology of voriconazole is characterized by extensive interindividual variability and nonlinear pharmacokinetics. The population pharmacokinetics of voriconazole in 64 adults is described. The patient population consisted of 21 healthy volunteers, who received a range of intravenous (i.v.) and oral voriconazole regimens, and 43 patients with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, who received the currently licensed dosage. Voriconazole concentrations were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The pharmacokinetic data were modeled using a nonparametric methodology and with a nonlinear pharmacokinetic structural model. The extent and consequences of pharmacokinetic variability were explored using Monte Carlo simulation. The relationship between drug exposure and clinical response was explored using logistic regression. Optimal sampling times were identified using D-optimal design. The fit of the nonlinear model was acceptable. Data from the healthy volunteers provided robust estimates for K-m and the maximum rate of enzyme activity (V-max). The Bayesian parameter estimates were more variable and statistically different in patients than in volunteers. There was a linear relationship between the trough concentration and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-12)). There was no relationship between the AUC(0-12) and clinical response. The original parameter values were readily recapitulated using Monte Carlo simulation. Initial i.v. dosing resulted in higher AUC(0-12) and trough concentrations compared with oral dosing. Sample collection times of 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, and 12 h after an i.v. infusion are maximally informative times for future pharmacokinetic studies.

AB Silica nanoparticles (NPs) have shown tremendous application potential as stabilising agents in foams. The adsorption of cationic surfactants on the surface of NPs through electrostatic interactions forms integrated surfactant-NP compounds and endows the NPs with surfactancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of the alkane chain length of cationic surfactants on NP surfactancy and foam stability. The results demonstrate that the surface tension decreases and dilational elasticity modulus increases with surfactant chain length. Simultaneously, coalescence of bubbles is markedly suppressed and the stability of surfactant-NP foams is enhanced in static and dynamic tests. With a coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation (CGMD), it was found that the surfactant-NP complexes evolve into an asymmetric Janus structure at the gas-liquid interface from their symmetric configuration in the aqueous phase. In addition, the resistance force during the pulling of a NP away from the interface increases with surfactant chain length. The simulation results imply that surfactant-NPs have a high surfactancy and the adsorption stability is improved with increasing surfactant chain length, which is in good agreement with the experimental results.

AB 1,8-Bis(tetramethylguanidino)naphthalene (TMGN, 1) is a new, readily accessible, and stable "proton sponge" with an experimental pK(BH)-value of 25.1 in MeCN, which is nearly seven orders of magnitude higher in basicity than the classical proton sponge 1,8-bis (dimethylamino) -naphthalene (DMAN). Because of the sterically less crowded character of the proton-accepting sp(2)-nitrogen atoms, TMGN also has a higher kinetic basicity than DMAN, which is shown by time-resolved proton self-exchange reactions. TMGN is more resistant to hydrolysis and is a weaker nucleophile towards the alkylating agent EtI in comparison to the commercially available guanidine 7-metliyl-1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (MTBD). Crystal structures of the free base, of the mono- and bisprotonated base were determined. The dynamic behavior of all three species in solution was investigated by variable-temperature H-1 NMR experiments. DeltaG(+) values obtained by spectra simulation reveal a concerted mechanism of rotation about the C-N bonds of the protonated forms of TMGN.

AB Hydrometallurgical recovery of rare earth elements (REE) from NiMH battery waste can be performed using sulfuric acid leaching followed by selective precipitation as double salt (REENa(SO4)(2)center dot H2O) by adding Na2SO4 as a precipitating agent. The formed double salts can then be further converted with NaOH solution to form REE hydroxides. However, present literature has paid little attention to how to minimize the consumption of reagents in this recovery process. In the current study, a process model was built using HSC Sim software, and metamodeling of the simulated flowsheet was conducted with the design of experiments (DOE), after which the basic functionality of the flowsheet was verified by experimental work, starting from sulfuric acid leaching of spent batteries. As the process is based on chemical circulation internally in the process, the objective was to investigate the accumulation of the elements in solution, specifically Na+, K+, SO42- ions and impurities liberated in the NaOH conversion step. It was found out that metamodeling could be utilized in obtaining first estimate of the process behavior, prior to any experiments. Flowsheet functionality with circulated solution was confirmed, obtaining at best 96.9% La recovery.

AB The electrochemical behavior of menadione reduction (MQ) in the presence of alkylated derivatives of the following nucleobases is reported for the first time in the present work: 9-nonyladenine (NAH), 1-nonylthymine (mTu), 1-ncr.ylcytcr!nc (NMI), aid 9-plienyietiviguamne (PEGH). Through voltammetric simulation, it was possible to characterize the MQ reduction mechanisms in the presence of NAH and NCH, including the hydrogen -bonding association between reduced species of menadione and nucleobases. In the case of the NAH nucleobase, the best fit between the simulated and the experimental voltammograms was achieved when a comproportionation reaction involving MQ(2-) (NAH) and MQ(-) is considered. The analysis of MQ voltammograms with different NTH concentrations led to the formation of an MQ(-)(NTH) association complex, and the concerted reduction and deprotonation of MQ(-) (NTH) resulted in the protonated species MQH(-), in agreement with the literature. Finally, in the case of the reduction of MQ with PEGH, the voltammetric response, evinced the protonation process of the semiquinone and confirmed a second -order disproportionation mechanism.

AB Single crystals of beta-In2S3 were grown by chemical vapor transport method using ICl3 as a transport agent. The below and above band-edge transitions in beta-In2S3 have been characterized using optical absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements in the temperature range 20-300 K. Thermo-reflectance (TR) and photoconductivity (PC) measurements were carried out to verify the band-edge nature of the diindium trisulfide tetragonal crystals. Experimental analyses of the transmittance, PL, PC, and TR spectra of beta-In2S3 confirmed that the chalcogenide compound is a direct semiconductor with a band gap of about 1.935 eV at 300 K. beta-In2S3 is familiar with its defect nature. For the beta-In2S3 crystals, two defect emissions and two above band-edge luminescences were simultaneously detected in the PL spectra at low temperatures. The energy variations of the defect emissions showed temperature-insensitive behavior with respect to the temperature change from 20 to 300 K. Temperature dependences of transition energies of the near-band-edge (NBE) transitions below and above band gap are analyzed. The origins for the NBE transitions in the beta-In2S3 defect crystals are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Fly ash from municipal waste incinerators constitutes an environmental problem, as it is polluted with heavy metals. By extracting the heavy metals from fly ashes with an acid solution, they can be partly removed and possibly recovered. The remaining fly ash can be landfilled or used as construction material. In this paper, the results of experimental leaching tests of fly ash are compared with computer calculations of the thermodynamic equilibrium of the leaching solution - fly ash system. The computer program MINTEQA2, used for this purpose, allows to predict the metal concentrations in the leaching solution, the minerals that precipitate, and the pH of the leaching solution at equilibrium. A calculation approach was chosen, whereby the simulation of the complex leaching process was divided into five subproblems. A leaching diagram with linear scales was introduced to visualise the equilibria as a function of pH. The computer simulation was used in two applications: calculation of the impact of addition of a complexing agent on the leaching behaviour of lead, and optimisation of the volume of liquid to be used in the leaching process for a given amount of fly ash.

AB In this work, for the first time, the authors report their observations on cross-linking condition, and its effects on conjugation capacity of a bioactive model. Therefore, carriers of chitosan films and microspheres were produced by using glutaraldehyde as bifunctional cross-linking agent. The following stages were carried out: preparation of cross-linked chitosan films and microspheres, conjugation of drug model on films and microspheres, investigation on the properties of the synthesized carriers and finally enzyme immobilization studies. Based on our results, degree of cross-linking and drug conjugation capacity, as two important factors, affect simultaneously the thermal, morphological, and hydrolytic behavior of the carriers in film and microsphere forms. From the experimental data, with increasing the degree of cross-linking and drug conjugation capacity, the drug release was increased up to 12% w/w of glutaraldehyde; however, on further increasing the degree of cross-linking (18% w/w), the drug released in a burst manner. Also, regarding to the results from drug and enzyme conjugates, it is possible to design diversity of the chitosan derivatives based on different degree of cross-linking as well as enzyme conjugation capacity as reliable carriers.

AB The FeF3/C composites were prepared by high energy milling, and its cyclic performance was characterized by discharge-charge measurements. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of FeF3/C cathode were obtained at different potentials during the initial discharge-charge cycle. The results show that the FeF3/C cathode exhibits an enhanced initial discharge capacity of 710 mAh/g (4.5-1.5 V) but shows a capacity retention of 40% after 100 cycles at room temperature. EIS of the FeF3/C cathode have revealed that the Nyquist plots of the typical EIS consist of two semicircles and one arc in an order of decreasing frequency during lithiation/delithiation. An equivalent circuit was proposed to simulate the experimental EIS data. The kinetic parameters of lithium ion and electron across the porous FeF3/C electrode in the first discharge-charge cycle are discussed in detail, offering some evidence that both the unstable SEI film on the electrode surface and the Schottky contact between metal-fluorides and conductive agents, can eventually affect the cyclic performance.

AB BACKGROUND: Local delivery of temozolomide (TMZ) through polymers is superior to oral administration in a rodent glioma model.
   OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that the observed clinical synergy of orally administered TMZ and carmustine (BCNU) wafers would translate into even greater effectiveness with the local delivery of BCNU and TMZ and the addition of radiotherapy in animal models of malignant glioma.
   METHODS: TMZ and BCNU were incorporated into biodegradable polymers that were implanted in F344 rats bearing established intracranial tumors. We used 2 different rodent glioma models: the 9L gliosarcoma and the F98 glioma.
   RESULTS: In the 9L rodent glioma model, groups treated with the combination of local TMZ, local BCNU, and radiation therapy (XRT) had 75% long-term survivors (defined as animals alive 120 days after tumor implantation), which was superior to the combination of local TMZ and local BCNU (median survival, 95 days; long-term survival, 25%) and the combination of oral TMZ, local BCNU, and XRT (median survival, 62 days; long-term survival, 12.5%). To simulate the effect of this treatment in chemoresistant gliomas, a second rodent model was used with the F98 glioma, a cell line relatively resistant to alkylating agents. F98 glioma cells express high levels of alkyltransferase, an enzyme that deactivates alkylating agents and is the major mechanism of resistance of gliomas. The triple therapy showed a significant improvement in survival when compared with controls (P = .0004), BCNU (P = .0043), oral TMZ (P = .0026), local TMZ (P = .0105), and the combinations of either BCNU and XRT (P = .0378) or oral TMZ and BCNU (P = .0154).
   CONCLUSION: The survival of tumor-bearing animals in the 9L and F98 glioma models was improved with the local delivery of BCNU and TMZ combined with XRT when compared with either treatment alone or oral TMZ, local BCNU, and XRT.

AB We design a novel method for the CH4 reduction of SnO2 for the efficient recovery of Sn from SnO2 through a study combining theory and experiment. The atomic-level process of CH4-SnO2 interaction and temperature-dependent reduction behavior of SnO2 were studied with a combination of a multiscale computational method of thermodynamic simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We found that CH4 was a highly efficient and a versatile reducing agent, as the total reducing power of CH4 originates from the carbon and hydrogen of CH4, which sequentially reduce SnO2. Moreover, as a result of the CH4 reduction of SnO2, a mixture of CO and H-2 was produced as a gasphase product (syngas). The relative molar ratio of the produced gas-phase product was controllable by the reduction temperature and the amount of supplied CH4. The laboratory-scale experimental study confirmed that CH4 actively reduces SnO2, producing 99.34% high-purity Sn and H-2 and CO. Our results present a novel method for an efficient, green, and economical recycling strategy for Sn with economic value added that is held by the co-produced clean energy source (syngas).

ID SUPPLY CHAIN MODEL
AB Driving control in the car-following (CF) driving behavior has two aspects. First, in what measure an approximation distance is taken as a safe distance guaranteeing the safety of the follower drivers. Second, how to control the follower's vehicle velocities based on the stimulus of the leading vehicle. In this context, to resolve the driving control problem in the CF driving behavior, a bilevel optimization is presented in this paper, based on the behaviors of the follower and leader drivers. Bearing in mind that mathematics has contributed to the imitation of human behaviors, they are now reaching a level of complexity requiring the entry on the scene of a new player, which is artificial intelligence. Thus, in this paper; we used the fuzzy logic theory for modeling a follower driver with a nonnormative behavior. To validate our model, we used a data set from the program of the US Federal Highway Administration. Therefore, according to the experimental results, there is homogeneity between the actual and the simulated travel trajectories in terms of deviation. Besides, the driver's behavior adopted (normative or nonnormative) is reflected in his reactions to the various components of the road.

AB In China, crowd stampede accidents usually take place within crowded areas in middle and primary schools. The crowd stampede risk is particularly related to the architectural design such as the staircase design, the layout of crowded places, obstacles, etc. Through the investigation of building design in several primary schools, the relationship between the sustainable layout of crowded places (e.g., toilets, canteens, playgrounds, staircases) and the crowd stampede risk of students are introduced via agent-based simulations. In particular, different experimental scenarios are conducted on stairs in the primary buildings. The evacuation processes are recorded by video camera and spatial stepping characteristics (e.g., foot clearance, step length, mass center, the distance between the mass center and ankle, and etc.) are extracted from the video. Dynamic steady ability is investigated by adopting the margin of stability, quantified by the instantaneous difference between the edge of the base of support and extrapolated vertical projection of the mass center. Based on the sustainable built environment principles and historical data of students, this paper focuses on an in-depth analysis of the staircase design aiming at preventing the crowd stampede risk.

AB The paper presents results of a two-stage study on the tribocorrosive wear of ADI alloy cast iron containing Ni and Cu. In the first stage of the wear tests with use test rig type pin-on-plate, there were determined the parameters of the process of tribocorrosion of the ADI cast iron in 3.5% NaCl solution. In the second stage, the tests were carried out on a test rig simulating real operating conditions of chain wheels used in armoured face conveyors. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the impact of the combined action of corrosive agents (water and NaCl) and quartz abrasive on the wear of the wheels tested. As part of the test, the abrasive wear in the presence of the abrasive material alone and in the presence of a mixture of the abrasive material, water and NaCl was determined. The microstructure and the hardness of the surface layer as a function of the distance from the surface were also determined. During the study it has been found that regardless of the type of test there is a synergy between the effects of corrosion and friction which led to an increase of the resulting wear by 30%.

AB We use molecular dynamics (MD) to perform an extensive characterization of the thermo-mechanical response of a thermoset polymer composed of epoxy EPON862 and curing agent DETDA. Our simulations, with no adjustable parameters, show that atomistic simulation can capture non-trivial behavior of amorphous thermosets including the role of polymerization degree, thermal history, strain rate and temperature on the glass transition temperature (T(g)) and mechanical response (including ultimate properties) and lead to predictions in quantitative agreement with experiments. We find a significant increase in T(g), Young's modulus and yield stress with degree of polymerization while yield strain is significantly less sensitive to it. For structures cured beyond the gel point (percolation of a 3D network) conversion degree and temperature affect yield stress in a similar way with yield stress linearly dependent on T T(g): however, we find non-linear and non-universal relationship below the gel point. Our results show that a relative small variation in polymerization degree (similar to 5%) can explain the spread in experimental measurements of T(g) and elastic constants available in the literature.

AB Drug delivery by layered double hydroxides (LDHs) is extensively studied due to the capacity of these solids to preserve the active agent and to modify its release rate and bioavailability. In this work, an ibuprofen-LDH complex was synthesized with high drug content (54% w/w), incorporated both in the interlayer and on the surface. The mechanisms involved in the ibuprofen release process were studied as a function of the anion type (chloride, acetate, and phosphate) and concentration, and the pH of the release media. The experimental conditions selected were based on the composition of pharmaceutically relevant fluids such as gastric, intestinal and lysosomal simulated media. Three release mechanisms accounted for the rate and extent of the drug release: ion exchange (highly dependent on the anions), desorption and weathering (dependent on the pH). These mechanisms, together with the different solubility of the anionic and non-ionic ibuprofen species, also explained the release behavior for particulate solid and hydrogel formulations. Anion exchange determined ibuprofen release in intestinal medium (phosphate anions pH 6.8) whereas surface reactions mediated by solid weathering or drug solubility ruled the release in acid media (gastric fluid and lysosomal medium).

AB Numerous research efforts have been conducted to simulate the crowd movements, while relatively few of them are specifically focused on multihazard situations. In this paper, we propose a novel crowd simulation method by modeling the generation and contagion of panic emotion under multihazard circumstances. In order to depict the effect from hazards and other agents to crowd movement, we first classify hazards into different types (transient and persistent, concurrent and nonconcurrent, and static and dynamic) based on their inherent characteristics. Second, we introduce the concept of perilous field for each hazard and further transform the critical level of the field to its invoked-panic emotion. After that, we propose an emotional contagion model to simulate the evolving process of panic emotion caused by multiple hazards. Finally, we introduce an emotional reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVOs) model to simulate the crowd behaviors by augmenting the traditional RVO model with emotional contagion, which for the first time combines the emotional impact and local avoidance together. Our experimental results demonstrate that the overall approach is robust, can better generate realistic crowds and the panic emotion dynamics in a crowd. Furthermore, it is recommended that our method can be applied to various complex multihazard environments.

AB Raman spectroscopy, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations were employed to study 5-amino-2-mercaptobenzimidazole (5-A-2MBI) molecules. Ag colloids were used as SERS substrates which were prepared by using hydroxylamine hydrochloride as reducing agent. Raman vibration modes and SERS characteristic peaks of 5-A-2MBI were assigned with the aid of DFT calculations. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) of 5-A-2MBI was used to discuss the possible adsorption behavior of 5-A-2MBI on Ag colloids. The spectral analysis showed that 5-A-2MBI molecules were slightly titled via the sulfur atoms adhering to the surfaces of Ag substrates. The obtained SERS spectral intensity decreased when lowering the 5-A-2MBI concentrations. A final detection limit on the concentration of 5 x 10(-7) mol . L-1 was gained. SEAS proved to be a simple, fast and reliable method for the detection and characterization of 5-A-2MBI molecules. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Cellular Automaton-based technique suitable for solving the path planning problem in a distributed robot team is outlined. Real-time path planning is a challenging task that has many applications in the fields of artificial intelligence, moving robots, virtual reality, and agent behavior simulation. The problem refers to finding a collision-free path for autonomous robots between two specified positions in a configuration area. The complexity of the problem increases in systems of multiple robots. More specifically, some distance should be covered by each robot in an unknown environment, avoiding obstacles found on its route to the destination. On the other hand, all robots must adjust their actions in order to keep their initial team formation immutable. Two different formations were tested in order to study the efficiency and the flexibility of the proposed method. Using different formations, the proposed technique could find applications to image processing tasks, swarm intelligence, etc. Furthermore, the presented Cellular Automaton (CA) method was implemented and tested in a real system using three autonomous mobile minirobots called E-pucks. Experimental results indicate that accurate collision-free paths could be created with low computational cost. Additionally, cooperation tasks could be achieved using minimal hardware resources, even in systems with low-cost robots.

AB To improve the foaming behavior of a common linear polypropylene (PP) resin, polycarbonate (PC) was blended with PP, and three different grafted polymers were used as the compatibilizers. The solid and foamed samples of the PP/PC 3:1 blend with different compatibilizers were first fabricated by melt extrusion followed by injection molding (IM) with and without a blowing agent. The mechanical properties, thermal features, morphological structure, and relative rheological characterizations of these samples were studied using a tensile test, dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and torque rheometer. It can be found from the experimental results that the influence of the compatibility between the PP and PC phases on the foaming behavior of PP/PC blends is substantial. The results suggest that PC coupling with an appropriate compatibilizer is a potential method to improve the foamability of PP resin. The comprehensive effect of PC and a suitable compatibilizer on the foamability of PP can be attributed to two possible mechanisms, i.e., the partial compatibility between phases that facilitates cell nucleation and the improved gas-melt viscosity that helps to form a fine foaming structure.

AB This paper presents the results of an unannounced theatre evacuation involving 1200 occupants. The evacuation took place towards the end of a live theatre performance in the Marlowe Theatre in Kent, UK. In particular, Response Phase behaviours are discussed, and response time data is presented. A significant finding of this work which is different to other reported work is that the occupant response time distribution, while following the typical log-normal distribution is related to the geometrical positioning of the occupants relative to proximity to exit aisles and exits. Response time is found to increase relative to seat distance from the exit aisles and distance of the seat row to an exit. The identified trends in response time distribution will have a profound impact on the analysis of evacuation times and congestion levels determined using agent based evacuation models and so should be represented within these models. Based on these findings, a generalised methodology is proposed to distribute response time within a theatre for use in evacuation simulation applications. Further experimental analysis is required to determine whether these observations can be generalised and applied to other seated venues such as cinemas, music venues and sports arenas.

AB From differential pulse voltammetry, DPV, it was determined the electrochemical behaviour of dopamine, DA, and ascorbic acid, AA, using a carbon paste electrode, CPE, with the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate, SIDS, present at concentrations around the critical micellar concentration, CIVIC It is shown that without SDS in solution, the oxidation peak potential of AA, E-AA, and DA, E-DA, completely overlap, however when [SDS] > CMC separation is possible between them (E-AA-E-DA = 238 mV). Moreover, at variance with other proposed systems, the DA potential peak becomes less positive than AA potential peak. Therefore, separation of signals allows selective determination of DA even when AA is present in the same solution. Optimization of the experimental conditions permitted to obtain a calibration plot for the DA in the presence of the AA, having a 0.01-0.2 mM linear range, a detection limit of 5 mu M and a 0.04812 mu A mu M-1 sensitivity. This new approach was used effectively to determine dopamine in real pharmaceuticals obtaining satisfactory results. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID GROUTED ROCKBOLTS; MODEL; STRENGTH; ANCHOR
AB This paper presents an analysis of bamboo bolt-modified slurry interfaces based on 26 in situ axial pull-out tests intended to highlight the mechanical behavior of interface under a fracture mode. Three impact factors are analyzed: anchorage length, bolt diameter, and bolt hole diameter, using the same materials of bamboo and modified slurry. The result shows that the interface between the bamboo bolt and anchoring agent is the control interface of an anchorage system, and the local behavior of the interface involves four stages: elastic, soften, friction, and decoupling. Distribution law and change trend of slippage, stress, and strain of anchoring interface along with the axial direction of an anchor bolt were analyzed. The result shows that there is effective anchoring length limit in this kind of interface, and that the complete decoupling phenomenon should not be neglected. Through a comparative analysis of the existing bond-slip model and interface bond-slip curve, and considering the correspondence of the strain-slip curve and trilinear bond-slip model simultaneously, a modified trilinear bond-slip model has been proposed. The friction section of this model is limited, and shearing stress in the complete decoupling section is zero.

AB A thermodynamic analysis of methane oxidative reforming was carried out by Gibbs energy minimization (at constant pressure and temperature) and entropy maximization (at constant pressure and enthalpy) methods, to determine the equilibrium compositions and equilibrium temperatures, respectively. Both cases were treated as optimization problems (non-linear programming formulation). The GAMS (R) 23.1 software and the CONOPT2 solver were used in the resolution of the proposed problems. The hydrogen and syngas production were favored at high temperatures and low pressures, and thus the oxygen to methane molar ratio (O-2/CH4) was the dominant factor to control the composition of the product formed. For O-2/CH4 molar ratios higher than 0.5, the oxidative reforming of methane presented autothermal behavior in the case of either utilizing O-2 or air as oxidant agent, but oxidation reaction with air possessed the advantage of avoiding peak temperatures in the system, due to change in the heat capacity of the system caused by the addition of nitrogen. The calculated results were compared with previously published experimental and simulated data with a good agreement between them.

AB The present work reports a multiscale approach to describe the dynamics of a chain of bubbles rising in non-Newtonian fluids. By means of the particle image velocimetry (PIV) and the lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation, a deep understanding of the complex flow pattern around a single bubble is gained at microscale. The interactions and coalescences between bubbles rising in non-Newtonian fluids are experimentally investigated by the PIV measurements, birefringence, and rheological characterization for both an isolated bubble and a chain of bubbles formed from a submerged orifice. Two aspects are identified as central to interactions and coalescence: the stress creation by the passage of bubbles and their relaxation due to the fluid's memory. This competition between the creation and relaxation of stresses displays nonlinear complex dynamics. Along with the detailed knowledge around a single bubble, these fundamental mechanisms governing the bubbles' collective behavior in a train of bubbles at mesoscale leads to cognitive modeling on the basis of behavioral rules. By simulating bubbles as adaptive agents with the surrounding fluid via averaged residual stresses, model predictions for consecutive coalescence between a great number of bubbles compare very satisfactorily with the experimental investigation at macroscale.

AB The present paper describes the results of solvent extraction studies carried out in batch mode to collect data on distribution of uranium, plutonium, and thorium using 5% TBP in n-dodecane. Extraction studies are carried out from feed solutions having bulk thorium containing aluminum and fluoride ions in 3.00-4.00M nitric acid at concentration levels anticipated in feed solutions during Advanced Heavy Water Reactor (AHWR) spent fuel reprocessing. Studies are carried out under varied experimental conditions. Parameters such as organic to aqueous phase ratio during extraction, concentration of nitric acid for scrubbing co-extracted thorium from loaded organic phase etc., are studied in detail. Hydroxylamine nitrate is selected for reductive stripping of plutonium in preliminary studies. Reagent mixture containing 0.30M HAN+0.60M HNO3 and 0.20M N2H4 is found to be optimum for plutonium partitioning. This paper also describes the extraction and stripping of uranium and plutonium in co-current mode. The extraction behavior of relevant fission products is studied from a simulated feed solution. A preliminary study on a few commercially available reducing agents is also included. These data are useful in developing a flow-scheme for the recovery of uranium and plutonium from spent fuel originating from AHWR.

AB Recent progress in deep reinforcement learning has enabled simulated agents to learn complex behavior policies from scratch, but their data complexity often prohibits real-world applications. The learning process can be sped up by expert demonstrations but those can be costly to acquire. We demonstrate that it is possible to employ model-free deep reinforcement learning combined with planning to quickly generate informative data for a manipulation task. In particular, we use an approximate trajectory optimization approach for global exploration based on an upper confidence bound of the advantage function. The advantage is approximated by a network for Q-learning with separately updated streams for state value and advantage that allows ensembles to approximate model uncertainty for one stream only. We evaluate our method on new extensions to the classical peg-in-hole task, one of which is only solvable by active usage of contacts between peg tips and holes. The experimental evaluation suggests that our method explores more relevant areas of the environment and finds exemplar solutions faster-both on a real robot and in simulation. Combining our exploration with learning from demonstration outperforms state-of-the-art model-free reinforcement learning in terms of convergence speed for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

AB Nanocomposites of cupric oxide (CuO) nanorods anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO/CuO) synthesized and applied as efficient catalysts in electrochemical hydrazine senor applications. The simultaneous reduction of Cu2+ ions and GO were achieved through a single reducing agent citrate and the average diameter of anchored CuO nanorods was found to be 18 nnn. The reduction of GO and formation of a complex of rGO with CuO were assessed on the basis of Raman and FT-IR spectroscopic techniques. The obtained diffraction patterns indicated a monoclinic structure for CuO nanorods which was not altered even after the anchoring process over rGO sheets. The electrocatalytic behavior of prepared nanostructures towards the oxidation of hydrazine was evaluated through cyclic voltammetry and amperometry techniques. The experimental results showed that the rGO/CuO composite exhibited a low detection limit of 9.8 nM, wide linear response range from 0.1 to 400 mu M and a sensitivity of 3.87 mu A/mu M.cm(2). Furthermore, the fabricated sensors exhibited constructive characteristics, such as excellent selectivity, good reproducibility and long durability, which suggested their viability in applications as hydrazine sensors.

AB Studies of lateral heterogeneity in cell membranes are important since they help to understand the physical origin of lipid domains and rafts. The simplest membrane mimics are hydrated bilayers composed of saturated and unsaturated lipids. While their atomic structural details resist easy experimental characterization, important insight can be gained via computer modeling. We present the results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for a series of fluid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. Lateral arrangement of lipids in these systems is not random and reveals small geometrical and hydrophobic clusters on the surface. Being "sharp" inside the bilayer, lateral heterogeneity is very 'fuzzy" on the surface. This picture is highly dynamic - lifetimes of clusters are similar to 1 ns. In the binary system, DPPC acts as an "order-preferring" agent, which efficiently modulates behavior of DOPC. Bilayer properties are tuned in a wide range by the chemical nature and relative content of lipids. The impact that the micro-heterogeneity may have on formation of lateral domains in response to external signals is discussed. Understanding of such effects creates a basis for rational design of artificial membranes with predefined properties.

AB Ischemic heart disease (IHD) affects about 16 million adults in the USA. Many more individuals likely harbor subclinical coronary disease. Hypertension (HTN) continues to be a potent and widespread risk factor for IHD. Among other Framingham risk factors of tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy, HTN plays an independent role in augmenting IHD risk, as well as a multiplicative role with respect to adverse outcomes when HTN is present concurrently with the other major IHD risk factors listed above. Over the past two decades, numerous studies and guideline reports have been presented with the aims of (a) elucidating the pathophysiology of IHD, (b) delineating an ideal blood pressure (BP) threshold at which to institute pharmacotherapy, and (c) defining the optimal pharmacologic elements of a therapeutic regimen. While there are active debates surrounding the existence and relevance of the J curve in IHD patients who have HTN, as well as the numerical level of the BP cutoff justifying drug therapy in the general population, there is a general consensus that the BP target in IHD patients should be lower than 140/90mmHg. The most appropriate class (or classes) of medication recommended will depend on the comorbid conditions associated with each individual patient. Overall, however, there is no major evidence underscoring a significant difference between drug classes, provided the target BP is achieved, although it should be pointed out that the most recent (2015) American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Society of Hypertension (ASH) guideline statement now elevates beta-blockers (BB) to the same level of recommendation as other classes of hypertension drugs in the treatment of patients who have hypertension and ischemic heart disease. Although most agents that reduce blood pressure will correspondingly lower myocardial workload, BB may exhibit a special advantage in IHD patients because BB (as well as verapamil and diltiazem subclasses of calcium channel blockers or CCB) act to lower HR as well as cardiac inotropy. Moreover, BB will remain an integral if not indispensable part of the management of IHD, especially in those with history of angina pectoris or MI, based on decades of favorable clinical as well as trial experience. This extensive salutary historical background has served as a foundation for the 2015 committee's decision to bring BB into the front rank of BP agents for those hypertensive individuals suffering simultaneously from IHD.

AB Nowadays the ability to prediction of complex behavior rationally based on the computational approaches has been a successful technique in drug discovery. In the present study interactions of a new series of hybrids, which were made by linking colchicine as a tubulin inhibitor and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) as a HDAC inhibitor, with HDAC8 and HDAC1 were investigated and compared. This research has been facilitated by the availability of experimental information besides employing docking methodology as well as classical molecular dynamics simulations and binding free energy calculation were performed. The obtained findings indicate different modes of interactions and inhibition strengths of the studied inhibitors for HDAC8 and HDAC1. HDAC8 binding free energies (-34.35 to -26.27 kcal/mol) revealed higher binding affinity to HDAC8 compared to HDAC1 (-33.17 to -7.99 kcal/mol). The binding energy contribution of each residue with the hybrid compounds 4a-4e within the active site of HDAC1 and HDAC8 was analyzed and the results confirmed the rule of key amino acids in interaction with the hybrid compounds.

AB The curing reaction process of epoxy-terminated poly(phenylene ether ketone) (E-PEK) with 4,4'-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS) and hexahydrophthalic acid anhydride (Nadic) as curing agents was investigated using isothermal differential scanning calorimetry (IDSC) and nonisothermal differential scanning calorimetry (DDSC) techniques. It was found that the curing reactions of E-PEK/DDS and E-PEK/Nadic are nth-order reactions but not autoaccelerating. The experimental results revealed that the curing reaction kinetics parameters measured from IDSC and DDSC are not equivalent. This means that, in the curing reaction kinetics model for our E-PEK system, both isothermal and nonisothermal reaction kinetics parameters are needed to describe isothermal and nonisothermal curing processes, The isothermal and nonisothermal curing processes were successfully simulated using this model. A new extrapolation method was suggested. On the basis of this method the maximum extent of the curing reaction (A(ult)) that is able to reach a certain temperature can be predicted. The A(ult) for the E-PEK system estimated by the new method agrees well with the results obtained from another procedure reported in the literature. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB In the present paper freely sedimenting n-butanol droplets in water are simulated by means of computational fluid dynamics. The finite-element and the extended finite-element methods were implemented and evaluated. The level-set function is used for capturing the interface movement. The three-dimensional nonstationary simulations included the stages of droplet acceleration, deformation, and stability in terms of shape and velocity. The influence of the grid resolution, the computational domain walls, and the droplet initial velocity was investigated and quantified. The droplet diameters that were studied spanned the region of spherical, deformed, and oscillating droplets. The simulation results were compared to experiments and empirical models in terms of droplet shape, oscillation behavior and terminal velocity, showing good agreement. The extended finite-element method was found to provide simulation results in better accordance to the experiments and empirical models than the conventional finite-element method.

AB The present paper introduces a novel stochastic statistical physics financial system by combining exclusion system with compound Poisson process. The financial system is a model concerning with price fluctuations derived from dissemination of trading attitudes of financial agents and random drastic jumps caused by exogenous economic factors, respectively. Multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis and fuzzy entropy of simulation dataset are performed. Fractional fuzzy entropy based on fuzzy entropy method and fractional calculus, is also developed to explore nonlinear complexity of the proposed model in the paper. Empirical results display that there are significant multifractality and fractal asymmetry in the proposed model, and the complexity of return series increases when lambda or gamma increases, correspondingly. And same analyses for actual stock market dataset are comparatively investigated. The conclusions reveal that the novel compound dynamics can reproduce various nonlinear behaviors of actual stock markets to a certain extent. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper seeks to gain insights on the relationship between growth and employment when considering heterogeneous agents in terms of their working horizon. Using an OECD database, our empirical estimations suggest that growth positively influences the employment rate of workers having a long working horizon (young workers) while negatively influences the employment rate of workers having a short working horizon (senior workers). We then provide theoretical foundations to this result by means of an endogenous job destruction framework a la Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) where we introduce life cycle features. We show that, under the assumption of homogeneous productivity among workers, growth negatively affects the employment rate of workers having a short working horizon before retirement (senior workers) while it positively affects the employment rate of workers having a long working horizon (young workers). Numerical simulations confirm these results, however a non-standard calibration is required to reproduce the elasticity values obtained in our empirical estimations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Extensive exploration of simulation models comes at a high computational cost, all the more when the model involves a lot of parameters. Economists usually rely on random explorations, such as Monte Carlo simulations, and basic econometric modeling to approximate the properties of computational models. This paper aims to provide guidelines for the use of a much more efficient method that combines a parsimonious sampling of the parameter space using a specific design of experiments (DoE), with a well-suited metamodeling method first developed in geostatistics: kriging. We illustrate these guidelines by following them in the analysis of two simple and well known economic models: Nelson and Winter's industrial dynamics model, and Cournot oligopoly with learning firms. In each case, we show that our DoE experiments can catch the main effects of the parameters on the models' dynamics with a much lower number of simulations than the Monte-Carlo sampling (e.g. 85 simulations instead of 2,000 in the first case). In the analysis of the second model, we also introduce supplementary numerical tools that may be combined with this method, for characterizing configurations complying with a specific criterion (social optimal, replication of stylized facts, etc.). Our appendix gives an example of the R-project code that can be used to apply this method on other models, in order to encourage other researchers to quickly test this approach on their models.

AB Soil strength is an influential property in determining agricultural and geotechnical outcomes. In uniaxial compression test the strength of artificial aggregates containing different proportions of kaolinite (cementing agent) and feldspar (skeletal particles) was determined in uniaxial compression test, and empirical model of aggregates breakage was constructed. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and bulk density (BD) measurements, structural parameters influencing the aggregates strength were estimated. Next the strength of the aggregates was simulated by discrete elements (DEM) coupled with parallel bonds (BPM) model. The structure of the aggregates was approximated as spherical silt particles joined by kaolinite bonds, similarly as it appeared in SEM images. Real breakage curves and failure development were satisfactorily simulated for aggregates in which kaolinite filled not more than their total pore space. The microparameters of interactions inside the aggregate (mean bond normal and tangent forces and critical bond force) provided links between the modeled and real physical interactions (Young's modulus and the compressive strength) resulting from aggregate formation.

AB In this paper, a stress and coping perspective is used to outline the processes that determine employee adaptation to organisational change. A theoretical framework that simultaneously considers the effects of event characteristics, situational appraisals, coping strategies, and coping resources is reviewed, Three empirical investigations of organisational change that have tested various components of the model are then presented. In the first study, there was evidence linking event characteristics, situational appraisals, coping strategies and coping resources to levels of employee adjustment in a sample of pilots employed in a newly merged airline company. In a more focused test of the model with a sample of employees experiencing a restructuring process in their Organisation it was found that the provision of change-related information enhanced levels of efficacy to deal with the change process which, in turn, predicted psychological wellbeing, client engagement, and job satisfaction. In a study of managers affected by a new remuneration scheme, there was evidence to suggest that managers who received change-specific information and opportunities to participate in the change process reported higher levels of change readiness. Managers who reported higher levels of readiness for change also reported higher levels of psychological wellbeing and job satisfaction. These studies highlight ways in which managers and change agents can help employees to cope during times of organisational change.

ID EMOTIONAL CONTAGION
AB In social psychology, emotional contagion describes the widely observed phenomenon of one person's emotions being influenced by surrounding people's emotions. While the overall effect is agreed upon, the underlying mechanism of the spread of emotions has seen little quantification and application to computational agents despite extensive evidence of its impacts in everyday life. In this paper, we examine computational models of emotional contagion by implementing two models (Bosse et al., European council on modeling and simulation, pp. 212-218, 2009) and Durupinar, From audiences to mobs: Crowd simulation with psychological factors, PhD dissertation, Bilkent University, 2010) that draw from two separate lines of contagion research: thermodynamics-based and epidemiological-based. We first perform sensitivity tests on each model in an evacuation simulation, ESCAPES, showing both models to be reasonably robust to parameter variations with certain exceptions. We then compare their ability to reproduce a real crowd panic scene in simulation, showing that the thermodynamics-style model (Bosse et al., European council on modeling and simulation, pp. 212-218, 2009) produces superior results due to the ill-suited contagion mechanism at the core of epidemiological models. We also identify that a graduated effect of fear and proximity-based contagion effects are key to producing the superior results. We then reproduce the methodology on a second video, showing that the same results hold, implying generality of the conclusions reached in the first scene.

TI Models of Emergency Departments for Reducing Patient Waiting Times
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, we apply both agent-based models and queuing models to investigate patient access and patient flow through emergency departments. The objective of this work is to gain insights into the comparative contributions and limitations of these complementary techniques, in their ability to contribute empirical input into healthcare policy and practice guidelines. The models were developed independently, with a view to compare their suitability to emergency department simulation. The current models implement relatively simple general scenarios, and rely on a combination of simulated and real data to simulate patient flow in a single emergency department or in multiple interacting emergency departments. In addition, several concepts from telecommunications engineering are translated into this modeling context. The framework of multiple-priority queue systems and the genetic programming paradigm of evolutionary machine learning are applied as a means of forecasting patient wait times and as a means of evolving healthcare policy, respectively. The models' utility lies in their ability to provide qualitative insights into the relative sensitivities and impacts of model input parameters, to illuminate scenarios worthy of more complex investigation, and to iteratively validate the models as they continue to be refined and extended. The paper discusses future efforts to refine, extend, and validate the models with more data and real data relative to physical (spatial-topographical) and social inputs (staffing, patient care models, etc.). Real data obtained through proximity location and tracking system technologies is one example discussed.

AB Global climate change (GCC) is projected to bring higher-intensity precipitation and higher-variability temperature regimes to the Northeastern United States. The interactive effects of GCC with anthropogenic land use and land cover changes (LULCCs) are unknown for watershed level hydrological dynamics and nutrient fluxes to freshwater lakes. Increased nutrient fluxes can promote harmful algal blooms, also exacerbated by warmer water temperatures due to GCC. To address the complex interactions of climate, land and humans, we developed a cascading integrated assessment model to test the impacts of GCC and LULCC on the hydrological regime, water temperature, water quality, bloom duration and severity through 2040 in transnational Lake Champlain's Missisquoi Bay. Temperature and precipitation inputs were statistically downscaled from four global circulation models (GCMs) for three Representative Concentration Pathways. An agent-based model was used to generate four LULCC scenarios. Combined climate and LULCC scenarios drove a distributed hydrological model to estimate river discharge and nutrient input to the lake. Lake nutrient dynamics were simulated with a 3D hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. We find accelerated GCC could drastically limit land management options to maintain water quality, but the nature and severity of this impact varies dramatically by GCM and GCC scenario.

AB Contrast injection protocol is known to affect the estimation of kinetic parameters in functional CT. A novel method is proposed to maximize the precision of parameter estimates by modulating the contrast injection scheme. The method models the intravenous contrast bolus to be dispersed by a "patient function" to give rise to the arterial input function, which, in turn, carries the contrast agent to tissue leading to contrast enhancement. The covariance matrix analysis was applied to calculate the uncertainty of parameter estimates as the coefficients of variation (CV) in the adiabatic tissue homogeneity (ATH), two-compartment, and the modified Kety model in which tumor pathophysiology is modeled. An optimization scheme was used to determine the optimal injection protocol which would minimize the CV of a particular kinetic parameter. For clinical utility, a recommended injection protocol was suggested from a statistical analysis with the optimal injection protocols obtained from the first group of 12 patients with cervix cancer. The efficacy of the recommended injection protocol was tested with a second group of 12 patients. In addition, the robustness of the recommended injection protocol to longitudinal study has been investigated in the presence of variations in arterial input function and tumor pathophysiology. Based on the data of the second group of patients, and using the ATH model, the recommended biphasic injection of two boluses improves the precision in the estimation of blood flow and mean transit time (MTT), by 36.9% and 38.4%, respectively, compared to the standard uniphasic injection protocol in the CV. However, measurement of the permeability surface area product and extravascular extracellular space volume favors a single fast bolus of the same contrast amount. The two-compartment model and the modified Kety model also benefited from the single fast bolus. The effect of variation in the arterial input function and tumor pathophysiology on the applicability of the recommended injection was also investigated. Based on computer simulation for a range of variations in the arterial input function and pathophysiology, the recommended biphasic injection was found to improve the precision in blood flow and MTT estimates by 31.4% and 36.5% on average, respectively, compared to the uniphasic injection.

AB The hypothesis that an effective protection of progeny chickens against inclusion body hepatitis/hydropericardium syndrome (IBH/HP) can be achieved by dual vaccination of breeders with fowl adenovirus (FAV) serotype 4 and chicken anemia virus (CAV) was tested. Thus, 17-wk-old brown leghorn pullet groups were vaccinated by different schemes including single FAV (inactivated), single CAV (attenuated), FAV and CAV dually, or were not vaccinated (controls). Subsequent progenies of these breeders were challenged with the virulent strains FAV-341 and CAV-10343 following three strategies: 1) FAV-341 intramuscularly (i.m.) at day 10 of age (only FAV-vaccinated and control progenies); 2) FAV + CAV i.m. simultaneously at day 10 of age (all, progenies); 3) CAV i.m. at day I and FAV orally at day 10 of age (all progenies). The induction of IBH/HP in these progenies was evaluated throughout a 10-day period. Both breeder groups vaccinated against FAV and those vaccinated against CAV increased virus neutralizing specific antibodies. Challenge strategy I showed 26.6% mortality in control progeny chickens and 13.3% in the progeny of FAV-vaccinated breeders. Presence of lesions in the liver of these groups showed no significant differences (P>0.05), suggesting a discreet protective effect of the vaccine. Challenge strategy 2 showed 29.4% mortality in controls and 94% of chickens showed hepatic inclusion bodies (HIB). Single CAV vaccination of breeders did not demonstrate a beneficial effect, with both mortality and liver lesions resembling the nonvaccinated controls. FAV vaccination of breeders significantly reduced both mortality (7.4%) and liver lesions (26% HIB) (P<0.05), providing protection against this challenge strategy. Dual vaccination of breeders with FAV and CAV proved to be necessary to achieve maximum protection of the progeny (no mortality and 7% HIB). Challenge strategy 3 produced no mortality but consistent liver damage in controls (96% HIB). In this case, both CAV and FAV + CAV-vaccinated breeders showed best protection results in terms of liver histopathology (8% and 0% HIB, respectively). FAV vaccination alone produced 24% HIB, similar to challenge strategy 2, demonstrating a lower protective effect.

AB A significant body of research investigates whether intraindustry competitors hold a common pattern of beliefs (or schema). Some work suggests that socially constructed shared beliefs, not technology-based economic factors, determine industry structure. While research on managerial cognition is important because it helps strategy researchers incorporate bounded rationality into otherwise hyper-rational theories, we take issue with the notion that the social construction works independently of economic factors. Empirical studies looking for shared beliefs find conflicting results. Some work suggests that managers in an industry, share a common set of beliefs; other work finds the opposite (managers do not share common beliefs). Understanding, if and to what extent, managerial cognition influences industry structure and competitive heterogeneity would greatly expand our understanding of strategy and firm performance. We model bounded rationality, cognition (belief formation), competition (economic restraints), and industry structure (competitive heterogeneity). We find that competitive pressure and bounded rationality induce agents (firms or managers) to focus their attention on nearby competitors. Thus,firms develop biased estimates of their competitive environment. These estimates correlate with the estimates of nearby firms. Thus, clusters of firms will have similar beliefs resulting in stable strategic and performance heterogeneity within an industry. However, as competitive pressures and the costs of strategic change decrease, managerial beliefs tend to converge, and the pattern of strategies that emerges is consistent with those predicted by economic theory, even under conditions of bounded rationality.

AB Mammalian predator foraging behavior is an important, but understudied determinant of avian nest success. Predator behavior may also affect the nest-site selection decisions of females: when predators respond strongly to prey density (e.g. through area-restricted search), the optimal strategy may be for birds to disperse their nests widely across the landscape. Conversely, clustered nests may benefit from dilution effects in the presence of incidental nest predators. In dabbling ducks, nest distributions range from clustered to dispersed and there is conflicting evidence about whether clustering enhances or reduces nest success, although presumably this depends on predator behavior. Here, I present results from an agent-based model designed to answer two qualitative questions: are clustered nests more or less successful than dispersed nests, and how does that relative benefit vary depending on predator behavior? I modeled three types of waterfowl nest predators (to emulate the foraging behavior of skunks and foxes) that differ in their degree of spatial memory and their capacity for area-restricted search, foraging on different distributions of nests. As hypothesized, well-dispersed nests survived better with fox-like predators that performed area-restricted searches. On the other hand, clustered nests survived better when incidental skunk-like predators were present, but survival was dramatically reduced in the presence of foxes; thus, small changes in the predator community (e.g. introduction of foxes) without commensurate changes in nest clustering could have important effects on waterfowl populations. On simulated landscapes containing both clustered and dispersed nests and a mixed predator community, average nest success for clustered versus randomly placed nests was the same across possible predator mixes, but the variance in success for clustered nests was much higher; this suggests that there may be risk-reward tradeoffs when nesting near conspecifics. That said, the degree to which ducks can actually assess and respond to the presence of conspecifics is largely unknown, and it is believed that nest sites are selected based on habitat. Results from this model, combined with empirical data suggest that commonly used management strategies that promote nest clustering, such as restoration of small parcels of habitat, can actually create ecological traps for nesting ducks, driven by predator behavior.

AB Nanomaterials have revolutionized modern science and technology due to their multiple applications in engineering, physics, chemistry, and biomedicine. Nevertheless, the use and manipulation of nanoparticles (NPs) can bring serious damages to living organisms and their ecosystems. For this reason, ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity assays are of special interest in order to determine the potential harmful effects of NPs. Processes based on ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity tests can significantly consume time and financial resources. In this sense, alternative approaches such as quantitative structure-activity/toxicity relationships (QSAR/QSTR) modeling have provided important insights for the better understanding of the biological behavior of NPs that may be responsible for causing toxicity. Until now, QSAR/QSTR models have predicted ecotoxicity or cytotoxicity separately against only one organism (bioindicator species or cell line) and have not reported information regarding the quantitative influence of characteristics other than composition or size. In this work, we developed a unified QSTR-perturbation model to simultaneously probe ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity of NPs under different experimental conditions, including diverse measures of toxicities, multiple biological targets, compositions, sizes and conditions to measure those sizes, shapes, times during which the biological targets were exposed to NPs, and coating agents. The model was created from 36488 cases (NP-NP pairs) and exhibited accuracies higher than 98% in both training and prediction sets. The model was used to predict toxicities of several NPs that were not included in the original data set. The results of the predictions suggest that the present QSTR-perturbation model can be employed as a highly promising tool for the fast and efficient assessment of ecotoxicity and cytotoxicity of NPs.

AB We recently reported that immune stimulation can be compromised if animals are simultaneously subjected to stressful conditions. To test the generalizability of these findings, and to elucidate neuroendocrine mediating mechanisms, we herein employed CpG-C, a novel TLR-9 immune-stimulating agent. Animals were subjected to ongoing stress (20-h of wet cage exposure) during CpG-C treatment, and antagonists to glucocorticoids, beta-adrenoceptor, COX2, or opioids were employed (RU486, nadolol, etodolac, naltrexone). In F344 rats, marginating-pulmonary NK cell numbers and cytotoxicity were studied, and the NK-sensitive MADB106 experimental metastasis model was used. In Balb/C mice, experimental hepatic metastases of the CT-26 colon tumor were studied; and in C57BL/6J mice, survival rates following excision of B16 melanoma was assessed - both mouse tumor models involved surgical stress. The findings indicated that simultaneous blockade of glucocorticoid and beta-adrenergic receptors improved CpG-C efficacy against MADB106 metastasis. In mice bearing B16 melanoma, long-term survival rate was improved by CpG-C only when employed simultaneously with blockers of glucocorticoids, catecholamines, and prostaglandins. Prolonged stress impaired CpG-C efficacy in potentiating NK activity, and in resisting MADB106 metastasis in both sexes, as also supported by in vitro studies. This latter effect was not blocked by any of the antagonists or by adrenalectomy. In the CT26 model, prolonged stress only partially reduced the efficacy of CpG-C. Overall, our findings indicate that ongoing behavioral stress and surgery can jeopardize immune-stimulatory interventions and abolish their beneficial metastasis reducing impacts. These findings have implications for the clinical setting, which often involve psychological and physiological stress responses during immune-stimulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Self-assembled nucleo-peptide hydrogels have a nanofibril structure composed of noncovalent molecular interactions between peptide groups as well as pi-pi stacking and Watson-Crick interactions via complementary nucleobases. These hydrogels have specific benefits for biomedical applications due to their DNA-like interactions in addition to the well-known advantages of peptide biomaterials: biocompatibility, extracellular matrix (ECM)-like structure, and bottom-up design. Inspired by the nucleobase stacking structure, we hypothesized that nucleo-peptides would be able to deliver the DNA-intercalating chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin (Dox) in a sustained manner when delivered locally to a solid tumor. Ade-FFF nucleo-peptide hydrogels were able to load a high concentration of Dox (1 mM) and demonstrated continuous release under in vitro degradation conditions. We adopted an in vivo tumor-bearing mouse model to evaluate the delivery of Dox by Ade-FFF hydrogels. We found that Dox-containing hydrogels reduced tumor growth and resulted in greater apoptosis-mediated cell death in the tumor as evidenced by caspase-3 expression. Pharmacokinetics and biodistribution studies also supported the observation that Dox delivery by an Ade-FFF hydrogel improves sustained delivery in the local tumor site. This study demonstrates the potential of self-assembled nucleo-peptides in biomedical applications by using their distinctive DNA-like structure.

AB Ceria (CeO2) crystalline compound is widely used as a catalyst or catalyst support and many other applications. However, the studies are continuing with a view to improving existing methods and/or developing innovative routes to obtain well -controlled shapes and sizes of ceria nanoparticles. In the present study, we report an original method to synthesize ceria nanoparticles (CeO2 and CeO2-X) by using two independent stages: (1) the precipitation of bastnasite-rich material under hydrothermal conditions (90 and 300 degrees C) and (2) the calcination of powdered basnasite-rich material at different temperatures (500, 1000 and 1600 degrees C) and under different atmospheres (air, Ar, N-2 and secondary vacuum). In addition, simultaneous thermal analyses (TGA/DSC) coupled with gas chromatography (mu GC/MS) were performed in order to investigate on the ceria formation during bastnasite de -carbonation and its thermal behavior at high temperature (until 1600 degrees C) under three different gas atmospheres (air, Ar and N-2). Herein, ceria was in -situ formed independently on the gas investigated atmosphere. This means that sufficient oxygen was also available in the so-called inert atmospheres (Ar and N-2) to oxidize the Ce(III) contained in Ce-carbonates to Ce(IV) constituting ceria cubic structure. Moreover, mu GC/MS measurements confirm that in-situ formed ceria CeO2 at about 600 degrees C is then partially reduced to CeO2-x at high temperature after 1000 degrees C because an increase in oxygen was clearly detected in expelled gas during heating process. This fundamental experimental study provides the hydrothermal conditions to which Ce fluorocarbonates could be formed in natural environments. In addition, new experimental conditions to produce ceria with oxygen vacancies CeO2-X without reducing gas agent and at lower temperature are also provided in this study. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB A detailed sensitivity analysis is performed on a one-dimensional fixed bed downdraft biomass gasification model. The aim of this work is to analyze how the heat transfer mechanisms and rates are affected as reaction front progresses along the bed with its main reactive stages (drying, pyrolysis, combustion and reduction) under auto-thermal conditions. To this end, a batch type fixed-bed gasifier was simulated and used to study process propagation velocity of biomass gasification. The previously proposed model was validated with experimental data as a function of particle size. The model was capable of predicting coherently the physicochemical processes of gasification allowing an agreement between experimental and calculated data with an average error of 8%. Model sensitivity to parametric changes in several model and process parameters was evaluated by analyzing their effect on heat transfer mechanisms of reaction front (solid-gas, bed-wall and radiative in the solid phase) and key response variables (temperature field, maximum solid and gas temperatures inside the bed, flame front velocity, biomass consumption and fuel/air ratio). The model coefficients analyzed were the solid-gas heat transfer, radiation absorption, bed-wall heat transfer, pyrolysis kinetic rates and reactor-environment heat transfer. On the other hand, particle size, bed void fraction, air intake temperature, gasifying agent composition and gasifier wall material were analyzed as process parameters. The solid-gas heat transfer coefficient (0.02 < correction factor < 1.0) and particle size (4 < diameter < 30 mm) were the most significant parameters affecting process behavior. They led to variations of 88% and 68% in process velocity, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Gatifloxacin (Tequin(R), Kyorin Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd) is a new fluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity for pathogens implicated in community-acquired respiratory tract infections, including Gram-positive, -negative and atypical bacteria. Excellent oral bioavailability, a half-life allowing once-daily administration and excellent penetration into respiratory tissues are desirable pharmacokinetic characteristics of gatifloxacin. Monte Carlo simulation of gatifloxacin in Streptococcus pneumoniae infection demonstrates that adequate levels of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters are obtained with gatifloxacin in almost all instances. In randomised, controlled trials and a large open-label, community-based study, gatifloxacin has shown excellent clinical and bacteriological efficacy in acute bacterial sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and community-acquired pneumonia. Current guidelines recommend the initial empiric use of gatifloxacin (along with the other new fluoroquinolones) for community-acquired respiratory tract infection in patients who have increased likelihood of infection with resistant pathogens. Another group of patients where this agent is recommended for initial antimicrobial therapy are those who, because of underlying disease and/or comorbid conditions, need an antibiotic with high antimicrobial efficacy to achieve optimal outcomes.

AB The important point to mold a heat swelling microcapsule is to disperse uniformly without destroying a micro-balloon in the molded article. Accordingly the optimization of the steam pressure of the foaming reagent, the diffusion to the shell polymer, the heat-resistance of the shell polymer and character of gas barrier for is required. According to the technique of the multivariate analysis, the statistical model was designed and constructed for the foaming start temperature (T,) and the maximum foaming temperature (T-max), using the raw material value of the microcapsule which has core/shell structure, grain diameter distribution and for the stirring conditions. The faction to influence the T-s and T-max could be specified by use of the statistical model. The core/shell constitution lowering the diffusion coefficient was applied to statistic models. It was necessary to use the increase of core weight, the cross-linking agent with low functional group in the presence of sodium hydroxide, simultaneously, and a narrow size distribution of the polymer in order to form the polymer at high temperature. In addition to, rotation number under polymerization conditions was found to influence the forming character.

AB Ten-mo-old broiler feeders were fed nicarbazin (NCZ) at 0, 25, 50, and 100 ppm of their diet for 2, 4, or 6 days to simulate accidental contamination of their feed with the medicant.  Reduced egg production was observed in all treatments except 25 and 50 ppm NCZ for 2 days.  A consistent reduction in egg weight occurred only at the maximum treatment level of 100 ppm for 6 days.  Reduction in hatchability was generally evident by Days 5 and 6 of the experiment except for the lowest treatment of 25 ppm NCZ for 2 days.  Due partially to the low number of eggs set, no statistically significant reduction in hatchability was seen for the group receiving 50 ppm NCZ for 4 days, but hatchability had dropped over 17 percentage points (from 93.3 to 75.5%) by Days 5 and 6 of the experiment, and continued to drop to a low of 31% on Days 11 and 12 of the experiment.  Shell pigmentation was the most sensitive characteristic measured, with significant depigmentation occurring after only 2 days of feeding 25 ppm NCZ.  Generally, the severity and duration of effects were in proportion to medicant concentration and length of treatment time.  Fertility was not influenced by the medicant.

TI Orphenadrine-induced convulsive status epilepticus in rats responds to

AB Background: Identification of new molecular targets as well as the new models recapitulating different aspects of pathophysiology of status epilepticus (SE) in humans might prove essential for the breakthrough in the efforts against pharmacoresistance in epilepsy. Recently, we described a new model of generalized convulsive SE induced with orphenadrine (ORPH) in rats with unique characteristics [5]. The current study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of a new generation antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and some of the experimental agents in suppressing ORPH-evoked seizures in rats.
   Methods: ORPH was administered intraperitoneally (ip) in the dose of 80 mg/kg in male Wistar rats. The latency to first seizure, the number of seizure episodes and the duration of overt SE, as well as the incidence of deaths was scored with simultaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings.
   Results: ORPH induced seizures in 100% of animals at a dose of 80 mg/kg, associated with low mortality and good behavioural outcome. Among new generation AEDs: felbamate, levetiracetam, topiramate, lamotrigine and progabide did not affect the seizure incidence. Among the experimental drugs, only dizocilpine, the non-competitive NMDA antagonist, dose-dependently affected the occurrence of the SE (p < 0.001). However, CGP-39551 competitive NMDA antagonist, the same as scopolamine and mecamylamine (muscarinic and nictotinic receptors antagonists, respectively) showed no effect.
   Conclusions: Based on the above findings, one may speculate that NMDA activation is partly involved in the proconvulsant activity of orphenadrine but may not be the primary pathomechanism. ORPH-induced seizures may provide an interesting option for studying novel targets for pharmacological interventions in status epilepticus.

AB Neuraminidase (NA) is one of the particular potential targets for novel antiviral therapy. In this work, a series of neuraminidase inhibitors with the cyclohexene scaffold were studied based upon the combination of 3D-QSAR, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics techniques. The results indicate that the built 3D-QSAR models yield reliable statistical information: the correlation coefficient (r(2)) and cross-validation coefficient (q(2)) of CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) are 0.992 and 0.819; the r(2) and q(2) of CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity analysis) are 0.992 and 0.863, respectively. Molecular docking and MD simulations were conducted to confirm the detailed binding mode of enzyme-inhibitor system. The new NA inhibitors had been designed, synthesized, and their inhibitory activities against group-1 neuraminidase were determined. One agent displayed excellent neuraminidase inhibition, with IC50 value of 39.6 mu M against NA, while IC50 value for oseltamivir is 61.1 mu M. This compound may be further investigated for the treatment of infection by the new type influenza virus. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB To study the relation between replicon initiation and nuclear organization of DNA, mouse erythroleukemia F4N cells were irradiated with Co-60 source and the rates of initiation of DNA synthesis were determined by a sensitive assay based on the introduction of Trioxsalen cross-links in DNA in vivo and determination of the amount of short nascent DNA fragments synthesized between the cross-links, In parallel, nuclear organization of DNA was monitored using the nucleoid sedimentation technique, The results show that DNA initiation rate and relative nucleoid sedimentation change sharply and simultaneously at doses of about 1 Gy, which suggests the existence of relationship between them, This suggestion was supported by the finding, that during the after-irradiation period, first DNA organization was restored and only after this process had been completed, the restoration of replicon initiation commenced, When cells were treated with novobiocin, an agent that is known to slow down the recovery of nucleoid sedimentation rate, initiation of DNA synthesis was also postponed, A hypothesis is put forward that replicon clusters represent groups of adjacent DNA loops organized in superloop domains and that the intact superloop domain structure is necessary for activation of the cluster.

AB Experimental data have shown that the solubility of water in the oleic (L) phase (x(wL)) can be significant at elevated temperatures. However, x(wL) was not properly considered in prior studies of steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) and expanding-solvent (ES)-SAGD. The main objective of this research is to present a detailed study of compositional mechanisms in SAGD and ES-SAGD simulation by considering x(wL).
   The phase-behavior models used in this research are carefully created on the basis of experimental studies presented in the literature. Mechanistic simulation studies are then conducted for SAGD and ES-SAGD. Coinjectants used in ES-SAGD simulations range from propane through n-decane.
   Results show that x(wL) enhances bitumen production in both SAGD and ES-SAGD, mainly because x(wL) results in reduction of L-phase viscosity. The enhancement is more significant when the chamber-edge temperature is higher, because x(wL) increases with temperature. The enhancement of bitumen production observed in the case studies is 7.66% for SAGD, 4.08% for n-C-6-SAGD, and 4.85% for n-C-8-SAGD for a fixed period of operation at 35 bar. It is important to consider x(wL) in SAGD and ES-SAGD simulations, because the performance of ES-SAGD relative to SAGD tends to be overestimated without considering x(wL).
   A guideline is presented to leverage x(wL) to improve bitumen production in ES-SAGD. As discussed in our prior research, solvent becomes effective in diluting bitumen and reducing the steam requirement only when it sufficiently accumulates near the chamber edge. New results show that water can act as a diluting agent until solvent sufficiently accumulates near the chamber edge.

AB Binding modes of a series of catechol derivatives such as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) inhibitors were identified by molecular modeling techniques. Docking, molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations were employed to determine the modes of these new inhibitors. Binding free energies were calculated by involving different energy components using the Molecular Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area and Generalized Born Surface Area methods. Relatively larger binding energies were obtained for the catechol derivatives compared to one of the PTP1B inhibitors already in use. The Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) free energy decomposition analysis indicated that the hydroxyl functional groups and biphenyl ring system had favorable interactions with Met258, Tyr46, Gln262 and Phe182 residues of PTP1B. The results of hydrogen bound analysis indicated that catechol derivatives, in addition to hydrogen bonding interactions, Val49, Ile219, Gln266, Asp181 and amino acid residues of PTP1B are responsible for governing the inhibitor potency of the compounds. The information generated from the present study should be useful for the design of more potent PTP1B inhibitors as anti-diabetic agents.

AB The risk characterization method employed by US EPA to quantitatively characterize the benefits of the Groundwater Rule (GWR) for drinking water computes person-to-person transmission intensity as the product of the number of primary illnesses and a static secondary morbidity factor. A population level infectious disease health effects model is used here to evaluate the implications of secondary transmission on exposures to viruses that are relevant to the GWR. These implications are evaluated via a hypothetical case study in which it is assumed that a tour group from a large population centre visits an outlying area that is served by a non-community water system with untreated or inadequately treated groundwater that is contaminated with a highly infectious virus. It is assumed that some of the exposed individuals become infected and then return home. Numerical simulations are used to estimate the subsequent number of additional infections and illnesses due to secondary transmission within the large community. The results indicate that secondary transmission could substantially impact the predicted benefits of the GWR depending on the suite of population dynamic elements and assumptions employed.

AB Here, for the first time, we show that with addition of a biological buffer, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), into aqueous solutions of tetrahydrofuran (THF), 1,3-dioxolane, 1,4-dioxane, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, tert-butanol, acetonitrile, or acetone, the organic solvent can be excluded from water to form a new liquid phase. The phase diagrams have been determined at ambient temperature. In order to understand why and how a zwitterion solute (HEPES) induced phase separation of the investigated systems, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies are performed for HEPES + water + THF system. The MD simulations were conducted for the aqueous mixtures with 12 different compositions. The reliability of the simulation results of HEPES in pure water and beyond the phase separation mixtures was justified by comparing the densities obtained from MD with the experimental values. The simulation results of HEPES in pure THF and in a composition inside the phase separation region were justified qualitatively. Interestingly, all HEPES molecules entirely aggregated in pure THF. This reveals that HEPES is insoluble in pure THF, which is consistent with the experimental results. Even more interestingly, the MD simulation for the mixture with composition inside the phase separation region showed the formation of two phases. The THF molecules are squeezed out from the water network into a new liquid phase. The hydrogen bonds (HBs), HB lifetime, HB Gibbs energy (Delta G), radial distribution functions (RDFs), coordination numbers (CNs), electrostatic interactions, and the van der Waals interactions between the different species have been analyzed. Further, MD simulations for the other phase separation systems by choosing a composition inside the two liquids region for each system were also simulated. Our findings will therefore pave the way for designing new benign separation auxiliary agents.

AB Motivation: The reliable identification of presence or absence of biological agents ("targets"), such as viruses or bacteria, is crucial for many applications from health care to biodiversity. If genomic sequences of targets are known, hybridization reactions between oligonucleotide probes and targets performed on suitable DNA microarrays will allow to infer presence or absence from the observed pattern of hybridization. Targets, for example all known strains of HIV, are often closely related and finding unique probes becomes impossible. The use of non-unique oligonucleotides with more advanced decoding techniques from statistical group testing allows to detect known targets with great success. Of great relevance, however, is the problem of identifying the presence of previously unknown targets or of targets that evolve rapidly.
   Results: We present the first approach to decode hybridization experiments using non-unique probes when targets are related by a phylogenetic tree. Using a Bayesian framework and a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach we are able to identify over 94% of known targets and assign up to 70% of unknown targets to their correct clade in hybridization simulations on biological and simulated data.

AB The organocatalytic controlled/living ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of monofunctional cyclotrisiloxanes using water or silanols as initiators, guanidines as catalysts, and organochlorosilanes as end-capping agents produced side-chain-functionalized linear polysiloxanes with controlled number-average molar mass (M-n), narrow molar-mass dispersity (D-M), the desired terminal structures, and good distribution of the side-chain functionalities, namely, vinyl, 3-chloropropyl, and allyl groups. The synthesis of monofunctional cyclotrisiloxanes, such as vinylpentamethylcyclotrisiloxane, (3-chloropropyl)-pentamethylcyclotrisiloxane, and allylpentamethylcyclotrisiloxane was achieved by the reaction of 1,3-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane and diacetoxysilanes using simple synthetic procedures. Control over the composition and monomeric sequences of the resulting side-chain-functionalized polysiloxanes was conveniently achieved using either polymerization or copolymerization and varying the initial feed ratio of the two monomers and the timing of monomer addition, i.e., using either the premix or two-stage method, in the copolymerizations. Analysis of the monomeric sequence using Si-29{H-1} NMR measurements revealed that the propagation reaction with VD2, CIPD2, and AD2 proceeded almost completely via a statistical manner. Plausible monomeric sequences and chain-length distributions of the resulting side-chain-functionalized polysiloxanes were visualized using two simulation methods.

ID PENILE ERECTION; SEXUAL FUNCTION; PAROXETINE; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; RABBITS
AB Objectives. To assess the efficacy of the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, DA-8159, in selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced rat erectile dysfunction model by measuring intracavernous pressure (ICP).
   Methods. Erectile dysfunction was induced by oral administration of either paroxetine or fluoxetine in rats. The changes in ICP and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were simultaneously recorded throughout electrostimulation of the cavernous nerve with 2 or 10 Hz after intravenous injection of DA-8159 (1 mg/kg). Statistical analysis was performed on the ICP/MAP ratio and the area under the curve of the ICP/MAP ratio.
   Results. Although the reduction in the ICP responses after acute paroxetine or fluoxetine administration was statistically significant, the electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve induced a statistically significant, frequency-dependent increase in the ICP/MAP ratio after DA-8159 administration. The differences in the ICP/MAP ratio and corresponding area under the curve values from the SSRI-treated group were statistically significant.
   Conclusions. The results of the present study have demonstrated that DA-8159 reverses the decrease in ICP induced by SSRI treatment, suggesting that DA-8159 may be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of erectile dysfunction associated with the use of SSRIs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB Dementias are neurodegenerative and progressive diseases of the central nervous system. The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of potentially inappropriate prescriptions of antipsychotics in a group of patients diagnosed with dementia in Colombia. This was a cross-sectional study based on a population database for drug dispensing that identified prescriptions of antidementia drugs, antipsychotics, and other drugs for patients with a diagnosis of dementia. Descriptive statistics and bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed. A total of 11,372 patients with dementia were identified; 66.6% were women, and the mean age was 80.5 +/- 9.6 years. Alzheimer's disease was the most frequent diagnosis (76.6%). A total of 69.0% of patients received antidementia drugs. A total of 37.1% of patients received some antipsychotic, especially atypical antipsychotics (31.0%). Increased age, being treated with memantine, simultaneously presenting with anxiety, depression, and psychotic disorders, and concomitantly receiving anticonvulsants, bronchodilators and benzodiazepines were associated with a greater probability of being prescribed antipsychotics. More than one-third of patients with dementia received antipsychotic prescriptions, which are considered potentially inappropriate because they can worsen cognitive decline and favor the occurrence of adverse events.

AB Patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) were asked to identify the agent of the action in orally presented sentences with subject-relative or object-relative center-embedded clauses while simultaneously performing a secondary task that was less resource-demanding (finger tapping) or more resource-demanding (recognition span). We found that a subgroup of PD patients with impaired sentence comprehension at baseline (no secondary task) did not differ from random in their accuracy understanding all types of sentences during the more demanding (recognition span) condition and also had difficulty understanding the most complex sentences during the less demanding (finger tapping) condition. Control subjects and PD patients without baseline sentence comprehension difficulty were random only in their comprehension of the most complex sentences under the more demanding (recognition span) secondary task condition. Examination of response latencies for accurately understood sentences revealed only an effect for the type of sentence, and this was equally evident across all groups of subjects and regardless of the condition under which the sentences were administered. The sensitivity of PD patients' sentence comprehension accuracy to secondary task resource demands is most consistent with the hypothesis that limited cognitive resources contribute to sentence comprehension difficulty in PD.

AB This study compared the effects of using two T-cell depleting antibodies, alemtuzumab (anti-CD 52, Campath-1H((R))) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (Thymoglobulin((R))), as induction immunosuppression for recipients of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation given a prednisone-free maintenance regimen. We used a single-center, nonrandomised, retrospective, sequential study design to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alemtuzumab (n = 50) or antithymocyte globulin (n = 38) induction in combination with a prednisone-free, tacrolimus/sirolimus-based immunosuppression protocol. Kaplan-Meier analyses of long-term patient and graft survivals and rejection rates were determined according to induction agent. Secondary endpoints included the quality of renal allograft function, incidence of infectious and malignant complications, and cost considerations. Overall long-term patient and graft survival rates did not significantly differ between patients treated with alemtuzumab and antithymocyte globulin. Rejection rates were also nearly equivalent at 1 and 2 years. Viral infectious complications were statistically significantly lower in the alemtuzumab group. The cost of alemtuzumab induction was lower than antithymocyte globulin. Alemtuzumab induction followed by steroid-free maintenance therapy with a tacrolimus/sirolimus-based immunosuppression regimen provided an effective, safe and cost-conscious approach to SPK transplantation.

AB As indicated early by Charles Darwin, languages behave and change very much like living species. They display high diversity, differentiate in space and time, emerge and disappear. A large body of literature has explored the role of information exchanges and communicative constraints in groups of agents under selective scenarios. These models have been very helpful in providing a rationale on how complex forms of communication emerge under evolutionary pressures. However, other patterns of large-scale organization can be described using mathematical methods ignoring communicative traits. These approaches consider shorter time scales and have been developed by exploiting both theoretical ecology and statistical physics methods. The models are reviewed here and include extinction, invasion, origination, spatial organization, coexistence and diversity as key concepts and are very simple in their defining rules. Such simplicity is used in order to catch the most fundamental laws of organization and those universal ingredients responsible for qualitative traits. The similarities between observed and predicted patterns indicate that an ecological theory of language is emerging, supporting (on a quantitative basis) its ecological nature, although key differences are also present. Here, we critically review some recent advances and outline their implications and limitations as well as highlight problems for future research.

AB Objectives: The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the effects of simulated pulpal pressure (PP) and moist bonding (MB) on the shear bond strength of three different dentine bonding systems (DBSs). Methods: Dentine surfaces were exposed on 120 extracted human molars and bonded with one out of three restorative systems (A.R.T. Bond/Brilliant, OptiBond FL/Herculite XRV, Scotchbond 1/Z100). In one-half of the specimens, the DBSs were applied under hydrostatic pulpal pressure of 30 cm H2O (PP). Forty specimens were prepared for each DBS according to the following experimental groups (each n=10): no PP/no MB; with PP/no MB; no PP/with MB; with PP/with MB. Shear bond stengths after 24 h were measured in a universal testing machine (Zwicki 1120) and statistically analysed by 2-way ANOVA. Fractured surfaces were investigated for the type of failure under an optical stereomicroscope and by SEM. Results: Ln all DBSs, pulpal pressure resulted in a decrease of dentinal bond strength. This effect was significant in A.R.T. Bond and OptiBond FL (P < 0.001), but not in Scotchbond 1 (P=0.060). Moist bonding significantly increased the bond strength of Scotchbond 1 (P < 0.001), significantly decreased the bond strength of A.R.T. Bond (P=0.032), but had no effect in the case of OptiBond FL (P=0.691). In A.R.T. Bond, the combination of hydrostatic pulpal pressure and moist bonding resulted in complete failure of most of the specimens prior to the debonding tests. The fracture patterns as detected by SEM fracture analyses were typical for each DBS and specific bonding condition and consistent with the results of the bond strength measurements. Significance: The results indicate that continuous intrinsic moisture in the form of hydrostatic pulpal pressure adversely affects the efficacy of DBSs, while limited extrinsic moisture by moist bonding is acceptable or even essential. The effect of moist bonding on the efficacy of DBSs seems to depend not only on the monomers used and the solvents per se, but also on the water content of the dentine primer and the self-priming adhesive, respectively.

AB Background. A neuroprotective drug may be safe and effective if given very early and in combination with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to acute stroke patients. No clinical trial has yet tested this hypothesis. Objective: To assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of simultaneously combining the neuroprotective drug lubeluzole with rt-PA. Method. Patients who qualified for and received rt-PA within 3 h of symptom onset were randomly allocated 1:1 to lubeluzole (7.5 mg i.v. over 1 h, then continuous 5-day infusion of 10 mg/ day) or placebo. Infusion of the study medication was started before the end of the 1-hour rt-PA infusion. Inclusion criteria were the same as those of the FDA-approved guidelines for rt-PA, plus National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) >5 and absence of serious ventricular arrhythmia, atrioventricular block or Q-T >450 ms. EKG was continuously monitored until 48 h after treatment. The primary outcomes were adverse events, especially hemorrhage and severe arrhythmia, and functionality as determined by the Barthel Index divided into >70,0-70 and dead. Results: 89 patients were randomized at 34 centers over 8 months. The study was terminated by the sponsor before the planned enrollment of 200 patients when a concurrent phase 3 trial of lubeluzole versus placebo given up to 8 h after stroke was negative. In our study, the mean NIHSS was 14.5, and the mean time from symptom onset to rt-PA was 2.5 h and to randomization to lubeluzole or placebo 3.2 h. Mortality was 26%, intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 10% and serious adverse events in 51%. There were no differences between the two treatment groups in any of these variables, outcomes or in the Barthel Index or other measures of functionality. Conclusion: Combining neuroprotective drugs such as lubeluzole simultaneously with rt-PA is feasible and safe. The efficacy of this strategy, using a potentially more effective neuroprotective agent, should be evaluated in an adequately powered clinical trial. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.
