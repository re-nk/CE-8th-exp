AB Purpose To compare lesion volume determination by applying diameter measurement and three different segmentation algorithms at different slice thicknesses reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) of a phantom model for hepatic colorectal metastases
   Materials and Methods Based on CT attenuation measurements obtained retrospectively from 20 patients with colorectal liver metastases a phantom model was designed with a sponge soaked with a dilution of contrast agent and 6 embedded polyamide spheres (diameter, 8 - 30 mm) to simulate the contrast behavior of liver metastases CT scans were obtained and reconstructed at different slice thicknesses (0 625/1 25/2 5/3 75 mm increment 1) One observer performed software-aided volume determination using the maximum diameter manual segmentation seed point method and threshold method six times for each lesion in a randomized order Statistical analysis revealed the absolute and relative differences from the actual lesion volumes and the intraobserver differences as well as the Influence of slice thickness for each method
   Results The mean relative differences of the seed point method (1 2 - 5 9%) and manual segmentation (2 6 - 4 9%) were significantly lower than the threshold method (5 4 - 12 8%) and diameter measurement (12 3 - 18 5% p < 0 01) Volume determination by manual segmentation and the seed point method benefited from the use of thin-slice CT datasets The intraobserver variation was lowest when using the manual segmentation (1 5 - 3 3%) and the seed point method (2 2 3 9% p < 0001)
   usion Manual segmentation and the seed point method for thin CT slices were the methods with the lowest volume differences and intraobserver variation

AB Background: Darwin and the architects of the Modern Synthesis found sympatric speciation difficult to explain and suggested it is unlikely to occur. Increasingly, evidence over the past few decades suggest that sympatric speciation can occur under ecological conditions that require at most intraspecific competition for a structured resource. Here we used an individual-based population model with variable foraging strategies to study the evolution of mating behavior among foraging strategy types. Initially, individuals were placed at random on a structureless resource landscape, with subsequent spatial variation induced through foraging activity itself. The fitness of individuals was determined by their biomass at the end of each generational cycle. The model incorporates three diallelic, codominant foraging strategy genes, and one mate-choice or m-trait (i.e. incipient magic trait) gene, where the latter is inactive when random mating is assumed.
   Results: Under non-random mating, the m-trait gene promotes increasing levels of either disassortative or assortative mating when the frequency of m respectively increases or decreases from 0.5. Our evolutionary simulations demonstrate that, under initial random mating conditions, an activated m-trait gene evolves to promote assortative mating because the system, in trying to fit a multipeak adaptive landscape, causes heterozygous individuals to be less fit than homozygous individuals.
   Conclusion: Our results extend our theoretical understanding that sympatric speciation can evolve under nicheless or gradientless resource conditions: i.e. the underlying resource is monomorphic and initially spatially homogeneous. Further the simplicity and generality of our model suggests that sympatric speciation may be more likely than previously thought to occur in mobile, sexually-reproducing organisms.

AB Individual neuronal, signal transduction, and regulatory pathways often control multiple stochastic downstream actuators, which raises the question of how coordinated response to a single input can be achieved when individual actuators fluctuate independently. In Escherichia coli, the bacterial chemotaxis pathway controls the activity of multiple flagellar motors to generate the run-and-tumble motion of the cell. High-resolution microscopy experiments have identified the key conformational changes adopted by individual flagella during this process. By incorporating these observations into a stochastic model of the flagellar bundle, we demonstrate that the presence of multiple motors imposes a trade-off on chemotactic performance. Multiple motors reduce the latency of the response below the time scale of the stochastic switching of a single motor, which improves performance on steep gradients of attractants. However, the uncoordinated switching of multiple motors interrupts and shortens cell runs, which thereby reduces signal detection and performance on shallow gradients. Remarkably, when slow fluctuations generated by the adaptation mechanism of the chemotaxis system are incorporated in the model at levels measured in experiments, the chemotactic sensitivity and performance in shallow gradients is partially restored with marginal effects for steep gradients. The noise is beneficial because it simultaneously generates long events in the statistics of individual motors and coordinates the motors to generate a long tail in the run length distribution of the cell. Occasional long runs are known to enhance exploration of random walkers. Here we show that they have the additional benefit of enhancing the sensitivity of the bacterium to very shallow gradients.

AB Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) results have indicated that network mapping can contribute to understanding behavior and disease, but it has been difficult to translate the maps created with rsfMRI to neuroelectrical states in the brain. Recently, dynamic analyses have revealed multiple patterns in the rsfMRI signal that are strongly associated with particular bands of neural activity. To further investigate these findings, simultaneously recorded invasive electrophysiology and rsfMRI from rats were used to examine two types of electrical activity (directly measured low-frequency/infraslow activity and band-limited power of higher frequencies) and two types of dynamic rsfMRI (quasi-periodic patterns or QPP, and sliding window correlation or SWC). The relationship between neural activity and dynamic rsfMRI was tested under three anesthetic states in rats: dexmedetomidine and high and low doses of isoflurane. Under dexmedetomidine, the lightest anesthetic, infraslow electrophysiology correlated with QPP but not SWC, whereas band-limited power in higher frequencies correlated with SWC but not QPP. Results were similar under isoflurane; however, the QPP was also correlated to band-limited power, possibly due to the burst-suppression state induced by the anesthetic agent. The results provide additional support for the hypothesis that the two types of dynamic rsfMRI are linked to different frequencies of neural activity, but isoflurane anesthesia may make this relationship more complicated. Understanding which neural frequency bands appear as particular dynamic patterns in rsfMRI may ultimately help isolate components of the rsfMRI signal that are of interest to disorders such as schizophrenia and attention deficit disorder.

SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Book Review
ID ARCHITECTURE; KNOWLEDGE
AB In his recent text, Unified Theories of Cognition, Allen Newell offers an exciting mixture of theoretical and methodological advice to cognitive scientists on how to begin developing more comprehensive accounts of human problem solving. Newell's perspective is at once both exciting and frustrating. His concept of a unified theory of cognition (UTC), and his attempt to illustrate a UTC with his Soar problem solving architecture, is exciting because it suggests how scientists might use the computational methods of cognitive science and artificial intelligence to formulate and explore both broader and deeper aspects of intelligence in people and in machines. Newell's perspective is equally frustrating because it dictates a behaviorist methodology for evaluating cognitive models. Newell views a UTC as a simulation of behavior. I explore the surprising similarity of Newell's approach to theory to the approaches of classical behaviorists such as John Watson and Edward Chace Tolman. I suggest that Newell's behaviorist methodology is incompatible with his commitment to building theories in terms of complex computational systems. I offer a modification to Newell's approach in which a UTC provides an architecture in which to explore the nature of competence-the requisite body of knowledge-that underlies an intelligent agent's ability to perform tasks in a particular domain. I compare this normative perspective to Newell's commitment to performance modeling. I conclude that his key theoretical concepts, such as the problem space hypothesis, knowledge level systems, and intelligence as approximation to the knowledge level are fundamentally COMPetence constructs. I raise specific concerns about the indeterminacy of evaluating a UTC like Soar against performance data. Finally, I suggest that competence modeling more thoroughly exploits the insights of cognitive scientists like Newell and reduces the gap between the aims of cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

AB As robots become more autonomous, their roles shift from being operated and controlled by humans to interactively teaming with humans. The current research focuses on how human operators can effectively team with autonomous urban search and rescue agents in a dynamic and complex task environment. To do so, we empirically examined how shared cognition and restricted language capabilities impacted performance of human-robot dyad search teams using a simulated Minecraft task environment. In order to examine the effects of shared mental models and language the following modified conditions were applied: (1) participants were either able to communicate using natural language or the internal participant's communication was limited to three-word utterances; and (2) shared mental models were manipulated by either the internal participant being made fully aware of the external participant's restricted representation of the environment and inaccurate map or the internal was unaware of these challenges. The primary findings from this study are: (1) teams in the natural language and shared mental model conditions performed better than teams in the limited language and restricted model conditions; (2) when the internal participant was unaware of the challenges of the external, the external perceived higher workload than when there was a shared mental model; (3) teams with natural language and shared mental model demonstrated more predictable behavior than the other teams; (4) some amount of systems' predictability was good but too much predictability was not good. Overall, these results indicate that effective team interaction and shared cognition play an important role in human-robot dyadic teaming performance.

AB Despite the dominance of the blast furnace ironmaking process, more attention is being paid to the new technologies with lower energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions. A novel flash ironmaking technology using pulverized coals and iron concentrates as raw materials, which is different from flash ironmaking with the reductive gas as the reducing agent, is studied. In order to obtain the flow patterns, temperature, and gas composition distribution, as well as particle trajectories in the reaction shaft of the flash ironmaking furnace, the Euler-Lagrangian model with a custom user defined function (UDF) code is used to simulate the processes of the fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and chemical reactions, including the combustion reaction of pulverized coals and reduction reaction of iron concentrates. The results indicate that the flow patterns, temperature, and gas composition distributions present symmetrical distribution characteristics. The central oxygen expands rapidly after entering the reaction shaft and its distribution is approximately bell-shaped. The temperature distribution in the reaction shaft is wing-shaped. The maximum temperature, 2615 K, is reached at 5 m below the roof of the reaction shaft. The O(2)is quickly consumed after entering the reaction shaft. At 6 m below the roof of the reaction shaft, the oxygen concentration becomes almost zero, with the CO concentration reaching the highest. The Fe(2)O(3)and FeO in the iron concentrates are mostly reduced to Fe at 9 m below the roof of the reaction shaft, and more than 95 wt% iron particles could be obtained within 1.2-7.7 s.

AB The development of the cutting-edge technologies in cogeneration and trigeneration has led to a rapid transition toward integrated energy systems and the mushrooming of energy hubs, calling for effective energy management schemes. This paper proposes a distributed algorithm for autonomous energy management (AEM) of a cluster of residential energy hubs. Given the interactive behaviors of energy purchasing at the supply side, we treat each hub as a self-interested agent, and formulate the AEM problem of these hubs as a monotone generalized Nash game (MON-GNG). On one hand, there are global coupling constraints representing the supply limits of the input energy systems, which are imposed by the limited capacities of electrical feeders and natural gas pipelines, thus making it a GNG. On the other hand, the cost function of each hub is merely convex in its actions considering the input-to-output energy transformation inside and the impacts of the energy storage devices, which leads to an MON game. The existence of the generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of this MON-GNG can be theoretically guaranteed. Then, by reformulating the MON-GNG as a variational inequality problem with special decomposition structure, an efficient and single-loop distributed algorithm is then proposed for computing a GNE with clear economic interpretation based on an improved Tikhonov regularization technique. Principles of parameter selection that will guarantee convergence are suggested. Numeric simulations validate the convergence performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate-co-acrylic acid) polyampholyte copolymers were synthesized by radical polymerization of the co-monomers in different molar ratios (2-1, 1-1 and 1-2). The water solutions of the obtained materials were used as stabilization agents for the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. XRD. FTIR and DMA methods were used to study the physical properties of the pure copolymers. It was found that the copolymer is a completely amorphous and inhomogeneous material. The FTIR spectrum was analysed by using literature data and corresponding numerical simulations. TEM analysis showed that the shape of the nanoparticles prepared by reduction of the silver salt in the presence of co-polymers strongly depends on the ratio of DMAEMA and AA co-monomer units. Besides spherical Ag-nanoparticles, reduction in the presence of the polymer with equal molar content of co-monomers also resulted in the formation of nano-plate particles (circular thin plates and thin triangular nanoprisms). The formation of the nano-plate particles was further promoted by heating the mentioned solution at 60 degrees C in air. UV-vis spectroscopy was used to study the change in the surface plasmon resonance behaviour during the growth of the nanoplates. The Ag-nanocomposite thin films of all three co-polymers showed fast antimicrobial activity against the Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans pathogens (more than 99% reduction after 2 h of exposure).

AB Two-piece hard shell capsules made from hypromellose (or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, HPMC) containing carrageenan as a gelling agent have been proposed as an alternative to conventional gelatin capsules for oral drug delivery. We have previously compared the disintegration of hypromellose(carrageenan) (Quali-V (R)) and gelatin capsules (Qualicaps) in fasted human subjects using the technique of gamma scintigraphy. This second study used the same technique with both fasted and fed human subjects. Size 0 capsules were filled with powder plugs made from lactose and did not contain croscarmellose as in the original study. The capsules were separately radiolabelled with indium-111 and technetium-99m. Both capsules were administered simultaneously with 180 ml water to eight healthy male subjects following an overnight fast. Each volunteer was positioned in front of the gamma camera and sequential 60s images were acquired in a continuous manner for 30 min. The mean (+/-S.D) disintegration time in the fasted state for the hypromellose(carrageenan) capsules was 8 +/- 2 min and for gelatin 7 +/- 3 min. These results were not statistically different from the data in the original study and show that the removal of the croscarmellose had no effect on the results. The mean (+/-S.D.) disintegration time in the fed state for the hypromellose(carrageenan) capsules was 16 +/- 5 min and for the gelatin capsules was 12 +/- 4 min. There was no statistical difference between the hypromellosecarrageenan and gelatin capsules in either the fed or fasted state. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In everyday life, our behavior varies on a continuum from automatic and habitual to deliberate and goal-directed. Recent evidence suggests that habit formation and relearning of habits operate in a context-dependent manner: Habit formation is promoted when actions are performed in a specific context, while breaking off habits is facilitated after a context change. It is an open question how one can computationally model the brain's balancing between context-specific habits and goal-directed actions. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian approach for control of a partially observable Markov decision process that enables conjoint learning of habits and reward structure in a context-specific manner. In this model, habit learning corresponds to an updating of priors over policies and interacts with the learning of the outcome contingencies. Importantly, the model is solely built on probabilistic inference, which effectively provides a simple explanation of how the brain may balance contributions of habitual and goal-directed control. We illustrated the resulting behavior using agent-based simulated experiments, where we replicated several findings of devaluation, extinction, and renewal experiments, as well as the so-called two-step task which is typically used with human participants. In addition, we show how a single parameter, the habitual tendency, can explain individual differences in habit learning and the balancing between habitual and goal-directed control. Finally, we discuss the link of the proposed model to other habit learning models and implications for understanding specific phenomena in substance use disorder. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB In the social and biological networks, each agent experiences a birth-and-death process. These evolving networks may exhibit some unique characteristics. Recently, the birth-and-death networks have gradually caught attention, and thus far, most of these studies on birth-and-death networks have focused on the calculations of the degree distributions and their properties. In this paper, a kind of random birth-and-death network (RBDN) with reducing network size is discussed, in which at each time step, with probability p (0 < p < 1/2) we add a new node to the network and connect it to m existing nodes, or delete an old node from the network with probability q = 1 - p. Unlike the existing literature, this study is to calculate the average degrees of the proposed networks under different network sizes. First, for the reducing RBDN, the steady state equations for each node's degree are given by using the Markov chain method based on stochastic process rule, and then the recursive equations of average degree for different network sizes are obtained according to these steady state equations. Second, by means of the recursive equations, we explore four basic properties of average degrees as follows: 1) the average degrees are limited, 2) the average degrees are strictly monotonically increasing, 3) the average degrees are convergent to 2 m q, and 4) the sum of each difference between the average degree and 2 m q is a bounded number. Theoretical proofs for these four properties are also provided in this paper. Finally, on the basis of these properties, a generation function approach is employed to obtain the exact solutions of the average degrees for various network sizes. In addition to the theoretical derivations to the average degrees, computer simulation is also used to verify the correctness of exact solutions of the average degrees and their properties. Furthermore, we use numerical simulation to study the relationship between the average degree and node increasing probability p. Our simulation results show as follows: 1) with the increasing of p, the convergent speed of the average degree to 2 m q is increasing; 2) with the increasing of m, the convergent speed of the average degree to 2 m q is decreasing. In conclusion, for the proposed RBDN model, the main contributions of this study include 1) providing the recursive equations of the average degrees under different network sizes, 2) investigating the basic properties for the average degrees, and 3) obtaining the exact solutions of the average degrees.

AB Ten years after the introduction of the first drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, tacrine, it seems appropriate to reappraise the pharmacological processes of innovation in the field of research in dementia. The aim of this review is to pinpoint concrete improvements achieved in this field, in terms of experimental methods and clinical evaluation of the compounds, as well as the neurochemistry of the disease and cellular targets deserving of initial consideration.
   The article first considers the use of animal models of Alzheimer's disease, which are classified according to two categories: animals with lesions of some neuronal pathways specifically implicated in clinical symptoms (i.e. lesions of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the origin of cholinergic projections to the cortex underlying memory processes); and transgenic models, which are intended to reproduce some of the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Drugs can be tested in animals with such alterations for their effect on neuropathology, neurochemistry and behavioural disturbances. More recently, in silico models have been developed, which offer the possibility of simulating the pharmacodynamic effects of drugs in specific areas of the brain. These experiments are helpful in distinguishing purely symptomatic effects from disease-modifying effects, the latter being the ultimate goal of the modern pharmacology of dementia.
   The second breakthrough considered in this article is the codification and standardisation of clinical methods for obtaining a more accurate and earlier diagnosis (the recent introduction of the concept of "Mild Cognitive Impairment", which includes patients who will later develop a true clinical dementia syndrome). In that respect, the determination of the biological markers of Alzheimer's disease (apolipoprotein E, amyloid substance, protein-tau, isoprostane) as well as progress in neuroimaging (functional positron emission tomography [fPET]-scan, single photon emission-computed tomography [SPECT], functional nuclear magnetic resonance [fNMR]) are discussed in terms of their potential as new tools in the early stages of drug development (surrogate markers). The methods used during the comparative clinical trials (phase III) have been elaborated and internationally standardised during the assessment of the different acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I), with the knowledge that, since 1994, four of these have been officially approved: tacrine, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine; the same methods have been used for developing memantine, a recently-launched modulator of glutamatergic neurotransmission. The validated scales now take into consideration not only the cognitive dimensions of Alzheimer's disease but also the behavioural symptoms, with the introduction of the concept of BPSD (behavioural psychological symptoms of dementia). Some proposals to improve this clinical assessment of anti-dementia drugs are presented here. *
   The section of this article dealing with prospective issues considers the main pathways of interest in drug innovation and the elucidation of new targets for the future compounds. As well as their symptomatic effects on the different components of cognition, drugs should be neuroprotective and limit the lesions documented in Alzheimer's disease, with the aim of progressing far beyond the amyloid hypothesis (immunisation, beta-sheet breakers, secretase inhibitors). The field of excitotoxicity (which is mainly glutamate dependent) appears fruitful, because of the possibility of pharmacological intervention at the different steps in the excitotoxic process. All the new directions presented in this article support the concept of true disease-modifying agents.
   In conclusion, this prospective review should be considered as a guide in fostering drug innovation in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders and should help to decrease the gap existing between neuroscience and therapeutics.

AB Yeasts are able to act as biosorbents, as their cell wall includes several components capable of binding organic xenobiotic compounds that can potentially be removed during various fermentation processes. In the present investigation, two novel Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (LMBF-Y 16 and LMBF-Y-18), previously isolated from grapes, were studied regarding their physiological behavior (dry cell weight-DCW production, substrate uptake, and ethanol and glycerol biosynthesis) during fermentations of grape must, in some cases enriched with commercial glucose and fructose (initial total sugar concentration approximately 150 and 250 g/L, respectively). Myclobutanil (a chiral triazole fungicide broadly used as a protective agent of vine) was also added to the culture media at various concentrations in order to assess the ability of the yeasts to simultaneously perform alcoholic fermentations and detoxify the medium (i.e., to remove the fungicide). In the first set of experiments and for both tested strains, trials were carried out in either 250 mL or 2.0 L agitated shake flasks in either synthetic glucose-based experiments or grape musts. Since the results obtained in the trials where the cultures were placed in 2.0 L flasks with grape musts as substrates were superior in terms of both DCW and ethanol production, these experimental conditions were selected for the subsequent studies. Both strains showed high fermentative efficiency, producing high amounts of DCW (9.5-10.5 g/L) in parallel with high ethanol production, which in some cases achieved values very close to the maximum theoretical ethanol production yield (approximate to 0.49 g of ethanol per g of sugar). When using grape must with initial total sugars at approximately 250 g/L (very high gravity fermentation media, close to winemaking conditions), significantly high ethanol quantities (i.e., ranging between 105 and 123 g/L) were produced. Myclobutanil addition slightly negatively affected sugar conversion into ethanol; however, in all cases, ethanol production was very satisfactory. A non-negligible myclobutanil removal during fermentation, which ranged between 5%-27%, as a result of the adsorptive or degradative capacity of the yeast was also reported. The presence of myclobutanil had no effect on DCW production and resulted in no significant differences in the biosynthesis of glycerol. Therefore, these newly isolated yeast strains could be excellent candidates for simultaneous high ethanol production and parallel pesticide removal in a general biorefinery concept demonstrating many environmental benefits.

AB A generalized non-porous shrinking particle model (NSPM) of leaching is proposed, which - unlike commonly used "simplified" mathematical models - takes into account the influence of the L/S ratio (by means of the so-called reduced A/B molar ratio, phi, which indicates how many times the leaching agent (A)-to-valuable substance (B) molar ratio actually used exceeds its stoichiometric value) and non-ideal behaviour of concentrated lixiviants. Moreover, n-th order chemical reaction with power-law kinetics is considered, which makes determination of the rate-determining step of the overall process more reliable.
   Correlation between the proposed model and experiment was tested using the hydrochloric acid leaching of dead-burned magnesite, which provides the opportunity to experimentally verify how the mathematical model fits the leaching data for both the positive and negative reaction order. Calculated values of the reaction order for HCl, n, different from unity (n = 0.28 and n = -0.23 obtained for low (0.20-1.03 M) and high HCl concentrations (2.06-3.83 M), respectively), together with relatively high values of the activation energy (57.5 J mol (-1) and 56.6 J mol(-1)) indicate that the leaching rate is controlled by the intrinsic chemical reaction under the conditions considered in the present work. Simulations made using the calculated values of the parameters have shown that the proposed generalized NSPM model clearly reflects two most important experimental facts: (a) L/S ratio affects the leaching process; and (b) qualitatively different leaching behaviour has been observed for the positive and negative reaction order. Unlike the simplified NSPM model, the generalized model describes the leaching process quantitatively in the whole range of the parameter phi, for both n > 0 and n < 0. The simplified NSPM (which does not take into account the L/S ratio) describes the leaching process with sufficient accuracy when phi >- 10, but at phi < 10 the error grows exponentially with decreasing if. and can reach up to 11-17% rel. under the stoichiometric conditions (i.e., at phi = 1), in dependence on the value of n. It is assumed that the proposed generalized NSPM model provides a useful tool for planning kinetic experiments, identifying the kinetic model parameters and simulation of the leaching process even under stoichiometric conditions.

AB Two distinct delayed rectifier K+ currents, I-Kr and I-Ks, were found recently in ventricular cells. We formulated these currents theoretically and investigated their roles in action potential repolarization and the restitution of action potential duration (APD). The Luo-Rudy (L-R) model of the ventricular action potential was used in the simulations. The single delayed rectifier K+ current in the model was replaced by I-Kr and I-Ks. Our results show that I-Ks is the major outward current during the plateau repolarization. A specific block of either I-Kr or I-Ks can effectively prolong APD to the same degree. Therefore, either channel provides a target for class III antiarrhythmic drugs. In the simulated guinea pig ventricular cell, complete block of I-Kr does not result in early afterdepolarizations (EADs). In contrast, >80% block of I-Ks results in abnormal repolarization and EADs. This behavior reflects the high I-Ks-to-I-Kr density ratio (similar to 8:1) in this cell and can be reversed (ie, I-Kr block can cause EADs) by reducing the ratio of I-ks to I-Kr. The computed APD restitution curve is consistent with the experimental behavior, displaying fast APD variation at short diastolic intervals (DIs) and downward shift at longer DIs with the decrease of basic drive cycle length (BCL). Examining the ionic currents and their underlying kinetic processes, we found that activation of both I-Kr and I-Ks is the primary determinant of the APD restitution at shorter DIs, with Ca2+ current through L-type channels (I-Ca) playing a minor role. The rate of APD change depends on the relative densities of I-Kr and I-Ks; it increases when the I-Kr-to-I-Ks density ratio is large. The BCL-dependent shift of restitution at longer DIs is primarily attributed to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+](i), This in turn causes different degrees of Ca2+-dependent inactivation of I-Ca and different degrees of Ca2+-dependent conductance of I-Ks at very long DIs (>5 s) fur different BCLs. This BCL dependence of I-Ca and I-Ks that is secondary to long-lasting changes in [Ca2+](i) is responsible for APD changes at long DIs and can be viewed as a ''memory property'' of cardiac cells.

AB The fact that chemical carcinogenesis involves single, isolated, essentially irreversible molecular events as discrete steps. several of which must occur in a row to finally culminate in the development of a malignancy. rather suggests that an absolute threshold for chemical carcinogens may not exist. However, practical thresholds may exist due to saturable pathways involved in the metabolic processing, especially in the metabolic inactivation, of such compounds. An important example for such a pathway is the enzymatic hydrolysis of epoxides via epoxide hydrolases, a group of enzymes for which the catalytic mechanism has recently been established. These enzymes convert their substrates via the intermediate formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate complex. Interestingly, the formation of the intermediate proceeds faster by orders of magnitude than the subsequent hydrolysis, ie, the formation of the terminal product. Under normal circumstances, this does not pose a problem, since the microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH). the epoxide hydrolases with the best documented importance in the metabolism of carcinogens, is highly abundant in the liver, the organ with the highest capacity to metabolically generate epoxides. Computer simulation provides evidence that the high amount of mEH enzyme is favorable for the control of the steady-state level of a substrate epoxide and can keep it extremely low. However, once the mEH is titrated out under conditions of extraordinarily high epoxide concentration, the epoxide steady-state level steeply rises, leading to a sudden burst of the genotoxic effect of the noxious agent. This prediction of the computer simulation is nicely supported by experimental work. V79 Chinese hamster cells that we have generically engineered to express human mEH at about the same level as that observed in human liver are completely protected from any measurable genotoxic effect of the model compound styrene oxide (STO) up to a dose of 100 mu M in the cell culture medium (toxicokinetic threshold). In V79 cells that do not express mEH, STO leads to the formation of DNA strand breaks in a dose-dependent manner with no toxicokinetic threshold observable. Above 100 mu-M. the genotoxic effect of STO in the mEH-expressing cell line parallels the one in the parental cell line. Thus, the saturable protection from STO-induced strand breaks by mEH represents a typical example of a practical threshold. However, it must be: pointed out that even in the presence of protective amounts of mEH. a minute but definite level of STO is present that does not contribute sufficiently to the strand break formation to overcome the background noise of the detection procedure. As pointed out above, absolute thresholds probably do not exist in chemical carcinogenesis.

AB Cell migration is crucial for thymocyte differentiation, and the cellular interactions involved now begin to be unraveled, with chemokines, extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, and their corresponding receptors being relevant in such oriented movement of thymocytes. This notion derives from in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental data, including those obtained in genetically engineered and spontaneous mutant mice. Thymic microenvironmental cells produce both groups of molecules, whereas developing thymocytes express chemokine and ECM receptors. It is important that although chemokines and ECM proteins can drive thymocyte migration per se, a combined role of these molecules likely concurs for the resulting migration patterns of thymocytes in their various differentiation stages. In this respect, among ECM moieties, there are proteins with opposing functions, such as laminin or fibronectin versus galectin-3, which promote, respectively, adhesion and de-adhesion of thymocytes to the thymic microenvironment. How chemokines and ECM are produced and degraded remains to be more clearly defined. Nevertheless, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) likely play a role in the intrathymic ECM breakdown. It is interesting that these molecules also degrade chemokines. Thus, the physiological migration of thymocytes should be conceived as a resulting vector of multiple, simultaneous, or sequential stimuli, involving chemokines, adhesive, and de-adhesive ECM proteins. Moreover, these interactions may be physiologically regulated in situ by matrix MMPs and are influenced by hormones. Accordingly, one can predict that pathological changes in any of these loops may result in abnormal thymocyte migration. This actually occurs in the murine infection by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. In this model, the abnormal release of immature thymocytes to peripheral lymphoid organs is correlated with the higher migratory response to ECM and chemokines. Lastly, the fine dissection of the mechanisms governing thymocyte migration will provide new clues for designing therapeutic strategies targeting developing T cells. The most important function of the thymus is to generate T lymphocytes, which once leaving the organ, are able to colonize specific regions of peripheral lymphoid organs, the T cell zones, where they can mount and regulate cell-mediated, immune responses. This intrathymic T cell differentiation is a complex sequence of biological events, comprising cell proliferation, differential membrane protein expression, gene rearrangements, massive programmed cell death, and cell migration. In this review, we will focus on the mechanisms involved in controlling the migration of thymocytes, from the entrance of cell precursors into the organ to the exit of mature T cells toward peripheral lymphoid organs. Nevertheless, to better comprehend this issue, it appeared worthwhile to briefly comment on some key aspects of thymocyte differentiation and the tissue context in which it takes place, the thymic microenvironment.

   PROCESS
AB Venous thromboembolism has been increasingly recognised as a clinical problem in the paediatric population. Guideline recommendations for antithrombotic therapy in paediatric patients are based mainly on extrapolation from adult clinical trial data, owing to the limited number of clinical trials in paediatric populations. The oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban has been approved in adult patients for several thromboembolic disorders, and its well-defined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics and efficacy and safety profiles in adults warrant further investigation of this agent in the paediatric population.
   The objective of this study was to develop and qualify a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for rivaroxaban doses of 10 and 20 mg in adults and to scale this model to the paediatric population (0-18 years) to inform the dosing regimen for a clinical study of rivaroxaban in paediatric patients.
   Experimental data sets from phase I studies supported the development and qualification of an adult PBPK model. This adult PBPK model was then scaled to the paediatric population by including anthropometric and physiological information, age-dependent clearance and age-dependent protein binding. The pharmacokinetic properties of rivaroxaban in virtual populations of children were simulated for two body weight-related dosing regimens equivalent to 10 and 20 mg once daily in adults. The quality of the model was judged by means of a visual predictive check. Subsequently, paediatric simulations of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), maximum (peak) plasma drug concentration (C (max)) and concentration in plasma after 24 h (C (24h)) were compared with the adult reference simulations.
   Simulations for AUC, C (max) and C (24h) throughout the investigated age range largely overlapped with values obtained for the corresponding dose in the adult reference simulation for both body weight-related dosing regimens. However, pharmacokinetic values in infants and preschool children (body weight < 40 kg) were lower than the 90 % confidence interval threshold of the adult reference model and, therefore, indicated that doses in these groups may need to be increased to achieve the same plasma levels as in adults. For children with body weight between 40 and 70 kg, simulated plasma pharmacokinetic parameters (C (max), C (24h) and AUC) overlapped with the values obtained in the corresponding adult reference simulation, indicating that body weight-related exposure was similar between these children and adults. In adolescents of > 70 kg body weight, the simulated 90 % prediction interval values of AUC and C (24h) were much higher than the 90 % confidence interval of the adult reference population, owing to the weight-based simulation approach, but for these patients rivaroxaban would be administered at adult fixed doses of 10 and 20 mg.
   The paediatric PBPK model developed here allowed an exploratory analysis of the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban in children to inform the dosing regimen for a clinical study in paediatric patients.

AB Scotland is the largest Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar) producer in the EU with an output of over 150,000 t, contributing over 500 million annually towards the economy. Production continues to increase, predominantly due to the increase in output per farm and reduction in losses due to infectious diseases. Farms are grouped within disease management areas whose boundaries are defined by where the closest pair of farms is separated by more than twice the tidal excursion distance (TE) Tidal excursion is defined as 7.2 km in mainland Scotland, or 3.6 km in the Shetland Islands). The majority of salmon farms are located within relatively sheltered inshore areas where non-tidal advective current speed is minimal. However there is an aspiration for offshore production where it might be possible to increase stocking levels and where current speeds will be greater so TE models could break down.
   Separation distances whereby farms would avoid infection risk were obtained using an analytical, discrete-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model coupled with a hydrodynamic transport expression representing transmission of pathogenic agents between fish farms. The model incorporated transmission, expression and recovery parameters as well as pathogen shedding and decay. The simplified hydrodynamic model incorporated residual advection, tidal advection and turbulent diffusion elements. The obtained separation distances were compared to a computationally intensive, numerical model and were demonstrated to be comparable, although the analytical model underestimated the variation within the transmission distances.
   Applying characteristics for a robust pathogen, infectious pancreatic necrosis virus type (IPNV-type), and less robust pathogens such as infectious salmon anaemia virus type (ISAV-type) and Aeromonas salmonicida type (AS-type) pathogens, it was possible to obtain separation distances whereby farms avoided infection. Simulation outputs indicated that separation distances should increase to avoid disease as farm size and current speed increase. The more conserved IPNV-type pathogen required separation distances of hundreds of kilometres, AS-type required tens of kilometres, whilst the distances for ISAV-type were within the scale of the current DMAs, that were developed for ISAV control. However, should production be moved to areas of faster moving currents and increased farm production the current disease management area principles might need readdressing.

AB Phylogenomic footprinting is an approach for ab initio identification of genome-wide regulatory elements in bacterial species based on sequence conservation. The statistical power of the phylogenomic approach depends on the degree of sequence conservation, the length of regulatory elements, and the level of phylogenetic divergence among genomes. Building on an earlier model, we propose a binomial model that uses synonymous tree lengths as neutral expectations for determining the statistical significance of conserved intergenic spacer (IGS) sequences. Simulations show that the binomial model is robust to variations in the value of evolutionary parameters, including base frequencies and the transition-to-transversion ratio. We used the model to search for regulatory sequences in the Lyme disease species group (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) using 23 genomes. The model indicates that the currently available set of Borrelia genomes would not yield regulatory sequences shorter than five bases, suggesting that genome sequences of additional B. burgdorferi sensu lato species are needed. Nevertheless, we show that previously known regulatory elements are indeed strongly conserved in sequence or structure across these Borrelia species. Further, we predict with sufficient confidence two new RpoS binding sites, 39 promoters, 19 transcription terminators, 28 noncoding RNAs, and four sets of coregulated genes. These putative cis-and trans-regulatory elements suggest novel, Borrelia-specific mechanisms regulating the transition between the tick and host environments, a key adaptation and virulence mechanism of B. burgdorferi. Alignments of IGS sequences are available on BorreliaBase.org, an online database of orthologous open reading frame (ORF) and IGS sequences in Borrelia.
   IMPORTANCE While bacterial genomes contain mostly protein-coding genes, they also house DNA sequences regulating the expression of these genes. Gene regulatory sequences tend to be conserved during evolution. By sequencing and comparing related genomes, one can therefore identify regulatory sequences in bacteria based on sequence conservation. Here, we describe a statistical framework by which one may determine how many genomes need to be sequenced and at what level of evolutionary relatedness in order to achieve a high level of statistical significance. We applied the framework to Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, and identified a large number of candidate regulatory sequences, many of which are known to be involved in regulating the phase transition between the tick vector and mammalian hosts.

TI Unraveling the intraguild competition between Oscheius spp. nematodes

AB Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are excellent biological control agents to fight soil-dwelling insect pests. In a previous survey of agricultural soils of Switzerland, we found mixtures of free-living nematodes (FLN) in the genus Oscheius, which appeared to be in intense competition with EPN. As this may have important implications for the long-term persistence of EPN, we studied this intraguild competition in detail. We hypothesized that (i) Oscheius spp. isolates act as scavengers rather than entomopathogens, and (ii) cadavers with relatively small numbers of EPN are highly suitable resources for Oscheius spp. reproduction. To study this, we identified Oscheius spp. isolated from Swiss soils, quantified the outcome of EPN/Oscheius competition in laboratory experiments, developed species-specific primers and probe for quantitative real-time PCR, and evaluated their relative occurrence in the field in the context of the soil food web. Molecular analysis (ITS/D2D3) identified MG-67/MG-69 as Oscheius onirici and MG-68 as O. tipulae (Dolichura-group). Oscheius spp. indeed behaved as scavengers, reproducing in similar to 64% of frozen-killed cadavers from controlled experiments. Mixed infection in the laboratory by Oscheius spp. with low (3 IJs) or high (20 IJs) initial EPN numbers revealed simultaneous reproduction in double-exposed cadavers which resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of EPN progeny from the cadaver. This effect depended on the number of EPN in the initial inoculum and differed by EPN species; Heterorhabditis megidis was better at overcoming competition. This study reveals Oscheius spp. as facultative kleptoparasites that compete with EPN for insect cadavers. Using real-time qPCR, we were able to accurately quantify this strong competition between FLN and EPN in cadavers that were recovered after soil baiting (similar to 86% cadavers with >50% FLN production). The severe competition within the host cadavers and the intense management of the soils in annual crops readily explain the low EPN numbers in Swiss field samples. The developed molecular tools can be used to elucidate the extent to which the competitive interactions affect EPN populations. This can help to develop strategies to achieve good persistence and natural EPN recycling, in particular in systems where native EPN levels are low, such as annual crops. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB The Tg rasH2 transgenic mouse has been developed as an alternative to the lifetime mouse bioassay to predict the carcinogenic potential of chemicals. Unlike the p53/mouse, the Tg rasH2 mouse is sensitive to both genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens. The Tg rasH2 mouse, officially designated CB6F1-TgN (RasH2), contains multiple copies of the human c-Ha-ras oncogene and promoter within its genome. These mice develop spontaneous and chemically induced neoplasms earlier in life and in greater numbers than wild-type mice, reflecting their enhanced sensitivity to neoplasia. The most common spontaneous neoplasms in control Tg rasH2 mice 8 to 9 months of age are lung adenomas and carcinomas (7.4% incidence), splenic hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas (5.4%), forestomach squamous cell papillomas and carcinomas (2.4%), and skin neoplasms (1.2%). Simulations have demonstrated that 20 to 25 mice/sex/treatment group are required to provide the assay with adequate statistical power. Four of 6 known or suspected human carcinogens tested in Tg rasH2 mice were positive in this assay. For 19 nonmutagenic agents testing positive in conventional rodent bioassays, 7 chemicals were positive, 10 chemicals were negative, and 2 were equivocal. None of the 10 nonmutagenic rodent carcinogens that were negative in the Tg rasH2 mouse model are considered to be human carcinogens. All nonmutagenic chemicals that were negative in the conventional rodent bioassays were also negative in the Tg rasH2 model. Results for 15 of 18 mutagenic chemicals tested in Tg rasH2 mice agreed with the results of conventional rodent bioassays, and 3 results were equivocal. The Tg rasH2 mouse model appears to predict known or suspected human carcinogens as well as the traditional mouse bioassay, but with fewer positive results for nongenotoxic compounds that are not considered human carcinogens. The Tg rasH2 mouse model is the most thoroughly tested in vivo alternative to the lifetime mouse bioassay for nongenotoxic compounds administered by oral or parenteral routes. The U. S. FDA Carcinogenicity Assessment Committee has determined that the Tg rasH2 model has been adequately evaluated for consideration for carcinogenicity testing of pharmaceutical candidates and its use could contribute to the weight of evidence for carcinogenicity assessment. The FDA will consider proposals to replace lifetime mouse carcinogenicity studies with 6-month Tg rasH2 mouse studies to support pharmaceutical registration on a case-by-case basis.

AB In this paper, the effect of beta-amyloid (A beta) oligomer aggregates on Acetylcholine (ACh) neurocycle of human brain and its relation to Alzheimer's disease (AD) are investigated through a two-enzyme/two-compartment (2E2C) diffusion mathematical model whereby compartment 1 represents the presynaptic neuron while compartment 2 represents the postsynaptic neuron and postsynaptic cleft. It is found that A beta aggregates induce choline leakage from the presynaptic neurons (compartment 1) leading to a reduction in choline content in both compartments. The lowering in choline levels in each compartment is promoted with the increase in the inlet A beta oligomers which create more channels and pores in the presynaptic membrane. In addition, it is found that both the rates of ACh synthesis and hydrolysis were affected negatively by the increase in the levels of A beta oligomers. Furthermore, the levels of ACh in both compartments decreased while the level of A beta oligomers increased. However, the acetate concentration in compartment 1 increased but the acetate level in compartment 2 decreased. These results are compatible with the low levels of both ACh and choline in the neuron tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains through choline leakage hypothesis. Also, the model shows the significant effect of inhibiting A beta aggregation as a promising therapeutic mechanism to mitigate cholinergic diseases. The model suggests that A beta oligomers exert neuroinflammatory and toxic effect against the ACh neurocycle. The paper suggests that development of therapeutic agents capable of inhibiting toxic A beta aggregations and maintaining choline substrates in neurons is necessary to provide a neuroprotective effect, choliner gic transmission, and maintain reasonable levels of ACh.

AB The majority of neurons in the magnocellular basal forebrain are wakefulness-active with highest discharge activity during wakefulness and a marked reduction in activity just before and during the entry to non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We have hypothesized that the reduction of discharge activity of wakefulness-active neurons and a consequent facilitation of the transition from wakefulness to sleep is due to an increase in the extracellular concentration of adenosine during wakefulness. To test the hypothesis, the present study employed microdialysis perfusion of adenosinergic pharmacological agents combined with single unit recording in freely moving cats, so as to determine: 1) if there were dose-dependent effects on behaviorally identified wakefulness-active neurons; 2) whether effects were mediated by the A1 receptor, as contrasted to the A2a receptor; and 3) if effects were specific to wakefulness-active neurons, and not present in sleep-active neurons, those preferentially discharging in nonREM sleep.
   Both adenosine and the A1 receptor-specific agonist N6-cyclo-hexyl-adenosine reduced the discharge activity of wakefulness-active neurons (n=16) in a dose-dependent manner but had no effect on sleep-active neurons (n=4). The All receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1-3-dimethylxanthine increased the discharge of wakefulness-active neurons (n=5), but the A2a receptor agonist, CGS-16284, had no effect (n=3). Recording sites were histologically localized to the cholinergic basal forebrain. These data support our hypothesis that adenosine acts via the A1 receptor to reduce the activity of wakefulness-promoting neurons, thus providing a cellular mechanism explaining why the increased adenosine concentrations observed in the basal forebrain following prolonged wakefulness act to induce sleep.

AB The effect of CO2 and H2O on the behavior of shale gas confined in calcite [104] slit-like nanopore is investigated using molecular dynamics simulation technique. The study is relevant as the advancement of enhance gas recovery (EGR) technologies requires in-depth atomistic understanding of the hydrocarbons, water, carbon dioxide, and other fracturing fluid constituents inside the nanopores of shale gas reservoirs. We are considering carbon dioxide (CO2) because it is an attractive displacing agent for enhanced gas recovery and has the potential to be an "exotic" fracturing fluid. Water (H2O) is considered as it is the major component of water-based fracturing fluids. The structural and dynamical properties of the confined species are computed. The results indicate that the presence of CO2 and H2O in the nanopore drastically affects the behavior of shale gas. The shale gas molecules that were tightly packed near the pore wall displaced towards the center by CO2 and H2O molecules. A new layer of carbon dioxide and water is formed near the pore wall. Further investigation reveals that CO2 molecules align themselves flat near the surface, whereas H2O molecules have directional orientation with oxygen atoms of water molecules pointing towards to wall. The predicted lateral (in-plane) self-diffusion coefficient values of methane, ethane, carbon dioxide and water indicate complex dynamics inside the pore. The investigation shows the fastest dynamics for methane gas followed by ethane. Both CO2 and H2O are almost immobile. The increase in temperature in the range from 300 to 450 K does not appear to have any significant impact on the behavior of the molecules inside the pore. The adsorption energies show that both CO2 and H2O have stronger interactions with calcite [104] surface than shale gas molecules.

AB In encapsulation-based self-healing materials, filled capsules with the healing agent are embedded in a matrix. But between the capsule and the matrix an interface always exists. The strength of the interface between both components is proved to play a crucial role in the correct working of the self-healing. This paper analyzes numerically the role of the interface bonding strength and the stress concentration around a cylindrical capsule embedded in a homogeneous, isotropic and elastic matrix, which undergoes a uniform and uniaxial far-field stress. Geometry and load condition make it to use a two-dimensional plane strain model. This model is based on a combination of the classical Finite Element Method and cohesive surface techniques implemented in the commercial code Abaqus. Two types of interfaces have been studied: perfect and imperfect bonding. A detailed validation of the model against analytical expressions has been conducted in order to guarantee a correct behavior of the interface elements. The influence of the elastic mismatch between the capsule and the matrix on the stress concentrations has been assessed, as well as the possibility of using capsules with different thicknesses. In order to prevent debonding, a study to provide the optimum combination of material elasticities, capsule thicknesses and bonding strength has been performed. The initiation and propagation of the interfacial crack have been also fully addressed. In that direction, once a crack is initiated, the role of the elastic mismatch and the capsule thickness is also assessed.

AB Background: In order to minimize the influence of glycolysis on diabetes mellitus (DM) diagnostic tests, we have compared the behavior of citric/citrate, fluoride additives and gel-serum with plasma-heparin under careful preanalytical conditions. Subsequently, we compared the effectiveness of both fluoride and citric additives at different pre-centrifugation times. Finally, the influence of citric/citrate collection tube on diagnostic tests results was evaluated.
   Methods: The first study of 80 voluntary patients assessed the glucose bias of citric/citrate, fluoride additive tubes and gel-serum tubes versus plasma-heparin tubes at several medical decision cut-offs (MDC). The second study performed with 72 volunteers evaluated additives, simulating transport times to the laboratory and centrifugation delay periods. Final evaluation compares the proportion of positive tests in total tests carried out in two different periods.
   Results: When citric/citrate (n=79) and fluoride tubes (n=60) were compared with plasma-heparin under controlled preanalytical conditions, both met the bias specification for plasma glucose (+/- 1.8%) at seven MDC. On the contrary, serum samples (n=15) did not meet it at five MDC. In the second study, differences in glucose values at distinct pre-centrifugation times were not statistically significant for citric/citrate tubes, but significant for fluoride tubes and also for comparison of fluoride and citric/citrate tubes. Hemolysis in fluoride tubes was higher. Citric/citrate tube implementation in our laboratory caused an increase in positive diagnostic tests that were only statistically significant for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening.
   Conclusions: Citric/citrate additive tube is equivalent to plasma-heparin avoiding glycolysis completely and immediately under careful preanalytical conditions even with a 3-h delay in plasma separation. According to used MDC we have not statistically significantly increased the diagnoses of DM cases.

AB The fate of a wetting liquid sessile droplet imbibed by a porous medium is formulated as a multiphase flow problem and a numerical solution is developed using the capillary network model with a microforce balance at the liquid vertical bar gas interface. The liquid phase capillary flow and evaporation are solved simultaneously. An exclusive evidence for a multiphase flow is already found in the capillary flow, as a liquid wets a much larger volume of porous medium compared to the wetted volume, calculated by assuming that the medium imbibes the liquid in the single-phase flow. The physics of the multiphase capillary flow includes the formation of local gas clusters and liquid ganglia. The clusters and ganglia distribution is further altered by evaporation. The evaporation tends to shrink the ganglia sizes and open the gas clusters, both due to the liquid mass loss from the porous medium. Still, the capillarity tends to disperse the liquid back into the regions from where the liquid previously evaporated. These changes in the liquid saturation produce the changes in vapor concentration within the porous medium and changes in the mass fluxes. The imprint shape varies, where, for more spherical imprints, the evaporation is enhanced due to the capillary flow. The opposite is true for the elongated imprints for which the capillarity hinders the evaporation rate. Comparing the spherical and elongated imprints, the liquid dispersion differs and the capillary flow the into protrusion direction is pronounced for the elongated imprints. The changes in the liquid dispersion and imprint shape influence the vapor concentration within the porous medium, vapor phase mass fluxes, and liquid persistence time. Finally, the previous behavior is observed for hazardous materials and warfare agents, where predicting the fate of such kind of liquids and their vapors become especially important due to their harmful effects.

AB Background Mechanotransduction in bone cells plays a pivotal role in osteoblast differentiation and bone remodelling. Mechanotransduction provides the link between modulation of the extracellular matrix by mechanical load and intracellular activity. By controlling the balance between the intracellular and extracellular domains, mechanotransduction determines the optimum functionality of skeletal dynamics. Failure of this relationship was suggested to contribute to bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis. Results A hybrid mechanical and agent-based model (Mech-ABM), simulating mechanotransduction in a single osteoblast under external mechanical perturbations, was utilised to simulate and examine modulation of the activation dynamics of molecules within mechanotransduction on the cellular response to mechanical stimulation. The number of molecules and their fluctuations have been analysed in terms of recurrences of critical events. A numerical approach has been developed to invert subordination processes and to extract the direction processes from the molecular signals in order to derive the distribution of recurring events. These predict that there are large fluctuations enclosing information hidden in the noise which is beyond the dynamic variations of molecular baselines. Moreover, studying the system under different mechanical load regimes and altered dynamics of feedback loops, illustrate that the waiting time distributions of each molecule are a signature of the system's state. Conclusions The behaviours of the molecular waiting times change with the changing of mechanical load regimes and altered dynamics of feedback loops, presenting the same variation of patterns for similar interacting molecules and identifying specific alterations for key molecules in mechanotransduction. This methodology could be used to provide a new tool to identify potent molecular candidates to modulate mechanotransduction, hence accelerate drug discovery towards therapeutic targets for bone mass upregulation.

AB In this paper, the influence of a dynamic variation in the ambient pressure on the subharmonic response of phospholipid-coated microbubbles was investigated. The ambient pressure in water was modulated by a 2.5 kHz acoustic wave with a peak amplitude of 15 kPa. We investigated the fundamental and subharmonic emissions at two driving frequencies: 5 and 10 MHz. The modulation of the bubble radius induced by the dynamic variation in the liquid ambient pressure subsequently causes modulations of the scattered acoustic pressure at the fundamental and subharmonic frequencies (half the fundamental frequency). As a first result, we measured that the variation in the ambient pressure of 15 kPa can modulate the subharmonic amplitude up to 10 dB as compared to the static atmospheric pressure condition. As a second result, we noticed that the relative subharmonic amplitude modulation as a function of the LF acoustic pressure was symmetrical for the 5 MHz driving frequency but asymmetric for 10 MHz. In the latter case, the subharmonic amplitude was more enhanced for an ambient overpressure than reduced for an ambient depression of the same amplitude likely due to the buckling of the lipid shell. However, the fundamental amplitude was symmetrically modulated during bubble compression and expansion. Moreover, subharmonic and fundamental amplitude modulations were found to be either in phase or out of phase with the low-frequency acoustic pressure. Numerical simulations showed that this behavior can be obtained depending on the bubbles' diameter. The highest subharmonic amplitude was measured when microbubbles were insonified at 10 MHz. This fact together with the asymmetry observed in the subharmonic modulation suggests that smaller bubbles with a buckling shell are excited at 10 MHz compared to 5 MHz. These results present new potentials for in vitro characterization of contrast agent microbubbles and possibly a new imaging modality.

AB In light with the view that KEAP1 loss of function may impact tumor behavior and modify response to chemotherapeutical agents, we sought to determine whether KEAP1 gene is epigenetically regulated in malignant gliomas. We developed a Quantitative Methylation Specific PC R (QMSP) assay to analyze 86 malignant gliomas and 20 normal brain tissues. The discriminatory power of the assay was assessed by Receiving Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. The AUC value of the curve was 0.823 (95% CI: 0.764-0.883) with an optimal cut off value of 0.133 yielding a 74% sensitivity (95% CI: 63%-82%) and an 85% specificity (95% CI: 64%-95%). Bisulfite sequencing analysis confirmed QMSP results and demonstrated a direct correlation between percentage of methylated CpGs and methylation levels (Spearman's Rho 0.929, p = 0.003). Remarkably, a strong inverse correlation was observed between methylation levels and KEAP1 mRNA transcript in tumor tissue (Spearman's Rho -0.656 p = 0.0001) and in a cell line before and after treatment with 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine (p = 0.003). RECPAM multivariate statistical analysis studying the interaction between MGMT and KEAP1 methylation in subjects treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide (n = 70), identified three prognostic classes of glioma patients at different risk to progress. While simultaneous methylation of MGMT and KEAP1 promoters was associated with the lowest risk to progress, patients showing only MGMT methylation were the subgroup at the higher risk (HR 5.54, 95% CI 1.35-22.74). Our results further suggest that KEAP1 expression is epigenetically regulated. In addition we demonstrated that KEAP1 is frequently methylated in malignant gliomas and a predictor of patient's outcome.

AB A widely cited roadblock to bridging ecological psychology and enactivism is that the former identifies with realism and the latter identifies with constructivism, which critics charge is subjectivist. A pragmatic reading, however, suggests non-mental forms of constructivism that simultaneously fit core tenets of enactivism and ecological realism. After advancing a pragmatic version of enactive constructivism that does not obviate realism, I reinforce the position with an empirical illustration: Physarum polycephalum, a communal unicellular organism that leaves slime trails that form chemical barriers that it avoids in foraging explorations. Here, environmental building and sensorimotor engagement are part of the same process with P. polycephalum coordinating around self-created, affordance-bearing geographies, which nonetheless exist independently in ways described by ecological realists. For ecological psychologists, affordances are values, meaning values are external to the perceiver. I argue that agent-enacted values have the same status and thus do not obviate ecological realism or generate subjectivism. The constructivist-realist debate organizes around the emphasis that enactivists and ecological theorists respectively place on the inner constitution of organisms vs. the structure of environments. Building on alimentary themes introduced in the P. polycephalum example and also in Gibson's work, I go on to consider how environment, brain, visceral systems, and even bacteria within them enter perceptual loops. This highlights almost unfathomable degrees of mutually modulating internal and external synchronization. It also shows instances in which internal conditions alter worldly configurations and invert values, in Gibson's sense of the term, albeit without implying subjectivism. My aim is to cut across the somatic focus of enactive constructivism and the external environment-oriented emphasis of ecological realism and show that enactivism can enrich ecological accounts of value.

AB Based on practical needs of oil fields, the viscosity, interfacial tension, static absorption, phase behaviors, molecular clew dimension (D-h), molecular configuration and flooding effect of the alkali/surfactant/polymer (ASP) systems were studied by instrumental analysis and physical modeling. The mechanisms of enhanced oil recovery were also discussed. As alkali concentration increased, the viscosity, interfacial tension and D-h of ASP decreased. As surfactant concentration increased, the viscosity and D-h increased, while the interfacial tension first decreased and then rose. The viscosity, interfacial tension and D-h of weak-alkali ASP all surpassed those of the strong-alkali ASP. The saturated absorption quantity of ASP ranked as surfactant > alkali > polymer. The saturated adsorption quantity and the ability to reduce the surfactant adsorption loss of the strong alkali were both higher, but the ability to reduce polymer adsorption loss was lower, compared with the weak alkali. As the concentrations of alkali and surfactant rose, the stability of emulsions was enhanced. The effect of alkali on the polymer molecular aggregation surpassed that of the surfactant. Physical modeling showed as the viscosity of the flooding agent rose, the recovery rate of weak-alkali ASP increased by 22.0% under the conditions of 1.2 wt% alkali, 0.3 wt% surfactant and 2500 mg/L polymer. The contribution rate to the recovery efficiency of A compound flooding ranked as the extended swept volume effect of the polymer (alpha(p)) > displacement effect (beta) > the extended swept volume of emulsification (alpha(e)). The results were alpha(p) = 73.5%, beta = 19.9%, alpha(e) = 6.6% (weak-alkali ASP); alpha(p) = 68.5%, beta = 23.0%, alpha(e) = 8.4% (strong-alkali ASP).

TI A conceptual model of the human-animal relationships dynamics during
   newborn handling on cow-calf operation farms
SO LIVESTOCK SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article

   Good practices of handling
AB Neonate calves are usually handled a day after birth for navel care and identification. During this procedure the newly calved cows usually become agitated and, in some cases, exhibit aggressive behavior toward humans, increasing the risk of accidents for both, humans and animals. In order to understand the dynamic relationships between cow, calf, and cowhand?s behavior expressed in this particular situation, a conceptual model was built by using the system dynamics methodology. Three dynamic hypotheses were formulated regarding the causeeffect relationship between: i) livestock-handling quality and maternal aggressiveness; ii) livestock-handling quality and newborn calf reactivity, and; iii) newborn calf reactivity and maternal aggressiveness. The first two hypotheses indicated that the improvement (increase) in handling quality will cause an effect in the opposite direction, decreasing cow?s aggressiveness and calf?s reactivity towards the cowhands. The third hypothesis indicated that the greater the calf?s reactivity, the greater will be the cow?s aggressiveness, interconnecting cowcalf behaviors. Moreover, the cow, calf, and cowhand subsystems are also comprised of other variables such as human and animal welfare and the occurrence of labor accidents. The combination of these three subsystems constituted a complex general dynamic model highlighting the connection among all agents involved in newborn handling procedure. Despite the complexity it is possible to identify components that promote, simultaneously, human and animal welfare when carrying out newborn calves handling procedures, offering opportunities to develop and adopt system management strategies. In this way, to reduce the risks of labor accidents and the impoverishment of overall welfare it is necessary to focus on three different factors, as follow: i) human behavior, ii) animal behavior, and iii) handling facilities. Thus, it is recommended to implement human capacity-building courses, the culling of aggressive cows and the use of appropriate facilities for the handling of newborn calves.

AB and are two closely related species of Australian stingless bees. The primary species-specific character is the architecture of the brood comb. The brood comb of is an open lattice comprising clumps of about ten cells that are connected by vertical pillars. In contrast, in the brood comb is a compact spiral in which all brood cells (except on the margins) are connected by their walls to adjacent cells at the same height. We made detailed observations of the cell construction process in two colonies of each species. From these observations we formed a species-specific hypothesis about the algorithm followed by the bees during cell construction. The two algorithms allowed us to make predictions about the locations of new cells. Both and share a preference for constructing new brood cells in the clefts formed by two or three adjacent existing brood cells, but there are differences in detail for other components of the building process. The fundamental difference in the cell construction process of the two species is that for , when a cluster of cells contains ten cells, the next cell added to the cluster is offset upwards by half a cell length, or, less often, a vertical pillar rather than a new cell is constructed. In , cell construction is continuous at the comb margin so that there are no gaps between cells. Furthermore, it seems that only makes use of local knowledge of the brood comb when deciding to place new brood cells, whereas could make some building decisions based on knowledge of the total structure. We translated the species-specific algorithms into agent-based lattice swarm computer simulations of the cell construction process for the two species. These simulations produced representations of brood combs that are similar to those seen in vivo, suggesting that our biological rules are realistic.

AB Understanding of the intracellular molecular machinery that is responsible for the complex collective behavior of multicellular populations is an exigent problem of modern biology. Quorum sensing, which allows bacteria to activate genetic programs cooperatively, provides an instructive and tractable example illuminating the causal relationships between the molecular organization of gene networks and the complex phenotypes they control. In this work we-to our knowledge for the first time-present a detailed model of the population-wide transition to quorum sensing using the example of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. We construct a model describing the Ti plasmid quorum-sensing gene network and demonstrate that it behaves as an "on-off" gene expression switch that is robust to molecular noise and that activates the plasmid conjugation program in response to the increase in autoinducer concentration. This intracellular model is then incorporated into an agent-based stochastic population model that also describes bacterial motion, cell division, and chemical communication. Simulating the transition to quorum sensing in a liquid medium and biofilm, we explain the experimentally observed gradual manifestation of the quorum-sensing phenotype by showing that the transition of individual model cells into the "on" state is spread stochastically over a broad range of autoinducer concentrations. At the same time, the population-averaged values of critical autoinducer concentration and the threshold population density are shown to be robust to variability between individual cells, predictable and specific to particular growth conditions. Our modeling approach connects intracellular and population scales of the quorum-sensing phenomenon and provides plausible answers to the long-standing questions regarding the ecological and evolutionary significance of the phenomenon. Thus, we demonstrate that the transition to quorum sensing requires a much higher threshold cell density in liquid medium than in biofilm, and on this basis we hypothesize that in Agrobacterium quorum sensing serves as the detector of biofilm formation.

AB Retrieving items from storage locations in warehouses, commonly referred to as order picking, is often performed by human workers. The high amount of human work involved in order picking turns this activity into a time- and cost-intensive process step in warehouse operations. Due to the cost impact of manual order picking, researchers have developed various planning methods that support practitioners in realizing an efficient order picking process. Among these planning approaches, methods that support the routing of order pickers through the warehouse have been a very popular research topic in recent years, with the focus being both on the development of optimal and heuristic routing policies. Surprisingly, problems that may arise when implementing picker routes for human workers in practice have not been investigated so far. There is, however, empirical evidence that order pickers tend to deviate from optimal routes, putting the efficiency of these routing approaches at stake.
   This paper presents a detailed evaluation of the relative efficiency of order picker routing policies when order pickers deviate from pre-specified routes. First, different behavioral factors that may result in deviations from pre-specified routes are identified in a state-of-the-art literature review and using the results of an exploratory case study. Subsequently, an agent-based simulation model is developed to quantify the effects of deviations from pre-specified routes. The simulation model is then used to compare different routing policies in an extensive simulation experiment. The results of this paper indicate that even in case order pickers deviate from given routes, implementing the optimal routing policy should be the preferred option in most real-world scenarios.

AB 1. Live-trapping is a fundamental tool in the study of wildlife species and populations. Capture of nontarget species is an inherent side-effect of trapping animals that is inefficient and potentially detrimental to individuals and populations. Reducing recapture of nontarget species will increase the efficiency of long-term studies and projects, and minimize unwanted impacts.
   2. During the initial stages of a 3-year feral cat Felis catus control programme on San Clemente Island, California, USA, we experienced high recapture rates of nontarget endangered San Clemente Island foxes Urocyon littoralis clementae, impacting project efficiency and potentially foxes.
   3. We investigated whether we could modify our baiting strategy to reduce fox recaptures using behavioural modification techniques, while simultaneously maintaining the ability to capture feral cats. We tested two strategies, aversive conditioning and reward removal, to reduce fox recapture rates.
   4. Using lithium chloride (LC) as an aversive agent, we reduced fox recapture rates more than 10 times compared with rates using control bait. Using the reward removal technique, we reduced fox recapture rates almost 20 times compared with control baits. Neither behavioural modification technique deterred cats from entering traps, and our results suggest that by reducing fox recaptures, we improved our ability to capture cats.
   5. Synthesis and applications. These novel baiting strategies have wide applicability in wildlife research and management. The efficiency of long-term monitoring or control programmes may be enhanced by discouraging recapture of 'trap happy' animals. Potential impacts to threatened species confined in traps could be minimized by reducing recaptures. Sampling of rare species in biodiversity studies could be improved by reducing recapture of competitively superior or numerically dominant species.

AB A numerical method is developed to study the dynamic behaviour of an encapsulated bubble when the viscous forces of the surrounding liquid are accounted for. The continuity and Navier-Stokes equations are solved for the liquid, whereas the coating is described as a viscoelastic shell with bending resistance. The Galerkin Finite Element Methodology is employed for the spatial discretization of the flow domain surrounding the bubble, with the standard staggered grid arrangement that uses biquadratic and bilinear Lagrangian basis functions for the velocity and pressure in the liquid, respectively, coupled with a superparametric scheme with B-cubic splines as basis functions pertaining to the location of the interface. The spine method and the elliptic mesh generation technique are used for updating the mesh points in the interior of the flow domain as the shape of the interface evolves with time, with the latter being distinctly superior in capturing severely distorted shapes. The stabilizing effect of the liquid viscosity is demonstrated, as it alters the amplitude of the disturbance for which a bubble deforms and/or collapses. For a step change in the far-field pressure the dynamic evolution of the microbubble is captured until a static equilibrium is achieved. Static shapes that are significantly compressed are captured in the post-buckling regime, leading to symmetric or asymmetric shapes, depending on the relative dilatation to bending stiffness ratio. As the external overpressure increases, shapes corresponding to all the solution families that were captured evolve to exhibit contact as the two poles approach each other. Shell viscosity prevents jet formation by relaxing compressive stresses and bending moments around the indentation generated at the poles due to shell buckling. This behaviour is conjectured to be the inception process leading to static shapes with contact regions.

AB In the present study, we describe a fingerprinting approach to analyze the time evolution of the MR signal and retrieve quantitative information about the microvascular network. We used a Gradient Echo Sampling of the Free Induction Decay and Spin Echo (GESFIDE) sequence and defined a fingerprint as the ratio of signals acquired pre- and post-injection of an iron-based contrast agent. We then simulated the same experiment with an advanced numerical tool that takes a virtual voxel containing blood vessels as input, then computes microscopic magnetic fields and water diffusion effects, and eventually derives the expected MR signal evolution. The parameter inputs of the simulations (cerebral blood volume [CBV], mean vessel radius [R], and blood oxygen saturation [SO2]) were varied to obtain a dictionary of all possible signal evolutions. The best fit between the observed fingerprint and the dictionary was then determined by using least square minimization. This approach was evaluated in 5 normal subjects and the results were compared to those obtained by using more conventional MR methods, steady-state contrast imaging for CBV and R and a global measure of oxygenation obtained from the superior sagittal sinus for SO2. The fingerprinting method enabled the creation of high-resolution parametric maps of the microvascular network showing expected contrast and fine details. Numerical values in gray matter (CBV = 3.1 +/- 0.7%, R = 12.6 +/- 2.4 pm, SO2 = 59.5 +/- 4.7%) are consistent with literature reports and correlated with conventional MR approaches. SO2 values in white matter (53.0 +/- 4.0%) were slightly lower than expected. Numerous improvements can easily be made and the method should be useful to study brain pathologies.

AB Enzymatic reactive crystallization of beta-lactam antibiotics provides a promising method for efficient and large-scale manufacturing. Since practical processes rely on immobilized enzyme for operation, a robust process model needs to take into account three phenomena of enzymatic reaction, species diffusion, and crystallization of the products. In this work a mathematical model and a numerical simulation procedure are developed for enzymatic reactive crystallization using penicillin G acylase immobilized on a porous carrier. Enzymatic reaction is described using previously established kinetic parameters for a commercial enzyme. An experimentally measured diffusivity is used to model the mass transport resistance, and a 1-D population balance model is used for crystallization of needle-like crystals from supersaturated species. The effect of five immobilization parameters, loading, carrier type and size, enzyme distribution, and carrier size distribution is systematically investigated using the developed model and their implications are discussed for synthesis of two beta-lactam antibiotics, ampicillin and cephalexin, with different turnover rates. As expected, using carriers with larger radius, higher loading, and smaller diffusivity is shown to lead to significant mass transport resistance and deviation from free enzyme behavior. This effect is more drastic for the ampicillin system, which has faster dynamics due to lower affinity of enzyme for its nucleophile agent. Testing different enzyme distributions, it is shown that accumulation of enzyme at the outer regions of the carrier leads to an improved process and mitigation of mass transport resistance due to higher sensitivity of diffusion timescale to radius, compared to reaction timescale to enzyme concentration. Adding a crystallization module to the model allowed for dynamic modeling of processes with high substrate concentrations applicable to reactive crystallization. Effect of pH as a critical process parameter affecting both reaction and crystallization is discussed, as well as potential intra-carrier crystallization and consequent enzyme blockage.

AB Ultrasound medical applications, such as an ultrasound imaging with micro-bubble contrast agents, and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy have attracted much attention in recent years. These applications have a close relation to the motion of micro-bubbles, so that it is essential to understand their dynamics. The bubble motion is influenced by the internal phenomena and its interaction with the surrounding medium, such as the thermal diffusion, the mist formation, the mass diffusion, the heat and mass transfer through the bubble wall. It is important that the oscillation of rnicro bubbles generates a strong acoustic pressure for these medical applications. The strong pressure also appears in the case of a bubble cluster, like a cloud cavitation. As these dynamics of bubbles are strongly influenced by the thermal phenomena inside them, it is necessary to construct the model taking these phenomena into account to analyse the behaviour of the bubble cluster precisely. Thus, the following effects are considered: the evaporation and condensation of the liquid at the bubble wall, the heat transfer through the bubble wall, and the compressibility of the liquid. Then the spherical bubble cluster is numerically simulated. When the frequency of the ultrasound is sufficiently high, the bubble cluster hardly oscillates. On the contrary, when the frequency of the ultrasound is at the resonance of the bubble cluster, the pressure wave generates the shock wave and it focuses to the cluster centre. As a result, the pressure inside the bubble at the cluster centre becomes much higher than that of a single bubble. Though this extreme high pressure causes the severe cavitation erosion, it is thought that this high energy concentration has the potential to be utilized for medical applications.

AB Biopolymer-capped particles, sodium alginate-, gelatin- and reconstituted silk fibroin-capped nanosilver (AgNPs), were synthesized with an intention to study, simultaneously, their in vitro and in vivo haemocompatibility, one of the major safety factors in biomedical applications. Solid state characterization showed formation of spherical nanoparticles with 5 to 30 nm primary sizes (transmission electron microscopy) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of particles confirmed silver bonding with the biopolymer moieties. The degree of aggregation of the biopolymer-capped AgNPs in the synthesis medium (ultrapure water) is relatively low, with comparable hydrodynamic size with those of the control citrate-stabilized NPs, and remained relatively unchanged even after 6 weeks. The polymer-capped nanoparticles showed different degrees of aggregation in biologically relevant media - PBS (pH 7.4) and 2% human blood plasma - with citrate- (control) and alginate-capped particles showing the highest aggregation, while gelatin- and silk fibroin-capped particles revealed better stability and less aggregation in these media. In vitro cytotoxicity studies revealed that the polymer-capped particles exhibited both concentration and (hydrodynamic) size-dependent haemolytic activity, the extent of which was higher (up to 100% in some cases) in collected whole blood samples of healthy human volunteers when compared to that in the washed erythrocytes. This difference is thought to result from the detected protein corona formation on the nanoparticle surface in the whole blood system, which was associated with reduced particle aggregation, causing more severe cytotoxic effects. At the tested particle concentration range in vitro, we observed a negligible haemolysis effect in vivo (Balb/c mice). Polymer-capped particles did accumulate in organs, with the highest levels detected in the liver (up to 422 mu g per g tissue), yet no adverse behavioural effects were observed in the mice during the duration of the nanoparticle exposure.

ID VOTER MODEL; ATTITUDE; DIFFUSION
AB Opinion dynamics models are based on the implicit assumption that people can observe the opinions of others directly, and update their own opinions based on the observation. This assumption significantly reduces the complexity of the process of learning opinions, but seems to be rather unrealistic. Instead, we argue that the opinion itself is unobservable, and that people attempt to infer the opinions of others by observing and interpreting their actions. Building on the notion of Bayesian learning, we introduce an action-opinion inference model (AOI model); this model describes and predicts opinion dynamics where actions are governed by underlying opinions, and each agent changes her opinion according to her inference of others' opinions from their actions. We study different action-opinion relations in the framework of the AOI model, and show how opinion dynamics are determined by the relations between opinions and actions. We also show that the well-known voter model can be formulated as being a special case of the AOI model when adopting a bijective action-opinion relation. Furthermore, we show that a so-called inclusive opinion, which is congruent with more than one action (in contrast with an exclusive opinion which is only congruent with one action), plays a special role in the dynamic process of opinion spreading. Specifically, the system containing an inclusive opinion always ends up with a full consensus of an exclusive opinion that is incompatible with the inclusive opinion, or with a mixed state of other opinions, including the inclusive opinion itself. A mathematical solution is given for some simple action-opinion relations to help better understand and interpret the simulation results. Finally, the AOI model is compared with the constrained voter model and the language competition model; several avenues for further research are discussed at the end of the paper.

AB The aim of this study was to characterize the behaviour of superparamagnetic particles in magnetic drug targeting (MDT) schemes. A 3-dimensional mathematical model was developed, based on the analytical derivation of the trajectory of a magnetized particle suspended inside a fluid channel carrying laminar flow and in the vicinity of an external source of magnetic force. Semi-analytical expressions to quantify the proportion of captured particles, and their relative accumulation (concentration) as a function of distance along the wall of the channel were also derived. These were expressed in terms of a non-dimensional ratio of the relevant physical and physiological parameters corresponding to a given MDT protocol. The ability of the analytical model to assess magnetic targeting schemes was tested against numerical simulations of particle trajectories. The semianalytical expressions were found to provide good first-order approximations for the performance of MDT systems in which the magnetic force is relatively constant over a large spatial range. The numerical model was then used to test the suitability of a range of different designs of permanent magnet assemblies for MDT. The results indicated that magnetic arrays that emit a strong magnetic force that varies rapidly over a confined spatial range are the most suitable for concentrating magnetic particles in a localized region. By comparison, commonly used magnet geometries such as button magnets and linear Halbach arrays result in distributions of accumulated particles that are less efficient for delivery. The trajectories predicted by the numerical model were verified experimentally by acoustically focusing magnetic microbeads flowing in a glass capillary channel, and optically tracking their path past a high field gradient Halbach array.

AB The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) plays an important role in coordinating physiological and behavioral responses to stress-related stimuli. In vertebrates, DMH serotonin (5-HT) concentrations increase rapidly in response to acute stressors or corticosterone (CORT). Recent studies suggest that CORT inhibits postsynaptic clearance of 5-HT from the extracellular fluid in the DMH by blocking organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3), a polyspecific CORT-sensitive transport protein. Because OCTs are low-affinity, high-capacity transporters, we hypothesized that CORT effects on extracellular 5-HT are most pronounced in the presence of elevated 5-HT release. We predicted that local application of CORT into the DMH would potentiate the effects of D-fenfluramine, a 5-HT-releasing agent, on extracellular 5-HT These experiments were conducted using in vivo microdialysis in freely-moving male Sprague-Dawley rats implanted with a microdialysis probe into the medial hypothalamus (MH), which includes the DMH. In Experiment 1, rats simultaneously received intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of 1 mg/kg D-fenfluramine or saline and either 200 ng/mL CORT or dilute ethanol (EtOH) vehicle delivered to the MH by reverse-dialysis for 40 min. In Experiment 2, 5 mu M D-fenfluramine and either 200 ng/mL CORT or EtOH vehicle were concurrently delivered to the MH for 40 min using reverse-dialysis. CORT potentiated the increases in extracellular 5-HT concentrations induced by either i.p. or intra-MH administration of D-fenfluramine. Furthermore, CORT and D-fenfluramine interacted to alter home cage behaviors. Our results support the hypothesis that CORT inhibition of OCT3-mediated 5-HT clearance from the extracellular fluid contributes to stress-induced increases in extracellular 5-HT and 5-HT signaling.

AB Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of free radical damage on two aspects of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) metabolism, namely, proliferation and phagocytosis. Bovine RPE cells were maintained in monolayer cultures, either as passaged (for proliferation and lysosomal activity assays) or primary cultures (for phagocytosis measurements). Free radicals (superoxide anions) were generated by a xanthine oxidase (XO)-hypoxanthine (HX) reaction. Total phagocytosis (binding plus ingestion of rod outer segments (ROS)) was quantitated by radioimmunoassay using a specific anti-opsin antibody and iodinated secondary antibody. In some cases, agents with known or possible protective influences against oxidative damage, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), vitamin E, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), were tested for their activity in this model system. RPE cell proliferation was inhibited in a HX-XO dose-dependent manner, in the absence of cell toxicity. Modifications of cell morphology were also noticed. Either simultaneous exposure of RPE cells to ROS membranes and HX-XO or pretreatment of ROS membranes with HX-XO prior to their addition to RPE monolayers led to a statistically significant 20-30% decrease in phagocytosis relative to control values. This decrease was essentially observed in the binding phase of phagocytosis, indicating damage to ROS surface molecules as the primary event. Addition of SOD or vitamin E prevented this loss of phagocytic activity, whereas bFGF had no effect. Superoxide radicals did not, however, affect phagocytosis when RPE cells were exposed to them alone, prior to incubation with ROS; nor did they alter a later stage in the phagocytic process, acid phosphatase activity. This tissue culture model represents a convenient system for analyting free radical damage in different aspects of RPE-photoreceptor behavior and may be useful in studying this phenomenon in several retinal disorders.

AB Laminar burning velocities and the flame response to stretch, as characterized by Markstein numbers, were determined experimentally and computationally for outwardly propagating spherical laminar premixed flames. The mixtures studied were premixed hydrogen/air/diluent and hydrogen/30% oxygen and 70% nitrogen (by volume)/diluent flames, with the latter condition of interest for pre-external vehicular activity preparation activities on board manned spacecraft. Other flame conditions were room temperature (300 K), fuel-equivalence ratios of 1.0 and 1.8, pressures of 0.5, 0.7, and 1.0 atm, diluents including helium, argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide as suppression agents, and diluent concentrations of 0-40% (by volume), which implies oxygen indices of 30-10 for present conditions. Predicted flame behavior was obtained from one-dimensional, spherically symmetric, steady, and time-dependent numerical simulations with variable-property and multicomponent transport and with detailed hydrogen/oxygen chemical kinetics. Flames Studied were sensitive to stretch, yielding unstretched/stretched laminar burning velocity ratios of 0.6-1.25 for conditions well away from quenching conditions (e.g., Karlovitz numbers; Ka <= 0.5). Diluents became more effective (provided greater reductions of the laminar burning velocity for a given diluent concentration) in the order helium, argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, which reflects their increased capabilities either to quench the reaction zone by increased specific heats or to reduce flame velocities by reduced transport rates. The addition of diluents generally decreased Markstein numbers, which made the flames more susceptible to preferential-diffusion instability. This effect increases flame speeds and tends to counteract the effect of diluents to reduce laminar burning velocities. (c) 2005 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB While deterministic metapopulation models for the spread of epidemics between populations have been well-studied in the literature, variability in disease transmission rates and interaction rates between individual agents or populations suggests the need to consider stochastic fluctuations in model parameters in order to more fully represent realistic epidemics. In the present paper, we have extended a stochastic SIS epidemic model - which introduces stochastic perturbations in the form of white noise to the force of infection (the rate of disease transmission from classes of infected to susceptible populations) - to spatial networks, thereby obtaining a stochastic epidemic metapopulation model We solved the stochastic model numerically and found that white noise terms do not drastically change the overall long-term dynamics of the system (for sufficiently small variance of the noise) relative to the dynamics of a corresponding deterministic system. The primary difference between the stochastic and deterministic metapopulation models is that for large time, solutions tend to quasi-stationary distributions in the stochastic setting, rather than to constant steady states in the deterministic setting. We then considered different approaches to controlling the spread of a stochastic SIS epidemic over spatial networks, comparing results for a spectrum of controls utilizing local to global information about the state of the epidemic. Variation in white noise was shown to be able to counteract the treatment rate (treated curing rate) of the epidemic, requiring greater treatment rates on the part of the control and suggesting that in real-life epidemics one should be mindful of such random variations in order for a treatment to be effective. Additionally, we point out some problems using white noise perturbations as a model, but show that a truncated noise process gives qualitatively comparable behaviors without these issues.

AB Background In the USA, men who have sex men (MSM) are at high risk for HIV, and black MSM have a substantially higher prevalence of infection than white MSM. We created a simulation model to assess the strength of existing hypotheses and data that account for these disparities.
   Methods We built a dynamic, stochastic, agent-based network model of black and white MSM aged 18-39 years in Atlanta, GA, USA, that incorporated race-specific individual and dyadic-level prevention and risk behaviours, network attributes, and care patterns. We estimated parameters from two Atlanta-based studies in this population (n=1117), supplemented by other published work. We modelled the ability for racial assortativity to generate or sustain disparities in the prevalence of HIV infection, alone or in conjunction with scenarios of observed racial patterns in behavioural, care, and susceptibility parameters.
   Findings Race-assortative mixing alone could not sustain a pre-existing disparity in prevalence of HIV between black and white MSM. Differences in care cascade, stigma-related behaviours, and CCR5 genotype each contributed substantially to the disparity (explaining 10.0%, 12.7%, and 19.1% of the disparity, respectively), but nearly half (44.5%) could not be explained by the factors investigated. A scenario assessing race-specific reporting differences in risk behaviour was the only one to yield a prevalence in black MSM (44.1%) similar to that observed (43.4%).
   Interpretation Racial assortativity is an inadequate explanation for observed disparities. Work to close the gap in the care cascade by race is imperative, as are efforts to increase serodiscussion and strengthen relationships among black MSM particularly. Further work is urgently needed to identify other sources of, and pathways for, this disparity, to integrate concomitant epidemics into models, and to understand reasons for racial differences in behavioural reporting.

AB Groundwater flow, driven, controlled and determined by topography, geology and climate, is responsible for several natural surface manifestations and affected by anthropogenic processes. Therefore, flowing groundwater can be regarded as an environmental agent. Numerical simulation of groundwater flow could reveal the flow pattern and explain the observed features. In complex geologic framework, where the geologic-hydrogeologic knowledge is limited, the groundwater flow model could not be constructed based solely on borehole data, but geophysical information could aid the model building. The integrated model construction was presented via the case study of the Tihany Peninsula, Hungary, with the aims of understanding the background and occurrence of groundwater-related environmental phenomena, such as wetlands, surface water-groundwater interaction, slope instability, and revealing the potential effect of anthropogenic activity and climate change. The hydrogeologic model was prepared on the basis of the compiled archive geophysical database and the results of recently performed geophysical measurements complemented with geologic-hydrogeologic data. Derivation of different electrostratigraphic units, revealing fracturing and detecting tectonic elements was achieved by systematically combined electromagnetic geophysical methods. The deduced information can be used as model input for groundwater flow simulation concerning hydrostratigraphy, geometry and boundary conditions. The results of numerical modelling were interpreted on the basis of gravity-driven regional groundwater flow concept and validated by field mapping of groundwater-related phenomena. The 3D model clarified' the hydraulic behaviour of the formations, revealed the subsurface hydraulic connection between groundwater and wetlands and displayed the groundwater discharge pattern, as well. The position of wetlands, their vegetation type, discharge features and induced landslides were explained as environmental imprints of groundwater. The highly vulnerable wetlands and groundwater-dependent ecosystems have to be in the focus of water management and natural conservation policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Acid in Carbonate Acidizing
SO SPE PRODUCTION & OPERATIONS

DT Article
ID REACTIVE DISSOLUTION; WORMHOLE FORMATION; SIMULATION
AB The success of matrix acidizing in carbonates is often dependent on the efficiency of diversion agents, especially for treatments on wells with thick formations or multiple zones, or horizontal wells with long and heterogeneous intervals. Viscoelastic-surfactant (VES) -based self-diversion acid has been used successfully in fields because of its negligible damage to the formation and good diversion ability. Although the diversion ability of VES acid was studied experimentally with small core plugs, the diversion conditions of VES acid under in-situ radial conditions need to be studied. In this paper, we develop a VES radial-acidizing model that simulates VES acid flow, acid/rock reaction, porosity variation, viscosifying, wormholing, and acid diversion in multiple zones. On the basis of the model, extensive numerical simulations are conducted to investigate wormholing behavior of the VES acid, the factors that affect the diversion ability of VES acid, and the diversion conditions of VES acid. The study shows that the VES acid-dissolution patterns depend on the injection rate, and there is an optimum injection rate under which the dominant wormholes are formed. Compared with regular acid, the VES acid provides better acid placement for heterogeneous intervals. The intervals with separation shorter than approximately 150 m can be acidized together with VES acid if the two intervals have a close permeability with no perforation between them. The permeability ratio of the two intervals has remarkable influence on the diversion performance of VES acid. Even though the viscosified fluid acts as a temporary barrier to prevent the fluid from flowing into the higher-permeability formation, the VES acid reduces diversion effectiveness for large permeability contrast. We also investigated the combined effect of permeability contrast and separation of the two intervals on diversion performance. This study provides a basis to select diversion technology and a method to evaluate diversion performance of VES acid for field-acidizing treatments.

AB In comparison with lymphomas and leukemias, chemotherapy of solid neoplasms, i.e., cancer, has much more limited success in curing the patient. This lack of efficacy of chemotherapy has been attributed to increased interstitial fluid pressure within cancers, which obstructs convection and only permits diffusion of oxygen and nutrients about 100 mu m from blood vessels. As diffusion is limited to this distance, hypoxic and necrotic fractions within the tumor are observed beyond this region. The comparably small number of cancer cells that can be targeted with drugs inevitably leads to an ineffective treatment response. This study presents an analysis of the influence of interstitial fluid pressure on the chemotherapeutic effect in an HT29 human colon cancer xenograft mouse tumor model. To investigate the limited distribution of drugs into primary tumor and metastases, we developed a mathematical model describing tumor growth dynamics of oxygenated, hypoxic, and necrotic fractions, combined with a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model describing the behavior and effectivity of the chemotherapeutic agent. According to the numerical simulations, the age of the tumor at treatment was the decisive factor in the reduction in size of the primary tumor. This effect is mediated by the rapid decrease in the percentage of oxygenated cells within the tumor, which reduces the fraction of cells that can be affected by the drug. As in the primary tumor, interstitial fluid pressure builds up in metastases when they reach a specific size, leading to the formation of tumor fractions. This behavior is absent if the metastasis enters a dormant phase before the threshold for the development of interstitial fluid pressure has been reached. The small size of these metastases maximizes therapeutic success since they consist only of oxygenated cells, and the drug therefore affects all the cells.

AB Thermochemical conversion of biomass is an encouraging way for the production of syngas. In the present research, four different biomass materials were used for gasification which includes rice husk, cotton stalks, sugarcane bagasse, and sawdust. These biomass sources were selected because they are common Pakistani feedstocks. Gasification of selected biomasses was performed using concentric tube entrained flow gasifier. Three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model was used to investigate the impacts of kinetic rate and diffusion rate on the gasification performance. The Euler-Lagrange method was used for the development of entrained flow biomass gasifier using commercial computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS FLUENT (R) 14. Discrete phase model was used to predict the movement of particles, whereas the gas phase was treated as the continuous phase with a standard k-epsilon turbulent model to predict the behavior of gas phase flow. Finite rate/Eddy dissipation model was applied for the calculation of homogenous and heterogeneous reaction rates. Oxygen was used as a gasifying agent. Cotton stalks and sugarcane bagasse produced higher mole fractions of hydrogen (H-2) and carbon monoxide (CO) than sawdust and rice husk. Regarding carbon conversion efficiency, cold gas efficiency, and higher heating value cotton stalks and sugarcane bagasse produced better syngas quality as compared to sawdust and rice husk. The oxygen/fuel (O/F) ratio is a key operating parameter in the field of gasification and combustion. The O/F ratio above 0.42 favored combustion reactions and increased mole fraction of water vapor (H2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in syngas composition, whereas gasification reactions dominated below 0.42 O/F ratio, resulting increased mole fraction of H-2 and CO in syngas composition.

AB One-pot, sequential reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was employed for the preparation of five end-linked semifluorinated amphiphilic polymer conetworks based on 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA, hydrophobic monomer) and 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA, hydrophilic monomer). 1,4-Bis[2-(thiobenzoylthio)prop-2-yl]benzene (1,4-BT-BTPB) was used as the chain transfer agent, while ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) served as the cross-linker. Three of the end-linked conetworks were based on ABA triblock copolymers with polyDMAE-MA midblocks with degrees of polymerization (DPs) of 50 and polyTFEMA end-blocks with overall polyTFEMA DPs of 25, 50, and 75. The fourth end-linked amphiphilic polymer conetwork was based on an equimolar BAB triblock copolymer with a polyTFEMA midblock and an overall copolymer DP of 100. The last end-linked conetwork was based on a statistical copolymer. A randomly cross-linked conetwork was also prepared by the simultaneous terpolymerization of the two comonomers (equimolar) and the cross-linker. The molecular weights and compositions of all the polymer precursors to the conetworks were characterized using gel permeation chromatography and H-1 NMR spectroscopy, respectively. The conetworks were characterized in terms of their degrees of swelling (DS) in THE and in water as a function of the solution pH. All conetworks swelled more in acidic than in pure water due to the ionization of the DMAEMA units in acidic water. The low pH aqueous DS of the statistical copolymer-based end-linked conetwork was higher than those of its triblock copolymer counterparts due to lack of microphase separation within the former conetwork. Finally, the microphase separation of the amphiphilic conetworks in deuterium oxide was investigated using small-angle neutron scattering which indicated a distance between the hydrophobic scattering centers of about 15 nm.

AB Insect G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) have important roles in modulating biology, physiology and behavior. They have been identified as candidate targets for next-generation insecticides, yet these targets have been relatively poorly exploited for insect control. In this study, we present a pipeline of novel Manduca sexta allatotropin (Manse-AT) antagonist discovery with homology modeling, docking, molecular dynamics simulation and structure-activity relationship. A series of truncated and alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT were assayed for the stimulation of juvenile hormone biosynthesis. The minimum sequence required to retain potent biological activity is the C-terminal amidated octapeptide Manse-AT (6-13). We identified three residues essential for bioactivity (Thr(4), Arg(6) and Phe(8)) by assaying alanine-replacement analogs of Manse-AT (6-13). Alanine replacement of other residues resulted in reduced potency but bioactivity was retained. The 3D structure of the receptor (Manse-ATR) was built and the binding pocket was identified. The binding affinities of all the analogs were estimated by calculating the free energy of binding. The calculated binding affinities corresponded to the biological activities of the analogs, which supporting our localization of the binding pocket. Then, based on the docking and molecular dynamics studies of Manse-AT (10-13), we described it can act as a potent Manse-AT antagonist. The antagonistic effect on JH biosynthesis of Manse-AT (10-13) validated our hypothesis. The IC50 value of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) is 0.9 nM. The structure-activity relationship of antagonist Manse-AT (10-13) was also studied for the further purpose of investigating theoretically the structure factors influencing activity. These data will be useful for the design of new Manse-AT agonist and antagonist as potential pest control agents.

AB Predator-prey interactions play a substantial role in shaping spatial distributions of organisms in biological communities. Recent theory has considered optimal habitat selection strategies for predators and prey that interact in real time. One consistent prediction across many theoretical studies is that it could be adaptive for predators to assess and respond to the quality of resources consumed by their prey (resources the predators do not consume). However, extremely few empirical studies have tested this prediction. We utilized a tritrophic system in which seven-spotted lady beetles (Coccinella septempunctata L., Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), pea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum (Harris), Hemiptera: Aphididae) and tic bean plants (Vicia faba L., Fabaceae) were, respectively, the predators, prey and prey's resource. In microcosms, we created patches of varying quality (from the perspective of the prey) among which predators and prey were allowed to move freely. By utilizing treatments in which there were (1) prey but no predators, (2) predators but no prey and (3) predators and prey simultaneously, we determined which sources of information influenced movement and habitat selection. Predators were able to detect and respond to the quality per se of their prey's resource, and they preferred the highest-quality patch regardless of the presence of prey. While theory has frequently predicted such behaviour, direct responses of predators to resource quality (rather than resource amounts, resource damage, or indirect cues of prey) have not previously been demonstrated. These results substantiate general predictions of ecological theory and have implications for predicting the behaviour of biological control agents.

AB Background: The beta-lactam antibiotics, in combination with aminoglycosides, are among the most widely prescribed antibiotics. However, because of extensive and unnecessary use, resistance to these drugs continues to increase. In recent years, resistance in the Indian bacterial. population has increased markedly, the majority showing complex mechanisms. Due to increased transcontinental movement of the human population, it would be wise to know the prevalence and resistance complexity of these strains, well in advance, in order to formulate a policy for empirical therapy.
   Methods: One hundred and eighty-one isolates of Escherichia coli and 61 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae obtained from 2655 non-repeat samples of pus (912) and urine (1743) were studied, and their resistance rates and patterns were noted. The isolates were analyzed for prevalent aminoglycoside and cephalosporin resistance phenotypes and for the presence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC enzymes by spot-inoculation and modified three-dimensional tests developed in our laboratory. Fourteen isolates of E. coli and six of K. pneumoniae, resistant to all of the antibiotics tested, were selected for plasmid screening, curing, and transconjugation experiments, and for comparative evaluation of the double disk synergy test (DDST) and modified three-dimensional test (TDT) for detection of beta-lactamases.
   Results: Urinary E. coli isolates showed maximum susceptibility to amikacin (57.1%), followed by tobramycin (38.5%) and gentamicin (31.9%). Eighteen (19.8%) isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime, whereas 11 (12.1%) were susceptible to ceftriaxone. The K. pneumoniae isolates from urine samples showed maximum susceptibility to tobramycin (63.6%) followed by amikacin (54.5%). Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 31.8% were susceptible to cefotaxime and 13.6% were susceptible to ceftriaxone. A more or less similar trend of antibiotic susceptibility was noted in E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from pus samples. Twenty-six (14.4%) E. coli and 15 (24.6%) K. pneumoniae isolates were found to be ESBL-producers by NCCLS-ESBL phenotypic confirmatory test. Eighteen (9.9%) E. coli and 19 (31.1%) K. pneumoniae isolates were found to be AmpC enzyme-producers by our modified TDT. The simultaneous occurrence of ESBL and AmpC enzymes was noted in 7.7% and 9.8% isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively.
   Conclusions: The prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacterial isolates is quite high in our bacterial. population. On comparative evaluation of DDST and TDT in resistant isolates, TDT was found to be the better method, detecting ESBLs in 80% of isolates compared to 15% with DDST. A 19.9-kb plasmid was consistently present in all the screened isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and was inferred to encode cefoxitin and tetracycline resistance based on curing and transconjugation experiments.

AB We describe the properties of the Sun, those of its Active Regions (Centres of Activity, ARs or CAs) and the 11 and 22-year cycles as observed via the variable numbers of sunspots. We describe the variations with time of the solar irradiance and of the flux of ejected magnetised plasma. We discuss the probable cause of solar variability. Planetary influences are ruled out; the variability is intrinsic and is described by the solar dynamo. The dynamo is characterised by internal toroidal and more superficial poloidal fields, interchanging and alternating in a 22-year periodicity. From these two components in the solar magnetic fields emanate two possible scenarios for the Sun-climate interaction.
   Solar irradiance variations are related to those in the solar toroidal magnetic fields. The fraction of the solar irradiance that reaches the Earth's ground level and low troposphere is emitted by the solar photosphere. That fraction does not significantly vary since the quiet photosphere does not significantly vary during the cycle. The variable part of the solar radiation flux is mainly emitted by the chromospheric parts of the CAs. That radiation component does not reach the Earth's troposphere since it is absorbed in the higher, stratospheric terrestrial layers. Tropospheric solar-driven variations should therefore be due to stratosphere-troposphere Coupling. The Group Sunspot number R-Gs is a proxy for the variable irradiance component and for the toroidal field variations.
   Ejected solar plasma clouds such as the Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and plasma ejected from Ephemeral Solar Regions and from the polar facular regions are related to variations in the poloidal magnetic fields. On the average they have their maximum intensity about a year after the maximum number of spots: we call this interval the Energetic Emissions Delay. These gas clouds fill the heliosphere with magnetised plasma. Thus, by emitting magnetised plasma. the Sun influences the Earth's atmosphere indirectly, by heliospheric modulation of the component of the galactic cosmic radiation (CR) that reaches tropospheric levels. Modulation is only important for cosmic ray particles with energies below about 50 GeV. Cosmic ray ionisation plays a minor role at ground level but it is the predominant ionising agent in higher atmospheric layers, already above a few kilometres. The amplitudes of the CR variations depend on those of the solar cycle. The atmospheric rate of ionisation varies with CR-intensity. A current hypothesis is that the variable ionisation may affect the degree of cloudiness. Cosmogenic radionuclides Such as Be-10 are proxies for this influence and for the poloidal field variations.
   The R-G and cosmogenic radionuclide proxies, although loosely correlated, refer to the two different aspects of the solar dynamo with their different terrestrial effects; they do not reach maximum intensity simultaneously and should therefore neither be confused nor be interchanged. Cases have occurred in which the one varied strongly while the other did hardly or not at all. The explanation must be intrinsic in dynamo theory.
   There is a significant solar signal in the troposphere; it depends on latitude and longitude. A physical investigation of the cause of the Sun-climate relationship based on one unique Delta T(time)-curve, assumed valid for the whole Earth's surface, is therefore basically incorrect. Never during the past 10,000 years has the Sun been as active in ejecting magnetised plasma as during the past few decades. Estimates suggest that the level of solar activity may recently have passed its maximum and that it may decrease in coming decades.
   Solar activity is variable with six well-determined quasi-periodicities. Attempts to theoretically describe the solar dynamo have so far succeeded only in explaining the qualitative aspects. They fail in a numerical description and notably in one that would permit one to forecast solar activity with acceptable precision. This is so because the solar dynamo is a non-linear system that occasionally shows phase catastrophes. It is a quasi-periodic engine with the properties of deterministic chaos. "The future of such a chaotic system is intrinsically unpredictable".

AB Background. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are well known as cytoprotective proteins. Geranylgeranyl acetone (GGA), an antiulcer agent, has recently been shown to induce Hsp70. This study was performed to investigate the renoprotective properties of GGA.
   Methods. The effect of GGA on the induction of the major HSPs (Hsp90. Hsp70. Hsc70, Hsp60, and Hsp32) was studied in the rat kidney or rat primary cultures of tubular epithelial cells (R-TECs) by Western blot. Localization of Hsp70 was determined by immunohistochemistry. The renoprotective effects of GGA were studied using a rat model of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. GGA (400 mg/kg), GGA with quercetin pretreatment (100 mg/kg), or a vehicle was given to rats 24 hours and again I hour prior to the induction of I/R injury. Rats were sacrificed at 24 hours after reperfusion. Histologic analyses and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay were performed. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine was also measured. The cytoprotcctive properties of GGA were also studied in vitro by treating R-TECs with GGA (10 mu mol/L) or a vehicle, followed by incubation in culture medium with oxidative stress condition (0.5 mmol/L hydrogen peroxide) or ischemic condition (2 nmol/L NaCN and 20 mmol/L 2-deoxyglucose in the absence of medium glucose).
   Results. Oral administration of GGA induced Hsp70 expression in the kidney (which peaked at 24 hours) but did not induce Hsp90, Hsc70, Hsp60, or Hsp32. The induction of Hsp70 was blocked by quercetin. Immunohistochemistry showed that Hsp70 was localized mainly in the tubular epithelial cells. Preconditioning rats with GGA significantly decreased BUN and serum creatinine levels after I/R injury. Histologic examination revealed that GGA significantly attenuated tubular damage and macrophage infiltration. The number of TUNEL-positive cells also decreased significantly in the GGA group. Quercetin. an inhibitor of Hsp70 induction. eliminated these renoprotective effects of GGA. In in vitro study, GGA-induced Hsp70 in R-TECs, which peaked at 2 to 4 hours. Both oxidative stress and ischemic stimuli induced apoptosis in R-TECs. GGA significantly suppressed the number of apoptotic Cells in both conditions.
   Conclusion. The results support the hypothesis that GGA induces Hsp70. protects tubular epithelial cells from apoptosis. and thus ameliorates tubular damage by I/R injury. The present study suggests that GGA would be a useful tool in treating acute renal failure or preventing transplanted kidney damage in the clinical setting.

AB In the era of druggable genome, the assessment of the numerous molecular targets represents remarkable therapeutic opportunities in the pharmaceutical and chemical biology, simultaneously understanding the properties required for the small molecules to emerge as good drug candidate. Incorporation of readily amenable biological properties and pharmaceutical modulation is the core key for the small molecule driven target studies in cancer related disease, especially in the case of inhibitory type mechanisms. Among huge protein targets, CK2 which is a protein serine/threonine kinase, also called the "Predominant monitor" of the cell plays comprehensive role in the various cellular machinery pertaining to cell growth and cell death. Due to its ubiquitous nature and its activity to block its activity by small molecules resulting in favorably targeting prostate cancer, CK2 was identified to be the distinct element of our study. In this study, we invested rapid computational techniques to uncover the new CK2 inhibitors with promising pharmaceutical traits and advantages when matched with existing drugs. Initially, pharmacophore modeling and atom-based 3Dimensional-Quantitative structure activity relationship of 45 known CK2 inhibitors resulted in over few hundred hypotheses. The most excellent five point pharmacophore model (AAHHR) with two hydrogen bond acceptor (A), two hydrophobic groups (H), and one aromatic ring (R) was built. 3D-QSAR studies of the finest model yielded correlation coefficient, R-2 (0.9728) and Q(2) (0.7965) for training and test set compounds respectively. Our effort of externally validating the generated QSAR model was quite momentous and encouraging with r(m)(2) = 0.682, r(cv)(2) = 0.779, k = 1.027 and r(0)(2) = 0.817 values points out the profoundness in predicting preeminence of model. The robust model was further employed as 3D query for virtual screening against ZINC database. The lead molecules were selected based on the fitness score, and then the lead molecules subsequently taken to molecular docking studies using Glide. Finally we identified six potential lead molecules were further subjected into ADME properties prediction by engaging Qikprop module. The ADME properties of six lead molecules ZINC15955420, Zinc13412605, Zinc40763681, Zinc40763677, Zinc26178676 and Zinc01536721 are under satisfactory range with desired ADME properties. On the whole, we believe our design of the new CK2 inhibitor serves as the approachable end resultant hits the can be researched further for clinical trials evaluation in prostate cancer and emphasize on choosing CK2 as the target that holds true protential for the genesis and proliferation of anti-CK2 agents to address prostate cancer therapeutics.

AB Elevated levels of aluminium (At), strontium (Sr), barium (Ba), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) cations combined with deficiencies of magnesium (Mg)/calcium (Ca) - have been observed in the foodchains that traditionally support the Chamorro populations affected by high incidence clusters of Alzheimer (AD), Parkinson-like (PD), motor neurone diseases and multiple sclerosis on the island of Guam. Soils drawn from the cluster region demonstrated an excessive fivefold increase in 'magnetic susceptibility' readings in relation to soils from disease free adjoining regions. A multifactorial aetiological hypothesis is proposed that pivots upon the combined exposure to high levels of natural/industrial sources of ferrimagnetic/ferroelectric compounds incorporating A[, Fe, Mn, Sr, Ba (e.g., via yam/seafood consumption or exposure to world war 2 (WW2) munitions) and to low levels of Mg/Ca in all S. Pacific locations where these clusters of neurodegenerative disease have simultaneously erupted. Once gut/blood brain barrier permeability is impaired, the increased uptake of At, Fe, Sr, Ba, or Mn into the Mg/Ca depleted brain Leads to rogue metal substitutions at the Mg/Ca vacated binding domains on various enzyme/proteoglycan groups, causing a broad ranging disruption in Mg/Ca dependent systems - such as the glutamine synthetase which prevents the accumulation of neurotoxic glutamate. The rogue metals chelate sulphate, disrupting sulphated-proteoglycan mediated inhibition of crystal proliferation, as well as its regulation of the Fibroblast growth factor receptor complex which disturbs the molecular conformation of those receptors and their regulation of transphosphorylation between intracellular kinase domains; ultimately collapsing proteoglycan mediated cell-cell signalling pathways which maintain the growth and structural integrity of the neuronal networks. The depression of Mg/Ca dependent systems in conjunction with the progressive ferrimagnetisation of the CNS due to an overload of rogue ferroelectric/ferrimagnetic metal contaminants, enables 'seeding' of metal-protein crystalline arrays that can proliferate in the proteoglycan depleted brain. The resulting magnetic field emissions initiate a free radical mediated progressive pathogenesis of neurodegeneration. The coclustering of these various types of disease in select geographical pockets around the world suggests that all of these conditions share a common early life exposure to ferromagnetic metal nucleating agents in their multifactorial aetiology. Factors such as individual genetics, the species of metal involved, etc., dictate which specific class of disease will emerge as a delayed neurotoxic response to these environmental insults.

AB Background Neurokinin (NK) 1 receptor antagonists (RAs), administered in combination with a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) RA and dexamethasone (DEX), have demonstrated clear improvements in chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prevention over a 5-HT(3)RA plus DEX. However, studies comparing the NK1RAs in the class are lacking. A fixed combination of a highly selective NK(1)RA, netupitant, and the 5-HT(3)RA, palonosetron (NEPA), simultaneously targets two critical antiemetic pathways, thereby offering a simple convenient antiemetic with long-lasting protection from CINV. This study is the first head-to-head NK(1)RA comparative study in patients receiving anthracycline cyclophosphamide (AC) and non-AC moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC). Materials and Methods This was a pragmatic, multicenter, randomized, single-cycle, open-label, prospective study designed to demonstrate noninferiority of single-dose NEPA to a 3-day aprepitant regimen in preventing CINV in chemotherapy-naive patients receiving AC/non-AC MEC in a real-life setting. The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (no emesis/no rescue) during the overall (0-120 hour) phase. Noninferiority was achieved if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between NEPA and the aprepitant group was greater than the noninferiority margin set at -10%. Results Noninferiority of NEPA versus aprepitant was demonstrated (risk difference 9.2%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 20.7%); the overall complete response rate was numerically higher for NEPA (64.9%) than aprepitant (54.1%). Secondary endpoints also revealed numerically higher rates for NEPA than aprepitant. Conclusion This pragmatic study in patients with cancer receiving AC and non-AC MEC revealed that a single dose of oral NEPA plus DEX was at least as effective as a 3-day aprepitant regimen, with indication of a potential efficacy benefit for NEPA. Implications for Practice In the absence of comparative neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist (RA) studies, guideline committees and clinicians consider NK(1)RA agents to be interchangeable and equivalent. This is the first head-to-head study comparing one NK(1)RA (oral netupitant/palonosetron [NEPA]) versus another (aprepitant) in patients receiving anthracycline cyclophosphamide (AC) and non-AC moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Noninferiority of NEPA versus the aprepitant regimen was demonstrated; the overall complete response (no emesis and no rescue use) rate was numerically higher for NEPA (65%) than aprepitant (54%). As a single-dose combination antiemetic, NEPA not only simplifies dosing but may offer a potential efficacy benefit over the current standard-of-care.

AB Background/aims In the conduct of phase I trials, the limited use of innovative model-based designs in practice has led to an introduction of a class of model-assisted designs with the aim of effectively balancing the trade-off between design simplicity and performance. Prior to the recent surge of these designs, methods that allocated patients to doses based on isotonic toxicity probability estimates were proposed. Like model-assisted methods, isotonic designs allow investigators to avoid difficulties associated with pre-trial parametric specifications of model-based designs. The aim of this work is to take a fresh look at an isotonic design in light of the current landscape of model-assisted methods.
   Methods The isotonic phase I method of Conaway, Dunbar, and Peddada was proposed in 2004 and has been regarded primarily as a design for dose-finding in drug combinations. It has largely been overlooked in the single-agent setting. Given its strong simulation performance in application to more complex dose-finding problems, such as drug combinations and patient heterogeneity, as well as the recent development of user-friendly software to accompany the method, we take a fresh look at this design and compare it to a current model-assisted method. We generated operating characteristics of the Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method using a new web application developed for simulating and implementing the design and compared it to the recently proposed Keyboard design that is based on toxicity probability intervals.
   Results The Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method has better performance in terms of accuracy of dose recommendation and safety in patient allocation in 17 of 20 scenarios considered. The Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method also allocated fewer patients to doses above the maximum tolerated dose than the Keyboard method in many of scenarios studied. Overall, the performance of the Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method is strong when compared to the Keyboard method, making it a viable simple alternative to the model-assisted methods developed in recent years.
   Conclusion The Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method does not rely on the specification and fitting of a parametric model for the entire dose-toxicity curve to estimate toxicity probabilities as other model-based designs do. It relies on a similar set of pre-trial specifications to toxicity probability interval-based methods, yet unlike model-assisted methods, it is able to borrow information across all dose levels, increasing its efficiency. We hope this concise study of the Conaway-Dunbar-Peddada method, and the availability of user-friendly software, will augment its use in practice.

SO JOURNAL OF VASCULAR AND INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB PURPOSE: To compare the precision of magnetic resonance (MR)-guided versus fluoroscopy-guided placement of retrievable inferior vena cava (IVC) filters with use of real-time MR imaging strategies optimized for each device in an in vitro model and in an animal model.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three different retrievable IVC filters were used in this study, including the Recovery, Gunther Tulip, and OptEase devices. Experiments were performed on a 1.5T-MR system with prerelease interactive MR software. For each device, high-resolution real-time MR imaging was optimized with use of steady-state free precession and fast low-angle shot sequences with radial and cartesian trajectories and varying flip angles (10 degrees-70 degrees) and a frame rate of 2 per second. A custom-built IVC phantom was filled with dilute gadolinium contrast agent at a concentration of 0.05 mmol/L simulating a blood T1 of 8 msec and T2 of 6 msec. Signal intensities were measured in regions of interest at the filter, the IVC lumen, and the background. The contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were calculated. The sequence suited best for each device was chosen for in vitro filter placement in a custom-made IVC phantom. Each device was deployed five times each under MR and fluoroscopic guidance with use of identical techniques. Accuracy was measured as absolute deviation of the filter tip in millimeters from a target landing zone. Differences were assessed statistically with use of the paired t test. Each device was also placed in vivo in a swine model under MR guidance.
   RESULTS: All three IVC filters could be clearly identified and positioned under fluoroscopic and MR imaging control. A cartesian true fast imaging sequence with steady-state precession with a flip angle of 30 degrees or 50 degrees resulted in optimal SNR and CNR for all three filters. The Tulip filter created more susceptibility artifacts than the other two. Filter placement accuracy was similar with MR and fluoroscopy whether comparing devices individually (P = NS) or as a group (P = NS). The mean absolute differences between MR and fluoroscopy were 0.088 mm for the OptEase filter, 0.41 mm for the Bard Recovery filter, and 0.34 mm for the Gunther Tulip filter.
   CONCLUSIONS: MR-guided placement of retrievable IVC filters is feasible and as accurate as fluoroscopy-guided placement in an in vitro model. With optimized sequences, real-time MR has the potential to develop as a reasonable alternative to fluoroscopy.

AB Lipotrope-deficient (methyl-deficient) diets cause fatty livers and increased liver-cell turnover and promote carcinogenesis in rodents. In rats prolonged intake of methyl-deficient diets results in liver tumor development. The mechanisms responsible for the cancer-promoting and carcinogenic properties of this deficiency remain unclear. The results of the experiments described here lend support to the hypothesis that intake of such a diet, by causing depletion of S-adenosylmethionine pools, results in DNA hypomethylation, which in turn leads to changes in expression of genes that may have key roles in regulation of growth. In livers of rats fed a severely methyl-deficient diet (MDD), lowered pools of S-adenosylmethionine and hypomethylated DNA were observed within 1 week. The extent of DNA hypomethylation increased when MDD was fed for longer periods. The decreases in overall levels of DNA methylation were accompanied by simultaneous alterations in gene expression, yielding patterns that closely resembled those reported to occur in livers of animals exposed to cancer-promoting chemicals and in hepatomas. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs from livers of rats fed control or deficient diets showed that, after 1 week of MDD intake, there were large increases in levels of mRNAs for the c-myc and c-fos oncogenes, somewhat smaller increases in c-Ha-ras mRNA, and virtually no change in levels of c-Ki-ras mRNA. In contrast, mRNAs for epidermal growth factor receptor decreased significantly. The elevated levels of expression of the c-myc, c-fos, and c-Ha-ras genes were accompanied by selective changes in patterns of methylation within the sequences specifying these genes. Changes in DNA methylation and in gene expression induced in livers of rats fed MDD for 1 month were gradually reversed after restoration of an adequate diet. In hepatomas induced by prolonged dietary methyl deficiency, methylation patterns of c-Ki-ras and c-Ha-ras were abnormal. Although human diets are unlikely to be as severely methyl deficient as those used in these experiments, in some parts of the world intake of diets that are low in methionine and choline and contaminated with mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin, are common. Even in industrialized nations, deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B-12 are not uncommon and are exacerbated by some therapeutic agents and by substance abuse. Thus, it seems possible that interactions of diet and contaminants or drugs, by inducing changes in DNA methylation and aberrant gene expression, may contribute to cancer causation in humans.

AB Glycerin is applied to cigarette tobacco at levels in the range of about 1-5% to improve moisture holding characteristics of tobacco and act as a surface active agent for flavor application. Neat material pyrolysis studies, smoke chemistry and biological activity studies (bacterial mutagenicity, cytotoxicity, in vivo micronucleus, and sub-chronic rodent inhalation) with mainstream smoke, or mainstream smoke preparations from cigarettes containing various target levels (5%, 10%, and 15%) of the glycerin were performed to provide data for an assessment of the use of glycerin as a cigarette tobacco ingredient. The actual levels of glycerin in the respective test cigarettes were determined to be 3.2%, 6.2% and 8.4% after cigarette production. At simulated tobacco burning temperatures up to 900 degrees C, neat glycerin did not pyrolyze extensively suggesting that glycerin would transfer intact to mainstream smoke (smoke was not analyzed for glycerin in this study). On a tar basis, nicotine in smoke was significantly decreased at 10% and 15% glycerin while water was increased at all addition levels. Addition of 10% or 15% glycerin also resulted in a statistically significant increase in acrolein (9%) and a decrease in acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, aromatic amines, nitrogen oxides, tobacco specific nitrosamines, and phenols. Addition of 5% glycerin produced the same decrease in smoke constituents as the 10% and 15% groups but there was no concomitant increase in acrolein. Biological tests indicated no relevant differences in the genotoxic or cytotoxic potential of either mainstream smoke (or smoke preparations) from cigarettes with added glycerin compared to control cigarettes. Cigarette smoke atmosphere dilution, coupled with the lower nicotine delivery in the test cigarettes containing glycerin resulted in a lower nicotine delivery to the glycerin cigarette smoke exposed rats of the 90-day inhalation study. Smoke atmosphere acrolein was also reduced in a concentration-related manner. Incorporation of glycerin at target levels up to 15% did not produce any adverse effects in rats exposed for 90-days. The major observation in the study was a reduced biological activity of the smoke as indicated by a reduction in the severity and/or incidence of focal macrophage accumulation in the lungs and goblet cell hyperplasia/hypertrophy in the nose (level 1), and goblet cell staining depletion in the nose (level 1). The results of these studies with glycerin applied to cigarette tobacco suggest that adding glycerin to cigarette tobacco at typical use levels does not adversely alter the smoke chemistry or biological effects normally associated with exposure to mainstream cigarette smoke.

AB Numerical modeling is a well established tool in rock mechanics studies investigating a wide range of problems. Implicit methods for solving linear equations have the advantage of being unconditionally stable, while explicit methods, although limited by the time step, are often used because of their limited memory demand, their scalability in parallel computing, and simple implementation of complex boundary conditions. In numerical modeling of explicit elastoplastic dynamics where the time step is limited by the material density, mass scaling techniques can be used to overcome this limit and significantly reduce computation time. While often used, the effect of mass and time scaling and how it may influence the numerical results is rarely-mentioned in publications, and choosing the right scaling technique is typically performed by trial and error. To our knowledge, no systematic studies have addressed how mass scaling might affect the numerical results. In this paper, we present results from an extensive and systematic study of the influence of mass and time scaling on the behavior of a variety of rock-mechanical models. We employ a finite difference scheme to model uniaxial and biaxial compression experiments using different mass and time scaling factors, and with physical models of increasing complexity up to a cohesion-weakening frictional-strengthening model (CWFS). We also introduce a normalized energy ratio to assist analyzing mass scaling effects. We find the tested models to be less sensitive to time scaling than to mass scaling, so mass scaling has higher potential for decreasing computational costs. However, we also demonstrate that mass scaling may lead to quantitatively wrong results, so care must be taken in interpreting stress values when mass scaling is used in complicated rock mechanics simulations. Mass scaling significantly influences the stress-strain response of numerical rocks because mass scaling acts as an artificial hardening agent on rock deformation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ecologists have traditionally focused on herbivore carcasses as study models in scavenging research. However, some observations of scavengers avoiding feeding on carnivore carrion suggest that different types of carrion may lead to differential pressures. Untested assumptions about carrion produced at different trophic levels could therefore lead ecologists to overlook important evolutionary processes and their ecological consequences.
   Our general goal was to investigate the use of mammalian carnivore carrion by vertebrate scavengers. In particular, we aimed to test the hypothesis that carnivore carcasses are avoided by other carnivores, especially at the intraspecific level, most likely to reduce exposure to parasitism.
   We take a three-pronged approach to study this principle by: (i) providing data from field experiments, (ii) carrying out evolutionary simulations of carnivore scavenging strategies under risks of parasitic infection, and (iii) conducting a literature-review to test two predictions regarding parasite life-history strategies.
   First, our field experiments showed that the mean number of species observed feeding at carcasses and the percentage of consumed carrion biomass were substantially higher at herbivore carcasses than at carnivore carcasses. This occurred even though the number of scavenger species visiting carcasses and the time needed by scavengers to detect carcasses were similar between both types of carcasses. In addition, we did not observe cannibalism. Second, our evolutionary simulations demonstrated that a risk of parasite transmission leads to the evolution of scavengers with generally low cannibalistic tendencies, and that the emergence of cannibalism-avoidance behaviour depends strongly on assumptions about parasitebased mortality rates. Third, our literature review indicated that parasite species potentially able to follow a carnivore-carnivore indirect cycle, as well as those transmitted via meat consumption, are rare in our study system.
   Our findings support the existence of a novel coevolutionary relation between carnivores and their parasites, and suggest that carnivore and herbivore carcasses play very different roles in food webs and ecosystems.

AB In this paper we propose a tracking algorithm to measure the velocity of fluorescently labelled red blood cells travelling through microvessels of tumours, growing in dorsal skin flap window chambers, implanted on mice. Preprocessing removed noise and artefacts from the images and then segmented cells from background. The tracking algorithm is based on a 'keyhole' model that describes the probable movement of a segmented cell between contiguous frames of a video sequence. When a history of cell movement exists, past, present and a predicted landing position of the cells will define two regions of probability that resemble the shape of a keyhole. This keyhole model was used to determine if cells in contiguous frames should be linked to form tracks and also as a postprocessing tool to join split tracks and discard links that could have been formed due to noise or uncertainty. When there was no history, a circular region around the centroid of the parent cell was used as a region of probability. Outliers were removed based on the distribution of the average velocities of the tracks. Since the position and time of each cell is recorded, a wealth of statistical measures can be obtained from the tracks. The algorithm was tested on two sets of experiments. First, the vasculatures of eight tumours with different geometries were analyzed; average velocities ranged from 86 to 372 mu m s(-1), with minimum and maximum track velocities 7 and 1212 mu m s(-1), respectively. Second, a longitudinal study of velocities was performed after administering a vascular disrupting agent to two tumours and the time behaviour was analyzed over 24 h. In one of the tumours there is a complete shutdown of the vasculature whereas in the other there is a clear decrease of velocity at 30 min, with subsequent recovery by 6 h. The tracking algorithm enabled the simultaneous measurement of red blood cell velocity in multiple vessels within an intravital video sequence, enabling analysis of heterogeneity of flow and response to treatment in mouse models of cancer.

AB In this study, the microwave rewarming process of cryopreserved samples with embedded superparamagnetic (SPM) nanoparticles was numerically simulated. The Finite Element Method (FEM) was used to calculate the coupling of the electromagnetic field and the temperature field in a microwave rewarming system composed of a cylindrical resonant cavity, an antenna source, and a frozen sample phantom with temperature-dependent properties. The heat generated by the sample and the nanoparticles inside the electromagnetic field of the microwave cavity was calculated. The dielectric properties of the biological tissues were approximated using the Debye model, which is applicable at different temperatures. The numerical results showed that, during the rewarming process of the sample phantom without nanoparticles, the rewarming rate was 29.45 degrees C/min and the maximum temperature gradient in the sample was 3.58 degrees C/mm. If nanoparticles were embedded in the sample, and the cavity power was unchanged, the rewarming rate was 47.76 degrees C/min and the maximum temperature gradient in the sample was 1.64 degrees C/mm. In the presence of SPM nanoparticles, the rewarming rate and the maximum temperature gradient were able to reach 20.73 degrees C/min and 0.68 degrees C/mm at the end of the rewarming under the optimized cavity power setting, respectively. The ability to change these temperature behaviors may prevent devitrification and would greatly diminish thermal stress during the rewarming process. The results indicate that the rewarming rate and the uniformity of temperature distribution are increased by nanoparticles. This could be because nanoparticles generated heat in the sample homogeneously and the time-dependent parameters of the sample improved after nanoparticles were homogeneously embedded within it. We were thus able to estimate the positive effect of SPM nanoparticles on microwave rewarming of cryopreserved samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The greater incidence of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and ischemic stroke among women who smoke and use oral contraception (OC) compared to women who do not smoke and who do or do not use OC may be due in part to how nicotine influences endocrine function in women. For example, we recently demonstrated that chronic exposure to nicotine, the addictive agent in tobacco smoke responsible for the elevated risk of cardiac arrest, abolishes the endogenous or exogenous 17 beta-estradiol-conferred protection of the hippocampus against global cerebral ischemia (a potential outcome of cardiac arrest) in naive or ovariectomized female rats. In the current study we examined the hypotheses that (1) a synergistic deleterious effect of nicotine plus oral contraceptives exacerbates post-ischemic hippocampal damage in female rats, and (2) nicotine directly inhibits estrogen-mediated intracellular signaling in the hippocampus. To test first hypothesis and to simulate smoking behavior-induced nicotine levels in the human body, we implanted osmotic pumps containing nicotine in the female rats for 16 days. Furthermore, we mimicked the use of oral contraceptives in females by administering oral contraceptives orally to the rat. Rats exposed to either nicotine alone or in combination with oral contraceptives were subjected to an episode of cerebral ischemia and the resultant brain damage was quantified. These results showed for the first time that nicotine with oral contraceptives did indeed exacerbate post-ischemic CA1 damage as compared to nicotine alone in naive female rats. In ex vivo hippocampal slice cultures, we found that nicotine alone or with 17 beta-estradiol directly hinders estrogen receptors-mediated phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP element binding protein, a process required for neuronal survival and also exacerbates ischemic damage. Thus, nicotine can affect the outcome of cerebral ischemia by influencing brain endocrine function directly rather than through indirect systemic effects. (C) 2011 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The extinguishment characteristics of CO2 as a fire-suppressing agent have been studied experimentally and numerically using a methane-air laminar co-flow diffusion flame stabilized on a cup burner. Direct numerical simulations of cup-burner flames under various gravitational forces were performed using a time-dependent, axisymmetric mathematical model with a detailed-chemical-kinetic mechanism for CH4/O-2 combustion. Experiments with cup-burner flames under normal-gravity (1g) conditions were performed for comparison purposes. Both the computed flicker frequency and the predicted critical concentration of CO2 for extinguishing the flame compared well with the respective quantities measured in the experiments. As the buoyancy force is reduced, the flicker frequency decreases, the flame diameter increases, the tip opens, and the base becomes vertical. It is predicted that the cup-burner flame ceases to flicker for gravitational forces corresponding to less than 0.5g. Numerical experiments revealed that radiative heat loss is predominantly responsible for flame quenching (opening) in the tip region under microgravity (0g) conditions. In contrast, 1g flames are affected only slightly by the radiative heat loss. Calculations are made by adding different amounts of CO2 to the air stream for obtaining the critical volume fraction of CO2 to extinguish 0g flames. The behavior is similar to that observed in 1g flames: the addition of CO2 destabilizes the flame base, which then moves downstream in search of a new stabilization location. For CO2 volume fractions greater than 19.1%, the flame base moves out of the computational area, as it cannot find a stabilization point within the domain. This critical concentration for the 0g flames is similar to 32% higher than that computed for the same flames under 1 g conditions. Calculations made by ignoring radiation for the limiting flame under 0g conditions yielded a stable flame. This study suggests that it is important to consider radiation heat losses when estimating the extinguishment limits of cup-burner flames in microgravity. (C) 2004 The Combustion Institute.

AB The influence of rain splash dispersal on the aggregation and variability of spores of Colletotrichum acutatum, the causal agent of strawberry anthracnose, was studied with simulated rain over a soil surface. In the first experiment, rains with intensities of 15 and 30 mm/h were generated and sampling plates, with a selective medium for Colletotrichum, were positioned under rainshields at both 20 and 60 cm from an inoculum point source (five infected fruit) for 1-min exposure periods. Number of colonies growing in plates were used to measure spore density. For each distance, time, rain intensity, and replication, the mean (m), variance (v), and Lloyd's index of patchiness (LIP) were calculated. Estimated (LIP) exceeded 1, indicating the high variability and clustering of colonies, and hence spores, resulting from splash dispersal. LIP increased with distance from the source and with rain intensity at the greater distance. Aggregation was further quantified by Taylor's power law describing the linear relation between ln (v) and In (m). The slope (b) of the relation for all data points was 1.67, which. was significantly (P < 0.01) greater than 1, a further indication of clustering. Distance form the source had a slight positive effect on b. Colony means (Y) were transformed to Y(star) = Y1/5 based on an approximate b of 1.6. Analysis of Y(star) indicated an expected significant main effect of rain duration and a significant interaction of distance and rain intensity. In another experiment, six infected fruit and the sampling plates were uniformly placed over the surface. LIP again exceeded 1, and Taylor's b equaled 1.63. In a final study, the inoculum source and sampling plates were raised 46 cm above the soil surface. There was a drastic reduction in Y(star) compared to surface values, supporting the prior hypothesis that surface topography strongly affects splash dispersal. Results indicate that the physical process of splash dispersal produces a degree of aggregation similar to that produced by population dynamic and other ecological processes.

AB We study the properties of an ODE description of schools of fish ( B. Birnir, An ODE model of the motion of pelagic fish, J. Stat. Phys. 128( 1/ 2) ( 2007), 535- 568.) and how they change in the presence of a random acceleration. The model can be reduced to one ODE for the direction of the velocity of a generic fish and another ODE for its speed. These equations contain the mean speed (v) over bar and a Kuramoto order parameter r for the phases of the fish velocities. In this paper, we give a complete qualitative analysis of the system for large number of particles. We show that the stationary solutions of the ODEs consist of an incoherent unstable solution with r = (v) over bar = 0 and a globally stable solution with r = 1 and a constant (v) over bar > 0. In the latter solution, all the fish move uniformly in the same direction with (v) over bar and the direction of motion determined by the initial configuration of the school. This is called the " migratory solution". In the second part of the paper, the directional headings of the particles are perturbed, in two distinct ways, and the speeds accelerated in order to obtain two distinct classes of non- stationary, complex solutions. We show that the perturbed systems have similar behavior as the unperturbed one, and derive the resulting constant value of the average speed, verifying the numerical observations. Finally, we show that the system exhibits a similar bifurcation to that in Vicsek and Czirok ( T. Vicsek, A. Czirok, E. Ben- Jacob, I. Cohen and O. Shochet, Novel type of phase transition in a system of self- driven particles, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75( 6) ( Aug 1995), 1226- 1229.) between phases of synchronization and disorder. Either increasing the variance of the Brownian angular noise, or decreasing the turning rate, or coupling between the particles, cause a similar phase transition. These perturbed models represent a more realistic view of schools of fish found in nature. We apply the theory to compute the order parameter for a simulation of the ChilePeru anchovy fishery.

AB Livestock disease simulation models that incorporate animal movements often assume (1) that farmers' livestock trading practices remain consistent over time in future, (2) that animals sold to other farms are chosen randomly from a herd, and (3) that the animals' fate on the destination farm is not influenced by their past production and movement histories. The objective of this study was to assess the extent to which these assumptions are violated in the real world using records from a national database in New Zealand that captures both milk production and movement data for individual dairy cattle. All individual animal milk test records from 2006 through 2010 were extracted from the database and processed to generate different animal and herd level variables including cow demographics, previous movement history, milk volume, and milk composition (somatic cell counts (SCC), protein percentage, and fat percentage). Various statistical models were used to explore factors associated with farms' selling practice and characteristics of animals being sold. The results showed farms' livestock selling practices were highly influenced by both external factors such as market milk price and internal factors such as previous year's cow mortality and how long farms had been in business. Higher milk price increased both the number of cows being sold and the number of farms selling cows. Compared with cows that remained in the herd at the end of lactation, cows sold to other farms had lower fat and protein percentages, but similar milk volumes and SCCs. Cows that had been sold more often in the past were more likely to be sold after controlling for the effects of age. Overall, these findings highlight the potential need for disease simulation models to account for dynamics in selling practices and animal characteristics when determining which animals will be sold to other herds.

AB Many cardiovascular diseases are characterised by the restriction of blood flow through arteries. Stents can be expanded within arteries to remove such restrictions; however, tissue in-growth into the stent can lead to restenosis. In order to predict the long-term efficacy of stenting, a mechanobiological model of the arterial tissue reaction to stress is required. In this study, a computational model of arterial tissue response to stenting is applied to three clinically relevant stent designs. We ask the question whether such a mechanobiological model can differentiate between stents used clinically, and we compare these predictions to a purely mechanical analysis. In doing so, we are testing the hypothesis that a mechanobiological model of arterial tissue response to injury could predict the long-term outcomes of stent design.
   Finite element analysis of the expansion of three different stent types was performed in an idealised, 3D artery. Injury was calculated in the arterial tissue using a remaining-life damage mechanics approach. The inflammatory response to this initial injury was modelled using equations governing variables which represented tissue-degrading species and growth factors. Three levels of inflammation response were modelled to account for inter-patient variability. A lattice-based model of smooth muscle cell behaviour was implemented, treating cells as discrete agents governed by local rules.
   The simulations predicted differences between stent designs similar to those found in vivo. It showed that the volume of neointima produced could be quantified, providing a quantitative comparison of stents. In contrast, the differences between stents based on stress alone were highly dependent on the choice of comparison criteria. These results show that the choice of stress criteria for stent comparisons is critical.
   This study shows that mechanobiological modelling may provide a valuable tool in stent design, allowing predictions of their long-term efficacy. The level of inflammation was shown to affect the sensitivity of the model to stent design. If this finding was verified in patients, this could suggest that high-inflammation patients may require alternative treatments to stenting. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Degradation of cellulose to glucose requires the cooperative action of three classes of enzymes, collectively known as cellulases. Endoglucanases randomly bind to cellulose surfaces and generate new chain ends by hydrolyzing beta-1,4-D-glycosidic bonds. Exoglucanases bind to free chain ends and hydrolyze glycosidic bonds in a processive manner releasing cellobiose units. Then, beta-glucosidases hydrolyze soluble cellobiose to glucose. Optimal synergistic action of these enzymes is essential for efficient digestion of cellulose. Experiments show that as hydrolysis proceeds and the cellulose substrate becomes more heterogeneous, the overall degradation slows down. As catalysis occurs on the surface of crystalline cellulose, several factors affect the overall hydrolysis. Therefore, spatial models of cellulose degradation must capture effects such as enzyme crowding and surface heterogeneity, which have been shown to lead to a reduction in hydrolysis rates.
   Results: We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for capturing the key events associated with the enzymatic degradation of cellulose at the mesoscopic level. This functional model accounts for the mobility and action of a single cellulase enzyme as well as the synergy of multiple endo-and exo-cellulases on a cellulose surface. The quantitative description of cellulose degradation is calculated on a spatial model by including free and bound states of both endo-and exo-cellulases with explicit reactive surface terms (e.g., hydrogen bond breaking, covalent bond cleavages) and corresponding reaction rates. The dynamical evolution of the system is simulated by including physical interactions between cellulases and cellulose.
   Conclusions: Our coarse-grained model reproduces the qualitative behavior of endoglucanases and exoglucanases by accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of the cellulose surface as well as other spatial factors such as enzyme crowding. Importantly, it captures the endo-exo synergism of cellulase enzyme cocktails. This model constitutes a critical step towards testing hypotheses and understanding approaches for maximizing synergy and substrate properties with a goal of cost effective enzymatic hydrolysis.

AB It is common to treat some diseases with more than one medication simultaneously Since more than one neurotransmitter system is involved in alcohol-seeking behaviour, then a therapeutic approach that targets more than one system should be more effective in reducing alcohol intake than one addressing a single system. To test this hypothesis, we compared the efficacy of low doses of individual drugs reported to reduce voluntary alcohol drinking to the efficacy of a mixture of these agents at the same low doses in reducing alcohol intake in three strains of alcohol-preferring rats (P, HAD, and Fawn-Hooded). After establishment of a stable baseline for alcohol intake in a continuous access paradigm. each rat received separate single i.p. injections of relatively low doses of either naltrexone (2.0 mg/kg), fluoxetine (1.0 mg/kg), the thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogue TA-0910 (0.2 mg). a mixture of all three drugs, or the vehicle at 09:30. Each rat received all treatments, with an inter-injection washout period of at least 3 days. Alcohol and water intakes were measured at 6 and 24 h, and food intake was measured at 24 h, after the injection. Our results show that individual drugs did not significantly affect food, water, or alcohol intake. However, the mixture significantly reduced alcohol intake in all three strains, but had no effect on food intake. Similar results were obtained when the HAD rats received an oral dose of the individual drugs or the mixture. When P rats were given an i.p. injection of the mixture for 10 consecutive days, there was a continued suppressing effect. These findings show that a combination treatment designed to target simultaneously serotonergic, dopaminergic, and opioidergic systems can reduce alcohol intake, even though the doses of the individual drugs in the mixture are relatively low and ineffective when given singly.

AB Coastal populations of small pelagic fish display nested aggregation levels. Above the level of the school structure, clusters are observed the nature of which has not been definitively determined. We hypothesized that these clusters corresponded to a materialisation of the microcohorts originating from successive spawnings of fish populations in their vital domain.
   A candidate individual-based model was developed to investigate this hypothesis. This model is based on pattern-oriented modelling of a concrete documented case: the dynamics of the round sardinella (Sardinella aunita) population living off the West African coasts and subject to environmental fluctuations caused by seasonal upwelling. The simulated agents were round sardinella microcohorts situated and moving in a discretised physical environment. The combined effects of environmental forcing (temperature, wind, retention) and inner biological dynamics (reproduction, growth and mortality, competition) condition the dynamics of this population.
   The modelled behaviour generated realistic dynamic patterns (population distribution, spawning zones, periods and plasticity, biomass fluctuations), which were obtained simultaneously and successfully compared with observations. The steady-state number of microcohorts obtained after simulation convergence was similar to the number of clusters observed in situ in this area for this population.
   The realism and diversity of the patterns simultaneously simulated suggested the cluster-microcohort equivalence hypothesis as a candidate framework accounting for the origin of the clusters observed in situ. Within this preliminary exploration, we discuss the consistency of the hypothesis and the accuracy of the model. If the correspondence between clusters and microcohorts proves to be real, it may be transient and progressively modified by other environmental factors. If stable over time, as simulated in the model, the number of observed clusters should be related to the number of spawning events in the species' lifetime. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB In North America, the Numerical Fish Surrogate (NFS) is used to design fish bypass systems for emigrating j uveni le salmon as they migrate from hatchery outfalls and rearing habitats to adult habitat in the oceans. The NFS is constructed of three linked modules: 1) a computational fluid dynamics model describes the complex flow fields upstream of dams at a scale sufficiently resolved to analyze, understand and forecast fish movement, 2) a particle tracking model interpolates hydraulic information from the fixed nodes of the computational fluid model mesh to multiple locations relevant to migrating fish, and 3) a behavior model simulates the cognition and behavior of individual fish in response to the fluid dynamics predicted by the computational fluid dynamics model. These three modules together create a virtual reality where virtual fish exhibit realistic dam approach behaviors and can be counted at dam exits in ways similar to the real world. Once calibrated and validated with measured fish movement and passage data, the NFS can accurately predict fish passage proportions with sufficient precision to allow engineers to select one optimum alternative from among many competing structural or operational bypass alternatives. Although South American fish species are different from North American species, it is likely that the basic computational architecture and numerical methods of the NFS can be used for fish conservation in South America. Consequently, the extensive investment made in the creation of the NFS need not be duplicated in South America. However, its use in South America will require that the behavioral response of the continent's unique fishes to hydrodynamic cues must be described, codified and tested before the NFS can be used to conserve fishes by helping design efficient South American bypass systems. To this end, we identify studies that could be used to describe the movement behavior of South American fishes of sufficient detail that they could be used to develop, calibrate and validate a South American version of the NFS.

AB Empirical evidence on the distributional characteristics of common stock returns indicates: (1) A power-law tail index close to three describes the behavior of the positive tail of the survivor function of returns (pr(r > x) similar to x(-alpha)), a reflection of fat tails; (2) general linear and nonlinear dependencies exist in the time series of returns; (3) the time-series return process is characterized by short-run dependence (short memory) in both returns as well as their volatility, the latter usually characterized in the form of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity; and (4) the time-series return process probably does not exhibit long memory, but the squared returns process does exhibit long memory. We propose a model of complex, self-referential learning and reasoning amongst economic agents that jointly produces security returns consistent with these general observed facts and which are supported here by empirical results presented for a benchmark sample of 50 stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The market we postulate is populated by traders who reason inductively while compressing information into a few fuzzy notions that they can in turn process and analyze with fuzzy logic. We analyze the implications of such behavior for the returns on risky securities within the context of an artificial stock market model. Dynamic simulation experiments of the market are conducted, from which market-clearing prices emerge, allowing us to then compute realized returns. We test the effects of varying values of the parameters of the model on the character of the simulated returns. The results indicate that the model proposed in this paper can jointly account for the presence of a power-law characterization of the positive tail of the survivor function of returns with exponent on the order of three, for autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, for long memory in volatility, and for general nonlinear dependencies in returns.

AB Changing environments, whether through natural or anthropogenic causes, can lead to the loss of some selective pressures ('relaxed selection') and possibly even the reinstatement of selective agents not encountered for many generations ('reversed selection'). We examined the outcome of relaxed and reversed selection in the adaptive radiation of the threespine stickleback fish, Gasterostues aculeatus L., in which isolated populations encounter a variety of predation regimes. Oceanic sticklebacks, which represent the ancestral founders of the freshwater radiation, encounter many piscivorous fish. Derived, freshwater populations, on the other hand, vary with respect to the presence of predators. Some populations encounter native salmonids, whereas others have not experienced predation by large fish in thousands of generations (relax-selected populations). Some relax-selected populations have had sport fish, including rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, introduced within the past several decades (reverse-selected). We examined the behavioural responses of sticklebacks from three populations of each type to simulated attacks by trout and birds to determine whether relaxed and reversed selection has led to divergence in behaviour, and whether this divergence was predator specific. Fish from trout-free populations showed weak responses to trout, as predicted, but these responses were similar to those of oceanic (ancestral) populations. Fish from populations that co-occur with trout, whether native or introduced, showed elevated antipredator responses, indicating that in freshwater, trout predation selects for enhanced antipredator responses, which can evolve extremely rapidly. Comparison of laboratory-reared and wild-caught individuals suggests a combination of learned and genetic components to this variation. Responses to a model bird flyover were weakly linked to predation environment, indicating that the loss of predation by trout may partially influence the evolution of responses to birds. Our results reject the hypothesis that the consistent presence of predatory birds has been sufficient to maintain responses to piscivorous fish under periods of relaxed selection.

AB Background: Cyanobacteria are important agents in global carbon and nitrogen cycling and hold great promise for biotechnological applications. Model organisms such as Synechocystis sp. and Synechococcus sp. have advanced our understanding of photosynthetic capacity and circadian behavior, mostly using population-level measurements in which the behavior of individuals cannot be monitored. Synechocystis sp. cells are small and divide slowly, requiring long-term experiments to track single cells. Thus, the cumulative effects of drift over long periods can cause difficulties in monitoring and quantifying cell growth and division dynamics.
   Results: To overcome this challenge, we enhanced a microfluidic cell-culture device and developed an image analysis pipeline for robust lineage reconstruction. This allowed simultaneous tracking of many cells over multiple generations, and revealed that cells expand exponentially throughout their cell cycle. Generation times were highly correlated for sister cells, but not between mother and daughter cells. Relationships between birth size, division size, and generation time indicated that cell-size control was inconsistent with the "sizer" rule, where division timing is based on cell size, or the "timer" rule, where division occurs after a fixed time interval. Instead, single cell growth statistics were most consistent with the "adder" rule, in which division occurs after a constant increment in cell volume. Cells exposed to light-dark cycles exhibited growth and division only during the light period; dark phases pause but do not disrupt cell-cycle control.
   Conclusions: Our analyses revealed that the "adder" model can explain both the growth-related statistics of single Synechocystis cells and the correlation between sister cell generation times. We also observed rapid phenotypic response to light-dark transitions at the single cell level, highlighting the critical role of light in cyanobacterial cell-cycle control. Our findings suggest that by monitoring the growth kinetics of individual cells we can build testable models of circadian control of the cell cycle in cyanobacteria.

AB Lahars are water-sediment mass flows from a volcanic source. They can be triggered by a variety of mechanisms and span a continuum of flow rheology and hydraulic properties, even within the same event. Lahars are extremely powerful landscaping agents and represent a considerable hazard potential. However, this highly dynamic character and a lack of direct measurements has made modelling lahars difficult. This study therefore applies a fluid dynamics model; Delft3D, to analyse the 18th March 2007 dam break lahar at Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand. The modelled lahar routed through the Whangaehu gorge in similar to 30 min, crossed the Whangaehu fan in similar to 60 min, and then over a further 3 h travelled an additional similar to 22 km distance along the Whangaehu River to the Tangiwai bridge. The modelled mean frontal velocity was 6.5 m s(-1) along the gorge although peak velocity reached up to 19.6 m s(-1). The modelled lahar flow front progressively slowed across the fan but along the River it accelerated from 2.1-3.3 m s(-1). Calculated peak velocity along the River was < 4.5 m s(-1). These results generally compare well with gauged records, with historical records, and with other modelling approaches. However, discrepancies in frontal velocity and time to peak stage arise due to (1) specifying roughness, which arises from slope variations between adjacent computational nodes, and which is stage-dependant, and (2) due to rapid topographic changes that produce frequent hydraulic jumps, which are inadequately accommodated in the numerical scheme. The overall pattern of discharge attenuation, and of relationships between topographic and hydraulic variables, is similar to that calculated for lahars on other volcanoes. This modelling method could be applied at other similar sites where a likely source hydrograph and high-resolution topographic data are available. These results have important implications for hazard management at Ruapehu and for examining geomorphic and sedimentary impacts of this lahar.

AB Recent land cover change estimates show overall decline of tropical forests at the regional and global scales caused by multiple social, cultural and economic factors. There is an overall concern on the prevailing land use practices, such as shifting cultivation and extraction of forest materials as agents of forests losses, but also new, emerging land uses are threatening tropical forests. Understanding of the long-term development and driving forces of forest changes are needed, especially at local levels where many decisions on forest policies and land uses are made. This paper addresses the importance of such information for improved estimates of forest dynamics by studying local level land cover and land use changes during the last 50-70 years in the Eastern African tropical island of Zanzibar, Tanzania. The paper discusses the role of traditional and new land uses mainly subsistence farming, tourism and government interference through tree planting, in the long-term development of the forests at the village level. The material for the study is gathered from the interpretation of archival maps and aerial photographs combined with contemporary digital aerial photographs. The analyses are based on the mapping, spatial sampling and spatio-temporal change trajectory analysis (LCTA) of forest land cover, forest land uses and settlement patterns with GIS and statistics. Six distinct forest land cover change trajectories were identified and these illustrate dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the forests. Closed forest cover has dominated throughout due to cyclical land use patterns, but over 70% of the land area has been continuously transforming between closed, semi-open and open land cover conditions. Land use turnover rates indicate that hardly any forest areas are left untouched from the forces, which remove and re-establish forest vegetation in the long run. Land cover and land use change trajectories are spatially fragmented in the studied landscape. Majority of forest loss-gain dynamics is caused by shifting cultivation, while forest losses are most dramatic along the coast, where traditional and new land uses meet and land uses pressures are highest. The study suggests that landscape change trajectory analyses, where contemporary and historical information on land uses and land cover changes are spatially linked, can provide valuable aspects into local level forest land use planning and management strategies. For the case study, the findings suggest the following key forest management strategies for consideration: (1) establishment of a protected forest/scrubland in participation with the local stakeholders, especially the farmers. (2) promotion of areas for permanent agricultural practices, while simultaneously introducing management controls in the traditional slash-and-burn farming areas, and (3) promoting new livelihood opportunities for the farmers, who have traditionally been dependent on forest resources, meanwhile introducing alternatives for fuel wood for cooking.

AB The release of enteric pathogenic bacteria in aquatic environments poses the problem of the fate of these bacteria under the effects of environmental factors (solar radiation, salt concentration, temperature, nutrient level, pH, competition). Frequently, these bacterial cells, potentially pathogenic, enter into a non-culturable state on routine bacteriological plating media. However, the use of direct detection methods (DAPI stained cells) allows the visualization of these Viable but Non Culturable cells (VNC). But, beyond the characterization of the viability of the cells (electron transport activity, metabolic activity, membrane integrity, structure and/or quantity of DNA), what happens with the virulence of these cells? This problem was experimentally investigated according to the bacterial model Salmonella Typhimurium. The virulence of this strain, which is the agent of the murine typhoid, was evaluated on a mouse model. Experimentally, the effects of some environmental factors on the survival and on the maintenance of virulence of Salmonella Typhimurium were measured in microcosms exposed to UV radiation (four germicidal lamps 8 mW s(-1) cm(-2), wave length: 254 nm), salt concentration (Sea Salt Sigma, 37), nutrient starvation. The microcosms were simultaneously submitted to these three factors, with variable exposure times. For each of those times, the viability of the nonculturable cells (which became nonculturable because of the exposure to the three factors) was measured through different physiological states notable in the cells, after using different fluorescent dyes. The stained cells were observed by epifluorescence microscopy and analysed by image cytometry. So, the cellular populations are characterised by enumeration of respiring bacteria (CTC, [39]), metabolising bacteria (YEK, [22] modified), bacteria owning an undamaged cytoplasmic membrane (LD, Live/Dead BacLight Viability Kit. Molecular Probes Inc.); we also determined the quantity and/or structure of DNA of the cells (fluorescence level of DAPI stained cells).
   After exposure to the three factors for one hour (13.56 J cm(-2)), while the plate count cell density rapidly decreased from #10(7) cells mL(-1) to < 0.1 cell mL(-1), physiological states of these viable but non-culturable cells are similar to those of nonexposed cells. On the other hand, after exposure for three hours, only 10 % of the cells deposit a CTC formazan-crystal and 20 % are substrate responsive cells (enlarged cells in presence of Yeast Extract and Cephalexin: YEC). Half of the cellular population presents an undamaged cytoplasmic membrane and the level of fluorecence of DAPI stained cells is close to 85 %, which shows that the DNA of these cells is weakly damaged. After exposure to the three experimental factors for 24 hours (315 J cm(-2)), weak replies to the physiological tests used in this study to characterize the viability of the non-culturable cellular population are observed (CTC: 4 %; YEC: 2 %; LD: 11.8 %) while the fluorescence level of DAPI stained cells remains firm at 80 %. At the same time, the virulence expression of VNC cells of Salmonella Typhimurium, evaluated by intraperitoneal injection to the mouse (route which excludes uncontrolled parameters, unlike the per os route) does not seem to be correlated with the cellular viability such as it has been evaluated in this study. A 30 min exposure (6.73 J cm(-2)) to the three environmental factors, leading to the non-culturability of almost the entire exposed cell population (0.08 culturable cell mL(-1)) whereas the level of viability of those culturable cells is closed to the one of non-exposed cells. The injection of 1000 of those cells (<0.001 culturable cells in 100 mu L inoculated) into the mouse (a group of ten mice) does not cause any mortality four weeks post-inoculation, whereas the injection of the same dose of nonexposed cells leads to the death of all mice in the group one week post-inoculation. According to our preliminary experiments on Salmonella Typhimurium, the loss of the state of culturability and the loss of virulence towards mice by intraperitoneal route, because of the exposure to associated effects of UV irradiation (254 nm), salinity (37) and nutrient starvation, seem to be concomitant.

AB Disturbance of the normal mucociliary clearance due to hyperproduction of mucus and modification of its physicochemical characteristics is a common finding in airway diseases. Drugs that affect airway secretion have been developed and used to cleanse the respiratory tract for many centuries and in many countries. On the basis of the mechanism of their actions, the mucoactive drugs are classified into several groups. Some mucoactive drugs have direct effects on the production or composition of airway secretions, resulting in increased effectiveness of mucociliary clearance. Other mucoactive drugs do not have a specific action on mucus, but have beneficial effects on airway structure and function, which lead to correction of the pathophysiologic mechanisms that result in abnormal secretions. However, since many drugs have overlapping effects, it is difficult to classify these drugs into groups based on their major actions. Taken together with previous findings on mucoactive drugs, it appears that an antioxidant effect is a common property of mucoactive drugs and that it is a crucial action to exert their effects against airway diseases. In light of this idea, we must use specific experimental models to simulate pharmacologic events in airway inflammation. The development of new techniques has made it possible to identify and measure the mucus components, measure the rheologic parameters more accurately, and evaluate mucociliary clearance precisely in animals and humans. Therefore, with modifications of methods, we have investigated airway-cleansing drugs from various points of view to reflect actions in inflammatory states for more than two decades. Here, I introduce the methods we have used to study many of the parameters involved in airway clearance, including cough reflex, and describe some of the mucoactive-antitussive drugs that we have studied recently. There is an increasing usage of traditional Chinese herbal medicines in clinics and hospitals, because they tend to have moderate side effects and sometimes remarkable efficacy. To renormalize overall defects in airway disorders, Chinese medicines may be adequate, because they are composed of various herbs with weak but ubiquitous pharmacologic activities. We have been investigating Bakumondo-to. Bakumondo-to has been used for the treatment of bronchitis and pharyngitis accompanying severe dry cough. We found that unlike codeine Bakumondo-to had a notable antitussive activity against the cough associated with bronchitis and the cough increased by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Recently, we have found that, in alveolar type II cells, Bakumondo-to attenuated phosphatidylcholine secretion increased by oxygen radicals from activated PMNLS. In addition, we found that Bakumondo-to itself stimulated phosphatidylcholine secretion and increased beta-adrenoceptor gene expression in rat alveolar type II cells. We studied the mechanism of action and clarified that Bakumondo-to increased glucocorticoid-sensitive promotor activity. The effect may contribute to its ubiquitous effectiveness in the treatment of airway diseases. Various parameters (chemical properties, physical properties, mucus production, surfactant phospholipid production, and mucociliary clearance) are considered to be important for the dynamics and mobilization of airway secretions. Pharmacologic investigation, with appropriate techniques, of the ability of an agent to modify these parameters can provide useful information about its mechanism of action.
   However, since these parameters are interconnected, it is very complicated to elucidate the precise mechanisms of action of mucoactive drugs. This means that the goal of treatment cannot always be achieved by the modification of a single parameter, but should, more realistically, be aimed at a renormalization of several parameters. On the basis of this idea, glucocorticoids are ideal mucoactive drugs because they exert various pharmacologic effects in the lung. From a polypharmacologic point of view, a traditional Chinese medicine can be classified as a glucocorticoid-like drug because Chinese medicines consist of many types of active components that have various pharmacologic effects. As one future course of research, we believe that efforts to seek compatible actions between glucocorticoids and Oriental medicines may lead to new opportunities for development of ideal airway-cleansing drugs with specific actions, i.e., suppression of gene expression.

   Processes During Solvent Displacement of Heavy Oil: A Parametric
   Analysis Using Visual Capillary-Tube Experiments
SO SPE JOURNAL

   DYNAMICS; ESTABLISHMENT; EXISTENCE
AB Oil/solvent mixing is essential during solvent-injection applications to reduce the viscosity of oil, but mass transfer by diffusion becomes slower because the oil becomes heavier. Thus, an interface exists between the oil and solvent at certain times, being stronger in the beginning of the process. This results in an immiscible displacement controlled by the capillary forces while mixing is in progress. It is of practical and fundamental importance to determine the mechanisms responsible for the displacement of heavy oil and the behavior of solvents (acting as both immiscible and miscible displacement agents) because it could be advantageous to accelerate the dilution of heavy oil in many circumstances, including heterogeneous (fractured, layered, wormholed) systems. This is a complex process consisting of multiple pore phases (oil, solvent, their mixtures, and aqueous and vapor phases) at the same time, while different mechanisms such as capillary imbibition, miscible interaction (diffusion and convection), and gravity also act simultaneously.
   To investigate this complex phenomenon for different oil/solvent systems, a novel experimental method was used. The underlying mechanisms that dominate the solvent displacement process were comprehensively identified. The movement and evolution of interfaces among different fluid phases in glass capillary tubes were observed and recorded. Oil samples with different viscosities were used to examine the effects of oil viscosity on the mass transfer accelerated by imbibition transfer. The effects of temperature, wettability, and boundary conditions on the interaction of miscible fluid pairs were also studied. Pentane, heptane, and decane were used as the solvent phases. Advanced photographic techniques using ultraviolet (UV) light and dyed fluids were applied to better track the flow of different phases in the mixing zone.
   The experiments demonstrated a slowly smearing interface between the solvent and viscous oil. A unique natural convection was induced, with the combined effect of gravity, diffusion (mixing), and capillarity all contributing to the recovery of heavy oil. On the basis of the saturation method, boundary condition, and the Bond number, four different motion modes of mixing zone and interfaces of miscible fluids in the capillary tube were revealed and categorized to identify the degree of interface development (immiscible flooding). Also, the mixing zone, mass flux, and flow behavior were quantified using dimensionless parameters. The results indicate that priority may be given to a solvent with a high interfacial tension (IFT) for the solvent-based oil-recovery technique because of a strong imbibition and further enhancement of the dilution and displacement processes under conditions of a similar viscosity ratio. The data provided will be useful for the accuracy of modeling studies, especially for complex geologies where oil/solvent interaction is critically difficult to develop in order for mixing to occur.

AB Purpose Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue anticancer agent that has shown promising anti-tumor activity in several experimental models of brain tumor. However, the pharmacokinetic behavior of gemcitabine in the central nervous system, especially in brain tumors is currently not well understood. In this study we evaluated the gemcitabine brain extracellular fluid (ECF) in normal rats and in ECF obtained from tumor- and tumor-free regions of glioma-bearing rats, to better understand the availability of the drug to brain and brain tumors.
   Methods The brain ECF pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine were investigated employing intracerebral microdialysis following intravenous administration of 10, 25 and 100 mg/kg doses in male Sprague-Dawley rats. In the second phase of the study, gemcitabine (25 mg/kg) was intravenously administered in rats implanted with C6 gliomas and ECF samples were simultaneously obtained from the tumor and tumor-free regions of the brain. Serial blood samples were obtained for evaluating the plasma pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine. Non-compartmental approach was employed for the analyses of the brain ECF and plasma pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine.
   Results Following intravenous administration, gemcitabine rapidly distributed into rat brain. At doses equivalent to 10, 25 and 100 mg/kg, the brain ECF gemcitabine AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve measured over the last sampling time point) values were 2.46 +/- 0.7, 3.20 +/- 1.1, and 9.06 +/- 3.0 mu g h/ml, respectively. The brain ECF concentrations of gemcitabine declined in parallel with plasma concentrations. At the three doses evaluated, the relative brain distribution coefficient (AUC(brainECF)/AUC(plasma)) of gemcitabine ranged from 0.07 to 0.09 suggesting limited gemcitabine availability to brain tissues. Studies on C6 glioma-bearing rats revealed that following an intravenous dose of 25 mg/kg, the AUC values in the tumor-free and tumor-brain regions were 4.52 +/- 2.4, and 9.82 +/- 3.3 mu g h/ml, respectively. Thus, the AUC of gemcitabine in the tumor ECF was on average 2.2-fold greater than the corresponding value in the tumor-free ECF of the brain. Plasma pharmacokinetics of gemcitabine remained unaltered in tumor-bearing animals, when compared to plasma pharmacokinetics in healthy animals.
   Conclusion Our findings suggest that the overall brain exposure to gemcitabine is likely to be low as evident from the relative brain distribution coefficient of < 0.1. However, the exposure is likely to be considerably higher in the brain tumor relative to tumor-free regions of the brain. The higher drug levels in brain tumor compared to the non-tumor region may facilitate selectively higher cytotoxicity against brain tumor cells.

AB Community interactions of small rodents have attracted the attention of ecologists for many years due to their abrupt changes in population numbers, their impact on the whole biocoenosis and also because of immense damages to agricultural production and forestry. In particular, regularly oscillating rodent populations in Scandinavia have been subject of discussions among theoretically and empirically working ecologists for many decades. Spatial and temporal restrictions in empirical work led to various attempts to model these dynamics to understand large scale effects resulting from complex interactions in variable cause-effect networks of the numerous involved system components.
   The presented individual-based model for the first time described small rodent communities as a set of interacting autonomously acting agents with a detailed life history and behavioural repertoire in a food-web setup composed of three trophic levels (rodents, rodents food and predators). It thus allowed to integrate all relevant factors accounting for the dynamics of rodents which acted in a simulated environment containing the spatial arrangement of habitats and seasonal changing conditions. Due to the representation with interacting entities, the dynamics on higher levels resulted in a self-organisation process as emergent properties. This differentiation between the focal and the operational level allowed to investigate processes interacting between different integration levels and to adapt the model to different scenarios easily as well as to specify it for a large range of rodents species.
   Simulations have been executed for two different scenarios. The Bornhoved scenario simulating the situation of a Northern German rodent community in a beech forest represented bottom-up effects of mast events on population dynamics. The Scandinavian scenario which depicted the most important actors of these oscillating rodent communities, gave new insights into the processes causing the sudden decline of rodent populations. Both, lack of resources and predation, contributed to about 90% of mortality, but no pattern could be found when relating either cause with the properties of the respective cycle. Bottom up and top down control vary unpredictably and chaotically in the model. These results may explain considerable parts of contradicting empirical findings. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

AB Modeling MRI signal behaviors in the presence of discrete magnetic particles is important, as magnetic particles appear in nanoparticle labeled cells, contrast agents, and other biological forms of iron. Currently, many models that take into account the discrete particle nature in a system have been used to predict magnitude signal decays in the form of R2* or R2' from one single voxel. Little work has been done for predicting phase signals. In addition, most calculations of phase signals rely on the assumption that a system containing discrete particles behaves as a continuous medium. In this work, numerical simulations are used to investigate MRI magnitude and phase signals from discrete particles, without diffusion effects. Factors such as particle size, number density, susceptibility, volume fraction, particle arrangements for their randomness, and field of view have been considered in simulations. The results are compared to either a ground truth model, theoretical work based on continuous mediums, or previous literature. Suitable parameters used to model particles in several voxels that lead to acceptable magnetic field distributions around particle surfaces and accurate MR signals are identified. The phase values as a function of echo time from a central voxel filled by particles can be significantly different from those of a continuous cubic medium. However, a completely random distribution of particles can lead to an R2' value which agrees with the prediction from the static dephasing theory. A sphere with a radius of at least 4 grid points used in simulations is found to be acceptable to generate MR signals equivalent from a larger sphere. Increasing number of particles with a fixed volume fraction in simulations reduces the resulting variance in the phase behavior, and converges to almost the same phase value for different particle numbers at each echo time. The variance of phase values is also reduced when increasing the number of particles in a fixed voxel. These results indicate that MRI signals from voxels containing discrete particles, even with a sufficient number of particles per voxel, cannot be properly modeled by a continuous medium with an equivalent susceptibility value in the voxel.

AB Background: Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and 2 causes several infections in humans including cold sores and encephalitis. Previous antiviral studies on herpes viruses have focussed on developing nucleoside analogues that can inhibit viral polymerase and terminate the replicating viral DNA. However, these drugs bear an intrinsic non-specificity as they can also inhibit cellular polymerase apart from the viral one. The present study is an attempt to elucidate the action mechanism of naturally occurring withaferin A in inhibiting viral DNA polymerase, thus providing an evidence for its development as a novel anti-herpetic drug.
   Results: Withaferin A was found to bind very similarly to that of the previously reported 4-oxo-DHQ inhibitor. Withaferin A was observed binding to the residues Gln 617, Gln 618, Asn 815 and Tyr 818, all of which are crucial to the proper functioning of the polymerase. A comparison of the conformation obtained from docking and the molecular dynamics simulations shows that substantial changes in the binding conformations have occurred. These results indicate that the initial receptor-ligand interaction observed after docking can be limited due to the receptor rigid docking algorithm and that the conformations and interactions observed after simulation runs are more energetically favoured.
   Conclusions: We have performed docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies to elucidate the binding mechanism of prospective herbal drug withaferin A onto the structure of DNA polymerase of Herpes simplex virus. Our docking simulations results give high binding affinity of the ligand to the receptor. Long de novo MD simulations for 10 ns performed allowed us to evaluate the dynamic behaviour of the system studied and corroborate the docking results, as well as identify key residues in the enzyme-inhibitor interactions. The present MD simulations support the hypothesis that withaferin A is a potential ligand to target/inhibit DNA polymerase of the Herpes simplex virus. Results of these studies will also guide the design of selective inhibitors of DNA POL with high specificity and potent activity in order to strengthen the therapeutic arsenal available today against the dangerous biological warfare agent represented by Herpes Simplex Virus.

AB A classical quantitative structure-activity relationship (Hansch) study and artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been applied to a training set of 32 substituted phenylpiperazines with affinity for 5-HT1A and alpha (1)-adrenergic receptors, to evaluate the structural requirements that are responsible for 5-HT1A/alpha (1) selectivity. The resulting models provide a significant correlation of electronic, steric, and hydrophobic parameters with the biological affinities. Although the derived linear Hansch correlations give good statistics and acceptable predictions, the introduction of nonlinear relationships in the analysis gives more solid models and more accurate predictions. In the ANN models on the basis of the obtained 3D plots, the 5-HT1A affinity has a nonlinear dependence on F, V-o, V-m, and pi (o), although the nonlinear relationship is not far from a planar one. The alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor affinity has a clear nonlinear dependence on F, V-o, V-m, pi (o), and pi (m). A comparison of both analyses gives an additional understanding for 5-HT1A/alpha (1) selectivity: (a) high F values increase the binding affinity for 5-HT1A receptors and decrease the affinity for alpha (1) sites; (b) the hydrophobicity at the meta-position has only influence for the alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor; (c) the meta-position seems to be implicated in the 5-HT1A/alpha (1) selectivity. While the 5-HT1A receptor is able to accommodate bulky substituents in the region of its active site, the steric requirements of the alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor at this position are more restricted. This information was used for the design of the new ligand EF-7412 (33) (5-HT1A: K-i (exptl) = 27 nM, alpha (1): K-i (exptl) > 1000 nM; 5-HT1A: K-i (pred) (ANN) = 36 nM, alpha (1): K-i (pred) (ANN) = 2745 nM) which was characterized as an antagonist in vivo in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1AR sites. Computational simulations of the complex between EF-7412 (33) and a 3D model of the transmembrane domain of the 5-HT1A receptor allowed us to define the molecular details of the ligand-receptor interaction that includes: (i) the ionic interaction between the protonated amine of the ligand and Asp 3.32; (ii) the hydrogen bonds between the m-NHSO2Et group of the ligand and Asn 7.39; and the hydrogen bonds between the hydantoin moiety of the ligand and (iii) Thr 3.37, (iv) Ser 5.42, and (v) Thr 5.43. These QSAR and ANN results in combination with computational simulations of ligand recognition will be useful for the design of potent selective 5-HT1A ligands.

AB Turbidity currents represent a major agent for sediment transport in lakes, seas and oceans. In particular, they formulate the most significant clastic accumulations in the deep sea, which become many of the world's most important hydrocarbon reservoirs. Several boreholes in the Qiongdongnan Basin, the northwestern South China Sea, have recently revealed turbidity current deposits as significant hydrocarbon reservoirs. However, there are some arguments for the potential provenances. To solve this problem, it is essential to delineate their sedimentary processes as well as to evaluate their qualities as reservoir. Numerical simulations have been developed rapidly over the last several years, offering insights into turbidity current behaviors, as geologically significant turbidity currents are difficult to directly investigate due to their large scale and often destructive nature. Combined with the interpretation of the turbidity system based on high-resolution 3D seismic data, the paleotophography is acquired via a back-stripping seismic profile integrated with a borehole, i.e., Well A, in the western Qiongdongnan Basin; then a numerical model is built on the basis of this back-stripped profile. After defining the various turbidity current initial boundary conditions, including grain size, velocity and sediment concentration, the structures and behaviors of turbidity currents are investigated via numerical simulation software ANSYS FLUENT. Finally, the simulated turbidity deposits are compared with the interpreted sedimentary bodies based on 3D seismic data and the potential provenances of the revealed turbidites by Well A are discussed in details. The simulation results indicate that a sedimentary body develops far away from its source with an average grain size of 0.1 mm, i.e., sand-size sediment. Taking into account the location and orientation of the simulated seismic line, the consistence between normal forward simulation results and the revealed cores in Well A indicates that the turbidites should have been transported from Vietnam instead of Hainan Island. This interpretation has also been verified by the planar maps of sedimentary systems based on integration of boreholes and seismic data. The identification of the turbidity provenance will benefit the evaluation of extensively distributed submarine fans for hydrocarbon exploration in the deepwater areas.

AB Sponsored search advertising is ascendant-Forrester Research reports expenditures rose 28% in 2007 to $8.1 billion and will continue to rise at a 26% compound annual growth rate [VanBoskirk, S. 2007. U. S. interactive marketing forecast, 2007 to 2012. Forrester Research (October 10)], approaching half the level of television advertising and making sponsored search one of the major advertising trends to affect the marketing landscape. Yet little empirical research exists to explore how the interaction of various agents (searchers, advertisers, and the search engine) in keyword markets affects consumer welfare and firm profits. The dynamic structural model we propose serves as a foundation to explore these outcomes. We fit this model to a proprietary data set provided by an anonymous search engine. These data include consumer search and clicking behavior, advertiser bidding behavior, and search engine information such as keyword pricing and website design.
   With respect to advertisers, we find evidence of dynamic bidding behavior. Advertiser value for clicks on their links averages about 26 cents. Given the typical $22 retail price of the software products advertised on the considered search engine, this implies a conversion rate (sales per click) of about 1.2%, well within common estimates of 1%-2% [Narcisse, E. 2007. Magid: Casual free to pay conversion rate too low. GameDaily.com (September 20)]. With respect to consumers, we find that frequent clickers place a greater emphasis on the position of the sponsored advertising link. We further find that about 10% of consumers do 90% of the clicks.
   We then conduct several policy simulations to illustrate the effects of changes in search engine policy. First, we find the search engine obtains revenue gains of 1% by sharing individual-level information with advertisers and enabling them to vary their bids by consumer segment. This also improves advertiser revenue by 6% and consumer welfare by 1.6%. Second, we find that a switch from a first-to second-price auction results in truth telling (advertiser bids rise to advertiser valuations). However, the second-price auction has little impact on search engine profits. Third, consumer search tools lead to a platform revenue increase of 2.9% and an increase of consumer welfare by 3.8%. However, these tools, by reducing advertising exposures, lower advertiser profits by 2.1%.

   optimization; surrogate modeling; surrogate-based optimization

AB After conventional waterflood processes the residual oil in the reservoir remains as a discontinuous phase in the form of oil drops trapped by capillary forces and is likely to be around 70% of the original oil in place (OOIP). The EOR method so-called alkaline-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flooding has proved to be effective in reducing the oil residual saturation in laboratory experiments and field projects through the reduction of interfacial tension and mobility ratio between oil and water phases.
   A critical step to make ASP floodings more effective is to find the optimal values of design variables that will maximize a given performance measure (e.g., net present value, cumulative oil recovery) considering a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir. Previously reported works using reservoir numerical simulation have been limited to sensitivity analyses at core and field scale levels because the formal optimization problem includes computationally expensive objective function evaluations (field scale numerical simulations). This work presents a surrogate-based optimization methodology to overcome this shortcoming.
   The proposed approach estimates the optimal values for a set of design variables (e.g., slug size and concentration of the chemical agents) to maximize the cumulative oil recovery from a heterogeneous and multiphase petroleum reservoir subject to an ASP flooding. The surrogate-based optimization approach has been shown to be useful in the optimization of computationally expensive simulation-based models in the aerospace, automotive, and oil industries. In this work, we improve upon this approach along two directions: (i) using multiple surrogates for optimization, and (ii) incorporating an adaptive weighted average model of the individual surrogates.
   The cited approach involves the coupled execution of a global optimization algorithm and fast surrogates (i.e., based on Polynomial Regression, Kriging, Radial Basis Functions and a Weighted Average Model) constructed from field scale numerical simulation data. The global optimization program implements the DIRECT algorithm and the reservoir numerical simulations are conducted using the UTCHEM program from the University of Texas at Austin. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using a field scale case study. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The resin NOBIAS-chelate PA-1 (R) was used to develop an off-line pre-concentration and extraction method for rare earth elements (REEs) in seawater prior to quantification using magnetic sector, high resolution, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS). The method employed an off-line manifold that is inexpensive, easy to set-up, and allows simultaneous processing of several samples. The method has low blanks and detection limits, which were in the range of 0.01 pmol kg(-1) to 0.82 pmol kg(-1), and yields quantitative recovery for all REEs (La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu) precluding the need to use isotope dilution. The HR ICP-MS allows an integrated, time-averaged signal of the eluent sample, reducing the HR ICP-MS instrument time relative to an in-line extraction procedure.
   The applicability of the method was demonstrated in a test of the hypothesis that some REEs are being mobilized by anthropogenic activities and are elevated in San Francisco Bay (SFB) and its discharge plume into coastal waters off Central California. This was done by normalizing REE data from the SFB to those of the GEOTRACES Surface Coastal (GSC) reference sample, collected in the Santa Barbara Basin off Southern California. The normalized REE pattern indicated a substantial Gd anomaly of up to 30-fold higher than GSC in the industrial southern reach of the SFB (Lower South Bay), and to a lesser extent in the plume, indicative of anthropogenic Gd inputs, associated with the medical use of Gd-based contrasting agents in magnetic resonance imagery, from the surrounding metropolitan area. Smaller anomalies for Lu and Yb were also observed in the Lower South Bay and plume, which were tentatively attributed to industrial inputs. However, because of the relatively restricted industrial uses of these elements this hypothesis requires further investigation. Ce and Eu anomalies were observed in the northern reaches of the Bay and appeared to be associated with natural redox mediated behavior of these REEs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new class of surface active ionic liquids (SAIL) have been reported to be a greener alternative to the conventional surfactants in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). These SAILs work efficiently under harsh salinity conditions encountered in the reservoir thereby recovering more additional oil during the tertiary oil recovery process. Adsorption mechanism of SAILs on different rock surface is however, not yet reported in the literature. This article highlights adsorption mechanism of three cationic SAILs having different headgroups, viz., imidazolium, pyridinium, pyrrolidinium, on different rock surfaces (crushed natural carbonate rock and crushed sandstone rock). All the SAILs studied here however had the same tail length and same anion (Br-) attached to it. XRD and XPS characterization techniques reveal that the crushed natural carbonate rock contains a substantial amount of silica, thus rendering it a slight negative charge. Static adsorption tests show that the retention efficiency on the natural carbonate type of rock for all the SAILs was lower than the conventional cationic surfactant, CTAB. The adsorption data obtained thereby was examined using four different adsorption isotherm models (Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Sips). Results suggest that Sips adsorption isotherm model can satisfactorily estimate the adsorption of all the surface active agents on the natural carbonate rock. Factors like mineralogical composition of rock surface, presence of diva lents, temperature, and structure of surfactants strongly affect the amount of surfactant adsorbed on reservoir rock. In order to evaluate the simultaneous effect all these factors as well as their interdependence on the retention capability of the three SAILs, a design of experiments approach has been employed further in this study. Statistical analysis of the data obtained after performing the full factorial experiments reveal that at high salinity, imidazoluim based SAIL show minimal adsorption on crushed natural carbonate rock at higher temperature. In general, at a given ionic strength, with increasing temperature as the amount of divalent in the aqueous solution increases, the amount of SAIL adsorbed on both the rock types decreases. Electrostatic attraction is the basic mechanism in governing adsorption of SAILs on the two types of rock surfaces. Results presented in this work can be used for EOR schemes.

AB The transitions that occur in the ascending dopamine systems between childhood and adulthood parallel the emergence, course, and severity of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Behaviorally, rats are more active in open field during periadolescence, and activity levels decline by 50% in males by adulthood. This peak in behavior parallels a transient overproduction in D1 and D2 dopamine receptors that occurs at puberty in rat striatum (STR) and prefrontal cortex (PFC), followed by a decline in receptor density into adulthood. While tempting to speculate that receptor density plays a role in the waning of ADHD symptoms, receptor overproduction does not occur in the nucleus accumbens (NA), which demonstrates only a modest rise in receptor density (10-20%). Given the importance of the accumbens in locomotor activity, an alternative explanation for increased activity was sought. The second messenger system cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) has classically been associated with dopamine receptors. The results of these studies demonstrate that CAMP accumulation in the accumbens and the STR parallel the observed rise and fall in activity levels in rats. At puberty, basal CAMP levels are 35% higher relative to adulthood in male accumbens, while a modest 7% change was observed in STR. Forskolin-stimulated CAMP was 240 300% higher in STR and accumbens at puberty before declining with maturation. These findings suggest that, the adolescent dopamine system has a much higher 'tone' relative to adults, However, pharmacological responsiveness of CAMP to D1 or D2 stimulation demonstrates an overall blunted response during puberty relative to adulthood. This finding is consistent with a hyposensitivity to stress and pharmacological agents at puberty in animals that are in a hyperdopaminergic state. These findings of combined elevated CAMP accumulation and reduced CAMP sensitivity during adolescence have clinical implications for hypothesized mechanism and course of ADHD and its treatment. The maturational decline in CAMP activity may explain why this disorder recedes, while, simultaneously CAMP becomes more responsive to D1 and D2 receptor stimulation in adulthood.

AB Modern drug discovery demands accurate knowledge of the drug properties of affinity and efficacy at specific receptor proteins. Furthermore, drugs with well defined properties make better tools with which to explore and understand receptor regulation. The use of clonal cell lines stably expressing a given recombinant receptor may provide a highly useful model in which drug effects may be studied on one receptor subtype at a time. The present report was designed to evaluate the utility of a general method in which a clonal cell line stably expressing a recombinant D1A dopamine receptor was used as a model system for studying drug actions by null models. The null model for receptor occlusion (to calculate agonist K-a) and the null model for relative efficacy (to calculate test agonist affinity and epsilon(r)) were evaluated in these studies. To initiate these studies, rat C6 glioma cells that do not normally express DA receptors have been modified by stable transfection with the primate D1A DA receptor [Machida et al., 1992 (Molec. Pharmacol. 41: 652-659)] to a density of approximate to 200 fmol/mg protein. The recombinant receptors show robust stimulation of cAMP in the stably transfected C6 cells.
   Calculation of agonist K-a from dose-response data requires that a portion of the cell's receptors be occluded in the absence of changes in post-receptor events leading to the response. Receptor reserve is typically reduced by alkylation, thereby lowering maximal response. Unfortunately, most of the currently available alkylating agents are not selective either for a particular receptor or for receptors vs other proteins within a signaling pathway. Short-term agonist treatment offers a possible complement to the use of non-selective or poorly characterized alkylating drugs for reducing maximum response in appropriate cell systems.
   The null method of receptor occlusion was used to determine the K-a for dopamine when maximum response was decreased by alkylation vs short-term agonist treatment. Direct non-linear curve fitting was used to analyze the data. In addition to DA, two other compounds were used to reduce receptor reserve to validate the method: fenoldopam (relatively high efficacy) and SKF38393 (low efficacy). Analyses indicated that the affinity of DA was similar whether calculated by alkylation (1.1 +/- 0.58 mu M), 75 min DA treatment (0.57 +/- 0.16 mu M) or 45 min treatment with DA (0.86 +/- 0.11 mu M). Short-term agonist treatment experiments using multiple concentrations of DA, fenoldopam, or SKF38393 to decrease receptor reserve provided additional support for the validity of the K-a determinations using this procedure.
   Other experiments were conducted according to the null model for relative efficacy in which the affinity for DA is calculated by comparing the DA response before and after receptor occlusion, and the affinity and relative intrinsic efficacy of the test agonist are determined as a function of its actions relative to DA. We used the following four test drugs: + Br-APB, a novel agent with potential dopamine agonist properties, and three high-affinity DA agonists, fenoldopam, R-(-)-apomorphine (APO), and SKF38393. Intrinsic efficacy values relative to that of DA (1.0) were as follows: fenoldopam, 0.46 +/- 0.11; APO, 0.19 +/- 0.13; SKF38393, 0.07 +/- 0.01; and +Br-APB, 0.26 +/- 0.40. The agonist affinities (K-a) were: fenoldopam, 0.018 +/- 0.008 mu M; APO, 0.80 +/- 0.18 mu M; SKF38393, 0.16 +/- 0.04 mu M; Br-APB, 0.43 +/- 0.29 mu M; and DA, 0.58 +/- 0.17 mu M EC(50)/K-a ratios were consistent with relative intrinsic efficacies and K-a values were similar to K-L values reported for membrane binding studies.
   Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to determine the precision of the parameter estimates. These simulations of 1000 experiments each, using the empirical variance of approximate to 3% of the maximum response, indicated a precision for the DA K-a of approximate to 16%, for the independently determined fenoldopam K-a of approximate to 24%, and of the fenoldopam epsilon(r) of approximate to 16% of the parameter values. To our knowledge, this represents the first report of agonist affinity plus relative intrinsic efficacy measurement at any recombinant receptor. The present results also provide the first report of the precision of these important drug parameter measurements using Monte Carlo methods. Together, these results suggest that clonal cell lines which stably express a recombinant receptor of interest may offer a unique system with which to determine essential drug properties. The method is able to accommodate agonists with very high potency and intrinsic activity, extremely low relative intrinsic efficacy, and can determine whether or not a drug is behaving as expected for a classical partial agonist.

AB Chemopreventive effects of synthetic and naturally occurring antioxidants on heterocyclic amine (HCA)-induced rat carcinogenesis and mechanisms of inhibition were assessed. In a medium-term liver bioassay, combined treatment with 0.03% 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and synthetic antioxidants such as 1-O-hexyl-2,3,5-trimethylhydroquinone (HTHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxutoluene (BHT), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) or propyl gallate, each at a dose of 0.25%, inhibited development of preneoplastic glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci as compared with MeIQx alone, after initiation with diethylnitrosamine (DEN). Of these antioxidants, HTHQ showed the greatest activity. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker for DNA damage induced by active oxygen species, and malonedialdehyde and 4-hydroxynonenal levels were not largely influenced by the treatment with MeIQx or antioxidants, either alone or in combination. In the same medium-term liver bioassay, effects of some naturally occurring antioxidants, such as green tea catechins (GTC), hesperidin, chlorogenic acid, quercetin, rutin, curcumin, daidzin, ferulic acid and genistein were also examined. Of these antioxidants, only GTC tended to inhibit GST-P positive foci development, while quercetin, rutin, curcumin, daidzin, ferulic acid and genistein all exerted significant enhancing effects. Examination of HTHQ influence in a medium term liver bioassay with HCA Glu-P-1, in which the experimental period was extended for up to 26 weeks, also demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of liver tumours to 40% in the group treated with 0.5% HTHQ and 0.03% 2-amino-6-methyldipyrido[1,2-a:3',2'-d]imidazole (Glu-P-1) as compared with the Glu-P-1 alone value of 89%. Effects of HTHQ on colon carcinogenesis induced by 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP) were evaluated in a two-stage colon carcinogenesis model using 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) as an initiator. At week 36, the multiplicity of colon tumours induced by 0.02% PhIP after DMH initiation (9.1 +/- 6.2/rat) was dose-dependently decreased by the combined treatment with 0.5% HTHQ (3.6 +/- 1.8, P < 0.001) and 0.125% HTHQ (6.2 +/- 3.2, not significant). Similarly, the incidence of mammary carcinomas in female F344 rats induced by oral administration of 0.02% PhIP (40%) for 52 weeks was significantly decreased by simultaneous treatment with 0.5% HTHQ (5%). alpha-Tocopherol and chlorophyllin only reduced the multiplicity of carcinomas. Analysis of the influence of HTHQ on metabolic activation of Glu-P-1 or PhIP after incubation with rat S9 mixture and NADPH by HPLC, revealed that each major metabolite was strongly reduced by the addition of HTHQ. Immunohistochemically detected PhIP-DNA adduct positive nuclei in the colon induced by continuous oral treatment with 0.02% PhIP for 2 weeks decreased by the combined treatment with 0.5 or 0.125% HTHQ. These results indicate that synthetic antioxidant HTHQ is a very strong chemopreventor of heterocyclic amine (HCA)-induced carcinogenesis and that depressed metabolic activation rather than antioxidant activity is responsible for the observed effect.

ID BUILDING-BLOCKS; INSIGHT
AB Self-assembly attracts enormous research attention because it is at the core of important applications ranging from medical treatments to renewable energy production. Among several classes of self-assembling materials, liquid crystals (LCs) and nanoparticles yield ordered structures under well-defined thermodynamic conditions and could yield supra-molecular aggregates, respectively. In this work, nanoparticle self-assembly on LC nano-droplets is investigated. The LC nano-droplets act as templating agents on which homogeneous and Janus nanoparticles of various geometrical features are adsorbed. LC mesogens and water have low mutual solubility, and under the conditions chosen the LCs yield bipolar nano-droplets. Particle self-assembly on oil nano-droplets is also considered for comparison. Our results reveal that the mesogens can direct the assembly of the nanoparticles. This effect is mainly governed by the nanoparticle size and shape. In some cases, strong evidence of emergent behaviour is observed depending on entropic forces that arise because of the shape and patchiness of the nanoparticles. For example, while one small spherical homogeneous particle does not show preferential adsorption on specific LC nano-droplet locations, 100 spherical nanoparticles preferentially agglomerate at the nano-droplet boojums, providing evidence of emergent behaviour. On the contrary, Janus spherical nanoparticles do not show such a strong emergent behaviour. Cylindrical NPs manifest the opposite trend: while homogeneous nano-cylinders do not exhibit orientational order on the LC nano-droplet, Janus ones either locate at the LC nano-droplet boojums or orient towards the direction vector of bipolar droplets. Quantification of the orientational order within the LC nano-droplets suggests that the self-assembly of the LC mesogens does not significantly change upon nanoparticle adsorption. These simulations clearly suggest an interplay between nanoparticle size, shape and chemical composition upon their self-assembly on LC nano-droplets. The results could be helpful for the design of new sensors and for the directed self-assembly of advanced materials.
   Design, System, Application
   Self-assembly of liquid crystals (LCs) is crucial for a variety of high-end applications ranging from sensors to displays. Towards designing supra-molecular aggregates for such applications, it is crucial to better understand nanoparticle (NP)-LC interactions. Yet, this area is not yet fully explored by either theoretical or experimental studies. To aid future system design and engineering for such systems, we conducted computational studies to quantify the molecular driving forces responsible for the collective behaviour of LC molecules in the presence of NPs. We focused on NPs with different shapes, sizes, and chemical functionalities. LC droplets dispersed in aqueous medium were considered as templates for guiding the self-assembly of the NPs. The LC droplets were prepared in the bipolar nematic phase. Our results yield a comprehensive map of NP-LC interactions at the nanoscale, revealing that the NP shape could be equally important as NP size in driving assembly. In addition, our results show that the chemical functionality, in particular homogeneous vs. Janus NPs, have strong effects on the NP assembly on the LC droplets. The results suggest that a balance among different driving forces is essential to develop advanced supra-molecular devices.

   space and microbial activity in windrow composting
SO COMPOST SCIENCE & UTILIZATION
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper describes the first equipment developed to include compressive loads in a physical model of the composting environment. This new type of composting reactor was named a biological load cell, or biocell for short. Our hypothesis was that the exclusion of compressive settlement in existing physical models may lead to errors if the data is used to design full-scale windrow composting facilities. Municipal biosolids were mixed with three organic amendments (wood chips, straw, and leaves) to yield mixture moisture contents of 55%. Compressive settlement analyses were completed by subjecting the mixtures to loads of 0, 4.3, 8.6, arid 12.9 kPa using biocells. The effect of compressive settlement on microbial activity was investigated using the biosolids:leaf mixture under loaded (12.9 kPa) and unloaded conditions. The settlement behavior of all three mixtures was found to fit established soil compaction equations and new equations were developed to represent the vertical free air space (FAS) and bulk density profiles in composting systems. The FAS profiles indicated that existing physical models do not simulate the FAS conditions within a composting matrix and significant differences in microbial activity were observed between loaded and unloaded biocells. The microbial activity differences were attributed to the reduced FAS within the loaded biocells, which, in consequence, lead to lower pore space oxygen concentrations. It proved difficult, however, to simulate the air flow regime within a windrow composting matrix. To further develop the biocells, there is a need to investigate the in-situ stress conditions and natural draft ventilation rates of full-scale windrow systems. While further work is required to perfect the biocells as a physical model of the windrow composting environment, it has demonstrated its potential use for FAS analysis and as a standard bulk density apparatus. Using biocells, it is recommended that FAS curves be developed for a wide range of feedstock recipes. The biocell apparatus could also be developed as a standard bulk density test apparatus. Other important conclusions drawn from the work include: leaves should not be used as a bulking agent; wood chips showed superior bulking properties and are recommended for use in very high (3.7 m) windrows; straw showed intermediate bulking properties and should not be used for high windrows without further investigation; for all materials, compaction occurred rapidly after each incremental load, suggesting that windrow turning will do little to alleviate a low FAS problem associated with an incorrect composting recipe.

AB Plant species models are among the available tools to predict the future of ecosystems threatened by climate change, habitat loss, and degradation. However, they suffer from low to no inclusion of plant dispersal, which is necessary to predict ecosystem evolution. A variety of seed dispersal models have been conceived for anemochorous and zoochorous plant species, but the coupling between vegetation models and seed dispersal processes remains rare. The main challenge in modelling zoochoric dispersal is simulating animal movements in their complex habitat. Recent developments allow straightforward applications of hidden Markov modelling (HMM) to animal movements, which could ease generalizations when modelling zoochoric seed dispersal. We tested the use of HMM to model seed dispersal by an endangered primate in the Brazilian Atlantic forest, to demonstrate its potential simplicity to simulate seed dispersal processes. We also discuss how to adapt it to other species. We collected information on movement, fruit consumption, deposition, and habitat use of Leontopithecus chrysomelas. We analysed daily trajectories using HMM and built a deterministic Model Of Seed Transfer (MOST), which replicated, with good approximation, the primate's movement and seed deposition patterns as observed in the field. Our results suggest that the dispersal behaviour and short daily-trajectories of L. chrysomelas restrict the species' role in large-scale forest regeneration, but contribute to the prevalence of resource tree species locally, and potentially maintaining tree diversity by preventing local extinction. However, it may be possible to accurately simulate dispersal in an area, without necessarily quantifying variables that influence movement, if the movement can be broken down to step-length and turning angles, and parametrised along with the distribution of gut-transit times. For future objectives, coupling MOST with a DVM could be used to test hypotheses on tree species survival in various scenarios, simulating regeneration and growth at regional scales by including data on main dispersal agents over the area of interest, distribution of tree species, and land use data. The principal advantage of the MOST model is its functionality with data available from the literature as the variables are easy to parametrise. We suggest using the coupled model to perform experiments using only available information, but varying the numbers and species of seed dispersers, or modifying land cover or configuration to test for possible thresholds preventing the extinction of selected tree species.

AB Strict regulations imposed by the European Union (EU) with the target of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions oblige the biogas plant operators to manage digestate properly. Digestate is a by-product of biogas plants and is used extensively as an organic fertilizer. Digestate drying is a commercially available technology. According to the Fachverband Biogas (German Biogas Assiciation) (2018), 500-700 dryers are in use in Germany's biogas industry. Thermal drying can meet the requirements for hygienization and produce a transportable and storable fertilizer as well. Moreover, the GHG emissions from dried digestate are considerably lower than emissions from moist digestate. In addition to the high energy demand of the drying process, emissions occur during drying, resulting in both a decrease in the digestate's fertilizing value and some negative effects on the environment. Consequently, accurate investigation of the drying kinetics is needed in order to optimize the process with regard to energy consumption, drying time, and the amount of emissions. Drying of digestate faces many difficulties because of material specific properties as well as environmental issues. Digestate tends to stick to the dryer in high moisture content. In spite of additional energy requirements, back-mixing or additives is usually utilized to cope with this problem. These methods also have a positive effect on drying rate and considerably reduce drying time. However, they should be investigated exactly because they can sometimes have negative effect in case of excessive usage. Drying rate and also ammonia emission can be controlled by operational conditions, as well. On account of wide variety of digestate, availability of a generalized reliable model will be of benefit as it allows the engineers and designers to develop and optimize the drying processes. However, determination of primary data should be regarded as the first step. It should be noted that even though obtaining an efficient drying process with regards to both energy consumption and emission is not possible, a relative commitment can be achieved. Thanks to the advances of computational resources, numerical modeling could be considered a key instrument for future progress in designing and optimization of drying process provided that reliable input data are obtainable. This paper aims to review the literature on drying techniques, drying kinetics, and emission behavior of digestate.

TI Concept-matching in the brain depends on serotonin and gamma-frequency
   shifts
SO MEDICAL HYPOTHESES
LA English
DT Article
ID RECOGNITION; HUMANS
AB A Eureka moment has three components - puzzle, solution and hedonic response (elation etc.). Puzzle and solution come together in the association cortex and are immensely variable from instance to instance. By contrast, the hedonic response is subcortical. and almost one-dimensional; how is it triggered? It is triggered by the relation between puzzle and solution, a good fit or good match, like the relation between two words that rhyme. In 1999 J.W. Fost proposed that serotonin is a crucial agent; here it is proposed that a frequency-jump initiates the serotonin causal chain, as energy shifts from 20 to 40 Hz or some such jump.
   The hypothesis assumes that any discrete idea is embodied in a time-course of electrical and chemical changes in a network of neurons, and that keeping the idea in mind involves repeating more or less the same time-course over and over. If observed frequencies in the gamma range result from such repetition, the period for running the time-course once is of the order of 25 ms. Also accepted is the suggestion that, although the brain runs many processes simultaneously, in the conscious mind attention focuses on only one idea at a time; an attempt to "think of two things at once" actually results only in giving them attention alternately, with a repeat-time of the order of 50 ms and frequency 20 Hz. Only if the two time-courses have certain elements in common will there be any repetition at 40 Hz.
   Now suppose a thinker takes up a problem and makes a succession of attempts at solution. As tong as he thinks of wrong answers, he generates activity only at 20 Hz, but when he hits upon the right answer, activity at 40 Hz shows up. This is a highly oversimplified scenario but its essential features might carry over to the vastly more complicated workings of a real brain.
   The virtue of the proposed mechanism is its generality. Under the proposal, any ideas in mind that do not match give no result but as soon as two ideas match, results ensue. This behavior in the model, wholly general except in one specific respect, is needed for conformity with real human brains' behavior. In normal people, production of this "link-joy" is an important reward mechanism and malfunction of this system may contribute to Capgras syndrome and some varieties of autism. &COPY; 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The purpose of this article is to study the theoretical foundations of the concept of fiscal decentralization, as the main path of self-development of the national economy of any country, and to develop mathematical tools that support decision-making in the aspect of "hard" budget constraints. The study of the problems of fiscal policy formation in foreign countries presented in modern scientific literature has revealed that the degree of application of the concepts of "soft" and "hard" budget restrictions is an actual topic in the theory of fiscal federalism. It has been substantiated that decision-making within the framework of "soft" budget constraints (financial assistance) leads to low tax autonomy of territories and limited liability of regional and municipal authorities for the results of their financial policy. As a research hypothesis, we put forward the thesis that it is necessary to create conditions for encouraging subnational authorities to support the territorial economy by granting them the possibility to use part of the taxes collected in the respective territories. The implementation of this thesis has given rise to the problem of quantifying decisions made regarding the establishment of standards for the distribution of tax revenues between budgets of different levels of the hierarchy of the country's budget system. In terms of solving this problem, the author has constructed mathematical models based on the use of synthesis of mathematical apparatus of the theory of stochastic automata, fuzzy algebra, and simulation. In terms of solving this problem, the author proposed the use of mathematical modeling methods. The article presents the results of constructing economic and mathematical models to support decision-making in the vertical distribution of tax revenues between budgets. The models include stochastic automata, as mathematical abstractions, describing the expedient behavior of an economic agent when choosing management alternatives for territories of different levels of economic development. The transition functions of automaton models are formally described on the basis of the synthesis of mathematical apparatus of the theories of stochastic automata operating in random environments and fuzzy sets. The expediency property of the behavior of automaton models is justified by proving the corresponding theorems. The random environment in which stochastic automata are immersed is formed by a simulation model. The article demonstrates the results of experiments carried out on models, as well as a conceptual scheme of interaction between the automaton and simulation models.

AB Background. Enzymatic hydrolysis of N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), which are signaling molecules responsible for the development of antibiotic resistance in gram-negative bacteria, is a potential solution to overcoming antibiotic resistance problem. It has been established that hexahistidine-tagged organophosphorus hydrolase (His(6)-OPH) exhibits lactonase activity against a number of AHLs and that the combined application of His(6)-OPH with beta-lactam antibiotics leads to an increase in the efficiency of the action of both the enzyme and antibiotics. The use of computational methods can be an effective way to search for and select from the known antibiotics to find the most rational "partners" for combining with this enzyme and creating effective antibacterial agents with a dual (lactonase and antibacterial) functional activity.
   Methods. In this study, by using AutoDock Vina and Gromacs softwares the molecular docking and the molecular dynamics methods were adopted to simulate models of puromycin, ceftiofur, and/or AHLs docked to the surface of a dimer molecule of His(6)-OPH and to study their binding properties. GABEDIT and GAMESS-US packages were used to generate and simulate electron densities of docked AHLs.
   Results. Interactions of N-butyryl-DL-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL), N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL) and N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone (C12-HSL) with His (6)-OPH dimer active sites in the presence of puromycin and ceftiofur were simulated and studied. The possible intersection of long-chain AHLs with antibiotic molecules in the active sites of the enzyme was revealed. The binding energies of antibiotics and AHLs with the His(6)-OPH surface were estimated. Statistically significant differences (p = 0.003) were observed between the values calculated for both C4-HSL and C12-HSL, whereas there were no statistically significant differences between the values of the other groups (p >= 0.100). The binding energies of AHLs with His(6)-OPH were slightly higher as compared with the binding energies of antibiotics with the enzyme. The dynamics of the most probable models obtained from docking were investigated. RMSD and RMSF analysis of His(6) -OPH-AHL complexes in the absence and presence of antibiotics were performed. The interaction energy values of antibiotics and AHLs with the His(6)-OPH were assessed. Significant increase of the AHLs steadiness in enzyme-substrate complexes in the presence of antibiotics was revealed. The interaction between His(6)-OPH and C12-HSL was established as thermodynamically more favored.
   Conclusions. It has been established that the studied antibiotics puromycin and ceftiofur steady the enzyme-substrate complexes, but at the same time lead to a decrease in the long-chain AHL-hydrolytic activity of His(6)-OPH in such a combination as compared to a native enzyme, and, therefore, it should be taken into account when creating a therapeutic composition based on combining antibiotics with His(6)-OPH.

AB High-dose GH therapy, with GH doses 10-20 times the normal replacement dose for GH-deficient adults, has been used as an anti-catabolic agent in a number of different patient groups. A recent study, however, has shown an increase in mortality in critically ill patients treated with high-dose GH. The increased mortality was associated with multiorgan failure, septic shock, and uncontrolled infection, suggesting that GH may have altered the immune response. The GH receptor and GH are both expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); thus, GH could act as either an endocrine or an autocrine modulator of the immune response. We have examined the hypothesis that high-dose GH therapy may induce proinflammatory cytokines, which are implicated in septic shock. To do this we measured cytokine production by PBMCs incubated in conditions that simulated high-dose GH therapy, and we measured cytokine levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who were randomized to receive either high-dose GH therapy (13 IU/m(2) day) or placebo.
   To confirm the biological activity of GH in our cell culture system we used a Stat5 functional assay. In this assay GH induced a bell-shaped curve, with a maximal response at GH levels between 100-1000 ng/mL. PBMCs from healthy volunteers were incubated with GH in doses from 1-1000 ng/mL for 6-72 h under resting conditions and after activation with endotoxin and the mixed lymphocyte reaction. Studies were repeated with PBMCs from six individuals using a GH dose of 100 ng/mL (the level of GH found after high-dose GH therapy) and an endotoxin dose that gave a submaximal response (0.01 ng/mL). GH had no effect on cell proliferation or the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), or interferon-gamma (IFN gamma). In patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy there was a time-related effect of surgery on cytokine levels. There was a rise in IL-6 and a fall in TNF alpha at 24 h after surgery; however, high-dose GH therapy had no effect on the cytokine response. We considered the possibility that endogenous GH production by PBMCs could influence the cytokine response in activated PBMCs; however, incubation of PBMCs in the presence of the GH receptor antagonist, B2036, had no effect on TNF alpha, IL-6, or IFN gamma production by PBMCs in either the mixed lymphocyte reaction or when activated by endotoxin.
   These results suggest that high-dose GH therapy does not alter the proinflammatory cytokine response to surgery or endotorrin. The results do not exclude an effect of GH on the immune response, but they suggest that the mortality seen in critically ill patients may be due to factors other than immune modulation.

AB The purpose of this study is to increase the basic understanding of outbreak dynamics in order to improve the management of bark beetle outbreaks. The spruce bark beetle Ips typographus is a major disturbance agent of European forests and is the continent's most economically and environmentally damaging bark beetle. Outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle are often triggered by large windfall episodes, and we have utilized a unique opportunity to study a Slovakian outbreak where little salvage logging was performed in some areas after a 2.5 million m(3) storm-felling in 2004.
   Our analyses focused on the first five years after the windfall, and we used a combination of empirical data and simulation models to understand the spatial patterns of beetle-killed forest patches developing during the outbreak. The univoltine beetle population used an increasing proportion of the windfelled trees during the two first seasons after the storm, but from the third season onwards our comparisons of inter-patch distance distributions indicated a transition from beetle production largely in windfall areas to a self-sustaining outbreak with infestation patches developing independently of the windthrows. The size of new infestation patches formed after this transition was modeled as a function of beetle pressure, estimated by the proportion of a circle area surrounding new patches that was covered by infestation patches the previous year. Our model results of patch size distribution did not correspond well with the empirical data if patch formation was modeled as a pure dispersal-diffusion process. However, beetle aggregation on individual trees appears to be important for patch development, since good correspondence with empirical data was found when beetle aggregation was incorporated in the modeled dispersal process. The strength of correspondence between the beetle aggregation model and the empirical data varied with the density of aggregation trees in the modeled landscape, and reached a maximum of 83% for a density of three aggregation trees per infestation patch.
   Our results suggest that efficient removal of windfelled trees up until the start of the second summer after a major windfall is important to avoid a transition into a patch-driven bark beetle outbreak that is very difficult to manage. Our results also indicate that the outcome of a patch-driven outbreak is difficult to predict, since the development of new infestation patches is not a simple function of beetle pressure but is also affected by beetle behavior and local forest conditions.

AB Both Cretaceous arc-type and intraplate rocks are widely distributed in SE China, in association with subduction of the paleo-Pacific Plate. However, it remains unclear whether there exists a genetic link between the intraplate and subduction-related magmatism. Here we conduct a comprehensive geochemical data compilation, sorting and processing of the Cretaceous mafic igneous rocks from SE China, in combination with a 2-D numerical simulation on slab melting, to further decipher the petrogenetic relationship between the arc-type and intraplate magmatism under a unified tectonic framework invoking subduction and rollback-tearing of the paleo-Pacific Ocean.
   The Cretaceous arc-type mafic rocks (120-80 Ma) include eruptive and intrusive rocks, distributing along the coastal region in a NE-NNE direction. After parent magma compositional recalculation of the mafic intrusions, the results indicate that both the eruptive and intrusive arc-type mafic rocks are hydrous calc-alkaline basalts, with enrichments in large ion lithophile elements (LILEs) and light rare earth elements (LREEs) but depletions in high field strength elements (HFSEs), crust-like Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic compositions, and low Lu/Hf ratios. All these features are typical of igneous rocks formed in a continental arc. The combined data suggest their mantle source was mainly metasomatized by melts derived from the subducted terrestrial sediments and reflect a relatively hot subduction zone during Cretaceous.
   The intraplate mafic rocks (110-70 Ma) distribute in SE China interior and generally show trace element geochemistry similar to oceanic island basalt (OIB, hereafter we term them as OIB-like basalts). They can be further divided into two groups: high-Nb (Nb > 50 ppm) and low-Nb (Nb < 40 ppm) basalts. The high-Nb basalts have depleted asthenospheric mantle-like isotopic compositions. Their mantle source was composed mainly of pyroxenite that was likely formed through interaction between the asthenosphere and melts from the dehydrated subducted slab. Relative to the high-Nb basalts, the low-Nb basalts have lower Nb/REE and Nb/LILE ratios, and more evolved but highly variable isotopic compositions. Their mantle source was also the asthenosphere metasomatized by addition of the slab melts containing a higher proportion of recycled sediment component.
   From the arc-type to low-Nb and ultimately to high-Nb mafic rocks, increases of Nb, Nb/LILE and Nb/REE ratios are coupled with more depleted Sr-Nd-Pb-Hf isotopic features, reflecting the occurrence of melting from the upper subducted sediment to the lower oceanic mafic crust that had experienced extensive dehydration. Further thermodynamic modelling results show that melting of the dehydrated slab can occur along the torn surface and lower part of the oceanic crust, once the slab is strongly thinned and fractured in response to tearing and fragmentation. In combination with the contemporaneous sedimentary records in SE China, the Cretaceous mafic magmatism provided geochemical records of tectonic transition from early Cretaceous advanced subduction to late Cretaceous rollback of the paleo-Pacific slab, during which slab tearing or fragmentation and the resultant melting of the dehydrated subducted slab acted as a predominant agent for mantle enrichment.

AB Lyme disease is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease and occurs in mammals including horses. The disease is induced by infection with spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group. Infection of mammalian hosts requires transmission of spirochetes by infected ticks during tick bites. Lyme disease diagnosis is based on clinical signs, possible exposure to infected ticks, and antibody testing which is traditionally performed by ELISA and Western blotting (WB). This report describes the development and validation of a new fluorescent bead-based multiplex assay for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA), OspC and OspF antigens in horse serum. Testing of 562 equine sera was performed blindly and in parallel by using WB and the new multiplex assay. Because a true gold standard is missing for Lyme antibody testing, we performed and compared different statistical approaches to validate the new Lyme multiplex assay. One approach was to use WB results as a 'relative gold standard' in ROC-curve and likelihood-ratio analyses of the new test. Cut-off values and interpretation ranges of the multiplex assay were established by the analysis. The second statistical approach used a Bayesian model for the calculation of diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the multiplex assay. The Bayesian analysis takes into consideration that no true gold standard exists for detecting antibodies to B. burgdorferi and estimated sensitivities and specificities of both tests that were compared. Therefore, the Bayesian analysis also resulted in an evaluation of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of WB. Overall, the new assay was characterized by low background values and a wide dynamic quantification range for the detection of antibodies to OspA, OspC and OspF antigens of B. burgdorferi. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the OspA bead-based assay were calculated as 49% and 85%, respectively, and by a standard ROC curve analysis only because the Bayesian model could not be run on this parameter. The Bayesian-derived diagnostic sensitivities of the OspC and OspF assays were 80% and 86%, respectively. For comparison, the Bayesian-derived estimates for WB resulted in sensitivities of 72% for OspC and 80% for OspF. The Bayesian diagnostic specificities of the multiplex assay were 79% and 69% for OspC and OspF, respectively. WB analysis had specificities of 92% for OspC and 77% for OspF. Although the analysis of a new assay in the absence of a true gold standard remains challenging, the approach used here can help to address this problem when new technologies and traditionally used test standards differ significantly in their analytical sensitivities, which consequently causes problems in the calculation of diagnostic sensitivity and sensitivity values for the new assay. In summary, the new multiplex assay for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi OspA, OspC and OspF antigens in horse serum has improved analytical and diagnostic sensitivities compared to WB analysis. Multiplex analysis is a valuable quantitative tool that simultaneously detects antibodies indicative for natural infection with and/or vaccination against the Lyme pathogen. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) in nonmyeloablative (NMA) transplant recipients remains high. To date, the ideal prophylaxis regimen, which minimizes aGVHD and chronic GVHD (cGVHD), but does not abrogate graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response, has not been described. Because tacrolimus is more potent than cyclosporine (CSA), and because mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is an effective immunosuppressant that does not lead to mucositis, we hypothesized that a combination of these 2 oral agents may be an effective GVHD prophylactic strategy. We, therefore, designed an outpatient prospective cohort study with a conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine (Flu) 30 mg/m(2) daily and cyclophosphamide (Cy) 300 mg/m2 daily for 5 days followed by infusion of blood stem cells. Tacrolimus 3 mg twice a day was started on day (D) -8, adjusted to achieve levels 10-15 nmol/L, continued until D + 50 and then tapered by D + 100 or + 180 according to estimated risk of relapse. MMF 1000 mg twice a day was started on D + I and discontinued on D + 50. To date, 131 patients (males/females: 75/56) with a median age of 54 years have received a 6/6 matched sibling transplant using this protocol. Indication for NMA transplant included age >55 years (24%), expected increased risk of toxicity (28%), or participation in a multiple myeloma (MM) sequential protocol (48%). Most common diagnoses included MM (N = 62), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, N = 46), and acute leukemia (N = 10). Following infusion of 6.8 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg (range: 0.30-22.3), neutrophil and lymphocyte engraftment occurred in 95% of patients by D + 180. The estimated cumulative incidence of classical grade I-IVaGVHD by D + 120 was 11.6% (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 7.1-18.5). No grade IV aGVHD was observed. In addition, 15 patients (12%: CI: 7.4-19.2; median D + 140) developed an overlap syndrome consisting of clinical and histologic features of both aGVHD and cGVHD simultaneously. The estimated cumulative incidence of extensive cGVHD was 76.1% (95% CI: 67.4-83.9) at 2 years, with clinical features at presentation similar to other reported series. In patients developing extensive cGVHD, the probability of remaining on immunosuppression at 5 years was 34.8% (95% CI: 16.4-57.3). With a median follow-up of 982 days, the estimated probabilities of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were 15.5% (95% CI: 9.0-26.1) and 62.7% (95% CI: 51.4-72.1). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 30% at 7 years. Following NMA transplant, disease-free survival (DFS) was highest in recipients with follicular NHL (79.8%:95% CI: 57.6-91.2) and lowest in large cell NHLs (34.3%: 95% CI: 1.6-75.9). From this large group of patients treated with a uniform conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis regimen, we conclude that aGVHD prophylaxis with early use of tacrolimus and MMF is safe, effective, and associated with low NRM. Future strategies will need to focus on decreasing the incidence of extensive cGVHD without increasing the risk of relapse.

AB As the heating demands of buildings drop considerably, the use of solar walls makes increasing sense. One of the obstacles to the development of such walls is their need for on-site implementation by specialized companies. On the other hand, a storage wall is generally composed of heavy materials with high inertia, which prevents prefabrication of the solar component. To avoid this problem and allow for solar walls to be prefabricated in the factory, a novel approach to replacing this heavy wall with a lighter storage wall incorporating phase change materials (PCM) has been proposed. This paper aims to demonstrate the impact of PCM on the thermal energy performance once they have been integrated into the storage wall of the composite Trombe wall. Addressed herein will be the heat transfer exchange inside a house located in the northern part of France, where a composite Trombe wall has been fitted without PCM. Three configurations will be investigated-(1) the model house without the solar Trombe wall, defined as the reference configuration; (2) the model house integrating the concrete solar Trombe wall; and (3) the model house integrating the PCM solar Trombe wall. Two setpoint temperatures will be introduced-(a) a constant setpoint of 20 degrees C, and (b) a variable setpoint of 19 degrees C (14 h from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.) and 16 degrees C (10 h from 9:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.). Furthermore, three different climate conditions will be adopted to run simulations-Paris-Orly, Lyon, and Nice.Dymola/Modelica, a dynamic thermal simulation tool, will be utilized to simulate the thermal performance of these defined configurations. The results obtained, regarding a solar Trombe wall installation that applies two distinct storage walls exposed to the weather of Paris, showed similar minimizations of the one-year energy heating demand inside the bedroom, equal to roughly 20% (i.e., 20.45% of concrete storage wall and 19.90% of PCM storage wall) compared to the reference configuration (i.e., the house with no solar Trombe wall). Based on the imposed setpoint temperature by means of night and day reductions, the resulting heating energy demand in the bedroom, through application of the two storage walls (concrete and PCM) and three different climatic regions could be minimized by 20.34% in Paris, 20.20% in Lyon, and 68.10% in Nice (for the concrete storage wall) vs. the reference configuration; and by 18.79% in Paris, 19.56% in Lyon, and 55.15% in Nice (for the PCM storage wall) vs. the reference configuration.

AB The exchange of water between hemispheres is examined theoretically by looking at the behaviour of continuous (double frontal) abyssal currents situated on the bottom of a (parabolic) meridional channel. We used a reduced-gravity (fluid) model with an active lower layer on the bottom of the channel, and a passive infinitely deep upper layer on the top. The topography is the agent responsible for forcing the current across the equator. We first examined analytically the nonlinear, steady, frictionless case and, as a second step, we considered a nonlinear numerical simulation (of the Bleck and Boudra type). We then compared the results of these two (fluid) models to each other and to the solid-balls model of Borisov and Nof which examined the migration of particles in the same cross-equatorial channel.
   All three models show that, in general, the current (or a 'cloud' of solid particles) advances gradually toward the equator without much change to its structure. Upon reaching the vicinity of the equator, the current width (or the distance between neighbouring balls) decreases dramatically. The current (or cloud) then turns eastward, flows rapidly downslope, and rises on the eastern side. The now (or cloud) ultimately splits into two parts, one progressing northward and the other recirculating and advancing southward.
   Remarkably good agreement is found between the detailed solid-particles analysis and the new numerical fluid simulations, indicating that the inter-hemispheric exchange is primarily an inertial process that depends mainly on the channel geometry. It is shown that the partition of mass flux between the two hemispheres depends on the way that the solid particles, or the current-jet, impinge on the eastern flank of the channel. In contrast to the very good agreement between the solid balls and the fluid simulations, poor agreement was found between the detailed analytical prediction for the cross-equatorial transport and the numerical solution (even when the viscosity was as small as we could use for numerical stability). However, the analytical solution does give the correct prediction for the position of the resulting currents and their general behaviour. It is argued that the disagreement between the analytically calculated fluid mass transports (which, in contrast to the balls, is subject to a potential-vorticity constraint) and the numerical computations is due to the alteration of potential vorticity. Specifically, the friction alters the potential vorticity of the flow and prevents it from acting as a constraint to the crossing. Though crucial to the crossing, the role of friction is, therefore, passive. It merely allows the fluid to alter its potential vorticity in such a manner that the flow can adapt to the crossing pattern imposed by the geometry.
   It is suggested that the observed recirculation of Antarctic Bottom Water in the vicinity of the equatorial Atlantic may be a result of our splitting process.

AB Direct numerical simulations are used to study the three-dimensional, incompressible and viscous flow dynamics of a base solid-body rotation flow with a uniform axial velocity entering a rotating, finite-length, straight circular pipe. Steady in time profiles of the axial, radial and circumferential velocities are prescribed along the pipe inlet. The convective boundary conditions for each velocity flux component is set at the pipe outlet. The simulation results describe the neutral stability line in response to either axisymmetric or three-dimensional perturbations in a diagram of Reynolds number (Re, based on inlet axial velocity and pipe radius) versus the incoming flow swirl ratio (omega). This line is in good agreement with the neutral stability line recently predicted by the linear stability theory of Wang el al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 797, 2016, pp. 284-321). The computed time history of the velocity components at a certain point in the flow is used to describe three-dimensional phase portraits of the flow global dynamics and its long-term behaviour. They show three types of flow evolution scenarios. First, the Wang & Rusak (Phys. Fluids, vol. 8 (4), 1996, pp. 1007-1016) axisymmetric instability mechanism and evolution to a stable axisymmetric breakdown state is recovered at certain operational conditions in terms of Re and co. However, at other operational conditions with same co but with a higher Re, a second scenario is found. The axisymmetric breakdown state continues to evolve and a spiral instability mode appears on it and grows to a rotating spiral breakdown state. Moreover, at higher levels of co a third scenario is found where there exists a dominant three-dimensional spiral type of instability mode that agrees with the linear stability theory of Wang et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 797, 2016, pp. 284-321). The growth of this mode leads directly to a spiral type of flow roll-up and nonlinearly saturates on a rotating spiral type of vortex breakdown. The Reynolds-Orr equation is used to reveal the mechanism that drives all the instabilities as well as the nonlinear global flow evolution. At high swirl ratios, the confined kinetic energy in the swirling flow can be triggered to be released through various physical agents, such as the asymmetric inlet-outlet conditions, that eliminate axial homogeneity along the pipe and induce flow instabilities and evolution to breakdown states. It is also shown that local instability analysis or its extension using the assumption of a weakly non-parallel flow to conduct convective instability-absolute instability analyses is definitely not related to any of the instability modes found in the present study. Moreover, a stability study based on the strongly non-parallel flow character, including axial inhomogeneity due to a finite-domain boundary conditions, must be conducted to reveal instabilities in such flows.

AB We addressed several controversial issues regarding the impact of predatory fish on prey in natural streams in Kentucky by experimentally adding predatory green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, to four stream pools that contained small-mouthed salamander larvae, Ambystoma barbouri, while leaving four other pools as fishless controls.  We monitored the density, drift (in and out of pools), and habitat use of the larvae before and for 1 mo after fish addition (until larvae began to undergo metamorphosis).  By quantifying larval density and drift, we were able to address two issues:  (1) effect of prey exchange on predator impacts; and (2) relative contribution to total predator impact of predation per se vs. predator-induced emigration.
   Larval densities and behaviors were similar in experimental and control pools before fish addition.  After fish addition:  (1) density decreased more rapidly in fish pools than in control pools; (2) larvae in fish pools spent more time under rocks and less time in deep, central areas than did larvae in control pools; and (3) larval overnight drift rates (proportion of larval in a pool, drifting out overnight) were higher in fish pools than in control pools.
   We calculated weekly average rates of change in larval density in fish and control pools and found that densities in control pools decreased very little except during a period with flooding; that is, flooding was a major cause of population reduction in fishless pools.  In contrast, in fish pools, densities decreased steadily.  Interestingly, the rate of decrease in larval density in fish pools was lower during the flood period than during other periods.  This might be due to an increase in net drift into fish pools, or a decrease in fish predation during floods.
   Although net drift (drift in minus drift out) showed a tendency to be positive, it did not differ significantly from zero in any situation (fish or control pools, day or night).  In particular, fish-induced increases in larval per capita emigration rates offset high immigration rates into fish pools.  Because there was no significant net drift into fish pools, immigration could not swamp predator impacts.  Because there was no significant net drift out of fish pools, the decrease in larval density in fish pools can be explained entirely by predation per se, rather than by predator-induced emigration.
   Our data suggested that, in the experiment year, almost-equal-to 30-40% of all larvae in this population drifted through a fish pool at some time in their lives; this estimate is conservative because we were unable to get data on drift rates during floods.  On average, only almost-equal-to 6-8% of the larvae that drifted into a fish pool survived to drift out the downstream end.  Thus fish predation should be a strong selective agent favoring behaviors that enhance larval survivorship and drift out of fish pools.
   Auxiliary experiments showed that:  (1) larvae decrease their activity when they first drift into fish pools; this presumably decreases the conspicuousness of these larvae to visual predators; (2) the presence of fish is associated with a larval shift in diurnal activity towards greater activity at night rather than in the daytime; this is associated with drift out at night; and (3) larvae alter their refuge use and drift in response to caged fish, from which larvae probably only receive chemical cues.
   Overall, our study is one of the few to simultaneously monitor predator effects on prey population dynamics, dispersal, and refuge use.  Information on each of these variables helped us to better understand predator effects on the other variables; we suggest that it should be generally useful to monitor a relatively full set of prey responses to predators.

AB Female mating failures seem a paradox similar to the paradox of polyandry. To illustrate the twin paradoxes of female mating failures and polyandry, we assume that individuals, not sexes, trade-off time available for mating with immediate fitness increments or decrements that would be conferred by alternative potential mates. We use Hubbell & Johnson's (1987) [analytical mating theory (H&J), the first sex-neutral null model of stochastic demography on variance in lifetime mating and adaptive behavior, as well as another sex-neutral null model, the Switch Point Theorem (SPT) (Gowaty & Hubbell, 2009). The H&J mating theory and SPT predict adaptive behavior of individuals accepting and rejecting potential mates without recourse to scenarios for the evolution of sex differences via anisogamy or parental investment. Sex-neutral models begin with individuals, not sexes. Null models assume no pre-existing sex-specific adaptations. H&J's mating theory and the SPT are discrete time absorbing Markov models that count the times individuals enter states such as receptivity, mating, latency to onset to receptivity, and death. H&J's model and the SPT are analytical solutions for the variance in mating success and the variance in reproductive success, as well as for the fraction of potential mates that are acceptable as mates to a given individual when potential mates differ in the fitness that they would confer to a given mating partner. In H&J's model, there are only two qualities of mates; in the SPT, there are n qualities of mates, where n = the number of potential mates in the population. Thus, both models predict mating failures and multiple mating for both sexes under similar or different demographic circumstances, including the fitness background (the fitness distribution of the pool of potential mates) under which individuals make reproductive decisions. In addition, we conducted numerical experiments using DYNAMATE (c), a dynamic, agent-based (object-oriented) simulation program that tracks dynamically the fate and interactions of all individuals in a single population over a reproductive season. DYNAMATE embodies the analytical solutions of the SPT as rules that determine individually adaptive reproductive decisions. With DYNAMATE we studied how moment-to-moment changes in demographic circumstances change individual behavior and trajectories of mating opportunities under the rules of the SPT that determined for each individual each of its adaptive (fitness enhancing) reproductive decisions. The models demonstrate that the pathways to life-long virginity and multiple mating reside in: (1) variation in individual lifespan; (2) variation in encounters with potential mates; (3) adaptive acceptance or rejection of potential mates as actual mates, which in the case of rejection of all encountered potential mates, results in life-long virginity, a fitness trap; (4) opposite-sex acceptances or rejections of potential mates as mates; and/or (5) some combination of (1)(4). The models make quantitative predictions about life-long failures to mate. Results are consistent with the conclusions that the paradoxical twin riddles of females failing to mate or mating multiply can occur without any appeal to or requirement for pre-existing fixed sex differences in choosy or indiscriminate behavior. It may be that the twin riddles of polyandry and female mating failures are only puzzling because the assumptions from parental investment and anisogamy theories about the fixed nature of female mating behavior are wrong.

AB In the presence of alternating-sinusoidal or rotating magnetic fields, magnetic nanoparticles will act to realign their magnetic moment with the applied magnetic field. There alignment is characterized by the nanoparticle's time constant, tau. As the magnetic field frequency is increased, the nanoparticle's magnetic moment lags the applied magnetic field at a constant angle for a given frequency, Omega, in rad s(-1). Associated with this misalignment is a power dissipation that increases the bulk magnetic fluid's temperature which has been utilized as a method of magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia, particularly suited for cancer in low-perfusion tissue (e.g., breast) where temperature increases of between 4 and 7 degrees C above the ambient in vivo temperature cause tumor hyperthermia. This work examines the rise in the magnetic fluid's temperature in the MRI environment which is characterized by a large DC field, B-0. Theoretical analysis and simulation is used to predict the effect of both alternating sinusoidal and rotating magnetic fields transverse to B-0. Results are presented for the expected temperature increase in small tumors (similar to 1 cm radius) over an appropriate range of magnetic fluid concentrations (0.002-0.01 solid volume fraction) and nanoparticle radii (1-10 nm). The results indicate that significant heating can take place, even in low-field MRI systems where magnetic fluid saturation is not significant, with careful the goal of this work is to examine, by means of analysis and simulation, the concept of interactive fluid magnetization using the dynamic behavior of superparamagnetic ironoxide nanoparticle suspensions in the MRI environment. In addition to the usual magnetic fields associated with MRI, a rotating magnetic field is applied transverse to the main B-0 field of the MRI. Additional or modified magnetic fields have been previously proposed for hyperthermia and targeted drug delivery within MRI. Analytical predictions and numerical simulations of the transverse rotating magnetic field in the presence of B-0 are investigated to demonstrate the effect of Omega, the rotating field frequency, and the magnetic field amplitude on the fluid suspension magnetization. The transverse magnetization due to the rotating transverse field shows strong dependence on the characteristic time constant of the fluid suspension, tau. The analysis shows that as the rotating field frequency increases so that Omega tau approaches unity, the transverse fluid magnetization vector is significantly non-aligned with the applied rotating field and the magnetization's magnitude is a strong function of the field frequency. In this frequency range, the fluid's transverse magnetization is controlled by the applied field which is determined by the operator. The phenomenon, which is due to the physical rotation of the magnetic nanoparticles in the suspension, is demonstrated analytically when the nanoparticles are present in high concentrations (1-3% solid volume fractions) more typical of hyperthermia rather than in clinical imaging applications, and in low MRI field strengths (such as open MRI systems), where the magnetic nanoparticles are not magnetically saturated. The effect of imposed Poiseuille flow in a planar channel geometry and changing nanoparticle concentration is examined. The work represents the first known attempt to analyze the dynamic behavior of magnetic nanoparticles in the MRI environment including the effects of the magnetic nanoparticle spin-velocity.
   It is shown hat the magnitude of the transverse magnetization is a strong function of the rotating transverse field frequency. Interactive fluid magnetization effects are predicted due to non-uniform fluid magnetization in planar Poiseuille flow with high nanoparticle concentrations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

TI Decision-making under uncertainty: Capturing dynamic brand choice
   processes in turbulent consumer goods markets
SO MARKETING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID PANEL-DATA; PROBIT MODEL; SIMULATION; PURCHASE
AB We construct two models of the behavior of consumers in an environment where there is uncertainty about brand attributes. In our models, both usage experience and advertising exposure give consumers noisy signals about brand attributes. Consumers use these signals to update their expectations of brand attributes in a Bayesian manner. The two models are (1) a dynamic model with immediate utility maximization, and (2) a dynamic ''forward-looking'' model in which consumers maximize the expected present value of utility over a planning horizon. Given this theoretical framework, we derive from the Bayesian learning framework how brand choice probabilities depend on past usage experience and advertising exposures. We then form likelihood functions for the models and estimate them on Nielsen scanner data for detergent.
   We find that the functional forms for experience and advertising effects that we derive from the Bayesian learning framework fit the data very well relative to flexible ad hoc functional forms such as exponential smoothing, and also perform better at out-of-sample prediction. Another finding is that in the context of consumer learning of product attributes, although the forward-looking model fits the data statistically better at conventional significance levels, both models produce similar parameter estimates and policy implications. Our estimates indicate that consumers are risk-averse with respect to variation in brand attributes, which discourages them from buying unfamiliar brands.
   Using the estimated behavioral models, we perform various scenario evaluations to find how changes in marketing strategy affect brand choice both in the short and long run. A key finding obtained from the policy experiments is that advertising intensity has only weak short run effects, but a strong cumulative effect in the long Nn.
   The substantive content of the paper is potentially of interest to academics in marketing, economics and decision sciences, as well as product managers, marketing research managers and analysts interested in studying the effectiveness of marketing mix strategies. Our paper will be of particular interest to those interested in the long run effects of advertising.
   Note that our estimation strategy requires us to specify explicit behavioral models of consumer choice behavior, derive the implied relationships among choice probabilities, past purchases and marketing mix variables, and then estimate the behavioral parameters of each model. Such an estimation strategy is referred to as ''structural'' estimation, and econometric models that are based explicitly on the consumer's maximization problem and whose parameters are parameters of the consumers' utility functions or of their constraints are referred to as ''structural'' models.
   A key benefit of the structural approach is its potential usefulness for policy evaluation. The parameters of structural models are invariant to policy, that is, they do not change due to a change in the policy. In contrast, the parameters of reduced form brand choice models are, in general, functions of marketing strategy variables (e.g., consumer response to price may depend on pricing policy). As a result, the predictions of reduced form models for the outcomes of policy experiments may be unreliable, because in making the prediction one must assume that the model parameters are unaffected by the policy change.
   Since the agents in our models choose among many alternative brands, their choice probabilities take the form of higher-order integrals. We employ Monte-Carlo methods to approximate these integrals and estimate our models using simulated maximum likelihood. Estimation of the dynamic forward-looking model also requires that a dynamic programming problem be solved in order to form the likelihood function. For this we use a new approximation method based on simulation and interpolation techniques. These estimation techniques may be of interest to researchers and policy makers in many fields where dynamic choice among discrete alternatives is important, such as marketing, decision sciences, labor and health economics, and industrial organization.

AB This essay is the outcome of a colloquium convened in November 2005 at the Benthos Laboratory of the Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn in Ischia, Italy, on chemical ecology and the role of secondary metabolites in the structuring and functioning of marine biodiversity. The participants of the workshop are part of the European Network of Excellence MarBEF (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function), a consortium of 56 European marine institutes to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine biodiversity. Here we review some of the new trends and emerging topics in marine chemical ecology. The first section deals with microbial chemical interactions. Microbes communicate with each other using diffusible molecules such as N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHL). These are regulators in cell-density-dependent gene regulation (quorum sensing) controlling microbial processes. In chemical interactions with higher organisms, microbes can act either as harmful pathogens that are repelled by the host's chemical defense or as beneficial symbionts. These symbionts are sometimes the true producers of the host's secondary metabolites that have defensive and protective functions for their hosts. We also describe how allelochemicals can shape phytoplankton communities by regulating competition for available resources, and also interactions among individuals of the same species. Compounds such as the diatom-derived unsaturated aldehydes have been demonstrated to act as infochemicals, and they possibly function as a diffusible bloom-termination signal that triggers an active cell death and bloom termination at sea. The same molecules have also been shown to interfere with the reproductive capacity of grazing animals deterring future generations of potential predators. Such compounds differ from those that act as feeding deterrents since they do not target the predator but its offspring. Many of the neurotoxins produced by dinoflagellates act as feeding deterrents, and laboratory experiments have shown that ingestion of these algae by some microzooplankton and macrozooplankton can cause acute responses such as death, incapacitation, altered swimming behavior, and reduced fecundity and egg-hatching success. These effects may rarely occur in nature because of low individual grazing rates on dinoflagellate cells and grazing on other food sources such as microflagellates; and diatoms. We also consider the nutritional component of marine plant-herbivore interactions, especially in the plankton, and the information available on the effects of growing conditions of algae on the production of toxic metabolites. Species producing saxitoxins seem to consistently produce the highest amounts of toxins (on a per cell basis) in the exponential phase of growth, and there is a decrease in their production under nitrogen, but not under phosphorus stress, where the production actually increases. We try to explain the circumstances under which organisms defend themselves chemically and argue that the most likely explanatory model for the production of secondary metabolites used for defense in planktonic organisms is the carbon nutrient balance hypothesis, which predicts that most algae produce their toxins mainly under conditions where carbon is in excess and nitrogen (or other nutrients) is limiting. We also discuss chemically mediated macroalgal-herbivore interactions in the benthos and the large variation in concentration of seaweed defense metabolites at different spatial and temporal scales.
   Seaweeds have been shown to produce a large variety of secondary metablites with highly variable chemical structures such as terpenoids, acetogenins, amino acid derivates, and polyphenols. Many of these compounds probably have multiple simultaneous functions for the seaweeds and can act as allelopathic, antimicrobial, and antifouling or ultraviolet-screening agents, as well as herbivore deterrents. We also provide examples of interactions between marine benthic invertebrates, especially sponges, molluscs, and cnidarians, that are mediated by specific secondary metabolites and discuss the role of these in shaping benthic communities.

AB Background
   Liver transplantation is an established treatment option for end-stage liver failure. Now that newer, more potent immunosuppressants have been developed, glucocorticosteroids may no longer be needed and their removal may prevent adverse effects.
   Objectives
   To assess the benefits and harms of glucocorticosteroid avoidance (excluding intra-operative use or treatment of acute rejection) or withdrawal versus glucocorticosteroid-containing immunosuppression following liver transplantation.
   Search methods
   We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index -Science, Literatura Americano e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude (LILACS), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials. gov, and The Transplant Library until May 2017.
   Selection criteria
   Randomised clinical trials assessing glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal versus glucocorticosteroid-containing immunosuppression for liver transplanted people. Our inclusion criteria stated that participants should have received the same co-interventions. We included trials that assessed complete glucocorticosteroid avoidance (excluding intra-operative use or treatment of acute rejection) versus short-term glucocorticosteroids, as well as trials that assessed short-term glucocorticosteroids versus long-term glucocorticosteroids.
   Data collection and analysis
   We used RevMan to conduct meta-analyses, calculating risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous variables and mean difference (MD) for continuous variables, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We used a random-effects model and a fixed-effectmodel and reported both results where a discrepancy existed; otherwise we reported only the results from the fixed-effect model. We assessed the risk of systematic errors using ' Risk of bias' domains. We controlled for random errors by performing Trial Sequential Analysis. We presented our results in a ' Summary of findings' table.
   Main results
   We included 17 completed randomised clinical trials, but only 16 studies with 1347 participants provided data for the meta-analyses. Ten of the 16 trials assessed complete postoperative glucocorticosteroid avoidance (excluding intra-operative use or treatment of acute rejection) versus short-term glucocorticosteroids (782 participants) and six trials assessed short-term glucocorticosteroids versus longterm glucocorticosteroids (565 participants). One additional study assessed complete post-operative glucocorticosteroid avoidance but could only be incorporated into qualitative analysis of the results due to limited data published in an abstract. All trials were at high risk of bias. Only eight trials reported on the type of donor used. Overall, we found no statistically significant difference for mortality (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.44; low-quality evidence), graft loss including death (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.46; low-quality evidence), or infection (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05; very low-quality evidence) when glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticosteroid-containing immunosuppression. Acute rejection and glucocorticosteroid-resistant rejection were statistically significantly more frequent when glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticosteroidcontaining immunosuppression (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.64; low-quality evidence; and RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.02; very lowquality evidence). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were statistically significantly less frequent when glucocorticosteroid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticosteroid-containing immunosuppression (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99; low-quality evidence; and RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90; low-quality evidence). We performed Trial Sequential Analysis for all outcomes. None of the outcomes crossed the monitoring boundaries or reached the required information size. Hence, we cannot exclude random errors from the results of the conventional meta-analyses.

AB 1. Cough can (a) be an important defense mechanism to help clear excessive secretions and foreign material from airways; (b) be an important factor in the spread of infection; (c) maintain consciousness during potentially lethal arrhythmias and/or convert arrhythmias to more normal cardiac rhythms; and (d) present as one of the most common symptoms for which patients seek medical attention and spend health-care dollars.
   2. Cough involves a complex reflex are that begins with the stimulation of an irritant receptor. Most receptors are probably located in the respiratory system; the existence of a discrete central cough center has not been demonstrated. Evidence to date suggests that the cough center is diffusely located in the medulla. An effective cough depends on the ability to achieve high gas flows and intrathoracic pressures, enhancing the removal of mucus adhering to the airway wall. Cough ineffectiveness may occur when respiratory muscles are weakened or when the surface adhesive properties of mucus are altered. While a variety of nonpharmacologic protussive treatment modalities may improve cough mechanics, clinical studies documenting improvement in patient morbidity and mortality are lacking.
   3. It is the complications of cough that lead patients to seek medical attention. The most common complications are subjective perceptions of exhaustion and self-consciousness, and symptoms of insomnia, hoarseness, musculoskeletal pain: sweating, and urinary incontinence. The pressures produced during vigorous coughing can cause a variety of complications in nearly all organ systems.
   4. The two categories of cough, are acute, lasting less than 3 weeks, and chronic, lasting 3 to 8 weeks or longer; they are not mutually exclusive (Grade II-2, III-3). Acute cough is most frequently due to the common cold (Grade III). Chronic cough is often simultaneously due to more than one condition (Grade II-2, II-3), but can be the sole clinical manifestation of asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) (Grade II-2). The most common causes of chronic cough in nonsmokers are postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS), asthma, and/or GERD (Grade II-2, II-3), whether or not the cough is described as dry or productive (Grade II-2). PNDS, asthma, and/or GERD are likely to be causes(s) of chronic cough approximately 100% of the time in nonsmokers who are not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) drugs and who have normal or nearly normal chest radiographs showing no more than stable inconsequential scars (Grade II-2).
   5. PNDS, either singly or in combination with other conditions, is the single most common cause of chronic cough for which patients seek medical attention (Grade II-2). The symptoms and signs of PNDS are nonspecific (Grade II-2); therefore, a definitive diagnosis of PNDS-induced cough cannot be made from history and physical examination alone. A favorable response to specific therapy for PNDS, with resolution of cough, is a crucial step in confirming that PNDS is present and is the etiology of cough. The combination of a first-generation antihistamine and a decongestant is considered to be the most consistently effective sole form of therapy in treating most patients with PNDS-induced cough not due to sinusitis (Grade II-2). In most patients, some improvement in cough will be seen within 1 week of initiation of therapy. Newer generation, relatively nonsedating antihistamines have been found ineffective in treating acute cough associated with the common cold (Grade I) and are not as effective as first-generation antihistamines in treating PNDS secondary to nonallergic conditions. The first-generation antihistamines should be used preferentially to treat PNDS-induced cough that is nonhistamine-mediated (Grade I, II-2).
   6. Asthma is a common cause of chronic cough. A diagnosis of cough-variant asthma is suggested by the presence of airway hyperresponsiveness, and confirmed only when the cough resolves with asthma medications. The treatment of cough-variant asthma is the same as for asthma presenting with other symptoms. Inhaled medications prescribed for asthma may worsen the cough.
   7. GERD can cause cough by aspiration, but it most likely causes chronic cough in patients with normal radiographs by a vagally mediated reflex mechanism (Grade II, II-2). When GERD is the cause of chronic cough, GI symptoms are often absent (Grade II-2). Twenty-four-hour esophageal pH monitoring is the most sensitive and specific test For GERD. In interpreting the test, it is important to assess the duration and frequency of reflux episodes, and the temporal relationship between reflux and cough episodes. Patients with normal standard reflux parameters may still have reflux as a cause of cough if a temporal relationship exists (Grade II-2). When 24-h esophageal pH monitoring cannot be done, an empiric trial of antireflux medication is appropriate when GERD is suspected as a cause of cough. However, if empiric treatment fails, GERD cannot be ruled out until objective studies are conducted (Grade III) because the empiric therapy may not have been intensive enough or medical therapy may have failed. Because minimum consistently effective therapy for GERD-induced chronic cough is not known, initial treatment should include diet and lifestyle changes in addition to drugs. Cough due to GERD has been reported to resolve with medical therapy in 70 to 100% of patients; mean time to recovery may take as long as 169 to 179 days (Grade II-2). Antireflux surgery may be considered after intensive medical therapy has been documented to have failed.
   8. Cough is a principal feature of chronic bronchitis (CB) and its treatment should chiefly be directed to reduction of sputum production and airway inflammation (eg, by smoking cessation and removal of environmental irritants) (Grade II-2). While CB is among tie most frequent causes of chronic cough in the community, it is the cause in only about 5% in series of patients who Seek medical attention for cough. Ipratropium can decrease sputum production and cough (Grade I). Nonspecific cough suppressants should be avoided, and mucolytics are of uncertain benefit. Although the effectiveness systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics on cough have not been specifically studied, they are likely to be helpful in decreasing cough during exacerbations of COPD (Grade III).
   9. Bronchiectasis is a cause of chronic cough in a relatively small number of patients: the diagnosis is established by clinical history, chest radiograph, high-resolution CT scan of the thorax, and cough disappearance with specific therapy. Cough associated with flares of the disease can be treated with a combination of chest physiotherapy, drugs to stimulate mucociliary clearance, and systemic antibiotics (Grade II-2). Inhaled antibiotics are recommended only in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with bronchiectasis (Grade I).
   10. Postinfectious cough is a diagnosis of exclusion; it should be considered when a patient complains only of cough after a respiratory tract infection and has normal chest radiograph. Postinfectious cough ultimately resolves over time; oral corticosteroids (Grade II-3), inhaled corticosteroids (Grade III), or ipratropium bromide (Grade II may attenuate the cough.
   11. Coughs that develop for the first time and last for months in susceptible groups are suggestive of bronchogenic cat-cinema. Bronchogenic carcinoma is not a common cause of chronic cough (Grade II-2), and is very unlikely in never-smokers (Grade II-2). Present or prior cigarette smoking or occupational exposures increase the risk. Chest radiographs, sputum cytology, and flexible bronchoscopy are the most important initial tests for evaluating bronchogenic carcinoma as a cause of chronic cough.
   12. Cough due to ACEIs is a class effect of these drugs and is not dose-related. The cough is typically nonproductive and is associated with an irritating, tickling, or scratchy sensation in the throat. ACEI-induced cough may appear hours to weeks or months after ACEI is started (Grade Iii. Because no laboratory test predicts who will have ACEI-induced cough, the diagnosis should be considered in any patient who has a cough while taking an ACEI (Grade IIII. Cough due to ACEIs will disappear or substantially improve within 4 weeks of discontinuing the drug (Grade I); definitive treatment of ACEI-induced cough is discontinuation of the drug.
   13. Habit cough and psychogenic cough are diagnoses of exclusion (Grade III). The character of the cough (eg; honking or barking) is not diagnostically helpful in adults (Grade II-2). However, the pediatric literature suggests that honking and barking coughs are consistent with psychogenic cough (Grade III). After exclusion of other causes, psychological counseling and short-term antitussive therapy may be appropriate for psychogenic cough (Grade III).
   14. Chronic interstitial pulmonary disease is an uncommon cause of cough; treatment of such cough is based on treatment of the underlying condition. If this treatment fails to resolve the cough, the cough may still be treatable with specific therapy for other comet-bid conditions. The most common causes of chronic cough should be investigated before antitussives are prescribed (Grade III).
   15. In children, asthma, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and GERD are the most common causes of acute and chronic cough. Less common causes of cough in children are congenital anomalies, aspiration and environmental exposures. The approach to managing chronic cough in children is similar to the approach in adults (Grade III). Diagnostic testing may be limited because many children are unable to cooperate in testing, and positive tests do not necessarily establish diagnosis or predict a favorable response to specific therapy (Grade III). A chest radiograph should be obtained in nearly all children with chronic cough to rule out lower respiratory tract and cardiac pathology (Grade III). A sweat test for CF may be considered when no clear etiology for cough is established. The recommended diagnostic approach to cough in children is history, physical examination, and determination of a most likely etiology (Grade III).
   16. The cause of chronic cough can be determined in most patients; specific therapy will be successful in the majority of patients when chronic cough is evaluated in a systematic manner. Guidelines and algorithms for evaluating acute and chronic cough in immunocompetent and immunocompromised adults, and children, with diagnostic caveats, are presented in the body of this report.
   17. Pharmacologic treatment of cough is either (a) antitussive, to prevent, control, or eliminate cough, or (b) protussive, to make cough more effective. Antitussive therapy is indicated when cough serves no useful function such as clearing the airways. Specific antitussive therapy is directed at the etiology or mechanism causing cough leg, cigarette smoking, postnasal drip). Nonspecific antitussive therapy is directed at the symptom rather than the etiology or mechanism. Because of the high probability of being able to determine the causes of cough and prescribe specific treatment that can be successful, there is a limited role for nonspecific antitussive treatment (Grade II-2, II-3). It is indicated (Grade III) when specific therapy has not had a chance to work or will not work leg, inoperable lung cancer). Protussive therapy is indicated when cough performs a useful function and needs to be encouraged leg, in bronchiectasis, CF). Although hypertonic saline, amiloride, and terbutaline by aerosol following chest physiotherapy have been shown to increase cough clearance (Grade I), or cough clearability in the case of amiloride, their clinical utility remains to be determined in future studies that assess short-term and long-term effects of these agents on the patient's condition. Hypertonic saline in CF appears promising.
