TI EFFECT OF ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKADE ON THERMOREGULATION IN ADRENAL
   DEMEDULLATED BURNED RATS
SO BURNS
LA English
DT Article
AB This study in burned rats studied at two ambient temperatures (22 degrees and 28 degrees C) and housed at 28 degrees C was designed to investigate the role of catecholamines in the maintenance of thermal homeostasis following burn injury. Two weeks prior to burn or sham burn, animals underwent adrenal medullectomy or sham adrenal medullectomy. Between postburn days 9 and 13, simultaneous direct and indirect calorimetry was performed following administration of 2mg/kg of phentolamine (alpha adrenergic blacking agent) via a carotid arterial line. Following administration of phentolamine, heat production and body temperature decreased and heat loss increased immediately. The cooling slopes for the ham groups were significantly steeper than far the control groups, within ambient temperatures. Within ambient temper atures, the presence or absence of the adrenal medulla had no discernible effect on the cooling slope of the bums or the controls. The burned animals cooled 1.9-3.5 times faster at 22 degrees than at 28 degrees C, and controls cooled 2.0-3.9 times faster at 22 degrees than at 28 degrees C. Phentolnmine produced a several-fold increase in serum concentrations of both norephinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), indicating a gross overlap in alpha and beta adrenergic receptor utilization for E and NE, The progressive cooling of the adrenal demedullated burn group at 22 degrees C following phentolamine administration seems to indicate that norepinephrine is calorigenic for rats under these experimental circumstances. These experimental results indicate a relatively non-essential role for catecholamines in the maintenance of thermal homeostasis within the thermal neutral zone in the rat.

TI PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION OF LEPROSY IN CHILDREN
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
AB India with its 4 million cases of leprosy, accounts for one-third of the world's population of leprosy patients. One-fourth of them are below 15 years of age.
   We report a 5-year follow-up study of healthy children who were close contacts of leprosy patients, in order to:
   1. detect subclinical infection and observe the development of overt disease by using the Fluorescent Leprosy Antibody Absorption Technique (FLA-ABS) and the lepromin test which assess the humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI), respectively;
   2. evaluate the efficacy of dapsone as a chemoprophylactic agent in the 'at risk' contacts.
   Four-hundred-and-fifty-five healthy contacts were studied. Majority of the contacts of multibacillary patients (303) were FLA-ABS positive (75 per cent) and lepromin negative (55 per cent) showing that although most of them had been infected, the lepromin status was negative (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the majority of the contacts of paucibacillary patients (152) were lepromin positive (57 per cent) (P< 0.05). Furthermore, only 61 per cent of contacts of paucibacillary patients were FLA-ABS positive as compared to 75 per cent of contacts of multibacillary patients demonstrating that the former had been exposed to a lesser quantum of infection (P < 0.05).
   On the basis of results of FLA-ABS and lepromin tests, these 455 contacts were classified into four groups, viz. Group I comprising children who were FLA-ABS positive and lepromin positive; Group II, who were FLA-ABS positive and lepromin negative; Group III, who were FLA-ABS negative and lepromin positive; and Group IV who were FLA-ABS negative and lepromin negative. During the followup period of 5 years, only two out of 155 children in Group I developed the disease showing that their good CMI had been able to contain the disease.
   Out of 166 contacts in Group II, 18 developed the disease mainly of the tuberculoid type. Most of these children were contacts of multibacillary patients. None of the children in Groups III and TV developed the disease. These findings were statistically significant (P<0.01). Out of the 166 children in Group II (the 'at risk' group), 70 were treated as controls while 96 were put on prophylaxis with dapsone which was continued ford years after the contact with the source patient had ceased, or for 3 years after the source patient became non-infective. The incidence of disease was significantly lower among children who received chemoprophylaxis (P<0.05). Among controls the incidence rate of the disease was higher in (i) contacts below 5 years of age, (ii) males, and (iii) contacts of bacteriologically positive patients (P<0.05). These contacts were labelled as the 'high risk' group.
   The efficacy rate of Dapsone prophylaxis was significantly better in:
   1. contacts below 5 years of age as compared to older contacts (P < 0.01) mainly because the latter were in late stages of incubation and also because there exists a lag period after which dapsone becomes effective as a prophylactic agent;
   2. males as compared to females, possibly because of better drug compliance by the former (P<0.05);
   3. contacts of bacteriologically positive patients (P<0.05) indicating that contacts of bacteriologically negative patients had been infected earlier when their source patients were bacteriologically positive and were, therefore now in an advanced stage of incubation where prophylaxis was less effective;
   4. contacts whose source patients were under treatment as compared to those contacts whose source patients were not receiving treatment, stressing the need for simultaneous treatment of active source patients.
   Our study demonstrates the value of the FLA-ABS and lepromin tests in detecting sub-clinical infection and for identifying the 'at risk' contacts of leprosy patients. It clearly establishes the chemoprophylactic value of Dapsone for the 'at risk' contacts, particularly for those in the 'high risk' category. In pursuance of our Government's policies under the National Leprosy Eradication programme, this study suggests the need to carry out surveillance surveys in the endemic population to identify, follow, and offer chemoprophylaxis to those at risk.

AB Cancers and precancerous lesions of the esophagus were efficiently induced in rats by the simulation of a clinicoepidemiological setting; that is, the administration of precursors of nitrosamine. Six week old non-inbred male Wistar rats were given 2g/kg bodyweight of sarcosine ethyl ester hydrochloride (SEEH) and concurrently 0.3g/kg bodyweight of sodium nitrite (NaNO2), precursors of N-nitrososarcosine ethyl ester (NSEE), in 2% sucrose as drinking water, Group 1 received the precursors twice a week for 6 weeks followed by 8 weeks observation, and group 2, once every 3 days for 7 weeks followed by 26 weeks observation. At the end of treatment, no tumor had developed in the esophagus of rats in group 1, but the [H-3]-thymidine labeling indices in both basal and superficial layer cells were higher than in the control group. On subsequent observation, papillomas appeared in group 1 (33.3%), and carcinomas in group 2 (33.3%), within 4 weeks. The tumors induced in group 1 were mostly papillomas and rarely carcinomas. When the observation was prolonged in group 2, 100% of the animals had cancer in week 20. The pathological changes of the lesions paralleled the sequential development of human squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Our system has the advantages in that papillomas and cancers can be induced in rats in a short time and the agents used are less toxic than preformed nitrosamines administered previously by gastric intubation. It would serve as a useful experimental tool to study premalignant lesions and cancers of the esophagus.

AB Excited-state proton transfers have been investigated for several isomeric and homologous N-((dimethylamino)alkyl)-9-aminoacridine carboxamides in a time-correlated single photon counting fluorescence study. The pH behavior of these DNA intercalators' steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectra has also been investigated. While the excited-state pK(a)* for removal of a proton from the singly protonated species is close to the ground-state pK(a) in the parent molecule 9-aminoacridine, the presence of the carboxamide substituent renders pK(a)* much lower than pK(a) for the corresponding deprotonation in the present compounds. This fact, along with the presence of an additional deprotonation site at the distal N atom of the side chain, endows these molecules with complex pH dependence in their excited-state kinetics. Triexponential model functions are generally required to fit the experimental fluorescence decays, The pH dependence of the component lifetimes and preexponential factors can be simulated with a kinetic model for sequential deprotonations involving four aminoacridine species in both the ground and fluorescing states. These results provide a baseline study for comparisons with these intercalators' excited-state kinetics in DNA.

AB Green turtle fibropapillomatosis (GTFP), characterized by multiple benign fibroepithelial tumors on the skin and eyes, has become a growing threat to green turtle Chelonia mydas populations worldwide. The cause of GTFP is unknown, but a viral etiology is suspected. This study investigated whether GTFP could be experimentally transmitted to young captive-reared green turtles using cell-free fibropapilloma extracts prepared from free-ranging turtles with spontaneous disease. Turtles raised from eggs collected from 4 separate clutches in the wild were assigned to 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. For each experiment a crude homogenate (33% w/v) was prepared from fibropapillomas removed from a free-ranging turtle with spontaneous disease. The crude tumor homogenates were freeze-thawed and centrifuged to yield cell-free extracts that were used (both filtered and unaltered) for inoculation. Recipients were inoculated by intradermal injection or by scarification; control turtles were not treated but were housed with treated turtles. Fibropapillomas developed in all 12 turtles receiving 3 of the 4 tumor extracts, and were first detected between 15 and 43 wk post inoculation. Both filtered and unfiltered tumor extracts successfully induced tumor development. During the 10 and 12 mo monitoring periods, fibropapillomas did not develop in control turtles or in any turtles inoculated with the fourth tumor extract. Although 2 sets of experiments were performed 8 wk apart, most of the tumors in both sets became evident simultaneously after water temperatures rose. Experimental tumors were histologically indistinguishable from spontaneous fibropapillomas found in free-living turtles but lacked evidence of endoparasites. Scattered foci of epidermal degeneration were found in most sections of experimentally induced fibropapillomas and within some sections taken from donor turtles. Electron microscopy revealed virus-like particles conforming in size, morphology, and intranuclear location with herpesvirus. Negative-staining electron microscopy of transmission-positive tumor extracts failed to demonstrate intact virus particles. This study demonstrates that the etiology of GTFP is an infectious filterable subcellular agent. The herpesvirus identified in this study is 1 possible candidate for the etiology of GTFP.

AB Despite success in theory formulation and prediction of quantities and patterns in nature, traditional modeling approaches have not proven particularly valuable as ''surrogate experimental systems'' in applied ecology. Theoretical models, while useful as embodiments of ecological theory, are too simplistic to be effective surrogate systems. Although simulation models can represent systems of realistic complexity, they are limited by factors which arise from the way in which they are built. We propose an alternative paradigm for modeling biotic systems which promises to enhance their usefulness as surrogate experimental systems. This paradigm is based on the premise that dynamic behavior in biotic systems emerges from the low-level interactions of independent agents. It forms the basis for the new field of artificial life (ALife), which involves the study of life-like behavior in artificial systems. In an ALife model, the target biological system is modeled as a population of independent computer programs called machines. The complete behavioral repertoire of each individual, including its interaction with others, is specified within the entity itself. A spatially-referenced ''environment'' is provided within which the machines interact with each other and their local environment. There is no overall controlling program or agent. Thus, the overall behavior of the system emerges from local interactions between independent agents. In this paper, we examine the premises upon which ALife is based (including the concept of emergence) and discuss several examples of ALife models at ecological scales, which we call ''artifical ecosystems''. We next introduce LAGER, an environment for producing and running artificial ecosystems. Finally, we present PARE, a host/parasitoid dynamics model built in LAGER, and compare its behavior to two similar systems in the literature.

ID DECISION; AGENCY
AB This study was an examination of how the preferences of a negotiator are formed in bargaining situations in which an individual represents a group of individuals.  The experiment used a policy-capturing approach within the context of a collective bargaining simulation.  The literature on industrial relations, principal-agent relations, managerial intravention, and frustration-regression mechanisms was used to construct the simulation.  These procedures also enabled a test of the voice mechanism that is hypothesized for unions.  The importance of a bargaining issue to a union negotiator was determined by the following four cues (in decreasing order of importance):  member preferences, management's capacity to concede the demands, the national union's support, and management's resistance to the issue.  Results indicated support for the voice mechanism.  Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB Recently, a cyclic heptapeptide with cytostatic activity was isolated from marine sources by three different groups independently. The sequence of the isolated peptide was ambiguous, since two different isomers have been proposed: cycle(-Asn(1)-Pro(2)-Phe(3)-Val(4)-Val(5)-Pro(6)-Val(7)-) (1) also called axinastatin 1 resp. pseudooxinellin and cyclo(-Asn(1#)-Pro(2#)-Pro(3#)-Phe(4#)-Val(5#)-Val(6#)-Val(7#)-) (2) called malaysiatin. We synthesized both peptides 1 and 2 and compared their optical rotation, FAB-MS, H-1- and C-13-NMR data with those of the native compounds. Our results prove that peptide 1 has been assigned correctly, whereas the data of 2 differ significantly from those of the natural peptide. Peptide 1 adopts two conformations (90:10 ratio) in DMSO, interconverting slowly on the NMR time scale. According to MD simulations, using NOEs and J couplings as experimental restraints, a beta VIa-turn with a cis peptide bond between Val(5)-Pro(6) and a beta I-turn in the Asn(1)-Val(4) region are the characteristic secondary structural elements of the major conformer. Its backbone conformation is very similar to the X-ray structure of a related peptide cycle(-Asn(a)-Leu(b)-Ser(c)-Phe(d)-Leu(e)-Pro(f)-Val(g)-) called evolidine.

AB Six complexones have been investigated as on-column derivatizing agents for the simultaneous separation of inorganic anions and cations using ion pair chromatography. UV spectrophotometry at 210 nm has been applied for both the direct and the indirect detection of anions and anionic metal complexes. Under the experimental conditions used DCTA and DTPA have been practically applicable. Factors affecting the chromatographic behaviour of analyte ions have been studied. Chloride, nitrite, nitrate sulphate, chromate, molybdate, iron, chromium (III), copper (II), cobalt (II), nickel(II) and mercury (II) ions have been separated in 30 min with a mobile phase containing 1 mmol/l TBA and 0.5 mmol/l DCTA at pH 6.2 in acetonitrile-water (10:90 v/v). With DTPA as eluent and using pre-column derivatization of metal cations with DCTA eight anions and six metal cations can be separated. The detection limits are less than 0.1 mg/l for most of the investigated ions.

TI UNDERSTANDING DUAL DISTRIBUTION - THE CASE OF REPS AND HOUSE ACCOUNTS
SO JOURNAL OF LAW ECONOMICS & ORGANIZATION
LA English
DT Article
ID PRICE; TRUST; FORM
AB Plural distribution systems are often found in industrial markets.  Although transaction cost analysis has been successfully applied to understanding decisions about distribution systems, these plural forms have been virtually ignored in extant empirical work.  Critics suggest that extant transaction cost models are inadequate to study these systems.  We contend that transaction cost reasoning can be readily applied to understanding these systems, and undertake an analysis of a common plural form, namely, the simultaneous use of an independent rep system with a company-operated, ''house account'' system.  Familiar transaction cost problems like lock-in (the safeguarding problem), and difficulties in evaluating an independent rep's performance (the behavioral uncertainty problem) are posited to lead firms to deploying house accounts to augment an independent rep system.  Using data from a survey of independent agents, we provide preliminary evidence for these predictions.  We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.

DE COLLABORATION; COMMUNICATION; SIMULATION
AB A theory of communication between autonomous agents should make testable predictions about which communicative behaviors are collaborative, and provide a framework for determining the features of a communicative situation that affect whether a behavior is collaborative. The results presented here are derived from a two-phase empirical method. First, we analyze a corpus of naturally occurring problem-solving dialogues in order to identify potentially collaborative communicative strategies. Second, we experimentally test hypotheses that arise from the corpus analysis in Design-World, an experimental environment for simulating dialogues. The results indicate that collaborative behaviors must be defined relative to the cognitive limitations of the agents and the cognitive demands of the task. The method of computational simulation provides an additional empirical basis for theories of human-computer collaboration.

AB Simultaneous interpenetrating polymer networks (SIN) based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) and unsaturated polyester (UP) in weight ratios of 100/0, 50/50, and 0/100 were blended and cured simultaneously by using cumene hydroperoxide (CHP) and m-xylenediamine (MXDA) as curing agents. A kinetic study during SIN formation was carried out at 43, 53, 58, and 64 degrees C. Concentration changes for both epoxide and C=C bond were monitored with Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). Rate expressions for epoxide polymerization were established with model reactions for phenyl glycidyl ether (PGE) and benzylamine in dichloroethane containing benzyl alcohol. Experimental results revealed that a lower cure rate constant for the C=C bond during SIN formation was found, compared with pure UP network formation. A model of network interlock is proposed to account for this phenomenon. During simultaneous cure of DGEBA and UP, the network interlock should provide a sterically hindered environment, which subsequently retards cure rate for UP. On the other hand, epoxide cure during SIN formation indicates higher rate constants for both uncatalyzed and catalyzed reactions, compared with those of pure DGEBA cure. Presumably the catalytic effect of hydroxyl end groups in UP overcomes the effect of network interlock. Kinetic parameters were calculated and are discussed. (C) 1995 John Wiley and Sons, Inc.

AB Objective: To determine whether arginine supplementation affects tumor growth or metastases in well-fed and starved mice using a squamous cell carcinoma VII tumor model.
   Design: Prospective study in a murine model.
   Interventions: Simulation of the cachectic state often seen in patients with head and neck cancer, induction of squamous cell carcinoma, and administration of standard and arginine-supplemented diet.
   Main Outcome Measures: Effect of arginine supple-mentation on tumor growth, metastases, and host weight gain.
   Results: Tumor weight was significantly decreased in those animals receiving 5% arginine supplementation. The rate of metastases was lower in animals receiving arginine, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. All groups receiving supplemental arginine experienced weight loss, which contradicts the findings that arginine as an anabolic agent may not be present in cancer bearing hosts.

AB A reproducible experimental model of intraabdominal infections in rats has been devised in order to simulate intraabdominal infections in patients. The experimental model was used to compare the efficacy of biapenem with imipenem. Three groups of animals were used, each group consisting of 20 animals. Antibacterial agents were given by injection initially 1 h after surgery and then at 12 h intervals for 12 days. The drugs and amounts of agents given per dose were biapenem 10 mg and imipenem 10 mg, respectively. The control group received 0.9% sterile saline. 80% of the untreated animals died within 3 days. Animals treated with biapenem or imipenem had a significantly decreased mortality and increased cure rates during the experimental period. Only two animals in the two treatment groups died. Biapenem seems to be useful in the treatment of intraabdominal infections.

AB Opioid peptides can be converted by tyrosinase into melanin-like compounds, in which the peptide moiety is retained. Such pigments, named opio-melanins, exhibit a characteristic absorption spectrum with a maximum at about 330 nm and a different solubility behaviour with respect to dopa-melanin, being completely soluble in hydrophylic solvents at neutral and basic pH. Opio-melanins precipitate in aqueous solutions below pH 5.0, and show apparent pK(a) values of 3.1, 3.6 and 4.4 for Tyr-Gly-melanin, Tyr-Gly-Gly-melanin and leuenk-melanin, respectively. The concomitant oxidation of dopa and opioid peptides by tyrosinase produces mixed polymers, showing the distinctive absorption peak at 330 nm. In the dark, in the pH range 5.5-7.0 the pigments are completely stable, whereas H2O2 addition provokes a slight degradation. At higher pH values or under simulated solar illumination with or without hydrogen peroxide, bleaching occurs more rapidly than in dopa-melanin. Upon photoirradiation the absorption spectrum of opio-melanins undergoes a marked variation, the peak at 330 nm being replaced by a broad shoulder in the range 280-350 nm. The absorption spectra of native and bleached pigments and the extent of opio-melanins degradation by bleaching agents, confirm the hypothesis that the different initial structure of the precursors accounts for a final diverse polymeric architecture of these pigments with respect to dopa-melanin.

AB To assess the usefulness of Dy-DTPA-BMA-induced signal reduction, as an indicator of myocar dial viability, myocardial infarction was induced in 17 domestic pigs by ligating a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 6 pigs, Dy-DTPA-BMA (1 mmol/kg b.w.) was administered 3 hours after induction of ischaemia. In 5 additional pigs, Gd-DTPA-BMA (0.3 mmol/kg b.w.) and Dy-DTPA-BMA (1 mmol/kg b.w.) were simultaneously injected after 4 hours of ischaemia to ascertain whether Dy-DTPA-BMA counteracted the signal enhancement effect of Gd DTPA-BMA. A further 6 pigs with infarctions, not administered contrast medium, served as controls. All pigs were sacrificed after 6 hours of ischaemia, and the extirpated hearts were investigated with MR (ex vivo). The concentrations of Dy and Gd were determined in tissue samples from infarcted and non-ischaemic myocardium. The extracellular concentrations of both contrast media were monitored over time during 2 hours in the double-contrast group (in vivo), using a microdialysis technique and analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
   The infarctions demonstrated a high SI in the proton density- and T2-weighted sequences, in both the Dy-DTPA-BMA and control groups, although the former group demonstrated a 3-fold greater concentration of Dy in infarcted compared with non-ischaemic myocardium. Dy-DTPA-BMA did not counteract the Gd-DTPA-BMA-induced enhancement of the infarcted tissue despite a 3-fold higher concentration. This lack of detectable susceptibility effects of Dy may be caused by a loss of cell membrane integrity in the infarcts, resulting in a homogeneous intra- and extracellular distribution of the contrast agent. This hypothesis of an expanded volume of distribution in infarcted tissue was further supported by the microdialysis data, demonstrating a similar extracellular concentration of contrast agents in infarcted and non-ischaemic myocardium, despite a proven 3-fold greater concentration in infarcted tissue samples.
   To investigate whether Gd-DTPA-BMA-enhanced MR imaging (ex vivo) permits differentiation between reperfused and non-reperfused myocardial infarction, and whether Dy-DTPA-BMA-enhanced MR imaging enables a differentiation between reversible and irreversible myocardial injury following reperfusion, myocardial infarction was induced in 24 domestic pigs (divided into 4 groups) by placing a patched ligature around a diagonal branch of the LAD. Four additional hearts were reperfused after 2 min of brief occlusion, not long enough to cause irreversible injury. Myocardial infarction was also induced in 12 pigs to ascertain whether a double-contrast method, combining a positive and a negative MR contrast agent, could improve the visualization of reperfused myocardial infarctions, compared with a single-contrast technique using Gd-DTPA-BMA alone. Radiolabelled microspheres were used to confirm ischaemia and to verify reperfusion in infarcted myocardium. The concentrations of Dy and Gd in tissue samples from infarcted, reversibly injured and non-ischaemic myocardium were determined by ICP-AES.
   The reperfused infarctions were strongly enhanced in the T1-weighted images, corresponding to a 5-fold higher Gd concentration compared with non-ischaemic myocardium. Hearts subjected to occlusion without reperfusion demonstrated only a peripheral rim enhancement of the infarctions, while the central parts demonstrated a SI and Gd content similar to that of non-ischaemic myocardium.
   In the proton density- and T2-weighted sequences, reperfused, infarcted myocardium demonstrated a high SI despite a 5-fold higher Dy-concentration compared with both non-reperfused infarcted and non-ischaemic myocardium. Reversibly injured myocardium could not be distinguished from adjacent non-ischaemic myocardium, probably due to a preserved cell membrane integrity, preventing Dy-DTPA-BMA from entering the cells. Dy-DTPA-BMA-induced signal reduction may thus serve as an indicator of myocardial viability.
   The double-contrast technique, whereby Dy-DTPA-BMA was injected in addition to Gd-DTPA-BMA, yielded a superior infarct visualization in the T2-weighted sequences, compared with the single-contrast technique using Gd-DTPA-BMA alone. This improvement of infarct visualization could be attributed to Dy-induced loss of SI, due to susceptibility effect in non-ischaemic myocardium. The double-contrast technique thus resulted in an excellent infarct visualization in both T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

AB The release behavior of typical commercial tissue expanders has been examined by carrying out two kinds of experiments: 1) Determination of chemical nature and its modification after in vivo use by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. This study has been parallelled by scanning electron microscopy with associated energy dispersive X-ray analysis of surface, as well as by silicon compounds analysis of tissues around implants. 2) Kinetic examination of silicon compounds released by the biomaterial in physiologic solution at 36 +/- 0.3 degrees C. Results of these investigations have shown independently that the starting material was not a filler-free, pure polymer, but a composite, reinforced elastomer, with the reinforcing agent most seemingly represented by silicon dioxide. Release of latter, with a relatively fast kinetics, is compatible with data of the simulating laboratory runs in the physiologic solution. All these facts seem to rule out any hypothesis of a prevailing siloxane oligomer migration. The correlation of kinetic and physicochemical tests with the in vivo behavior is discussed.

TI DEPNET: How to benefit from social dependence
SO JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper, two different views of sociality, one based upon interferences, and the other based upon complementarity, or interdependence, are confronted. The latter is shown to present a number of theoretical advantages over the former, allowing for an account of different types of social actions-influencing, exchange, cooperation-and of how these emerge from structural social conditions. A formal model of dependence relations is presented, and an algorithm for calculating the dependence networks and situations in a multi-agent context is briefly shown. A simulator of dependence relations, which edits a set of agents (in terms of their goals, actions, and plans) and applies the algorithm to calculate their dependence relations relative to any given goal, is described, and its applications are discussed. Some elementary simulations are exemplified in order to illustrate the experimental application of the simulator in a two-agent context. Future expansions of the simulator are finally discussed.

AB Plasma oxytocin (OT) levels are strongly correlated with inhibition of ingestion in many models of stimulated food and NaCl intake in rats, but peripheral administration of OT or OT antagonists has little or no effect on these behaviors. These findings led us to propose that central OT secretion from parvocellular neurons occurring in parallel with pituitary secretion from magnocellular neurons acts to inhibit ingestion of both food and salt. Multiple lines of evidence now support this hypothesis: 1) intracerebroventricular (icv) OT administration inhibits food intake in fasted rats and NaCl intake in hypovolemic rats; 2) icv administration of OT-receptor antagonists significantly blunts the effects of anorexigenic agents on food intake and the action of naloxone to inhibit hypovolemia-induced intake of NaCl, but not water; 3) most treatments that inhibit food and/or NaCl intake stimulate expression of c-fos in parvocellular as well as magnocellular OT neurons, indicating simultaneous activation of both centrally-projecting and pituitary-projecting OT neurons; 4) icv treatment with cytotoxic conjugates of ricin A and OT to disable cells bearing OT receptors leads to a disinhibition of NaCl intake similar to that produced by OT antagonists; 5) administration of ethanol, a well known inhibitor of OT secretion, produces effects on stimulated food and NaCl intake in rats analogous to those produced by OT-antagonists and ricin-OT conjugates. In conjunction with studies demonstrating natriuretic effects of circulating OT, these results therefore support the concept of coordinated central and peripheral OT secretion as a mechanism for regulating body solute homeostasis in rats. These phenomena will be used as a framework to discuss and critically evaluate the criteria that are both necessary and sufficient to firmly establish behavioral and physiological functions of centrally-secreted peptides such as OT.

DT Article
AB In order to make clear the role of zinc (Zn) ions in the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) the investigations of rats with the compression model of TN as well as on false operated animals were carried out. In 1.5 months after the intraorbital nerve compression the increase of Zn concentration in caudal trigeminal nucleus and (to a less degree) in hyppocampus as well as behavioural and pathophysiological pain correlates were revealed. The exogenous Zn introduction led to an increase of its level in these structures simultaneously with the exacerbation of all sings of the TN syndrome. The addition of chelating agents Xydiphone which bound bivalent cations in soft tissues, into drinking water, normalized the Zn content in rats brain and reduced the pathological symptoms. The use of Xydiphone in the complex therapy of 25 patients with the TN tolerant to carbamazepine reduced the pain syndrome in 15 cases. thus the local changes of Zn level in the CNS may play a certain role in the manifestation of the TN pain syndrome.

AB 19-Nortestosterone (19-NT) is one of the mostly recurrent anabolic agents on the black market of illicit drugs. Dexamethasone (DEXA) is licensed for therapy in veterinary practice but its misuse, although often suspected, has seldom been demonstrated. The excretion of 19-NT and DEXA is well documented when the compounds are administered independently but poor information is available in literature for instances when both drugs are administered as a mixture. To evaluate a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for anabolic residues in urine, blood and faeces, the effect of the simultaneous administration and the subsequent elimination of the two drugs, two animals were injected (4 times) with 19-NT and another two (4 times) with 19-NT-DEXA. After preparation and a sequential clean-up on C-18 and alumina columns, the samples were analysed by means of a specific 19-NT radioimmunoassay kit and an anti-DEXA antibody. Detection limits for both drugs were 0.5 ppb in blood samples and 2.0 ppb in urine and faecal samples. After the final treatment, positive 19-NT results were recorded at 14 and 21 d in urine and faecal samples, respectively. In the same matrices, positive DEXA values were found at 11 and 28 d, respectively. Urinary excretion was the main metabolic path both for 19-NT and DEXA; only 30% of the residues were excreted via the faeces. The simultaneous injection of DEXA and 19-NT increased the urinary excretion of 19-NT; however, the excretion of 19-NT via faecal matter was similar for both groups.

TI ROBOT SHAPING - DEVELOPING AUTONOMOUS AGENTS THROUGH LEARNING
SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID ALGORITHMS; SYSTEMS
AB Learning plays a vital role in the development of autonomous agents.  In this paper, we explore the use of reinforcement learning to ''shape'' a robot to perform a predefined target behavior.  We connect both simulated and real robots to Alecsys, a parallel implementation of a learning classifier system with an extended genetic algorithm.  After classifying different kinds of Animat-like behaviors, we explore the effects on learning of different types of agent's architecture and training strategies.  We show that the best results are achieved when both the agent's architecture and the training strategy match the structure of the behavior pattern to be learned.  We report the results of a number of experiments carried out both in simulated and in real environments, and show that the results of simulations carry smoothly to physical robots.  While most of our experiments deal with simple reactive behavior, in one of them we demonstrate the use of a simple and general memory mechanism.  As a whole, our experimental activity demonstrates that classifier systems with genetic algorithms can be practically employed to develop autonomous agents.

AB Effects of plant-host type, either wheat, Triticum aestivum L., or oat, Avena sativa L., and the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, on numerical and spatial distributions of Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia Kurdyumov, populations were investigated. Untreated adult aphids or aphids inoculated with conidial suspensions of the pathogen were released onto the center seedlings of an 81-seedling grid in a cage. After 17 d, the numbers of live adults, live nymphs, and sporulating cadavers were recorded for each plant, along with plant height and dry weight. Aphid populations were consistently lower on oat than on wheat, and lower in B, bassiana treatments. Spatial statistics (geostatistics) were used to compare patterns of aphid distribution on plants. On wheat without the pathogen present, adult aphid populations were highest in approximately concentric rings near the outermost plants in grids. Addition of B, bassiana to the system reduced the amount of variation caused by spatial orientation, thereby changing the spatial distribution of aphid populations. On oat, aphid populations generally were highest near the center of the grid, but addition of the pathogen changed the spatial structure of the aphid population. Results suggest that aphid movement behavior, which is intimately linked to host-plant quality, is an important determinant of epizootic proliferation. Elucidation of these relationships may eventually lead to a synergistic use of microbial control agents and host-plant resistance in pest management strategies.

AB The frequencies of chromosome aberrations, SCEs and micronuclei (cytokinesis-block method) in blood lymphocytes were compared among six nonsmoking female pharmacists before and after 1 year of working with cytostatic drugs. All possible precautions were taken to avoid exposure to cytostatics, including proper protective clothing and a monitored, negative-pressured working environment with vertical laminar flow cabinet. As referents, an age-matched group of six nonsmoking female hospital workers not dealing with cytostatics was simultaneously sampled twice with the same time interval. The pharmacists showed a marginally higher mean frequency of SCEs/cell (6.3; P = 0.049) after the working period than 1 year earlier (5.8). On the other hand, the referents, with no obvious exposure, had a higher mean number of cells with chromatid-type aberrations, gaps excluded, in the second sampling (2.0%; P=0.048) than in the first one (0.5%). In addition, a slight (P=0.055) trend towards a higher frequency of micronucleated binucleate cells was observed in the second sampling for both the exposed and control subjects. As such findings suggest technical variation in the cytogenetic parameters, the small difference observed in SCEs for the pharmacists between the two samplings was probably not related to the cytostatics exposure. No statistically significant differences were observed for any of the cytogenetic parameters in comparisons between the pharmacists and the referents. The findings suggest that caution should be exercised in comparing results obtained from two different samplings in prospective cytogenetic studies.

AB Simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) results in short-latency thirst and sodium appetite (i.e., the rapid ingestion of water and NaCl solution). To elucidate potential mechanisms for mediating this behavior, changes in plasma levels of key hormones involved in fluid intake and balance were characterized in rats subjected to this treatment protocol. Rats treated jointly with furosemide and low-dose captopril had exaggerated increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I but equivalent increases in plasma aldosterone compared with rats treated with either agent alone. Treatment with furosemide plus low-dose captopril increased plasma vasopressin but not plasma oxytocin. The administration of a higher dose of captopril (100 mg/kg) with furosemide, a combination of drugs that does not stimulate fluid intake (29), further increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I but prevented the rise in plasma vasopressin. The results support the hypothesis that thirst and salt appetite generated by this protocol depend on angiotensin II formed within brain circumventricular organs rather than the systemic circulation.

AB The following study was performed to delineate the possible differences in the onset, recovery and ''train of four'' (TOF) fade characteristics of pancuronium (Pan) and pipecuronium (Pip). Eighty adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I and II surgical patients were studied with institutional approval. After premedication, general anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium i.v. followed by N-2/O-2 halothane and fentanyl. The lungs were ventilated. Normocarbia and normothermia were maintained. Two groups of 40 patients received pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) or pipecuronium (0.07 mg/g i.v.). Neuromuscular block (NMB) was measured simultaneously by mechanomyography (MMG) and electromyographically (EMG) on the thumb adductor muscle. Supramaximal (TOF) stimuli were applied to the ulnar nerve every 20 seconds. The onset of neuromuscular blocking action, duration of action (to 25% recovery of twitch response), TOF fade during onset and up to 25% T-1 response recovery, hemodynamic changes following induction of anesthesia and after the muscle relaxant and subsequent oral intubation were determined. Mean values and the differences in the two treatments groups were statistically analyzed. The onset of action of the two agents were similar: 3.62+/-0.02 minutes (MMG) and 4.94+/-0.05 minutes (EMG, Pan) and 3.74+/-0.02 minutes (MMG) and 4.36+/-0.012 minutes (EMG, Pip). TOF fade ratios during the onset phase were similar. TOF fade at the 25% twitch responses recovery level was 100% with the MMG responses and (96% (Pan) and 94.8% (Pip) with the EMG responses at the 25% twitch response recovery level. Hemodynamic changes were similar after the single dose adminstration of the bolus administration of the two NMB agents. The only difference between the two treatment groups was in the degree of tachycardia in response to endotracheal intubation which was marginally more significant with Pan than with Pip (p=0.1>0.05). The clinical NMB onset of action and TOF fade characteristics of equipotent doses of Pan and Pip are identical. The duration of action of Pip was about 10% (p=<0.01) shorter than that of Pan, (The probable cause of this difference may be due to a differing influence of halothane anesthesia on the duration of NMB of otherwise equipotent NMB doses of these agents). Essentially no difference was observed in the hemodynamic data between the two treatment groups during the periods of induction of anesthesia.

AB The purpose of this study was to compare the in vitro reactivation of the various molecular forms of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase by oximes such as HI-6, toxogonin and PAM, in striated muscle tissue from three species-rat, monkey and human. To simulate the various in vivo conditions the oxime was present either 5 min before and after (Pre-Post) or 5 min after (Post) exposure to the nerve agent soman. In the Pre-Post mode the oxime effects would result from a combination of not only shielding of acetylcholinesterase from soman inhibition but also from immediate reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinnesterase. In the Post experimental group the increase in soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity was due to reactivation. HI-6 (Pre-Post) increased significantly the activity of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the rat, human and monkey muscle. HI-6 (Post) was a highly effective reactivator of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the rat muscle and moderately so in the human and monkey muscle. Toxogonin (Pre-Post) and toxogonin (Post) were effective in increasing soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in rat muscle but were relatively ineffective in the human and monkey muscle. PAM (Pre-Post) and PAM (Post) were ineffective in increasing soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle from all species examined. Effectiveness of oxime-induced reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase could be estimated from the total acetylcholinesterase activity which appears to reflect the results found with the individual molecular forms of acetylcholinesterase. In addition, SAD-128, a non-oxime bispyridinium compound, appeared to enhance significantly the HI-6 induced reactivation of soman-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in human but not rat striated muscle.

TI EVALUATION OF THE DEPENSATORY FISHING HYPOTHESIS AS AN EXPLANATION FOR

AB Causes of cyclic fluctuations in the abundance of Fraser River sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been the focus of considerable debate for much of this century. Most hypotheses to explain cyclic behaviour in Fraser River sockeye centre on identifying agents of depensatory mortality, and several recent papers argue that sockeye cycles are maintained primarily by depensatory fishing patterns. We assess the evidence for depensatory fishing as an explanation for these cycles. Using simulations, we demonstrate that empirical evidence for depensatory fishing is likely an artifact caused by bias in estimating stock composition of catches in mixed-stock fisheries. Moreover, recent trends in harvest rates among comigrating stocks with asynchronous cycles are inconsistent with the depensatory fishing hypothesis. It also seems very unlikely that aboriginal and early commercial fisheries were intensive enough to maintain cycles that persisted prior to 1860. Only during the unregulated, early commercial fishery prior to the collapse of the upriver runs following the 1913-14 disaster at Hell's Gate is there any convincing evidence of depensatory fishing.

AB The methanesulfonanilide-containing Class III agents dofetilide, D-sotalol, E-4031, and MK-499 have been characterized as selective blockers of a rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier (I-K) K+ current, I-Kr. In the present studies, the effects of dofetilide (3-30 nM), D-sotalol(10-100 mu M), E-4031 (30-300 nM), and MK-499 (30-300 nM) on myocardial effective refractory period (ERP) were assessed in ferret right ventricular papillary muscles in conditions of altered extracellular Kf concentration ([Ki(+)](e) [normal (4 mM) versus increased (10 mM)] concentrations, and of altered pacing frequency (1-3 Hz). With 4 mM [K+](e), all four agents elicited significant, concentration-dependent ERP increases in the frequency range of 1-3 Hz, and all four agents displayed reverse frequency-dependent activity. Reverse frequency-dependent profiles also were demonstrable in 10 mM [K+](e) at the higher test agent concentrations: dofetilide (10 and 30 nM), D-sotalol (100 mu M), E-4031 (100 and 300 nM) and MK-499 (100 and 300 nM). All four agents displayed diminished ERP increases in increased versus normal [K+](e). Among individual test agents, however, there were differences in magnitudes of diminution of ERP increases observed in increased [K+](e): The activities of D-sotalol and MK-499 were better maintained in increased [K+](e) than were those of dofetilide and E-4031. As a result of this differential sensitivity increased [K+](e), significant ERP increases were not demonstrable for dofetilide and E-4031 in simultaneous conditions of increased [K+](e) and rapid pacing, whereas significant activities were maintained with D-sotalol and MK-499 in increased [K+](e) throughout the 1-3-Hz range of pacing frequencies. However, the inherent tendency of myocardial refractoriness to increase in increased [K+](e), particularly at faster pacing frequencies, played a dominant role in determining the relationship between increased versus normal [K+](e) posttreatment ERP in all Class III treatment groups. This frequency-dependent increment in refractoriness in increased [K+](e) reflected in baseline ERP determined in 10 versus 4 mM [K+](e), respectively, at frequencies of 1 Hz (163 +/- 3 vs. 157 +/- 2 ms, p = 0.06), 2 Hz (146 +/- 3 vs. 134 +/- 2 ms, p < 0.01), and 3 Hz (134 +/- 2 vs. 112 +/- 2 ms, p < 0.01) tended to offset as well as minimize differences among the I-Kr blockers in diminution of activity observed in increased [K+](e). As a consequence, no fundamental differences among the methanesulfonanilide I-Kr blockers were apparent with regard to the influence of altered pacing frequency and [K+](e) on effects on absolute refractoriness in this experimental preparation. -

   PRINCIPLES
AB Protein crystal growth often depends on the combination of many different factors. Some affect protein solubility directly; others may act indirectly by causing conformational changes. Systematic characterization of these factors can be important for generating good crystals. It can also provide useful insight into the biochemical behavior of the protein being crystallized. Here we focus on statistical methods to achieve these two objectives. (1) Characterization of a protein system by analyzing patterns of crystal polymorphism under different levels of biochemical parameters, such as ligands and pH. Tests of the reproducibility of crystal growth experiments indicate that quantitative scales of crystal quality can be statistically significant. Analysis of variance for a replicated, full-factorial design in which four factors were tested at two levels has been used to demonstrate highly significant, biochemically relevant, two-factor interactions strongly implicating pH and ligand-dependent conformational changes. (2) Optimization of crystal growth via response-surface methods. 'Minimum predicted variance' designs provide for efficient response-surface experiments aimed at constructing quadratic models in several dimensions. We have used such models to improve crystal size and quality significantly for three forms of Bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. In one case we can now avoid having to increase the size by repeated seeding, a difficult procedure that also produces unwanted growth of satellite crystals. Graphs of two-dimensional level surfaces reveal a number of ridges, where the same result is obtained for many combinations of the factors usually varied when trying to improve crystals. An important inference is that it may be better to sample simultaneously for the effects of protein concentration and supersaturation. For a system involving only one crystallizing agent, supersaturation can be approximated as the product of protein and precipitant concentrations. Use of this search direction significantly improves the performance of response-surface experiments. Advantages of growing crystals at stationary points of their response surfaces include better crystals and higher reproducibility, since crystal growth at stationary points is insulated from the deleterious effects of experimental fluctuations. This arises because the derivatives of the response are by definition zero with respect to the experimental variables. Quantitative analysis of appropriately designed crystal growth experiments can thus be a powerful way to characterize complex and interacting biochemical dependencies in macromolecular systems and optimize parameters important to the crystallography.

AB Various studies have shown that in vitro production of cytokines by leukocytes from the newborn are normal, decreased, or increased. We investigated the blood levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) interleukin-1 alpha, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) simultaneously to assess the cytokine response to systemic infection during the neonatal period. One or more cytokine levels were elevated in all of the newborns with sepsis. Serum TNF levels in the newborns with sepsis were significantly higher than the two control groups (P<0.002). Serum IL-6 levels in the study group were also found to be significantly higher than the control groups (P<0.0004 for sepsis vs adult controls and P<0.03 for sepsis vs newborn controls). We could not find statistically significant correlation between any of the cytokine levels, C-reactive protein, white blood cells, and platelet counts and the outcome. Gram-negative bacteria were the main causative agents in these patients, although one of them was infected with gram-positive bacteria, besides one premature infant (29 weeks) with Candida sepsis also had significantly elevated TNF, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 levels. Our data show that both mature and premature neonates were able to produce and significantly increase the blood levels of the cytokines in response to sepsis. Because the biologic relevance of cytokine levels is not known, further prospective and sequential studies on cytokine levels simultaneously and correlation with clinical parameters are needed to clarify the biological role of this important component of the host defense system.

AB A mathematical model of thrombopoiesis in small rodents, principally rats, is presented. It is a compartmental model, consisting of seven compartments, which contain the following cell populations: early megakaryocyte progenitor cells, late megakaryocyte progenitor cells, megakaryocytes of ploidy classes 8N, 16N, 32N and 64N, and platelets. Signals for feedback regulation are derived from the platelet compartment and from all megakaryocyte compartments. The main characteristic of the model is its ability to simulate megakaryocyte ploidy and volume distribution. Platelet number and the ploidy distribution of megakaryocytes after acute and chronic disturbances in the platelet compartment were simulated and were found to approximate experimental data published in the literature. The kinetic parameters for the progenitor cell compartment, which were derived from published in vitro data, were sufficient to stimulate the platelet number after administration of hydroxyurea and 5-fluorouracil. The proposed model is capable of reproducing the reactions of the system to several experimental disturbances in the thromobopoietic lineage, but the action of agents such as radiation, which cause damage to the stem cells or to other lineages, cannot be simulated.

AB H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of trypsin and ribonuclease, stabilized by chemical modification with a hydrophilic polymer, have been obtained over a wide pH range (1-11). The spectral features, referred to some nuclei of the catalytic sites (the ''catalytic triad'' for trypsin and the His-12-His-119 pair for ribonuclease), have been identified using different NMR techniques as well as chemical modification with selective reagents. It is found that monoprotonation of these systems leads to symmetrical (or quasi-symmetrical) H-bonds formed between the basic groups. This allows us to explain the discrepancies between experimental data obtained by different authors on the protonation sites in these catalytic systems. The simulation of the catalytic triad by a N-15 labeled low molecular weight model has led us to the conclusion that external agents do not cause any discrete proton transfers but do cause a smooth shift of the bridging protons from one basic atom to another, with the quasi-symmetrical H-bonds being formed in intermediate cases. On the basis of these experimental data, a new concept has been proposed for the mechanism of acid base catalysis performed by the pairs of weak basic groups like His-Im and Asp(Glu)-COO- (pK(a) 3-7) which are not capable of proton abstraction from alcoholic or water OH groups (pK(a) > 13). This catalysis may consist on the one hand of changing the charge densities on reacting groups due to strong H-bonding and, on the other hand, of facilitating the free movement of a proton in the field of several basic atoms when going along the reaction coordinate. The energy of the very strong H-bonds thus formed diminishes the activation energy of the reaction.

AB bcl-2 is the first member of a new class of protooncogenes the products of which inhibit programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis. We have previously determined that Bcl-2 is expressed in a significant percentage of untreated primary neuroblastoma (NBL) tumors. In these specimens Bcl-2 expression correlated with other markers of poor prognosis suggesting a role for Bcl-2 in the malignant behavior of NBL tumor cells. To investigate this possibility, a Bcl-2-negative human NBL cell line (Shep-1) was transfected with a beta expression vector (pSFFVneo-bcl-2). Multiple unique clones were isolated which showed variable levels of Bcl-2 protein by quantitative immunoprecipitation. Vector-transfected controls were generated simultaneously. Clones expressing high levels of Bcl-2 were resistant to cisplatin- and etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei by flow cytometry after cisplatin or etoposide treatment revealed marked DNA degradation in vector-transfected controls whereas bcl-2 transfectants showed a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA degradation. Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed relatively large fragment DNA degradation (similar to 50 kilobases) in the absence of internucleosomal degradation in vector-transfected control cells treated with either cisplatin or etoposide. In contrast, Bcl-2-expressing cells showed significantly less DNA degradation at all time points. These single gene transfection experiments have revealed that expression of Bcl-2 renders specific NBL cells resistant to chemotherapy-induced PCD and support the hypothesis that Bcl-2 enhances the malignant phenotype of NBL by promoting tumor resistance to chemotherapy agents.

AB Experiments were performed to investigate the effect of free radical damage on two aspects of retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) metabolism, namely, proliferation and phagocytosis. Bovine RPE cells were maintained in monolayer cultures, either as passaged (for proliferation and lysosomal activity assays) or primary cultures (for phagocytosis measurements). Free radicals (superoxide anions) were generated by a xanthine oxidase (XO)-hypoxanthine (HX) reaction. Total phagocytosis (binding plus ingestion of rod outer segments (ROS)) was quantitated by radioimmunoassay using a specific anti-opsin antibody and iodinated secondary antibody. In some cases, agents with known or possible protective influences against oxidative damage, i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), vitamin E, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), were tested for their activity in this model system. RPE cell proliferation was inhibited in a HX-XO dose-dependent manner, in the absence of cell toxicity. Modifications of cell morphology were also noticed. Either simultaneous exposure of RPE cells to ROS membranes and HX-XO or pretreatment of ROS membranes with HX-XO prior to their addition to RPE monolayers led to a statistically significant 20-30% decrease in phagocytosis relative to control values. This decrease was essentially observed in the binding phase of phagocytosis, indicating damage to ROS surface molecules as the primary event. Addition of SOD or vitamin E prevented this loss of phagocytic activity, whereas bFGF had no effect. Superoxide radicals did not, however, affect phagocytosis when RPE cells were exposed to them alone, prior to incubation with ROS; nor did they alter a later stage in the phagocytic process, acid phosphatase activity. This tissue culture model represents a convenient system for analyting free radical damage in different aspects of RPE-photoreceptor behavior and may be useful in studying this phenomenon in several retinal disorders.

ID CONSUMPTION; MODEL
AB We seek to establish the general empirical importance of investment-motivated saving. Our hypothesis is that inadequate financial intermediation will induce agents to save more in order to undertake lumpy physical investment in the future. The result is a positive relationship between the degree of capital market imperfection and the size of the private saving rate. A simulation exercise calibrated on Taiwan found a close match between the simulated and actual data. Regression analysis established that the private saving rate was negatively related to the level of financial market sophistication.

AB The effects of clodronate, a bisphosphonate for the treatment of hypercalcemia, on the progress of atherosclerosis were studied in rabbits fed with a high-cholesterol (1%) diet and treated simultaneously with disodium clodronate 0 (saline), 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg intravenously twice a week for 6, 9, and 12 weeks. In 9 to 12 weeks, plasma total cholesterol increased from 0.8+/-0.3 mmol/L (mean +/- SD) in rabbits fed the standard diet to 46+/-17 mmol/L in animals subjected to high-cholesterol diet. Clodronate did not influence the cholesterol concentration in plasma. None of the parameters studied were changed by clodronate within 6 weeks after beginning the treatment. In 9 to 12 weeks (n = 7 to 9), plasma total Ca++ concentration was decreased from 3.55+/-0.12 mmol/L in the saline group to 3.36+/-0.16 mmol/L in the group on the greatest clodronate dose (p < 0.05). Free and esterified cholesterol and total Ca++ concentrations in the wall of thoracic aorta were reduced by the greatest dose of clodronate, compared with the groups treated with saline solution or smaller doses of the drug (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, the greatest dose of clodronate also reduced the visible and lipid-stained atheromatous areas in the thoracic and abdominal aorta, compared with those in the saline and the other clodronate dose groups (p < 0.05). The results suggest that a high dose of clodronate inhibits the development of diet-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits.

AB Models of the solar nebula reveal that it might have been gravitationally unstable, both early and later in its evolution. Such instabilities produce density waves and associated gravitational torques, which are potent agents of angular momentum transport. In previous work, we conducted a series of numerical simulations designed to quantify the effects of gravitational instabilities in a generalizable way (Tomley, Cassen, & Steiman-Cameron 1991). Here we present a second series of simulations in which we examine disks of greater size, increased star/disk mass ratio, and flatter surface density distribution than those in our initial study. The purpose is to represent disks at a later stage of evolution than those already studied, to test the quantitative relations derived in our earlier work and to explore the effects of mass ratio on the results. The new results indicate that the tendencies for unstable, uncooled disks to heat to stability and for dynamical evolution rates to be proportional to cooling rates are general characteristics of the behavior of gravitationally unstable disks. Nevertheless, there are quantitative, and (for strong cooling) even qualitative differences that are revealed in the new simulations, particularly with regard to the cooling rates at which clumping tends to occur.

ID ASPIRATION
AB A dichotomy exists in the literature concerning the efficacy of sclerosing agent tetracycline hydrochloride for treatment of thyroid cysts. However, the studies vary in patient selection and none employed a statistical method for simultaneous analysis of multiple factors that might affect the outcome of therapy. We, therefore, studied the efficacy of percutaneous instillation of tetracycline for eradication of recurrent thyroid cysts, using a multivariate analysis. Thirty-seven patients with recurrent, cytologically benign thyroid cysts (not cured after 3 aspirations) were studied. Twenty-three patients were given tetracycline instillations [100 mg/ml, range (R): 1-4 ml]. The remainder underwent only repeated needle aspiration. They were followed for 33+/-12 (SD) months, R: 12-58 months. Cure was achieved in 21 out, of 23 cases after tetracycline instillation within 2+/-1.7 months (R: 1-6 months) and in 12 out of 14 cases after aspiration alone within 9.9+/-11.3 months (R: 1-43 months, 4-10 aspirations). Multivariate survival analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model demonstrated significantly shorter time interval before cure in the group with tetracycline instillation (p=0.001). The volume, color or duration of cysts and levothyroxine (L-T4) treatment did not appear to influence, the outcome of therapy. After initial cure by tetracycline instillation, 5 cases had relapse. Three were later cured by reinstillation of tetracycline or by repeated aspirations (R: 1-3 times). Complications of tetracycline instillation included brief episode of neck pain and development of a foreign body granuloma in a single patient. In conclusion, tetracycline instillation is a quick and effective procedure for treating recurrent thyroid cysts. The duration, characteristics of cysts and L-T4 administration do not influence the outcome of therapy.

AB TWO NEWLY-DEVELOPED COMPOUNDS (U92798 and U92032), which inhibit lipid peroxidation and block calcium entry, were studied for their effects on neocortical damage after transient focal ischemia. Ischemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by simultaneous occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries for a period of 3 hours. Compounds (1 mg/kg) were administered intravenously 30 minutes before occlusion and again 2.5 hours after the cessation of blood flow. After a 72-hour period of reperfusion, the animals were killed and examined for cerebral infarction and edema. Treatment with U92798 or U92032 significantly reduced the volume of cortical infarction. Edema was also reduced in these groups; however, this effect did not achieve statistical significance. These results suggest that dual function compounds, which both inhibit lipid peroxidation and block calcium entry, are promising therapeutic agents for the amelioration of ischemic cerebral damage.

TI MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF THE CONFORMATIONAL BEHAVIOR OF THE
   SYNTHETIC DIPEPTIDE PIDOTIMOD, A NEW IMMUNOSTIMULATING AGENT
SO JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE
LA English
DT Article
ID NUCLEIC-ACIDS; FORCE-FIELD; PROTEINS
AB Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the conformational behaviour of the conformers of PIDOTIMOD. an interleukin-2 lymphocyte T receptor agonist dipeptide. have been carried out. MD simulations at constant temperatures of 300 and 400 K and constant total energy runs at high temperatures have been performed, and trajectories and statistical properties of motions investigated.
   At 300 K two trans and one cis conformer were found to be dynamically stable. Two puckered forms of the oxoprolyl ring in rapid equilibrium have been detected. The equilibrium conformations appear rather rigid and poor in H-bonds.
   At 400 K both trans and cis conformers are thermally mixed. At high temperatures large fluctuations of the peptide bond between the oxo-prolyl and thyazolidin rings are observed. Nevertheless in the short time scale trans cis interconversion does not occur.
   Suggestions on the nature of the structure activity relationship are made.

TI Drop size distributions in high holdup fraction dispersion systems:
   Effect of the degree of hydrolysis of PVA stabilizer
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Although turbulence-stabilized dispersions are of considerable industrial importance, their behaviour is generally not well understood, especially for the high dispersed phase volume fractions encountered in suspension polymerization reactors. The dispersion is formed by two dynamic processes, namely, drop breakage and coalescence. Breakage mainly occurs in regions of high shear stress near the impeller or as a result of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations along the surface of a drop. Droplet coalescence is prevented by the combined action of turbulent agitation and the addition of protective colloids such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Depending on the combination of the degree of agitation and the concentration and type of surface active agent, the average droplet size can exhibit a U-shaped variation with respect to the impeller speed or the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA stabilizer. This U-type behaviour has been confirmed both experimentally and theoretically and has been attributed to a manifestation of the balance between breakage and coalescence rates of the monomer drops. Both processes are related to the interfacial tension and its variation with time as a result of the varying polymer concentration and conformation at the monomer/water interface. In the present study, a series of experiments were carried out with a model system of 50% n-butyl chloride in water in the presence of PVA with varying degrees of hydrolysis at different agitation rates. A generalized numerical algorithm incorporating the most comprehensive models describing the breakage and coalescence processes has been used for simulating the steady-state drop size distributions in a high holdup liquid-liquid dispersion system in order to elucidate the breakage and coalescence mechanisms as a function of the droplet interfacial characteristics. It is shown that the model simulations are in satisfactory agreement with measurements of the drop size distributions over the whole range of the experimental conditions investigated.

TI Reactor modeling and scale-up of a multiphase reaction-extraction
   system: Metallothermic reduction of rare earth oxides
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A mathematical model was developed to describe the transient and steady-state behavior of a multiphase reaction-extraction system in a batch stirred-tank reactor used for the metallothermic reduction of rare earth oxides. The model includes thermodynamic, kinetic and transport parameters as well as reactor design and operating parameters. The model was applied to the metallothermic reduction of Nd2O3 by Ca using molten salts as the phase transfer agent. Mathematical analyses of the model have indicated that the steady-state performance of the reactor can be characterized by the reactor eigenvalue which is a linear function of the interfacial equilibrium constant of the rare earth metals. Important scale-up parameters were identified from dimensional analysis of the model, whereas the rate-controlling step of the process was identified through the numerical simulation of the model. The results of numerical simulation of the model were consistent with experimental observations on both the laboratory and the pilot reactor.

AB In this paper, we present the concepts behind the implementation of behavioral and cognitive capabilities in objects used for controlling workstations in manufacturing systems. These capabilities characterize a new class of objects called agents; such objects intuitively play the role of human decision-makers in the system modeled. Three types of reasoning activities are considered: a meta-reasoning level to control the inference/search reasoning activities, the local reasoning level incorporating simple rule-based procedures and an extended reasoning level representing the reasoning activities that cannot be performed using simple procedures and thus require external knowledge agents to assist the decision-making process. Implementation issues are discussed, illustrated by an application of the approach to the modeling of workstations in a rolling-mill facility.

AB The actions of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine (THA) and 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) on glutamatergic receptors were studied using the whole-cell and outside-out variants of the patch-clamp technique. Typically, either N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or kainate alone or combined with various concentrations of THA or 9-AA was applied via a U tube to activate whole-cell currents. Other superfusion techniques were also used. THA (25-50 mu M) and 9-AA (10-25 mu M) reduced the peak and steady-state amplitudes of NMDA-activated whole-cell inward currents and had no significant effect on outward currents. At higher concentrations, these agents produced a delayed current peak in addition to a further depression of the current size. A delayed current peak was a high-amplitude current peak delayed in relation to the time course of control currents. THA and 9-AA were much less potent in blocking kainate-activated currents. Also, the blockade of kainate currents was voltage independent, and no delayed current peak was generated. With the same superfusion method, the antagonists APV (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) and Mg++ were tested independently of THA or 9-AA and were found not to produce delayed current peaks or NMDA-activated whole-cell currents. Bath perfusion of THA (250 mu M) abolished the delayed current peaks produced by pulse application of NMDA and THA, whereas bath perfusion of the competitive blocker APV did not have this effect. High concentrations of glycine (10 mu M) did not alter THA's blocking effects or the production of delayed current peaks. Outside-out patches exposed to pulses of NMDA and THA displayed a delayed increase in the channel-opening probability. Apparently, this is the microscopic counterpart of the delayed current peaks. We also performed stationary single-channel analyses of currents recorded from outside-out patches exposed to continuous bath perfusion of NMDA (1-5 mu M) and various concentrations of THA or 9-AA. Either one of these agents produced a reduction in the mean open time coupled with an apparent shortening of the mean burst length at concentrations on the order of 10(-5) M. The data were fitted to a model with two sequentially arranged blocked states. The resulting rate constants were used in computer simulations. The computer-simulated traces of whole-cell NMDA-activated currents under the effect of THA mimicked all the major features of the experimental traces obtained under the nonstationary conditions of concentration jumps. In conclusion, the depression of the amplitude of NMDA-activated whole-cell currents and the appearance of a delayed current peak produced by either THA or 9-AA were interpreted as being due to rapidly reversible channel blockade. Because of some of the unique characteristics of the channel blockade produced by these compounds, they have proved to be potentially powerful tools in the study of the kinetics of NMDA receptor channels.

AB Applies a computer model GAIA (Groups of Adaptive Inferencing Agents) to simulate the lifecycle of artificial groups directed by agendas which specify varying strategies for collective problem solving. Within GAIA, groups of artificial agents dynamically learn and interact by proposing, combining and testing inductive hypotheses in the form of genetic building blocks. Agents share and combine building block solutions to evolve decision trees to respond to environmental inputs. Effects of agendas which emphasize stages of conservative and liberal problem solving strategies over a group's lifecycle were simulated. Conservative strategies emphasize consensus and collective memories within groups. Liberal strategies emphasize challenges to collective memory and individual agent predictions. Agendas which vary from conservative to liberal resulted in the poor group solutions. Significantly better group solutions were produced by an agenda varying from liberal to conservative and back to liberal (L-C-L). The L-C-L agenda focuses on critical evaluation and rewards for individual contribution in the beginning and ending lifecycle stages and provides a middle stage of collective exploration.

TI CONCEPTS FOR PRIVATIZING NATIONALIZED LAND AND FOR REGULATING
   COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATIONS IN THE NEW FEDERAL STATES ANALYSIS AND
   ALTERNATIVES
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
LA German
DT Article
AB The privatisation process of the nationalized land and the still expected bill to regulate the compensation for expropriations in East Germany are interdependent issues. As an introduction a short discription of the legal preconditions to resolve the problems associated with privatisation and compensation is given. The analysis is based on the concepts of Institutional Choice Theory, the New Political Economy and the concept of Policy-Analysis. The underlying process is identified as a widely politically directed institutional change. In addition, the participation of three policy-nets makes it more difficult to analyse the process: the traditional ''west-oriented'' net of agricultural policy, the net of financial policy similarly oriented towards West German interests and third the new net of agricultural policy and administration in the New Lander. Thus the hypothesis is put forward that the various political interest groups will use different policy-nets and specific methods to achieve their political goals. Obviously they will try to establish a privatisation regime maximizing their own opportunities to exert influence on the agents involved in the privatisation process. The paper is focussing on two episodes of institutional change, first the transition from the so called Gerster-Paper to the Bohl-Paper (Three-Phase-Model) and second the replacement of the Gattermann-Model (Certificate-Model) by the Bond-Model, created by the Federal Government. It is apparent from these examples that the West-German-oriented networks prefer methods we call ''Feinsteuerung'', what means exertion of influence in processes of information and negotiation within die networks of bureaucracies, parliamentary committees and interest groups, whereas die policy net in the New Lander obviously prefers instruments from the arsenal of the so called ''Grobsteuerung'', e. g. their influence relies on political pressure originating from party competition, the danger of vote losses and public protest. This result corresponds with the specific comparative advantages of the interest groups in the decision making process. Unlike the interests of the expropriated former property-owners the regional farmers' unions in die New Lander prefer to establish a ''dosed-shop'' concept favouring the existing farms and farmers to manage conflicting interests. The former, in the most cases people now living in West-Germany, want to open the distribution process for ''outsiders'' and therefore prefer market instruments for distribution of land. Simultanously they try to establish preferential treatments in their favour by making use of the west oriented policy nets. So up to now the privatisation process including compensation components is dominated by governmental-administrative action and therefore corresponds more to the interests of the now existing farmers and their associations in the New Lander.

AB The sources of iron blanks in liquid chromatography and interactions of these blanks with injected samples were investigated. The main sources of the blanks are the chemicals used and the chromatographic equipment. Even so-called ''metal-free'' systems contain iron blanks in the low-ng range, which can be a source of error in speciation analysis of iron. The effects induced by iron blanks include the formation of additional peaks (positive and negative) and changes in the recovery of injected species. Especially free ligands, which are present in the sample, interact strongly with blanks. The mechanism of interaction of blanks with injected species was investigated in some detail using organic acids as complexing agents for Fe(II), Fe(III) or both. The experimental results were compared with computer-simulated chromatograms. It is shown that the observed effects can be explained by using a model based on chemical equilibria in the stationary and mobile phases.

AB The rates of dissolution of Fe(III) (hydr)oxides are critically dependent on the coordinative interactions taking place on their surfaces, above all of the reactions of the surface functional > FeOH groups with H+, OH-, metal ions and suitable ligands. Surface processes rather than transport processes are typically the rate-controlling steps. Thus the     dissolution rates depend on the type of surface species present. In this work, the inhibition of the dissolution of gamma-FeOOH by various organic and inorganic solutes, benzoate, arsenate, phosphate, selenite, sulfate and the inhibition of the acid dissolution of alpha-FeOOH by Cr(III) and chromate was investigated. Enhancement and inhibition of dissolution are relative terms and have to be measured operationally in relation to a reference condition. As a reference ligand in ligand-promoted and ligand-inhibited dissolution, ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA) was chosen because it is dissolution-active over a relatively large pH range. The experimental results show pronounced inhibition of the dissolution by phosphate, arsenate and selenite at near neutral pH values. At pH < 5, phosphate, arsenate and selenite accelerate the dissolution. It is postulated that binuclear surface complexes inhibit the dissolution, because much more energy is needed to remove simultaneously two center atoms from the crystalline lattice than to remove solely one center. However, mononuclear complexes, especially if they are nucleophilic and bidentate, accelerate the dissolution.

TI THE IN-VITRO RADIOSENSITIZATION OF HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA WITH

AB There is evidence that pentoxifylline may be both a radioprotector of normal tissue and a radiosensitizer of tumor cells. This article reviews this evidence and then describes our own laboratory study to determine whether pentoxifylline is a radiosensitizer of human glioblastoma cells in vitro. Human glioblastoma multiforme cells (SNB19 cell line) were irradiated in vitro with and without pentoxifylline. Regression of the log ratios (quotient of surviving colonies) revealed greater tumor cell kill in the PTX group, and the difference increased as the radiation dose increased (p < 0.01 at the 750 and 1000 cGY doses). Before the hypothesis that PTX is a radiosensitizer of hypoxic tumor cells can be confirmed or denied, it must be determined if the agent also has a separate mechanism of tumoricidal activity. Whereas in vivo models allow the well-documented rheologic, immunologic and oxygen-related effects of PTX to be active simultaneously, the in vitro model described herein excludes the effects of such systemic actions and focuses on mechanisms at the cellular or subcellular level. These data suggest there exists such a mechanism of tumoricidal activity of PTX that has not been previously identified.

AB Zinc treatment in liver cirrhosis is known to prevent a number of clinical symptoms. Previous studies have also indicated that Zn has a protective effect on the development of the clinical, biochemical and morphological manifestations of hepatic injury if administered simultaneously with the noxious agent. In this study, the protective effects of zinc treatment against the development of liver cirrhosis have been tested in cirrhotic rats treated by intragastric administration of CCl4. The development of morphological lesions has been investigated by means of standardized and comparable techniques, LM, TEM, SEM, microvascular casts and measurements of liver collagen content by colorimetric determination in paraffin embedded sections. LM and EM observations showed typical morphological features of cirrhosis in all CCl4 treated rats. In the same group of animals, the microsvascular casts showed the development of the typical 'perinodular' branching and the various anastomoses of pre and post-sinusoidal vessels. Colorimetric evaluation has shown a significant increase in collagen content after CCl4 treatment. Qualitative and quantitative data of livers of CCl4 treated rats supplemented or not with zinc were significantly similar.
   In conclusion, zinc treatment influences biochemical parameters, but not the morphology of liver cirrhosis.

AB The knowledge on the microscopic reduction behavior of fine iron ore in hot reducing gas flow is indispensable to accurate description of the extremely complex raceway combustion zone induced by PCI(Pulverized Coal Injection) and OI(fine iron Ore Injection) from blast furnace tuyeres. In the studies using the vertical flow reactor and the tube type reactor where fine materials were transported by the pressure difference in the gas chambers, and thereby a short residence time and a rapid heating rate of fine materials in the raceway combustion zone were simulated, the reduction degree of fine iron ore as well as the reduction morphology were investigated in detail under the conditions of the combined injection(PCI+OI) and the carbon coated ore injection. The experimental results revealed that the in-flight reduction degree of fine iron ore was significantly increased mainly by the improved efficiency of contact of fine ore particles with reducing agents. And the carbon coating of the fine ore surface achieved the most excellent condition for promoting the in-flight smelting reduction.

AB The long-acting local anaesthetic agent ropivacaine, S(-)-1-propyl-2',6'-pipecoloyxlidid, is characterised by lower lipid solubility and lower cardiotoxicity compared with bupivacaine. This study was designed to evaluate its clinical efficacy and motor blocking properties when using lower volumes and higher concentrations of both plain substances.
   Methods. In a randomised, double-blind study plain ropivacaine (ro) 1% (1 50 mg) and bupivacaine (bu) 0.75% (112.5 mg) were compared in 44 patients. In the lateral position, epidural anaesthesia was performed at L2/3 or L3/4 using the loss-of-resistance technique. A test dose of 3 ml was given followed by 12 ml (total volume 15 ml). Sensory blockade was registered by the pin-prick method after 2 min at 5-min intervals up to maximal levels and after the operation at 30-min intervals. Simultaneously, the motor block was determined by means of the Bromage scale. Results are given as median values.
   Results. The onset of analgesia was 6.0 min for both substances (L2), the time to level L5 16.0 and 17.0 min, respectively. The median maximum upper level of sensory analgesia was achieved after 24.5 min with ro (Th 5) and after 21.0 min (Th 7) with bu. The maximum durations (regression to L2) were 321.5 (ro) and 266.0 min (bu) (P<0.05). Times for 2-segment regression were comparable at 177.5 and 176.0 min, respectively, and for 4-segment regression at 201.3 and 222.0 min. Twenty-one of the 22 patients developed a first-degree motor block (latency 15 and 12 min); 16 patients in the ro group developed a second-degree block, as did 14 in the bu group (latency 24 and 22 min). Third-degree motor block was recorded in 3 patients (latency 45 and 38 min). The duration of first-degree motor block was 233 min and 207 min, of second-degree block 150 and 155 min, and third-degree block 135 min in both groups. The mean arterial pressures and heart rates did not differ. The diastolic pressures were lower after bu (-8.3%) than after ro (-0.4%) at 30 min. No major side effects were observed. Theodrenaline and/or dihydroergotamine (1:10 diluted) was administered to 38.6% of the patients; 34.1% received atropine for the treatment of bradycardias (decrease greater-than-or-equal-to 12%) and hypotension of more than 20%. No significant differences were found in frequency of analgesia (pin-prick) between both groups. One of 22 patients in the ro group and 6 of 22 in the bu group required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia. The difference is not statistically significant, but is of clinical relevance. With 2 patients after ro and 4 patients after bu the relaxation was insufficient for good operating conditions.
   Conclusion. Ropivacaine 1% produced a longer duration of analgesia and better clinical efficacy than bupivacaine 0.75%. The clinical difference in motor blockade was not statistically significant. The Bromage scale is not representative for a substance with good analgesic effects and moderate motor blocking properties, as has been shown in sophisticated studies on ropivacaine motor blockade.

AB We performed experiments in rats aimed at determining whether a combination of ceftriaxone (CRO) and netilmicin (NET), by using once-daily administration in rats, which simulated profiles of drug in human serum, was more effective than either agent alone in the treatment of endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci. A programmable infusion pump system enabled the production of profiles of CRO in serum that simulate those found in humans after the intravenous administration of 2 g. The subcutaneous administration of 18 mg of NET per kg of body weight produced levels in the sera of rats comparable to those after the intravenous administration of a dose of 5 mg of NET per kg in humans. Rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with two test strains, a CRO-susceptible Streptococcus sanguis strain (MICs of CRO and NET, 0.064 and 8 mg/liter, respectively) and a relatively CRO-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain (MICs of CRO and NET, 2 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). Against both strains, the combination of CRO and NET was synergistic in vitro as determined by time-kill curves. Treatment of rats was started 48 h postinfection and lasted for 3 days. CRO alone was effective against the susceptible strain (P < 0.001 compared with control animals) but was not effective against the resistant organism. A significantly enhanced antibacterial activity of the CRO-NET combination in reducing the valvular bacterial counts was observed with both test strains (P < 0.001). The synergistic effect was obtained with a single daily injection of NET which provided detectable levels in serum for only 8 h, suggesting that in vivo synergism in the treatment of infections caused by viridans group streptococci can be obtained without 24 h of aminoglycoside coverage. These experimental data might provide a rationale for clinical trials of a once-a-day dosing regimen in the treatment of streptococcal but nonenterococcal endocarditis.

TI CONCURRENT LABEL METHOD WITH IN-111 AND CR-51 ALLOWS ACCURATE EVALUATION
   OF PLATELET VIABILITY OF STORED PLATELET CONCENTRATES
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INVIVO KINETICS; STORAGE
AB The precision and reproducibility of In-111 and Cr-51 platelet radiolabel agents for in vivo kinetic studies of stored platelet concentrates (PC) were investigated. The objective was to develop a precise method with concurrent labelling of two platelet populations using different isotopes, which would allow identification of small differences in in vivo platelet quality. Identical labelling procedures were used to investigate the effects of PC storage age, different methods of red cell (RBC) and white cell (WBC) contamination correction, and label elution correction on the results of In-111 and Cr-51 kinetic studies.
   In-111 and Cr-51 platelet survival curves from the same PC, even when uncorrected for elution and RBC contamination, exhibited excellent correlation, irrespective of the age of the concentrate and its viability. However, slightly higher, but statistically significant, post-infusion per cent recoveries with Cr-51 labelled platelets were found. Two factors were identified as the cause for this difference. There was a higher affinity of contaminating RBC/WBC in PC for Cr-51 than for In-111. With determination of RBC/WBC activity by centrifugation/density separation, RBC/WBC fractions from the injectate were found to contain 12.6 +/- 3.8% v 7.1 +/- 3-6% of total Cr-51 and In-111 activity, respectively, in 20 studies. In addition, there was a significantly higher In-111 activity in plasma immediately post-infusion than with Cr-51, 5.2 +/- 1.3% v 2.8 +/- 1-6%, respectively, suggesting more label elution or carryover. After correction for the activity of RBC/WBC and for elution or carryover, essentially identical Cr-51/In-111 platelet survival curves were found. In 31 stored PC studies, the absolute average difference between Cr-51 and In-111 per cent recoveries was only 4 +/- 3% in a group of donors whose platelet recoveries ranged from 10% to 80%. Similarly, the average difference between Cr-51 and In-111 survival was only 8 +/- 4 h within a range of survivals from 40 to 220 h.
   In conclusion, after correction for elution and contaminating RBC/WBC binding, these studies show that Cr-51 and In-111 may be used interchangeably for labelling of stored PC, and that small differences between test and control platelets could be reliably detected using concurrent labelling with simultaneous infusion.

AB The animals' reactivity and the levels of experimental anxiety during pregnancy and lactation in female rats were studied using the burying behavior test. The three main parameters analyzed in this test were: the cumulative burying behavior, the burying behavior latency, and the number of shocks necessary for displaying the behavior. The burying behavior was studied at the 7th, 14th, and 21st days of pregnancy and lactation. An additional group tested 12 h after parturition was also included. Simultaneously, in all animals, the ambulatory behavior was evaluated. All results were compared with those obtained in a control group of ovariectomized females. At the end of pregnancy a clear increase in burying behavior latency accompanied by a decrease in cumulative burying behavior was observed. Similarly, a clear reduction in burying behavior immediately after parturition was found. The number of shocks necessary for displaying the burying behavior were not modified along pregnancy and lactation with the exception of a clear decrease for the 7th lactation day. Changes in locomotor activity were observed at pregnancy, but not along lactation. These changes do not account for the reduction in burying behavior observed at the 14th gestation day. Data related to the reduction in burying behavior observed during gestation are discussed on the possible participation of progestins, while those found during lactation are discussed on the bases of the variations in serotonin and endorphins that normally occur during this period.

AB Balloon angioplasty is an accepted treatment for arterial obstruction; however, a substantial percentage of initially successfully treated lesions recur in the first 4 to 6 months. There is increasing interest in local treatment of lesions undergoing angioplasty to prevent restenosis, and an infusion catheter has been developed for this purpose. This study compared infusion balloon angioplasty by means of saline solution with conventional balloon angioplasty in atherosclerotic iliac arteries of 18 cholesterol-fed New Zealand white rabbits. Values for minimum stenosis diameter assessed angiographically immediately after maximum infusion balloon angioplasty (2.1 +/- 0.6 mm) and after conventional balloon angioplasty (2.3 +/- 0.3 mm, p = NS) were similar. In follow-up studies up to 5 weeks after angioplasty, the angiographic minimum stenosis diameter remained similar in the two treatment groups, but the histologically assessed intimal area was greater after infusion angioplasty (1.54 +/- 0.92 mm vs 1.02 +/- 0.75 mm in conventionally treated arteries, p = 0.0001). Infusion balloon angioplasty merits further evaluation as a treatment strategy for the simultaneous dilatation of atherosclerotic lesions with delivery of therapeutic agents to minimize restenosis.

AB The goal of this article is to review many of the animal models that have been used for epilepsy research. The intent is to present the behavioral and electrographic patterns observed in these models and to relate those patterns to human epilepsy. This review is organized into three sections. The first section deals with the methods used in the study of epilepsy. These methods range from in vivo preparations. through in vitro brain slice preparations and neural grafting methods. to computer simulation methods. The second section of the review deals with agents capable of inducing epilepsy. Some of the agents include chemical convulsants. ionic changes in the tissue. changes in osmolarity, and withdrawal from drugs. The effects of these agents are reviewed with their relation to the mechanisms of action. Finally, the methods used to control epilepsy are reviewed. These methods include the application of anticonvulsants. changes in the osmolarity. neuronal grafts and electrical currents. Examples of epilepti-form activity obtained from animal models published in the literature are shown in several figures for comparison to human patterns. It is clear from this review that animal models are capable of reproducing many of the seizure types found in clinical situations. Although we have some understanding of the mechanisms underlying the abnormal behavior in these animal models, we are unable to explain the mechanisms underlying human epilepsy. However. the combination of existing animal models. in vitro human tissue experiments. and computer stimulation should allow us to advance rapidly toward a solution.

ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB In modelling trade competition for final products within a sector, the assumption of product homogeneity is often quite unrealistic. Even where the demand for different versions of the product can be attributed to relatively independent submarkets, considerable heterogeneity may still exist within each submarket. For each submarket, such as that for a medium-priced family car, it is assumed that more product heterogeneity exists between countries or regions than within them. Heterogeneity between regions is related to the existence of importers, acting as intermediate agents, who make trade-offs between cif import prices of goods and the willingness-to-pay by consumers. Aggregate spatial supply and demand functions based on plausible distributional assumptions are presented and estimated using a unified theoretical basis for each regional grouping of producers, importers and consumers. Conditions for simultaneous equilibrium for these three sets of agents are established, and illustrated via a small numerical example.

AB The influence of rain splash dispersal on the aggregation and variability of spores of Colletotrichum acutatum, the causal agent of strawberry anthracnose, was studied with simulated rain over a soil surface. In the first experiment, rains with intensities of 15 and 30 mm/h were generated and sampling plates, with a selective medium for Colletotrichum, were positioned under rainshields at both 20 and 60 cm from an inoculum point source (five infected fruit) for 1-min exposure periods. Number of colonies growing in plates were used to measure spore density. For each distance, time, rain intensity, and replication, the mean (m), variance (v), and Lloyd's index of patchiness (LIP) were calculated. Estimated (LIP) exceeded 1, indicating the high variability and clustering of colonies, and hence spores, resulting from splash dispersal. LIP increased with distance from the source and with rain intensity at the greater distance. Aggregation was further quantified by Taylor's power law describing the linear relation between ln (v) and In (m). The slope (b) of the relation for all data points was 1.67, which. was significantly (P < 0.01) greater than 1, a further indication of clustering. Distance form the source had a slight positive effect on b. Colony means (Y) were transformed to Y(star) = Y1/5 based on an approximate b of 1.6. Analysis of Y(star) indicated an expected significant main effect of rain duration and a significant interaction of distance and rain intensity. In another experiment, six infected fruit and the sampling plates were uniformly placed over the surface. LIP again exceeded 1, and Taylor's b equaled 1.63. In a final study, the inoculum source and sampling plates were raised 46 cm above the soil surface. There was a drastic reduction in Y(star) compared to surface values, supporting the prior hypothesis that surface topography strongly affects splash dispersal. Results indicate that the physical process of splash dispersal produces a degree of aggregation similar to that produced by population dynamic and other ecological processes.

   AGGREGATION
AB The aim of our study was to evaluate the platelet antiaggregatory and hemodynamic effects of the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost and the NO-donor SIN-1, an active metabolite of molsidomine. The number of circulating platelets was determined in anesthetized male Wistar rats as a measure of in vivo platelet aggregation. Platelet count decreased from 648 +/- 25 to 476 +/- 15 x 10(3) platelets/mul and from 578 +/- 36 to 411 +/- 40 (mean +/- SEM) in response to two repetetive injections of collagen (70 mug/kg body weight). Treatment with SIN-1 bolus injections (0.3 or 1 mg/kg bw) and/or continous i.v. infusion of iloprost (0.2 or 0.4 mug/kg bw/min) was initiated 15 min before the second collagen bolus. As a single agent, SIN-1 did not influence platelet count. Iloprost at 0.2 mug/kg/min reduced platelet aggregation (PA) by 15.5 %, and at 0.4 mug/kg/min by 27.1 % (p = n.s.). When iloprost (0.2 mug/kg) and SIN-1 (0.3 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously, PA was suppressed by 56.2 %, iloprost at 0.4 mug/kg/min and SIN-1 at 0.3 mg/kg were even more effective and inhibited PA synergistically by 64.9 % (p < 0.05). A statistically significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was seen in response to all SIN-1 and iloprost groups. However, the vasorelaxant effect of both agents given simultaneously was not synergistic but less than additive.
   In conclusion, iloprost and SIN 1 exert synergistic platelet inhibitory effects in vivo. In contrast, the decrease in MABP is less then additive. These results are of major interest for the therapeutic regimen with NO-donors (nitrovasodilators).

ID ARCHITECTURE; KNOWLEDGE
AB In his recent text, Unified Theories of Cognition, Allen Newell offers an exciting mixture of theoretical and methodological advice to cognitive scientists on how to begin developing more comprehensive accounts of human problem solving. Newell's perspective is at once both exciting and frustrating. His concept of a unified theory of cognition (UTC), and his attempt to illustrate a UTC with his Soar problem solving architecture, is exciting because it suggests how scientists might use the computational methods of cognitive science and artificial intelligence to formulate and explore both broader and deeper aspects of intelligence in people and in machines. Newell's perspective is equally frustrating because it dictates a behaviorist methodology for evaluating cognitive models. Newell views a UTC as a simulation of behavior. I explore the surprising similarity of Newell's approach to theory to the approaches of classical behaviorists such as John Watson and Edward Chace Tolman. I suggest that Newell's behaviorist methodology is incompatible with his commitment to building theories in terms of complex computational systems. I offer a modification to Newell's approach in which a UTC provides an architecture in which to explore the nature of competence-the requisite body of knowledge-that underlies an intelligent agent's ability to perform tasks in a particular domain. I compare this normative perspective to Newell's commitment to performance modeling. I conclude that his key theoretical concepts, such as the problem space hypothesis, knowledge level systems, and intelligence as approximation to the knowledge level are fundamentally COMPetence constructs. I raise specific concerns about the indeterminacy of evaluating a UTC like Soar against performance data. Finally, I suggest that competence modeling more thoroughly exploits the insights of cognitive scientists like Newell and reduces the gap between the aims of cognitive science and artificial intelligence.

AB An experimental model of proliferative vitreoretionpathy (PVR) induced by macrophages simulates a special form of wound healing process in the eye and mimics the development of PVR from its initial stage. We used this model for the evaluation of drug efficacy in the prevention of PVR. One mg triamcinolone acetonide (TA), 10 mug daunomycin-liposome (DL), 5 mug free daunomycin (FD) and 0.1 ml saline or empty liposomes (as controls) were injected into the vitreous in four groups of animals (30 or 40 rabbit eyes each) after macrophage injection. Retinal detachment developed in 77.5 % of the control eyes on day 28, compared to 13.3 % of the TA-treated eyes (P<0.01), to 33.3 % of the eyes treated with DL (P<0.01), and 50 % of the FD-treated eyes (P<0.05). TA cleared up from the vitreous within 35-63 days (average 45.5 days). The half-time of FD clearance was 145.5 min. Although DL declined rapidly during the first 2 days, there was an average of 0.64 mug/ml daunomycin in the vitreous on day 14. Transmission electron microscopy showed that FD at a dosage of over 5 mug or DL over 20 mug was toxic to the retina and that up to 4 mg TA was nontoxic. These results suggest that steroids such as TA, given at the inflammatory stage, can effectively and savely prevent the development of PVR, and that encapsulation in liposomes of cytotoxic agents such as daunomycin can enhance drug efficacy and reduce toxicity. The time course of initiation and development of PVR is important in the selection of particular drugs.

ID POTENTIAL HAZARD; BRODIFACOUM; RAPTORS; OWLS
AB Rodenticides have the potential to cause toxicity to nontarget animals that might become accidently exposed to such materials, and various experimental techniques have been developed to determine whether rodenticides cause nontarget hazard under various use conditions. Distinctions between toxicity and hazard are important. Determinations need to be made as to what nontarget animals are present near rodenticide applications and how potential exposure can occur. Various formulation and application parameters may be experimentally modified to reduce hazard, and to determine resultant effects upon both target and nontarget species. Aversive agents have been evaluated that may increase rodenticide selectivity to the target species. Wildlife hazard evaluations require basic toxicity testing, and primary hazard may be reduced through formulation and application modifications. Secondary hazard requires a knowledge of a nontarget species foraging behavior versus rodenticide application in terms of habitat used or affected, and prey preference versus pest species controlled. Simulated field studies or large scale field studies utilizing radiotelemetry techniques (concurrent with rodenticide applications) may provide the most realistic data on hazard.

AB In our previous work we reported that the cytoprotective effect of several sesquiterpene lactones would be mediated through a Michael reaction between the sulfhydril groups of the gastric mucosa and the stericallyun hindered Michael acceptors present in these compounds.
   In this work, we evaluated the different potential reactive renters present in natural lactones and several derivatives obtained by chemical modifications in our laboratory, In order to determine the structural advantages of the different active sites, we simulate a molecular interaction between a blockable cysteine residue and the substituent tiglic acid, as well as the alpha-methylen-gamma-butyrolactone and cyclopentenone rings.
   The experimental and theoretical results show that butenolide and cyclopentenone rings are the biologically active sites. On the other hand, these results indicate that tiglic acid can not act as Michael acceptor. The steric hindrance of the methyl group and the spatial distribution of the sesquiterpene skeleton would explain the different behavior obtained for tiglic acid substituent.

AB 1. Simple models were developed to explore the interaction between the lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) pest Sitona discoideus Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) and its introduced braconid parasite Microctonus aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) in New Zealand.
   2. A model for the population dynamics of S. discoideus demonstrated that observed levels of parasitism account for a decline in pest abundance, in spite of strong density-dependent mortality in the host.
   3. An empirical model for changes in parasitism from year to year, spanning five to six parasitoid generations each year, suggested that control is likely to be maintained in the long term and that the interaction is stable.
   4. Tentative values were established for the average searching efficiency of M. aethiopoides (approximately 0.25 m2  per parasitoid per generation) and for parameters governing pseudo-interference and a functional response to host density, based on analysis of discrete parasitoid generations.
   5. Based on experimental data and field temperatures, a simulation model of daily parasitoid behaviour over summer, when generations overlap, supported the hypothesis that atypically developing parasitoids are those oviposited in newly emerged adult weevils. The model accounted for the observed atypical summer build-up of parasitism which is essential for the success of biological control.
   6. The models suggested that biological control of S. discoideus is complementary to other forms of control, including other biological control agents, because subsequent levels of parasitism appear little affected by changes in pest density.
   7. It is argued that quantitative analysis of specific biological control case studies, both successful and unsuccessful, is a vital prerequisite for improvements in general biocontrol theory and practice.

ID FLUORESCENCE
AB Effective procedures associated with storage and disposal of chemical warfare (CW) agents are important for the protection of civilian populations from inadvertent release of these agents. Emergency groups as well as citizens in surrounding communities need to know the relative effectiveness of various chemical protective clothing (CPC) ensembles in the unlikely event of such releases. A method has been developed for studying permeation of chemical warfare agent simulants through CPC materials. The experimental results characterize some commercially available CPC materials. Thirteen different CPC materials having widely differing compositions were chosen to study the permeation of four different liquid CW simulants (dimethyl methyl phosphonate, diisopropyl methyl phosphonate, malathion, and dibutyl sulfide) through these CPC materials at 25-degrees-C. This permeation study involved a newly developed analytical technique employing room temperature fluorescence quenching of an indicator compound, phenanthrene, on filter paper. Various experimental factors such as breakthrough time, rate of permeation and uptake were investigated. On the basis of breakthrough time, the 13 CPC materials could be divided into three groups: most resistant, moderately resistant, and least resistant. Materials in the most resistant category exhibited no permeation by any of the simulants for at least 24 hours. Breakthrough occurred in the least resistant materials in generally less than an hour, and sometimes as soon as a few minutes.

AB A one-dimensional kinematic model is used to investigate the effects of silver iodide seeding in the region of a Cb cloud between isotherms of -8-degrees-C and -12-degrees-C. The agent interaction with cloud atmosphere is simulated by an improved microphysical model version which includes phoretic processes. The behaviour of the different agent types is investigated using the maximum values of agent mixing ratios and corresponding agent particle masses and radii.
   It is shown that the agent residence time in the seeding zone significantly depends on vertical velocity. The residence time is comparable to that previously reported. On the other side, the final graupel production decreases slightly when vertical velocity increases, while the corresponding graupel production is quite different for agents used. The main agent nucleation mechanisms are the Brownian coagulation of cloud droplets, inertial impact of cloud droplets and deposition nucleation.

AB Enhanced Co migration in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA, referred to below as Y) at U.S. Department of Energy waste sites may be due to the presence of Co(III)-Y rather than Co(II)-Y chelates in groundwaters. To examine the implication of this for the attenuation of Co in soils and subsoils, the absorption of equimolar Co and Y by delta-Al2O3 was examined for ranges of pH (5-9.5), adsorbate concentration (0.2-10 muM), adsorbent concentration (0.1-10 g/L), and ionic strength (0.1-0.001 M NaClO4) in the presence of dissolved Al (0.2-10 muM in equilibrium with delta-Al2O3. The anionic Co(II)-Y and Co(III)-Y chelates exhibited ligand-like adsorption behavior as a function of pH; however, under identical conditions, Co(III)-Y adsorption was much less than that of Co(II)-Y. Dissolved Al competed with Co(II) for Y and, in both Co(II)-Y and Y-only experiments, Al-Y appeared to adsorb, although the affinity of surface hydroxyls (XOH) is greater for Co(II)-Y than for Al-Y. Significant variation in Co(II)-Y and Al-Y adsorption with ionic strength suggests that there is a major electrostatic contribution to adsorption and supports the hypothesis that these chelates form outer-sphere complexes (ion pairs) with XOH. Evidence for competition between XOH and Y for the Co(II) occurs only at the highest adsorbent-to-adsorbate ratio (10 g/L: 0.5 muM = Co(II) = Y), where Co(II)- and Co(II)-Y adsorption occur simultaneously for pH > 8. Outer-sphere surface complexes between XOH and the free carboxylate groups of the chelated Al and Co are proposed to describe absorption.

AB Limbic seizures (forepaw clonus) were induced in Lewis rats by subcutaneous injections of lithium (3 mEq/kg) followed 24 h later by a muscarinic agent. Either 7 days before, 7 days after, or on the day of seizures, rats were inoculated with a spinal cord preparation. Other groups received these preparations but served as treatment (no seizure) controls. In three separate experiments, rats in which seizures had been induced at the time of inoculation displayed significant increases in the severity of clinical symptoms 14-20 days later relative to controls while rats in which seizures had been induced 7 days after inoculation displayed less severe symptoms; the latter effect was partially simulated by multiple injections of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone. The immunofacilitation effect was much stronger than the immunosuppression and explained 25-30% of the variance in the clinical severity scores.

AB 1 Conscious, Long Evans rats (n = 10), chronically instrumented for the measurement of regional haemodynamics, were studied on 3 consecutive experimental days to assess responses to angiotensin II (AII) (I 25 pmol kg-1, i.v.) and noradrenaline (1 nmol kg-1, i.v.) in the absence and presence of the AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123319 (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) (day 1), the AT1-receptor antagonist, EXP 3174 (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) (day 2), and PD 123319 (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) given 24 h after EXP 3174 (day 3).
   2 In naive rats (day 1), PD 123319 did not antagonize the haemodynamic effects of AII or noradrenaline. EXP 3174 (day 2) caused a marked, prolonged blockade of the haemodynamic effects of AII but not those of noradrenaline. Twenty four h after administration of EXP 3174 (day 3) there was still significant attenuation of the haemodynamic effects of AII. However, administration of PD 123319 at this time caused a further inhibition (lasting 1 h) of the effects of AII but not those of noradrenaline.
   3 An identical 3 day protocol was used in a separate group of rats (n = 6) in which the AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123177, was given instead of PD 123319, and the results were essentially the same, i.e., PD 123177 significantly attenuated the haemodynamic effects of AII but only when given 24 h after EXP 3174.
   4 In a separate group of rats (n = 4), a low dose of EXP 3174 (60 mug kg-1 i.v.) was given to naive rats in order to simulate the degree of inhibition of the effects of AII seen after administration of AT2-receptor antagonists in animals pretreated with EXP 3174. This low dose of EXP 3174 did not produce a sustained inhibition of the effects of AII and the time course of recovery of All responses was similar to that seen with PD 123319 or PD 123177 given after the high dose of EXP 3174.
   5 The apparent inhibition of the effects of All by the AT2-receptor antagonists, PD 123319 and PD 123177, when these were administered 24 h after the AT1-receptor antagonist, EXP 3174, may have been due to the functional activation of AT2-receptors and/or loss of AT2-receptor antagonist selectivity, and/or the displacement of nonspecifically bound EXP 3174 by AT2-receptor antagonists. While the latter explanation seems the most likely, these results raise the possibility that nonpeptide, AII-receptor antagonists that act at both AT1- and AT2-receptors may have therapeutic advantages over selective AT1-receptor antagonists.

AB The safety and efficacy of butoconazole nitrate 100-mg pessaries was compared with that of econazole nitrate 150-mg ovules in a three-day regimen in nonpregnant patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis. Follow-up visits occurred approximately 11 and 32 days after the completion of treatment. In microbiologic assessments of the elimination of the pathogenic Candida sp from vaginal secretions (wet-mount and culture), butoconazole was superior to econazole, both at visit 2 (89% versus 52%, respectively; P = 0.006) and at visit 3 (100% versus 67%, respectively; P = 0.014). Among patients treated with butoconazole who had a microbiologic cure at visit 2, no cases of relapse were detected a month after treatment ended. In contrast, 33.3% of econazole-treated patients experienced relapse. Clinical cures (absence of vulval and vaginal signs and/or symptoms) were comparable for the two treatment groups at visit 2 (69% for butoconazole and 82% for econazole) and also at visit 3 (80% for butoconazole and 83% for econazole). Therapeutic cures (simultaneous clinical and microbiologic cures) were numerically but not statistically superior for butoconazole at visit 2 (62% versus 48%) and at visit 3 (80% versus 58%). No serious adverse events were reported or observed with the use of either drug.

AB In this study, long term dextran sulphate sodium administration was studied to ascertain whether colorectal carcinoma could be produced in patients with long standing ulcerative colitis. Simultaneously, changes in the intestinal microflora were analysed. Low grade to high grade dysplasia was seen in three of the five hamsters treated with 1% dextran sulphate sodium solution for 100 days, while no dysplasia was detected in the eight animals concomitantly treated with metronidazole, an antianerobic microbial agent, which prevents colonic ulceration. In these two groups, none of the animals developed colorectal cancer over 100 day period. In a group treated for 180 days, seven of the eight animals had dysplasia, and one had two adenomas. Furthermore, four of the eight animals had adenocarcinoma in the transverse colon; they were protruding well differentiated adenocarcinoma in one and non-protruding lesions infiltrating into the musclaris propria in three. The three non-protruding infiltrating   adenocarcinomas were classified to be well differentiated adenocarcinoma in one and mucinous adenocarcinoma in two, resembling the type of cancer which complicates ulcerative colitis in man.

AB Macrophage-secreted prostaglandins of the E series inhibit numerous immunologic events, including IgM secretion by B lymphocytes. In this study, we investigated whether PGE also regulates the activation of normal quiescent murine B cells and subsequent isotype differentiation to IgE and IgG1 production. PGE2 and PGE1 were found to inhibit cellular enlargement induced by IL-4 or bacterial LPS, IL-4 and LPS, or anti-mu and IL-4 by approximately 75%, and completely inhibit enlargement in response to anti-mu antibody. PGE2 also suppresses activation-induced class II MHC up-regulation by 35% and expression of the low affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRII/CD23, by 30%. Interestingly, PGE completely inhibits a fraction of cells from these activation events, while other cells fully respond to activation stimuli, even in the presence of high PGE2 concentrations. Therefore, a PGE-resistant subset of B lymphocytes may exist. A closely related PG, PGF2alpha, had no immunoregulatory effect in these systems. Because PGE induces production of cAMP in B cells, we determined whether other agents that increase cAMP could inhibit B cell activation. Cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP mimicked the ability of PGE2 to inhibit B cell enlargement, and class II MHC and FcepsilonRII induction, suggesting that PGE2 signaling occurs via cAMP. In addition, cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP inhibited B cell activation much more potently (90-100% inhibition) than PGE, indicating that whereas all B cells are cAMP-sensitive only some are PGE-sensitive. Although PGE inhibits activation-associated events, we previously reported that PGE enhances IL-4 and LPS-induced differentiation to IgE and IgG1 synthesis. To investigate the relationship between the cells that are activation-inhibited and those that are differentiation-enhanced by PGE, we sorted B cell subsets by FACS and determined their relative abilities to produce IgM, IgG1, and IgE in response to IL-4 and LPS in the presence of PGE. The population of lymphocytes that was unaffected by PGE in terms of class II hyperexpression was also unaffected by PGE for Ig synthesis, again indicating a PGE-resistant subpopulation of B cells. Furthermore, the PGE activation-inhibited subset of B cells was responsive to PGE enhancement of IL-4-induced class switching, reducing IgM synthesis and inducing a sevenfold increase in IgE and IgG1 synthesis compared with other sort groups. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the B lymphocytes that are PGE activation-inhibited are the same cells that are PGE differentiation-enhanced. Thus, PGE2 and cAMP may simultaneously inhibit activation and yet act as differentiative agents, promoting lymphokine-induced B cell isotype switching.

ID INTERPENETRATING POLYMER NETWORKS
AB Study of the simultaneous interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) between diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) and unsaturated polyester (UP) was carried out at ambient temperature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the intermolecular H-bonding and functional group changes. Viscosity changes due to H-bonding and crosslinking were examined with a Brookfield viscometer. Gelation time was measured by a Techne gelation timer. Complexation between Co (II) (the promoter for UP cure) and diamine (the curing agent for DGEBA) was detected with UV-visible spectrometer. Experimental evidence revealed that intermolecular interactions were observed in systems such as DGEBA/UP, DGEBA/diamine, UP/diamine, Co (II) /diamine, DGEBA/uncured UP, and UP/uncured DGEBA. All such interactions had measurable effects on the curing behaviors for both networks, as were indicated by the viscosity changes and gelation time. The IPNs thus obtained were further characterized with rheometric dynamic spectroscopy (RDS) and differential scaning calorimetry (DSC). Partial compatibility between UP and DGEBA networks was evidenced from a main damping peak with a shoulder near glass transition temperature (T(g)) for lower UP content; while at higher UP content, only a main damping peak near T(g) was observed. DSC revealed a broad glass transition for all IPNs. The resultant IPN materials were all transparent.

TI CAN ROAD TRAFFIC LAW-ENFORCEMENT PERMANENTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
   ACCIDENTS
SO ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper it is argued that conventional analyses of road user adaptation to traffic law enforcement, based on parametric rational-choice theory, are flawed. Such analyses only consider road-user actions as a response to enforcement level and penalty size and do not simultaneously consider enforcement as a response to road-user behaviour. If each party is considered a rational agent who adapts to the other's behaviour, the proper way to analyze the outcomes is by the way of game theory. A game-theoretic model is presented and the main implications are: (i) most attempts at enforcing road traffic legislation will not have any lasting effects, either on road-user behaviour or on accidents; (ii) imposing stricter penalties (in the form of higher fines or longer prison sentences) will not affect road-user behaviour; (iii) imposing stricter penalties will reduce the level of enforcement; (iv) implementing automatic traffic surveilance techniques and/or allocating enforcement resources according to a chance mechanism, and not according to police estimates of violation probability, can make enforcement effects last, but both alternatives are difficult to implement. Relevant empirical studies are reviewed, and they seem to support the conclusions arrived at by the game-theoretic model.

AB It is not an easy task to regenerate chromium(III) ions from weak electrolyte carboxylate resins using conventional chemicals (e.g., mineral acids, saline solutions, alone or in combination).
   In areas of environmental control, referring to some specific cases of industrial effluents (e.g., tanneries), where metal complexing agents are present, additional difficulties in separation and recovery of the metals may arise by use of carboxylate form resins.
   Referring to the Cr(III)/Al(III)/Fe(III) ionic system in a solution simulating a typical spent chrome tanning bath, the exhaustion-regeneration behaviour of a commercial acrylic-based macroporous carboxylic resin (i.e., Purolite C106) is reported. The exhaustion behaviour of the resin is straightforward, whereas regeneration by using chemicals, such as sulphuric acid, sodium hydroxide, sodium sulphate, is difficult. The adoption of hydrogen peroxide in alkaline media, during the regeneration step, seems very promising.
   The general behaviour is interpreted in terms of ionic speciation and complex formation. A mechanistic explanation is provided in support of the experimental findings.

AB When conducting active experiments in the ionosphere which give rise to artificial disturbances of electron density, it is necessary to diagnose such disturbances. The study of irregularities using ground-based radio sounding methods often involves recording and analyzing ionogram traces, depending on the position, dynamics and phase of development of an artificial disturbance. Within the context of solving the problem of diagnostics, we offer a numerical model that includes blocks for calculating disturbance parameters and parameters of the recorded signal of ground-based radio sounding of the disturbance. By considering an example of the release of a plasma neutralizing agent, we study successive evolutionary stages of the disturbance and their reflection in the behaviour of additional traces on complex ionograms.

AB The formation of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine (HEVal) in hemoglobin was investigated in male F344 rats (10/group) and B6C3F1 mice (20/group) exposed to 0, 3, 10, 33, 100, or 300 (rats only) ppm ethylene oxide (ETO) by inhalation for 6 h/day for 4 weeks (5 days/week) or exposed to 100 (mice) or 300 ppm (rats) ETO for 1 or 3 days or 1, 2, or 4 weeks (5 days/week). The persistence of HEVal was studied in animals killed up to 10 days after cessation of the 4-week time-course studies. HEVal was determined by a modified Edman degradation and quantitation of the resulting pentafluorophenylthiohydantoin derivative, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The resulting experimental data were compared to simulations derived with a model for the formation and removal of hemoglobin adducts (T. R. Fennell, S. C. J. Sumner, and V. E. Walker, Cancer Epidemiol., Biomarkers & Prev., 1: 213-219, 1992). Repeated exposures of rats and mice for 4 weeks to 300 and 100 ppm ETO, respectively, led to an accumulation of HEVal that was 14 (rats) and 15 (mice) times greater than that found after 1 day of exposure 128 +/- 2 (SE) and 9.4 +/- 0.4 (SE) pmol HEVal/mg globin in rats and mice, respectively]. After cessation of exposures, HEVal was lost faster than predicted by the normal erythrocyte life span alone. An initial phase of rapid decline in HEVal concentrations was consistent with the removal of older, more heavily alkylated populations of RBCs, accompanied by a burst of erythropoiesis. The dose-response curves for HEVal were linear between 3 and 33 ppm ETO, with 3.5 +/- 0.2 and 3.4 +/- 0.3 pmol adduct/mg globin formed in rats and mice, respectively, after 4 weeks of exposure to 3 ppm ETO. Above 33 ppm ETO, the slope of the dose-response curves increased. Comparison of the dose response for HEVal in rats exposed to ETO for 4 weeks to the dose-response for N(tau)-(2-hydroxyethyl)histidine in rats exposed to the same concentrations of ETO for 2 years (S. Osterman-Golkar et al., Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen., 3: 395-405, 1983) suggested that exposures to ETO can reduce the life span of erythrocytes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Correlation of the experimental data and simulations for the formation and removal of HEVal demonstrated that perturbations in erythropoiesis and RBC life span complicate the estimation of exposures to ETO when estimates are based upon hemoglobin adduct measurements in heavily exposed individuals. However, results of these rodent studies indicate that ETO-induced erythroclastic effects are associated with high cumulative doses of the epoxide and are unlikely to occur in workers exposed near or below the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard of 1 ppm (8-h time-weighted average).

AB Spherical latex particles were used as a colloid model to investigate the aggregation process resulting from the action of electrolytes and polyelectrolytes. The colloid size distribution was directly determined using a particle counter technique. Bell shaped curves were expected for diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) when particle sticking succeeded each interparticle collision. The colloid size frequency was described by a continuously decreasing curve when reaction limited aggregation (RLA) was expected. The last mode implied that the collision efficiency for sticking might depend on the aggregate size. Starting with the cluster size distribution, we calculated the different moments of the size distribution.
   When electrostatic forces modulated the interparticle interactions, in the presence of a excess of electrolyte or at a polymer concentration inducing fast aggregation, the reduced size distribution exhibited a typical maximum and the aggregation kinetic was described by a simple scaling law. As a result, a time invariant size polydispersity characterized the long time behavior. Apart from these ideal coagulation conditions, the flocculation proceeded at a slower rate and the dynamic scaling laws required two scaling exponents, w and z. The cluster size polydispersity factor increased with aggregation period as a result of variable collision efficiency.
   When flexible polymer acted as an inter-particle bridging agent, the amount of polymer adsorbed on a colloid surface also modulated the rate of aggregation but the aggregation mode itself was only determined by the polymer/colloid interaction. Fast aggregation was found to induce maximal cluster size polydispersity.
   In all these situations, colloid aggregation modes were analyzed using the results of computer simulation of the cluster-cluster aggregation and the experimental results were presented via a scaling approach. Validity of scaling relations was verified for electrolyte and polyelectrolyte induced aggregation and the different processes corresponded to diffusion and reaction limited aggregation.

AB Background and Methods: Alinidine is a recently developed antiarrhythmic medication that acts directly on the cardiac pacemaker cells to reduce heart rate (HR). At effective doses, alinidine might have cardiodepressant actions that could be hazardous in the presence of hemodynamic instability. On the other hand, one limitation of the use of catecholamines is tachycardia, and alinidine could be beneficial in situations such as septic shock, where adrenergic agents are commonly required. The present study explored the hemodynamic and gasometric effects of alinidine during dobutamine administration in a canine model of septic shock induced by endotoxin administration.
   In ten pentobarbital-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs (weight 28 +/- 4 kg), Escherichia coli endotoxin (3 mg/kg) injection was followed 30 mins later by saline infusion to restore and maintain pulmonary artery occlusion pressure at the baseline value. Sixty minutes after the endotoxin administration, a dobutamine infusion was started at a rate of 10-mu-g/kg/min. Thirty minutes later, alinidine was administered as a bolus dosage of 1 mg/kg in five dogs; the other five dogs served as a control group.
   Results: Alinidine administration resulted in a decrease in HR from 157 +/- 20 to 138 +/- 27 beats/min (p < .01) and a nonsignificant increase in cardiac output from 5.2 +/- 3.0 to 6.8 +/- 2.8 L/min, as a consequence of increases in stroke volume from 31.9 +/- 15.3 to 49.2 +/- 13.9 mL (p < .01) and in left ventricular stroke work from 32.1 +/- 20.0 to 57.4 +/- 32.1 g.m (p < .05).
   Conclusions: During experimental septic shock, alinidine administration can reverse dobutamine-induced tachycardia and simultaneously improve ventricular function.

AB We addressed several controversial issues regarding the impact of predatory fish on prey in natural streams in Kentucky by experimentally adding predatory green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus, to four stream pools that contained small-mouthed salamander larvae, Ambystoma barbouri, while leaving four other pools as fishless controls.  We monitored the density, drift (in and out of pools), and habitat use of the larvae before and for 1 mo after fish addition (until larvae began to undergo metamorphosis).  By quantifying larval density and drift, we were able to address two issues:  (1) effect of prey exchange on predator impacts; and (2) relative contribution to total predator impact of predation per se vs. predator-induced emigration.
   Larval densities and behaviors were similar in experimental and control pools before fish addition.  After fish addition:  (1) density decreased more rapidly in fish pools than in control pools; (2) larvae in fish pools spent more time under rocks and less time in deep, central areas than did larvae in control pools; and (3) larval overnight drift rates (proportion of larval in a pool, drifting out overnight) were higher in fish pools than in control pools.
   We calculated weekly average rates of change in larval density in fish and control pools and found that densities in control pools decreased very little except during a period with flooding; that is, flooding was a major cause of population reduction in fishless pools.  In contrast, in fish pools, densities decreased steadily.  Interestingly, the rate of decrease in larval density in fish pools was lower during the flood period than during other periods.  This might be due to an increase in net drift into fish pools, or a decrease in fish predation during floods.
   Although net drift (drift in minus drift out) showed a tendency to be positive, it did not differ significantly from zero in any situation (fish or control pools, day or night).  In particular, fish-induced increases in larval per capita emigration rates offset high immigration rates into fish pools.  Because there was no significant net drift into fish pools, immigration could not swamp predator impacts.  Because there was no significant net drift out of fish pools, the decrease in larval density in fish pools can be explained entirely by predation per se, rather than by predator-induced emigration.
   Our data suggested that, in the experiment year, almost-equal-to 30-40% of all larvae in this population drifted through a fish pool at some time in their lives; this estimate is conservative because we were unable to get data on drift rates during floods.  On average, only almost-equal-to 6-8% of the larvae that drifted into a fish pool survived to drift out the downstream end.  Thus fish predation should be a strong selective agent favoring behaviors that enhance larval survivorship and drift out of fish pools.
   Auxiliary experiments showed that:  (1) larvae decrease their activity when they first drift into fish pools; this presumably decreases the conspicuousness of these larvae to visual predators; (2) the presence of fish is associated with a larval shift in diurnal activity towards greater activity at night rather than in the daytime; this is associated with drift out at night; and (3) larvae alter their refuge use and drift in response to caged fish, from which larvae probably only receive chemical cues.
   Overall, our study is one of the few to simultaneously monitor predator effects on prey population dynamics, dispersal, and refuge use.  Information on each of these variables helped us to better understand predator effects on the other variables; we suggest that it should be generally useful to monitor a relatively full set of prey responses to predators.

AB Two categories of models have been developed to describe the mass transfer process in emulsion liquid membrane extraction of phenols/amines from waste water. In the first the reaction between the transferred solutes and the trapping agent in the internal phase is assumed to be irreversible while in the second a reversible reaction is involved. Generally the various authors have tested the proposed models against their own experimental data. The present study is an attempt to investigate the efficacy of the reversible reaction model of Bunge and Noble, which is simpler to use and requires input of less parameters to predict the experimental data reported by different authors. It is shown that by introducing a shape factor into the model for the effective diffusivity of solute within the macrodrop, it is possible to use this model to simulate experimental data of other groups reasonably well.

AB A model based on the shrinking-core principle is presented for three cases of oxidative metal leaching from nonporous mineral particles. Several limitations inherent in the assumptions of the traditional shrinking-core model, such as those of oxidation agent in excess and first-order irreversible kinetics, are overcome. In each case, an unconventional behavior observed in experimental data is explained through numerical leaching simulations.

ID RATIONALITY
AB A growing tradition in analyzing bargaining behaviour uses an experimental setup to control parameters of the underlying conflict. Game theory is used to model the conflict, to analyze the possible actions of the agents and the arguments that can be used within the bargaining process, and to understand the results of the bargaining. In face-to-face bargaining especially, large variations occur in the results within a given class of situations (with the same game used). It is a major task of bargaining research to explain this variance. This task requires a bounded rationality approach. In an earlier paper I reported some results on the influence of the social field on the bargaining process. This paper deals with individual aspiration processing as a further explanation for the course and results of observed bargaining sequences. Simulations based on individual aspiration processing are compared with experimental data; the fit is imperfect but some of the deviations can be explained.

TI APROTININ - THE IDEAL ANTICOAGULANT

LA English
DT Article
DE APROTININ; HEPARIN; THROMBOSIS; ANTICOAGULANT
AB The serine proteinase inhibitor, aprotinin, significantly reduces transfusion requirements during open heart surgery.  Whether this benefit is associated with an increased tendency to thrombosis has not been studied.  We investigated the effect of aprotinin in an experimental arterial thrombosis model.  In 17 male Sprague-Dawley rats, the infrarenal aorta was replaced with 1.0-mm diameter PTFE grafts of varying lengths.  The time to graft occlusion, recorded by palpation, Doppler ultrasound and a distal bleeding test, was 20.2 +/- 1.8 min, 35.8 +/- 6.1 min and 43.7 +/- 6.6 min for grafts of 10, 7.5 and 5.0 mm respectively (r = -0.98, p < 0.05).  Following PTFE graft placement 24 Sprague-Dawley rats were given saline (n = 6), aprotinin (n = 6), heparin (n = 6), and heparin + aprotinin (n = 6).  The time to occlusion was significantly prolonged in the aprotinin group (71.7 +/- 20.4 min vs. 20.2 +/- 1.8 min, p < 0.05).  The time to thrombosis for heparin + aprotinin and heparin alone was also significantly prolonged (p < 0.05).  Prothrombin times (PT) were 21.9 +/- 3.0 s for control, 29.4 +/- 6.2 s for aprotinin, 40.7 +/- 2.5 s for heparin and 39.9 +/- 14.5 s for heparin + aprotinin (p < 0.05 vs. control for all values).  Bleeding time was not prolonged with aprotinin (3.0 +/- 0.9 min vs. 2.9 +/- 0.7 min).  The bleeding time was 18.9 +/- 4.1 min for heparin + aprotinin and 22.5 +/- 2.3 min for heparin alone (p < 0.05 vs. control for both values).  This analysis demonstrates that high doses of aprotinin induce a significant anti-coagulant effect in a simple experimental thrombosis model.  This effect is less than that seen with heparin and is not associated with abnormalities in the bleeding time.  The simultaneous administration of heparin and aprotinin does not have a cumulative anti-coagulant effect although the presence of heparin with aprotinin results in prolonged prothrombin and bleeding times.  Thus aprotinin does not reduce increased thrombosis in this model.  We speculate that aprotinin may be the ideal agent for anti-coagulation in surgery.

AB Methylphosphonate (MP)-substituted antisense DNA oligomers have significant Potential for genome targeted therapy. The physicochemical basis of the difference in R- versus S-MP diastereomers incorporated into DNA oligomers with regard to complementary DNA target hybridization has been poorly understood. State of the art advanced molecular computational methods and supercomputer technology were applied to identify key physicochemical determinants involved in stabilizing and destabilizing target hybridization. MP-oligomer:DNA target hybridization is more stable with R-MP substitution and is due to favorable hydrophobic interactions between the equatorial projecting methyl group and water molecules. S-MP destabilizes the double strand helix formation by less favorable local hydrophobic interactions with waters, which result in DNA helix unwinding, and by promoting local changes from C2' endo to C3' endo in the 5' furanose ring. In the oligomer studied, R-MP thymine is more stable than R-MP uracil, resulting from hydrophobic interaction to locally stabilize the helix due to the presence of the pyrimidine C5 methyl group. The presence of the C5 methyl group in thymine also appears to influence helical winding and the local conformation of the furanose ring. These numerical simulations are supported by experimental data, enabling us to propose several mechanisms which underlie some of the experimental observations. These results support further development of diastereomerically pure MP analogues as diagnostic/therapeutic agents involving sequence-specific DNA interactions.

AB Lipotrope-deficient (methyl-deficient) diets cause fatty livers and increased liver-cell turnover and promote carcinogenesis in rodents. In rats prolonged intake of methyl-deficient diets results in liver tumor development. The mechanisms responsible for the cancer-promoting and carcinogenic properties of this deficiency remain unclear. The results of the experiments described here lend support to the hypothesis that intake of such a diet, by causing depletion of S-adenosylmethionine pools, results in DNA hypomethylation, which in turn leads to changes in expression of genes that may have key roles in regulation of growth. In livers of rats fed a severely methyl-deficient diet (MDD), lowered pools of S-adenosylmethionine and hypomethylated DNA were observed within 1 week. The extent of DNA hypomethylation increased when MDD was fed for longer periods. The decreases in overall levels of DNA methylation were accompanied by simultaneous alterations in gene expression, yielding patterns that closely resembled those reported to occur in livers of animals exposed to cancer-promoting chemicals and in hepatomas. Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNAs from livers of rats fed control or deficient diets showed that, after 1 week of MDD intake, there were large increases in levels of mRNAs for the c-myc and c-fos oncogenes, somewhat smaller increases in c-Ha-ras mRNA, and virtually no change in levels of c-Ki-ras mRNA. In contrast, mRNAs for epidermal growth factor receptor decreased significantly. The elevated levels of expression of the c-myc, c-fos, and c-Ha-ras genes were accompanied by selective changes in patterns of methylation within the sequences specifying these genes. Changes in DNA methylation and in gene expression induced in livers of rats fed MDD for 1 month were gradually reversed after restoration of an adequate diet. In hepatomas induced by prolonged dietary methyl deficiency, methylation patterns of c-Ki-ras and c-Ha-ras were abnormal. Although human diets are unlikely to be as severely methyl deficient as those used in these experiments, in some parts of the world intake of diets that are low in methionine and choline and contaminated with mycotoxins, such as aflatoxin, are common. Even in industrialized nations, deficiencies of folic acid and vitamin B-12 are not uncommon and are exacerbated by some therapeutic agents and by substance abuse. Thus, it seems possible that interactions of diet and contaminants or drugs, by inducing changes in DNA methylation and aberrant gene expression, may contribute to cancer causation in humans.

AB Previous clinical studies on the train-of-four (TOF) fade have used different recording techniques, anesthesia agents and muscles for measurement, thus comparison of the results has become difficult.  On 49 surgical patients divided into 6 groups, we compared:  1) the TOF fade ratios (T4/T1) produced by d-tubocurarine (dTc), pancuronium (P), atracurium (A), and vecuronium (V) and 2) the influence of previously given suxamethonium on TOF ratios (dTc and P).  Neuromuscular block (NMB) was monitored simultaneously by electromyography (EMG) and by mechanomyography (MMG).  Differences between the TOF fade ratios of different groups were determined and statistically analyzed by ANOVA of repeated measures, 1) at onset, as compared to spontaneous recovery with the same agent, 2) between NMB agents at (a) onset and (b) during recovery.  Results:  TOF fade was significantly more pronounced during spontaneous recovery than during onset of NMB:  a) with all NMB agents, b) with both EMG and MMG responses, with bolus dose administration of the agents, c) the degrees of TOF fade significantly differed between NMB agents during onset, d) the degrees of TOF fade (MMG) were more pronounced during onset when the agents were given in incremental doses following succinylcholine as compared to degrees of fade following single bolus doses in the absence of succinylcholine.  During recovery, there was also difference in the TOF fade ratios among the agents:  dTc and P produced more fade than A and V.  There were variable differences during recovery between the groups which received succinylcholine and incremental doses of dTc and P vs those which received these agents in single bolus doses.  Since there were two variables (e.g. mode of administration and succinylcholine) between these groups, no reasonable explanation can be offered to explain these differences during the recovery phase.

AB This article presents an empirical analysis of credit-constrained households in which models of both demand and supply sides of the market for loans are simultaneously estimated.  We develop a discrete-choice logit model of the consumers' decision on whether or not to apply for credit.  Combining this with a reduced-form logistic model for the banks' credit-granting decision, we then estimate the model with cross-sectional data, as a nonlinear, ordered, sequential logit.  Our findings shed light on the criteria used by banks in assessing credit applications and reveal the strong dependence of preferences on demographic characteristics.  The results also suggest that agents face significant fixed costs in applying for loans.  The fact that we jointly estimate models of both supply and demand sides of the credit market enables us to examine whether particular groups in the population are more frequently credit rationed because they tend to demand more loans or because they are viewed as bad credit risks by lenders.

AB Background: One objective of regional chemotherapy is to achieve therapeutic drug levels in local tissues and primary nodal drainage fields, while minimizing systemic drug toxicity. The composition of the drug-delivery vehicle may influence local drug absorption and thereby modulate both tissue drug levels and systemic toxicity. Purpose: We evaluated the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a drug-delivery vehicle on regional and systemic levels of doxorubicin (DOX) and on the cytotoxicity of DOX following continuous intravesical administration in an invasive rat transitional cell bladder carcinoma model. Methods: F344 rats received continuous intravesical DOX infusion for a 7-day period using a regional drug administration system. A constant dose of DOX was adnministered in one of three DMSO concentrations (0%, 10%, or 50%) to groups of animals (N = 20 per group). These concentrations corresponded to target urinary concentrations of 0%, 0.1%, and 0.5%, respectively. DOX levels in urine, serum, muscle, liver, bladder wall, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were measured using a fluorescence assay on experimental days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (N = four animals/group per day). In vitro assays evaluated the effect of DMSO concentration on the cytotoxicity of DOX against six transitional cell carcinoma cell lines. A final experiment on rats with established bladder tumors compared the cytoreductive effect of continuous intravesical infusion of DOX in 50% DMSO with that of DOX alone and with that in a sham-treated control group; there were 20 rats in each group. Results: Mean and peak tissue and serum levels of DOX increased as a direct function of DMSO concentration. Compared with the results in controls, mean concentrations of DOX in the bladder were increased 7.1-fold and 12.1-fold in the groups given 10% and 50% DMSO, respectively. Average drug concentrations in the lymph nodes were increased 9.6-fold and 9.3-fold in the groups given 10% and 50% DMSO, respectively. In vitro, DMSO synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX in two of the six cell lines studied. Solubilizing the test agent in 5 % DMSO reduced the IC50 (drug concentration required to reduce cell viability to 50% of control values) to an average of 56 +/- 41 % (+/- SD) of control values; 10% DMSO further decreased the average IC50 to 20% +/- 18% (+/- SD) of control values. The mean bladder tumor weight of animals treated with the combination of DOX and DMSO was 0.52 g. This compared with a mean tumor-bearing bladder weight of 2.69 g in the control group (P = .012) and 0.80 g in the group treated with DOX alone (P = .0544). Conclusions: These results suggest that the use of DMSO as a solvent vehicle for DOX improves drug absorption while simultaneously potentiating DOX cytotoxicity. The use of DMSO as a drug carrier merits further evaluation as a way of enhancing the efficacy of regional chemotherapy regimens.

AB Dithioerythritol (DTE) is frequently employed as a reducing agent or a protective reagent for thiol groups in biological assays. Owing to its known inhibiting properties in enzyme catalysis reactions, lead is also commonly used in such experiments, and often simultaneously with DTE. Given the potential affinity of these two reactants, their measured individual effects may well depend on their interactions in the medium used. Any quantitative assessment of these interactions necessitates, however, that the complex equilibria between lead and DTE be investigated beforehand. To test this hypothesis, the formation constants of lead(II) complexes with DTE under physiological conditions (37-degrees, NaCl 0.15 M) have been calculated from the results of glass electrode potentiometry, with the help of the MINIQUAD and ESTA computer programs. The pK values for dissociation of DTE have been found equal to 8.926 +/- 0.003 and 9.840 +/- 0.003. The following lead-DTE species have been characterized: ML (12.774 +/- 0.037), MLH-1 (2.858 +/- 0.037), M2LH-1 (13.349 +/- 0.025) and M6L5 (86.586 +/- 0.099); the log *beta-values are given in the parentheses. Appropriate computer simulations effectively show that the interactions of the two reactants are indeed quite significant within the concentration ranges commonly used in in vitro biological assays. They should thus be taken into account in interpretation of the effects observed.

AB Microhabitat selection by Simulium vittatum Zetterstedt larvae in a flume was studied at different mainstream velocities on two substrates: a thin flat plate parallel to the flow and a cylinder in cross flow. The results do not support the generally accepted assumptions that simuliid larvae keep within the boundary layer to avoid the direct influence of mainstream current and that they select the fastest velocity available when offered a longitudinal velocity gradient within their tolerance range. Instead, larvae gathered along the zone of boundary layer separation and remained along the stagnation line at the leading point of the cylinder when artificially positioned there. Further, under most conditions, larvae avoided zones of maximum surface shear stress. Larval reaction to hydraulic changes was immediate. It is hypothesized that S. vittatum larvae first scan the velocity profile at the substrate, initially moving toward increasing flow velocity (or water acceleration). They then cue on a steep velocity gradient along the body as part of the processes involved in choosing a location for suspension feeding. Such conditions would maximize particle flux through the labral fans and minimize drag forces on the bulbous posterior abdomen. This study provides the first direct evidence for microhydraulic factors as causative agents in the formation of simuliid larval assemblages.

   (I-123-PARAPPA) SCINTIGRAPHY .2. CLINICAL-RESULTS

DT Article
AB Our results establish that myocardial regions supplied by a significantly stenosed coronary vessel can be distinguished with high statistical significance from healthy regions on account of changes in the myocardium/background ratio, i.e. a reduction of regional uptake of 15-(p-iodo-phenyl) pentadecanoic acid (pPPA). The statistical significance applies to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), to all examined CAD areas without areas of infarction as well as to infarcted regions. Our results also confirm the suitability of labelled fatty acids, such as pPPA, for the visualization of damaged myocardial regions. The results further indicate that pPPA practically is of comparable value to Tl-201 with regard to their respective qualities as 'static' imaging agents for the heart muscle.
   This study, with the help of a simultaneous analysis of regional myocardial perfusion rates (rMBF) and of a parameter for the metabolism of fatty acids, practised here for the first time, could demonstrate interindividual differences between patients and groups of patients with a correlation between perfusion and the utilization of pPPA in patients with CAD. The reciprocal of the rMBF, the mean transit time (MTT), was significantly prolonged after stress in patients with CAD (P < 0.05), suggesting impaired 'microcirculation' in the patient group.
   The determination of elimination half-lives (T1/2) contributes little if any information towards delineation of cardiac disease entities. The wide overlap of T1/2 values between various clinical syndromes and entities with extreme standard deviations remained an annoying problem in our studies. Nevertheless, certain trends in T1/2 behaviour could be recorded, but they did not yield any statistical significances, because of the high degree of individual variability. A considerable variability of T1/2 values among healthy controls was recorded as well as intra-individually in different regions of the heart muscle. The wide range of 'normal' values rendered statistical evaluation almost, if not entirely, impossible. It appears that the high degree of variability results amongst others, from technical shortcomings in the external recording instruments, i.e. gamma cameras, as well as from the presence of interfering alternate substrates such as glucose and lactate. Nevertheless, the wide range of measured results in healthy control subjects suggests the presence of a considerable regional intra-individual heterogeneity of cardiac substrate metabolism.
   One must therefore accept, at least in our opinion, that T1/2 values are not sufficiently reliable as an indicator of myocardial metabolism and are of little value with respect to clinical diagnostic considerations and to prognosis as well. Possible explanations for this finding are offered and discussed in this paper.

AB Pregnancy is associated with decreases of blood pressure and vascular sensitivity to vasopressor agents.  We have hypothesized that the increased liberation of endogenous vasodilator(s) by the vascular endothelium or other structures could mediate these blunted responses.  Thoracic aorta rings of nonpregnant, 21 days pregnant, and first day post partum rats respond similarly to acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant.  In contrast, the potency of the response to sodium nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasorelaxant, is unchanged in tissues of pregnant rats and increased (p < 0.05) in those of post partum animals.  In the presence of indomethacin (10-mu-mol/L) the three groups of tissues show a decreased potency.  The effects of phenylephrine on aortic rings of both nonpregnant and pregnant rats are markedly increased in the presence of N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine.  Indeed, the concentration producing 50% of the maximum response of phenylephrine decreases (p < 0.001) from 50.7 to 8.02, from 93.8 to 37.6, and from 60.4 to 5.97 nmol/L with the use of N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine (0.1 mmol/L) in rings from nonpregnant, pregnant, and postpartum rats, respectively.  Simultaneously, the maximum response to phenylephrine increases markedly in three groups of tissues.  In the presence of N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine, indomethacin does not influence the response to phenylephrine.  Our results do not support the possible involvement of an endogenous vasodilator (prostaglandin-like or endothelium-derived) in the blunted responses to vasoconstrictors during pregnancy.

TI ADSORPTIVE PRECONCENTRATION FOR VOLTAMMETRIC MEASUREMENTS OF TRACE LEVEL

SO ANALYTICAL LETTERS

   ANALYSIS
ID MERCURY DROP ELECTRODE; STRIPPING VOLTAMMETRY
AB This paper describes an electrochemical stripping procedure for ultratrace measurements of iron, in which preconcentration is achieved by the adsorption of a iron-[2-thiazolylazo)-4- methyl phenol] complex onto a static mercury drop electrode.  Cyclic voltammetry was used to characterize the interfacial and redox behavior.  For a 5 minute preconcentration time, the detection limit found was 1.8 x 10(-9) mol/l.  Optimum experimental conditions were found by the use of a stirred triethanolamine (pH 8.6) solution with 2-[2-thiazolylazo- 4- methyl phenol] concentration of 1.0 x 10(-5) mol/l, a preconcentration potential of -0.46V and linear scan mode.  With preconcentration for 30 sec., calibration plots for iron are linear for the 5-29mug/l range.  Possible interferences by masking agents and several trace ions have been investigated.  The interference of copper and uranium are eliminated by addition of CyDTA and carbonate ion respectively.  Simultaneous determination of iron with copper and nickel is possible.  The merits of the aforementioned procedure are demonstrated in the analysis of fresh water.

TI EFFECTS OF LIFE-INSURANCE PRICE REBATING ON SIMULATED SALES ENCOUNTERS
SO JOURNAL OF RISK AND INSURANCE
LA English
DT Article
ID CONSUMER; PERSPECTIVE; AUTOMOBILES; INVOLVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Pressure exists for the repeal of insurance anti-rebating laws. Research on price negotiation and insurance selling suggests-consequences in terms of agent/consumer behavior, attitudes, and perception. Hypotheses are evaluated in an experimental simulation of the life insurance sales situation under different rebating conditions. Evidence suggests little actual rebating but a tendency for consumers to delay purchase as a bargaining ploy. Consumers' psychological reactions are found to be contingent on their price negotiation orientation and insurance involvement. Female negotiators and highly involved males are favorable, while others are unfavorable. Agents have a negative evaluation of participating in price negotiation and question the effectiveness of sales interaction.

AB Almost 200 pharmaceutical chemicals and groups of drugs have been evaluated for their carcinogenic properties by working groups convened by the International Agency for the Research on Cancer. Therapeutic agents are exceptional environmental carcinogens in that humans are exposed to relatively pure substances at well-defined dosages. Of those evaluated, 20 are conclusively carcinogenic to humans and 52 are probably or possibly carcinogenic. The human tissues most often affected are bone marrow, skin, urinary bladder, liver, lymphatic tissue and endometrium. In cases in which there is sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity from both epidemiological and experimental studies, the similarity between humans and animals with regard to the target organs involved is close (85%). Since data on carcinogenicity exist for several groups of pharmaceuticals, risk versus benefit evaluations should be made carefully in relation to possible clinical applications.

TI PROPRANOLOL THERAPY ALTERS ESTIMATION OF POTENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK

AB We studied the effect of propranolol administration on risk assessment based on submaximal exercise testing performed early after myocardial infarction.  A total of 70 patients with recent infarction underwent modified Bruce treadmill testing with simultaneous measurement of expired gases in the absence of antianginal agents including beta-antagonists.  Among these, 31 patients who had at least one of the following abnormalities-ST depression greater-than-or-equal-to 1 mm (22 patients), chest pain (four patients), or treadmill time < 360 seconds (12 patients)-were studied in a randomized double-blind fashion and received either placebo or 240 mg of propranolol/day.  A total of 28 patients completed the randomized phase and were able to undergo repeat exercise testing an average of 3.4 +/- 1.8 days later.  Randomized groups were equivalent at baseline except for a higher peak oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (p < 0.05) in the propranolol compared with the placebo group; these differences were taken into account in statistical analyses of the study data.  Resting heart rate (59 +/- 1.2 versus 82 +/- 4.2 beats/min) and peak heart rate X systolic blood pressure (14,208 +/- 496 versus 20,075 +/- 1,062) were both significantly less (p < 0.01) after propranolol than after placebo.  Eight of nine patients treated with placebo maintained ST depression greater-than-or-equal-to 1 mm from the initial to the randomized exercise test, compared with only 4 of 13 receiving propranolol (p < 0.01).  In those with continued ST depression, time to positivity was significantly longer in those receiving propranolol compared with those taking placebo (538 +/- 73 versus 318 +/- 44 seconds, p < 0.05).  In contrast, the peak ratio between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption was higher in those receiving propranolol compared with those receiving placebo (0.93 +/- 0.04 versus 0.81 +/- 0.03, p < 0.05).  We conclude that propranolol therapy reduces evidence of ischemia and changes traditional estimates of potential cardiac risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing.

TI RECTAL THIOPENTAL COMPARED WITH INTRAMUSCULAR MEPERIDINE, PROMETHAZINE,
   AND CHLORPROMAZINE FOR PEDIATRIC SEDATION
SO ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Study objectives:  We studied the hypothesis that rectal thiopental is an effective agent for emergency department pediatric sedation and may have advantages over a more traditional regimen.
   Design:  Rectal thiopental 25 mg/kg was compared with the combination of meperidine 2 mg/kg, promethazine 1 mg/kg, and chlorpromazine 1 mg/kg in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.
   Type of participants:  Children between 18 months and 6 years of age presenting to our teaching hospital ED for laceration repair were entered after the clinical decision was made to sedate.  Patients with altered sensorium, medical contraindications to sedation, or medication allergy were excluded.
   Interventions:  After informed consent, each patient received IM injection (drug combination or placebo) and rectal suspension (rectal thiopental or placebo) simultaneously.
   Measurements and main results:  Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and pediatric Glasgow Coma Scores were recorded before and every 15 minutes after sedation until discharge.  Intradermal lidocaine and suturing began when the patient appeared adequately sedated, and response was numberically scored.  Patients were discharged when able to stand.  Twenty-nine patients 34 +/- 13 months old were studied.  Fifteen patients received rectal thiopental, and 14 received the drug combination.  Analysis using the Wilcoxon two-sample test revealed no differences in age, sex, weight, or wound location between groups.  The time course of sedation was different for the two treatment regimens.  At 15 and 30 minutes after administration, patients who received rectal thiopental were more deeply sedated than those who received the drug combination, as evidenced by significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scores (P < .05).  Accordingly, time from medication administration to suturing was 29 +/- 12 minutes in the thiopental group and 54 +/- 33 minutes (P < .01) in the drug combination group.  Patients in the thiopental group also recovered more quickly and were discharged approximately one-half hour earlier than those in the drug combination group (89 +/- 25 vs 120 +/- 44 minutes, P < .05).  No difference in response to lidocaine injection or suturing was demonstrated between the groups.  Laceration repair time was comparable between the groups.  There were eight sedation failures (three of 15 in thiopental group and five of 14 in drug combination group, P = NS).  Vital signs remained stable, no adverse reactions occurred, and no patient had decreased oxygen saturation to less than 95%.
   Conclusion:  Rectal thiopental is superior to this drug combination for pediatric sedation because it can be administered painlessly, has a more rapid onset and offset of action, and is of equal safety and efficacy at the dosage studied.

TI FURTHER EVALUATION OF THE TETRODOTOXIN-RESISTANT CIRCADIAN PACEMAKER IN
   THE SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEI
SO JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RHYTHMS
LA English

ID RAT; NEURONS; RHYTHM; VASOPRESSIN; RELEASE; RODENTS; PERIOD
AB We previously reported the results of an experimental paradigm in which tetrodotoxin (TTX) was chronically infused by miniosmotic pump into the rat suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) (Schwartz et al., 1987).  Although TTX reversibly blocked photic entrainment and overt expression of the circadian drinking rhythm, the circadian pacemaker in the SCN continued to oscillate unperturbed by the toxin, and we concluded that Na+-dependent action potentials are not a part of the SCN pacemaker's internal timekeeping mechanism.  In the research reported in the present paper, we used our paradigm to chronically infuse other agents, in order to evaluate the validity of this interpretation further.
   (1) Infusion of 50% procaine into the SCN of blinded rats resulted in a disorganized circadian drinking rhythm during the infusion, after which behavioral rhythmicity returned without apparent phase shift.  In intact rats, procaine reduced the phase-resetting action of a reversed light-dark cycle imposed during the infusion.  Thus, the effects of voltage-dependent Na+ channel blockade by a local anesthetic resemble those produced by TTX.
   (2) Infusion of high (20 mM) K+ or 100-mu-M veratridine into the SCN of blinded rats resulted in an apparent phase advance of the circadian drinking rhythm by over 4 hr.  The phase-shifting effect of veratridine was blocked by simultaneous infusion of 1-mu-M TTX.  Thus, membrane depolarization or direct activation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels can affect the pacemaker's oscillation.  Our infusion paradigm can detect alterations of rhythm phase, and the lack of phase shift after TTX or procaine infusion is not an artifact of an insensitive method.

AB 51 gnotobiotic and 63 conventional, one-, or two-days-old piglets were divided into five groups and infected orally with Isospora suis or rotavirus alone, or with both agents simultaneously or successively with alternative sequences and various intervals.  15 gnotobiotic and 10 conventional piglets served as controls.  The development of small intestinal lesions after infection with I. suis was biphasic.  The dominant alterations resulting from rotavirus infection was villus atrophy, considerably more pronounced and extensive in gnotobiotic than in conventional piglets. Synergistic action of I. suis and rotavirus was manifested both clinically, and morphologically.  This action culminated at the time of the actual, or presumed development of merogony of I. suis, i.e. on DPI 3 to 5.  The action develops only if the intestinal epithelium is damaged functionally and morphologically by a preceding rotavirus infection.  It is concluded that the synergistic action is based on a competition of rotavirus and I. suis for mature, enzymatically active absorptive cells.

AB The relative binding thermodynamics of trimethoprim [2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine] congeners to chicken dihydrofolate reductase are determined by free energy simulation methods.  The congeners considered in this study represent methoxy to ethyl substitutions at the 3'-, 4'-, and 5'-positions of trimethoprim found at the benzyl portion of the inhibitor.  Molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-inhibitor complexes, and the evaluation of potential energy interactions between inhibitor and protein, were evaluated for their ability to predict trends similar to those found for the thermodynamic simulations.  The relative free energy trends for the 3',5'-diethyl and 3',4',5'-triethyl derivatives of trimethoprim follow those observed experimentally for identical inhibitor compounds.  An observation of a reversal of enzyme preference for species with 3'- or 5'-ethyl functional groups, depending on the absence or presence of a 4'-ethyl group, demonstrates complex influences by active site atoms on the relative thermodynamics of inhibitor binding.  Potential energy data derived from molecular dynamics of inhibitor-protein complexes show no demonstrable correlation to experimental results or calculated thermodynamic data.

AB Ten-mo-old broiler feeders were fed nicarbazin (NCZ) at 0, 25, 50, and 100 ppm of their diet for 2, 4, or 6 days to simulate accidental contamination of their feed with the medicant.  Reduced egg production was observed in all treatments except 25 and 50 ppm NCZ for 2 days.  A consistent reduction in egg weight occurred only at the maximum treatment level of 100 ppm for 6 days.  Reduction in hatchability was generally evident by Days 5 and 6 of the experiment except for the lowest treatment of 25 ppm NCZ for 2 days.  Due partially to the low number of eggs set, no statistically significant reduction in hatchability was seen for the group receiving 50 ppm NCZ for 4 days, but hatchability had dropped over 17 percentage points (from 93.3 to 75.5%) by Days 5 and 6 of the experiment, and continued to drop to a low of 31% on Days 11 and 12 of the experiment.  Shell pigmentation was the most sensitive characteristic measured, with significant depigmentation occurring after only 2 days of feeding 25 ppm NCZ.  Generally, the severity and duration of effects were in proportion to medicant concentration and length of treatment time.  Fertility was not influenced by the medicant.

AB A general microscopic interaction model is proposed to describe the changes in the physical properties of phospholipid bilayer membranes due to foreign molecules which, to different degrees, partition between the membrane phases and the aqueous environment.  The model is a multi-state lattice model for the main phase transition of lipid bilayers and the foreign molecules are assumed to intercalate as intestitials in the lattice.  By varying the model parameters, the diversity in the thermodynamic properties of the model is explored using computer-simulation techniques which faithfully take account of the thermal fluctuations.  The calculations are performed in both the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles corresponding to the cases where the concentration of foreign molecules in the membrane is either fixed or varies as the external conditions are changed.  A classification of the diverse thermal behaviour, specifically with regard to the phase diagram, the specific heat, the density fluctuations, and the partition coefficient, is suggested with a view to rationalizing a large body of experimental measurements of the effects of different foreign molecules on membrane properties.  The range of foreign molecules considered includes compounds as diverse as volatile general anaesthetics like halothane, cocaine-derived local anaesthetics like procaine, calcium-channel blocking drugs like verapamil, antidepressants like chlorpromazine, and anti-cancer agents like adriamycin.

TI ASSESSMENT OF LONG-TERM EXPOSURES TO TOXIC-SUBSTANCES IN AIR

AB Because airborne exposure varies greatly over time and between individual workers, occupational hygienists should adopt sampling strategies which recognize the inherent statistical nature of assessing exposure.  This analysis indicates that the traditional practice of testing 'compliance' with occupational exposure limits (OELs) should be discarded.  Rather, it is argued that acceptable exposure should be defined with reference to the exposure distribution.  Regarding the many statistical issues which come into play, it is concluded that hygienists should continue to apply the log-normal model for summarizing and testing data.  However, sampling designs should move away from methods which are biased (e.g. sampling only the worst case) and which rely upon job title and observation as the primary means of assigning workers into groups.  Since exposure data often lack independence (e.g. owing to the autocorrelation of serial measurements) and there exist large differences in exposure between workers in the same job group, random sampling designs should be adopted.  It is also shown that the relationship between the mean of a long-normal distribution and exposures in the right tail allows one to evaluate simultaneously the mean exposure and the maximum frequency with which exposures exceed the OEL.
   Investigation of the biological concepts relies heavily upon a conceptual model which depicts the exposure-response continuum as a sequence of time series related to exposure, burden, damage and risk.  Analysis of the linkages between these processes identifies two kinetic conditions which are necessary if variability of exposure is to affect appreciably the individual's risk of chronic disease.  First, the variation of exposure from interval to interval must be efficiently translated into burden and damage (no damping), and second, during periods of intense exposure the relationship between burden and damage must be non-linear (curving upwards).  On the basis of current knowledge it appears that relatively few chronic toxicants satisfy both these conditions.  Even for those substances which cause damage only when a threshold is exceeded, a statistical argument suggests that the maximum risk can still be related to the mean exposure received over time.
   It is concluded that the risk of chronic disease generally depends upon the mean exposure received by the individual worker over time.  Thus, the sampling strategy must allow the distribution of individual mean exposures to be characterized across the population at risk.  It follows from this paradigm for assessing exposures that relatively little effort should be devoted to the evaluation of short-term 'peak' exposures since such transients are unlikely to exert undue influence on long-term effects.  Regarding short-term effects it is argued that evaluation of exposures to acutely toxic agents should rely upon assessment and control of the source rather than of exposure per se.
   Finally, three approaches are evaluated for testing exposures relative to limits:  the test of compliance; a test of the frequency of  excursions; and a test of the mean exposure.  By several objective criteria it is shown that the traditional test of compliance offers a poor tool for prospective assessment.  While both of the other approaches allow rigorous testing to be conducted, evaluation of the mean exposure appears superior on the grounds of statistical power and the relationship between outcome and the long-term hazard.  However, investigation of the underlying bases for OELs indicates that exposure limits can allow more risk to prevail than is generally presumed and the variation of exposure among workers in a group can be large.  Thus, it may be necessary to incorporate safety factors into OELs prior to testing mean exposures.

AB The outcome of two different alternating regimens of chemotherapy was investigated in a prospective controlled trial in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).  Both regimens comprised cyclophosphamide, lomustine, vincristine, methotrexate, doxorubicin and etoposide administered in different schedules.  The investigative regimen (B) included simultaneous administration of cyclophosphamide + lomustine alternating with cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin, and with doxorubicin + lomustine.  The hypothetical superiority of this regimen was based on data from experimental animal tumors suggesting potentiated efficacy of the three specific combinations.  A total of 234 patients were included, and 113 vs 108 patients were eligible.  Median survival in both groups was 48 weeks (p = 0.89).  Complete remissions were observed in 36/101 and in 42/99 patients evaluable for response.  There was no significant difference in response duration.  At restaging after 18 months of chemotherapy 27 patients (16%) and 22 patients (16%), respectively, were free of disease.  Six patients, three in each arm, are still alive, 8+ to 10.5+ years after diagnosis.  Scheduled doses of the six agents were the same in the two regimens except for a 30% reduction of every second dose of cyclophosphamide in regimen B.  Nevertheless, regimen B resulted in significantly more leukopenic patients, septicemic episodes, and blood transfusions, and the dosage of etoposide was more often reduced in arm B than in arm A.  The increased toxicity was not associated with improved treatment results.

AB The influence of a series of sympathomimetic agents on the liver content of non protein bound thiol groups (NP-SH), mainly representing glutathione, has been assessed in the male rat.  The rats were intravenously and/or subcutaneously infused over 6 h at different dosages either with dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, terbutaline, or phentolamine, or simultaneously with dopamine and phentolamine, or with epinephrine and phentolamine.  Besides NP-SH, total sulfhydryl group content was measured in liver cytosol, while glucose and insulin concentrations were determined in the serum.
   Liver NP-SH content was significantly decreased by epinephrine.  This decrease was abolished and even inverted to an increase, when appropriate doses of phentolamine were infused simultaneously.  Dopamine caused a rise in NP-SH content at a dose rate of 7.5-mu-g/kg . min, while lower and higher dose rates of dopamine exerted not any influence on liver NP-SH.  When phentolamine was concomitantly infused with 15-mu-g/kg . min of dopamine, NP-SH was significantly elevated.  Phentolamine, when infused exclusively, increased NP-SH as well, while it was not influenced, however, by terbutaline or dobutamine at any dosage.  Cytosolic total sulfhydryls were found to be unaltered across all experimental groups.
   When the NP-SH values are related to the corresponding serum insulin levels, a close and linear relationship becomes evident.  The study demonstrates, that some sympathomimetic agents can exert a considerable influence on hepatic non protein bound thiol content.  The data suggest, that the varying liver NP-SH content under adrenergic drugs is primarily related to changes in serum insulin concentration.  The study does not support the concept of a direct influence upon liver NP-SH regulation by adrenergic stimulation of the rat hepatocytes.

AB Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and early coronary thrombolysis are now widely used to treat selected patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction, respectively. However. the efficacy of these procedures may be limited by the occurrence of thrombotic complications. Restenosis of the dilated vessel, which occurs in about 30% of the patients, is considered the Achilles' heel of PTCA. Experimental and clinical data suggest that restenosis after PTCA may be mediated by platelet attachment at the site of balloon dilation, with a consequent release of platelet-derived mitogen factors able to stimulate intimal hyperplasia. Similarly, a thrombotic reocclusion of the infarct-related coronary artery may significantly reduce the potential benefits of early thrombolysis. This reocclusion occurs in up to 30-35% of the patients successfully reperfused after suspension of the thrombolytic agent, despite the concomitant use of heparin. Increasing evidence indicates that intracoronary platelet activation and aggregation play a major role in the pathophysiology of reocclusion. First, it has been demonstrated that a marked increase in thromboxane A2 production occurs at the moment of reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing successful thrombolysis. Second, in experimental models of coronary thrombosis, reocclusion after thrombolysis can be prevented or markedly delayed by antiplatelet interventions, such as administration of a monoclonal antibody against the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb and IIIa-the putative fibrinogen receptor on platelet membrane whose exposure seems to be an obligatory step for platelet aggregation to occur. Furthermore. our group has demonstrated that thromboxane A2 and serotonin, released during platelet activation, cooperatively mediate reocclusion, as simultaneous administration of a thromboxane A2 and a serotonin receptor antagonist prevents or markedly delays the occurrence of reocclusion in a canine model of coronary thrombosis. This combination of drug is also able to significantly shorten the time to thrombolysis. The initial promising results of PTCA and thrombolytic therapy have greatly altered the care of patients with coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction. However, despite the substantial progress made during the past few years, a number of unresolved issues still exists. Specifically, much more effort needs to be made with regard to reducing the incidence of restenosis after PTCA, shortening the interval between onset of ischemia and achievement of reperfusion and prevention of reocclusion after thrombolysis.

AB Electrochemical reduction of heavy elements from aqueous solution to amalgams was studied by radiopolarography and radiocoulometry.  Mechanism of actinide reduction on a mercury pool is discussed through simulation techniques.  Special emphasis is placed on redox reactions and potentials, kinetics of the process and effect of acetate and citrate ions as complexing agents.  Three groups of actinides have been found.  The first group represents actinium and from uranium to berkelium.  Reduction occurs in the experimental conditions via an irreversible 3-0 process.  The second group consists of the elements from fermium to nobelium, which are reduced in non-complexing solutions, or with acetate ions, similarly as barium and radium, via a reversible 2-0 reaction.  Finally, californium and einsteinium behave as in termediate elements.  It is noticeable that such groups are also observed in the actinide series by studying the structure of the trivalent aqua ions.  On the basis of the above mentioned investigations of actinides and lanthanides several examples of electrochemical application are presented.  Californium has been separated from preceding transuranium and lanthanide elements (except europium) by electrochemical reduction to amalgams in acetic solution.  Separation factors from 25-90 are achieved with appropriate cathodic potentials.  Similarly, this element could be separated from several heavier actinides with citric media.  The electrochemical preparation of mixed uranium-nickel and uranium-tin amalgama from aqueous acetate solutions is investigated.  The dependence of redox potentials of mixed amalgams on different atomic ratio U:Ni and U:Sn in amalgams is measured.  The large shift of redox potentials of mixed amalgams to the positive direction is detected when the atomic ratio U:Ni or U:Sn in amalgams reaches 1:5.  The thermal distillation of mercury from mixed amalgams with different U:Ni and U:Sn atomic ratios was carried out and the products were identified by chemical analysis and X-ray diffraction.  The intermetallics UNi5 and USN3 were prepared from mixed amalgams with the atomic ratios U:Ni = 1:5 and U:Sn = 1:3. The uranium and neptunium amalgams are prepared by electrolysis of aqueous acetate solutions and are processed into metals or nitrides U2N3, NpN by thermal distillation of mercury in vacuum or in nitrogen atmosphere.

AB A modeling methodology for a class of resist materials that rely on the acid catalyzed crosslinking of the resin matrix during a post-exposure bake is presented.  This methodology is used to derive a complete and quantitative model for a production worthy deep-ultraviolet (UV) resist, Shipley XP-8843 (also known commercially as SNR 248).  The modeling is based on the chemical and physical mechanisms which determine resist behavior during the exposure, post-exposure bake, and development processes.  The IR absorption bands near 990 and 1070 cm-1 are used to monitor the extent of crosslinking during the bake as a function of bake temperature, bake time, and photogenerated acid concentration.  The post-exposure bake model consists of a primary crosslinking reaction with an order of 1.42 in photogenerated acid and an acid loss reaction to account for dose dependent saturation of the crosslinking.  Resist development is modeled by relating the dissolution rate to the extent of crosslinking during the post-exposure bake and to the number of sites on the crosslinking agent (six for melamine).  Good correlation is obtained between simulated development profiles and experimental results with several post-exposure bake conditions.

AB The influence of dopamine administration upon peripheral triiodothyronine (T3) production from thyroxine (T4) has been investigated at the subcellular level in the liver.  Using an in vivo-in vitro experimental design, 60 thyroidectomized and T4-substituted rats were treated over a period of 6 h either with dopamine at different dosages (2.5, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60-mu-g/kg.min), or with terbutaline (1-mu-g/kg.min), or with phentolamine (12-mu-g/kg.min), or simultaneously with dopamine and phentolamine (15/8 and 15/12-mu-g/kg.min, resp.).  Thereafter, in the liver T4-to-T3 deiodinating activity (5'-DA), T4-to-reverse T3 deiodinating activity, and cytosolic non protein sulfhydryl groups and in the serum insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were determined.
   Dopamine increased 5'-DA, when given at 7.5-mu-g/kg.min, while it decreased 5'-DA at higher dosages.  When the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine was administered simultaneously, the depressing effect of dopamine was abolished or reversed to an increase of 5'-DA, according to the phentolamine dose applied. Phentolamine, when given exclusively, as well as the beta-adrenergic stimulating agent terbutaline increased 5'-DA.  Intracellular reverse T3 production was not affected by any of the adrenergic agents administered.  Concomitant changes of serum glucose and insulin and of cytosolic non protein sulfhydryl groups were not likely to account for the dopamine action upon T3 production.
   The data demonstrate, that dopamine acts on hepatic intracellular T3 production divergently, according to the dosage applied.  The study strongly suggests that the effects of dopamine on 5'-DA are due to alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation, respectively.  This mechanism may contribute to the disturbance of thyroid hormone regulation under dopamine treatment.

AB A stable period length is a characteristic property of circadian oscillations.  The question about whether higher frequency oscillators (0.5-8 hr) contribute to or establish the stable circadian periodicity cannot be answered at present.  A sequential coupling of quantal subcycles appears possible on the basis of known "ultradian" oscillations.  There is, however, no supporting evidence for such a concept.  Phase response curves of the circadian clock derived from various perturbing pulses allow qualitative conclusions concerning the perturbed clock process.  Deductions from computer simulations also allow conclusions about the phase of this oscillatory process.
   The distinction between processes (a) essential to the clock mechanism, (b) maintaining and controlling the clock (inputs) and (c) depending on the clock (outputs) on the basis of "oscillatory" and "change of psi or tau after perturbation" seems to be useful but not stringent.  Protein synthesis may be an essential or input process.  Oscillatory changes of this process may be due to periodic translational control or RNA-supply.  Circadian changes in protein concentration and/or activity may depend on periodic synthesis, proteolysis, covalent modifications or aggregations.  Specific essential proteins have not been identified conclusively.  The large overlap between the group of agents and treatments that phase shift the clock and the group that induces stress proteins suggest that the latter may play a role in the controlling (input) or essential domain.
   The role of membranes in the clock mechanism is not clear: concepts assuming an essential function are based on circumstantial evidence.  The membrane potential as well as Ca2+ may be involved in either input or essential function.  Ca2+ -calmodulin may also be important as concluded from inhibitor experiments.  It is tempting to assume that a calmodulin-dependent kinase is part of a periodic protein phosphorylation process, yet it is not clear whether the periodic protein phosphorylation that has been observed is essential or is just another output process.

AB The emerging new area referred to as computational science or science done on a computer adds a third dimension to the traditional methods of theoretical and experimental approaches.  Counterparts to computational science such as computational linguistics, computational engineering and others arc beginning to take roots.  Naturally, new research paths and opportunities in computational epidemiology must also be explored.
   One of the major challenges in epidemiologic research is the issue of how to realistically and effectively handle complex bioepidemiologic dynamics involving interactions between humans or animals, etiological agents and the multiple array of environmental and socioeconomic determinants which affect these populations.  To understand the behavior of such complex biological systems, it is useful to devise computer based simulation models.  Computational epidemiologic approaches now provide alternative avenues to classical laboratory and/or field experimental methods.  Systems which may be impractical because they are too large, or, not feasible because the cost is too prohibitive can now be simulated realistically.  In the past obtaining solutions to biomathematical equations with any degree of complexity was impossible.  However, the availability of powerful computers now makes the quantitative analysis of such systems feasible and indeed practical.
   With this in mind our research at Tuskegee University has focused on:  a) Epidemiologic modelling and expert systems, and, b) Hypertex/hypermedia based epidemiologic knowledge management.  The case studies for our research involve the bioepidemiologic dynamics of two complex host-parasite systems of trypanosoma and schistosoma.  The ultimate goal is to develop resources and methodologies based on computational technology to advance epidemiologic research.  The paper will address the methodological issues and findings as well as questions related to configuring an appropriate research workstation for computational epidemiology.
