AB The formation of N-(2-hydroxyethyl)valine (HEVal) in hemoglobin was investigated in male F344 rats (10/group) and B6C3F1 mice (20/group) exposed to 0, 3, 10, 33, 100, or 300 (rats only) ppm ethylene oxide (ETO) by inhalation for 6 h/day for 4 weeks (5 days/week) or exposed to 100 (mice) or 300 ppm (rats) ETO for 1 or 3 days or 1, 2, or 4 weeks (5 days/week). The persistence of HEVal was studied in animals killed up to 10 days after cessation of the 4-week time-course studies. HEVal was determined by a modified Edman degradation and quantitation of the resulting pentafluorophenylthiohydantoin derivative, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The resulting experimental data were compared to simulations derived with a model for the formation and removal of hemoglobin adducts (T. R. Fennell, S. C. J. Sumner, and V. E. Walker, Cancer Epidemiol., Biomarkers & Prev., 1: 213-219, 1992). Repeated exposures of rats and mice for 4 weeks to 300 and 100 ppm ETO, respectively, led to an accumulation of HEVal that was 14 (rats) and 15 (mice) times greater than that found after 1 day of exposure 128 +/- 2 (SE) and 9.4 +/- 0.4 (SE) pmol HEVal/mg globin in rats and mice, respectively]. After cessation of exposures, HEVal was lost faster than predicted by the normal erythrocyte life span alone. An initial phase of rapid decline in HEVal concentrations was consistent with the removal of older, more heavily alkylated populations of RBCs, accompanied by a burst of erythropoiesis. The dose-response curves for HEVal were linear between 3 and 33 ppm ETO, with 3.5 +/- 0.2 and 3.4 +/- 0.3 pmol adduct/mg globin formed in rats and mice, respectively, after 4 weeks of exposure to 3 ppm ETO. Above 33 ppm ETO, the slope of the dose-response curves increased. Comparison of the dose response for HEVal in rats exposed to ETO for 4 weeks to the dose-response for N(tau)-(2-hydroxyethyl)histidine in rats exposed to the same concentrations of ETO for 2 years (S. Osterman-Golkar et al., Teratog. Carcinog. Mutagen., 3: 395-405, 1983) suggested that exposures to ETO can reduce the life span of erythrocytes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Correlation of the experimental data and simulations for the formation and removal of HEVal demonstrated that perturbations in erythropoiesis and RBC life span complicate the estimation of exposures to ETO when estimates are based upon hemoglobin adduct measurements in heavily exposed individuals. However, results of these rodent studies indicate that ETO-induced erythroclastic effects are associated with high cumulative doses of the epoxide and are unlikely to occur in workers exposed near or below the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration standard of 1 ppm (8-h time-weighted average).

AB Amyloid-ss (A ss) and human islet polypeptide (hIAPP) are the causative agents responsible for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and type II diabetes (T2D), respectively. While numerous studies have reported the cross-seeding behavior of A ss and hIAPP in solution, little effort has been made to examine the cross-seeding of A ss and hIAPP in the presence of cell membranes, which is more biologically relevant to the pathological link between AD and T2D. In this work, we computationally study the cross seeding and adsorption behaviors of A ss and hIAPP on zwitterionic POPC and anionic 1-palmitoy1-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylglycerol (POPG) mixed bilayers using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, particularly aiming to the effects of the initial orientation of the A ss-hIAPP assembly and the lipid composition of cell membranes on mutual structural and interaction changes in both A ss-hIAPP assembly and lipid bilayers at the atomic level. A ss-hIAPP cross-seeding assembly always preferred to adopt a specific orientation and interface to associate with both lipid bilayers strongly via the N-terminal strands of A ss. Such membrane-bound orientation explains experimental observation that hybrid A ss-hIAPP fibrils on cell membranes showed similar morphologies to pure hIAPP fibrils. Moreover, A ss-hIAPP assembly, regardless of its initial orientations, interacted more strongly with POPC/POPG bilayer than POPC bilayer, indicating that electrostatic interactions are the major forces governing peptide-lipid interactions. Strong electrostatic interactions were also attributed to the formation of Ca2+ bridges connecting both negatively charged Glu of A ss and PO4 head groups of lipids, which facilitate the association of A ss-hIAPP with the POPC/POPG bilayer. It was also found that the strong peptide-lipid binding reduced lipid fluidity. Both facts imply that A ss-hIAPP assembly may induce cell damage by altering calcium homeostasis and cell membrane phase. This work provides a better fundamental understanding of cross-seeding of A ss and hIAPP on cell membranes and a potential pathological link between AD and T2D.

TI Estimating the population impact of hypothetical breastfeeding
   interventions in a low-income population in Los Angeles County: An
   agent-based model
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SYSTEMS SCIENCE; HEALTH; INITIATION; INTENTION; MOTHERS
AB Background
   Breastfeeding has clear benefits. Yet, breastfeeding practices fall short of recommendations in low-income populations including participants of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). To promote breastfeeding, it is important to understand breastfeeding-related behaviors such as initiation and maintenance within the context of a complex societal system. For individual women, making choices about infant feeding (whether to breastfeed or formula-feed a newborn, or when to stop breastfeeding) is a dynamic process involving interactions with health professionals, family, peers and work-places. Integrating behavioral change theories with systems science tools such as agent-based modeling can help illuminate patterns of breastfeeding behaviors, identify key factors affecting breastfeeding behaviors within this complex dynamic system, and estimate the population impact of hypothetical interventions.
   Methods
   An agent-based model (ABM) was developed to investigate the influences of multiple levels of factors affecting breastfeeding behaviors among WIC participants. Health behavioral change theories were applied and stakeholder input obtained to improve the model, particularly during the conceptual design and model specification steps. The model was then used to identify critical points for intervention and assess the effects of five common interventions (improving knowledge through education, implementing Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative practices, providing postpartum breastfeeding counselling, strengthening partner support, and fostering supportive workplace environments.)
   Results
   The ABM developed in this study produced outcomes (i.e., breastfeeding rates) that were concordant with empirical data. Increasing the coverage of the five selected interventions produced various levels of improvement in breastfeeding practices in the target population. Specifically, improving breastfeeding knowledge had a positive impact on women's intent to breastfeed, while increasing the availability of the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative improved breastfeeding initiation rates. However, neither of these two interventions showed a significant impact on breastfeeding maintenance, which was supported by postpartum breastfeeding counseling, partner support and a supportive workplace environment. These three intervention strategies each improved breastfeeding rates at 6 months from 55.6% to 57.1%, 59.5% and 59.3%, respectively. Increasing the coverage of multiple interventions simultaneously had a synergistic effect on breastfeeding maintenance with their effects being greater than the cumulative effects of increasing the coverage of these interventions individually.
   Conclusion
   The ABM we developed was helpful for understanding the dynamic process of decision-making regarding infant feeding modalities in a low-income population, and for evaluating the aggregated population-level impact of breastfeeding promotion interventions.

AB With the advent of nanotechnology and its development, there have been dramatic advances in various aspects of diverse sciences. Nanotechnology encompasses the manipulating matter to create nanometre-scale materials with prodigious features and their implementation in a vast range of applications. The topic that is the current debate in today's scientific community and the transformation origin in modern technologies. Magnetic nano-materials belong to the group of materials mainly consisting of a magnetic component, such as iron, and a chemical functionality agent. Hitherto, several reports on these materials have been published in various sciences, including chemistry, and their applications have been discussed from different perspectives. One of the most interesting aspects of these materials is in a special type of chromatographic techniques, called "magnetic-chromatography" as well as "magneto-chromatography". The subject that has been somewhat underestimated compared to the other practical aspects of these materials. This review devotes to the recent issue and seeks to address the principles, benefits, challenges, analytical data, and potential applications of magnetic-chromatography in ions separation, size fractionation of magnetic nanoparticles, and isolation of biologically active organic molecules. Also, the new aspects and future trends of this technique are discussed.

AB This study investigated the feasibility of using a new adsorbent prepared from Coconut coir pith, CP (a coir industry-based lignocellulosic residue), for the removal of uranium [U(VI)] from aqueous solutions. The adsorbent (PGCP-COOH) having a carboxylate functional group at the chain end was synthesized by grafting poly(hydroxyethylmethacrylate) onto CP using potassium peroxydisulphate-sodium thiosulphite as a redox initiator and in the presence of N,N'-methacrylamide as a crosslinking agent. IR spectroscopy results confirm the graft copolymer formation and carboxylate functionalization. XRD Studies confirm the decrease of crystallinity in PGCP-COOH compared to CP, and it favors the protrusion of the functional group into the aqueous medium. The thermal stability of the samples was studied using thermogravimetry (TG). Surface charge density of the samples as a function of pH was determined using potentiometric titration. The ability of PGCP-COOH to remove U(VI) from aqueous Solutions Was assessed using a batch adsorption technique. The maximum adsorption capacity was observed at the pH range 4.0-6.0. Maximum removal of 99.2% was observed for an initial concentration of 25 mg/L at pH 6.0 and an adsorbent dose of 2 g/L. Equilibrium was achieved in approximately 3 h. The experimental kinetic data were analyzed using a first-order kinetic model. The temperature dependence indicates an endothermic process. U(VI) adsorption was found to decrease with an increase in ionic strength due to the formation of outer-sphere surface complexes on PGCP-COOh. Equilibrium data were best modeled by the Langmuir isotherm. The thermodynamic parameters Such as Delta G(0), Delta H-0 and Delta S-0 were derived to predict the nature of adsorption. Adsorption experiments were also conducted using a commercial cation exchanger, Ceralite IRC-50, with carboxylate functionality for comparison. Utility of the adsorbent was tested by removing U(VI) from simulated nuclear industry wastewater. Adsorbed U(VI) ions were desorbed effectively (about 96.2 +/- 3.3%) by 0.1 M HCl. The adsorbent was suitable for repeated use (more than four cycles) Without any noticeable loss of capacity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rather than using baseline-oriented approaches, autonomous spacecraft trajectory planning within asteroid systems may be based on human behavior that is learned by demonstration. In this paper, we conducted a numerical experiment to observe a human agent steering in real-time spacecraft motion within simulated binary asteroid environments. The resulting collection of human-planned trajectories demonstrates effective guidance mechanisms and reveals underlying path-planning processes that may serve for more agile and autonomous asteroid exploration.

In this paper we have studied dynamical behaviours of a model for biocontrol of pests, where it is assumed that the pest is affected by a virus. Boundedness and stability of the model are studied. The effect of time-delay is investigated. Numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate our analytical findings. It is observed that the time-delay has a regulatory impact on the system.

TI AN EMPIRICAL STATIONARY EQUILIBRIUM SEARCH MODEL OF THE HOUSING MARKET
SO INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC REVIEW

AB This article specifies and estimates a computationally tractable stationary equilibrium model of the housing market. The model is rich and incorporates many of its unique features: buyers and sellers simultaneous search behavior, heterogeneity in their motivation to trade, transaction costs, a trading mechanism with posting prices and bargaining, and the availability of an exogenous advertising technology that induces endogenous matching. Estimation uses Maximum Likelihood methods and Multiple Listing Services data. The estimated model is used to simulate housing market outcomes when (a) the amount of information displayed on housing listings increases and (b) real estate agents commission rates change.

AB An instability near the transition to collective motion of self-propelled particles is studied numerically by Enskog-like kinetic theory. While hydrodynamics breaks down, the kinetic approach leads to steep solitonlike waves. These supersonic waves show hysteresis and lead to an abrupt jump of the global order parameter if the noise level is changed. Thus they provide a mean-field mechanism to change the second-order character of the phase transition to first order. The shape of the wave is shown to follow a scaling law and to quantitatively agree with agent-based simulations.

AB Peer review is a process used in the selection of manuscripts for journal publication and proposals for research grant funding. Though widely used, peer review is not without flaws and critics. Performing large-scale experiments to evaluate and test correctives and alternatives is difficult, if not impossible. Thus, many researchers have turned to simulation studies to overcome these difficulties. In the last 10 years this field of research has grown significantly but with only limited attempts to integrate disparate models or build on previous work. Thus, the resulting body of literature consists of a large variety of models, hinging on incompatible assumptions, which have not been compared, and whose predictions have rarely been empirically tested. This scoping review is an attempt to understand the current state of simulation studies of peer review. Based on 46 articles identified through literature searching, we develop a proposed taxonomy of model features that include model type (e.g. formal models vs. ABMs or other) and the type of modeled peer review system (e.g. peer review in grants vs. in journals or other). We classify the models by their features (including some core assumptions) to help distinguish between the modeling approaches. Finally, we summarize the models' findings around six general themes: decision-making, matching submissions/reviewers, editorial strategies; reviewer behaviors, comparisons of alternative peer review systems, and the identification and addressing of biases. We conclude with some open challenges and promising avenues for future modeling work.

AB The aim of this paper is to analyze the behavior of Hegselmann-Krause-type models. General sufficient conditions for achieving consensus are provided. Model predictive control is applied to the Hegselmann-Krause system in the context of time scales. Numerical simulations show that the predictive control mechanism has the ability to steer the system to attain a consensus. Moreover, faster consensus speed is observed when compared with the classical model. Finally, in the case of the discrete time scale and all agents being neighbors at the initial time, conditions guaranteeing an average consensus are given.

AB The causes of seasonal variability in pathogen transmission are not well understood, and have not been comprehensively investigated. In an example for enteric pathogens, incidence of Escherichia coli O157 (STEC) colonization in cattle is consistently higher during warmer months compared to cooler months in various cattle production systems. However, actual mechanisms for this seasonality remain elusive. In addition, the influence of host (cattle) behavior on this pattern has not been thoroughly considered. To that end, we constructed a spatially explicit agent-based model that accounted for the effect of temperature fluctuations on cattle behavior (direct contact among cattle and indirect between cattle and environment), as well as its effect on pathogen survival in the environment. We then simulated the model in a factorial approach to evaluate the hypothesis that temperature fluctuations can lead to seasonal STEC transmission dynamics by influencing cattle aggregation, grazing, and drinking behaviors. Simulation results showed that higher temperatures increased the frequency at which cattle aggregated under shade in pasture, resulting in increased direct contact and transmission of STEC between individual cattle, and hence higher incidence over model simulations in the warm season. In contrast, increased drinking behavior during warm season was not an important transmission pathway. Although sensitivity analyses suggested that the relative importance of direct vs. indirect (environmental) pathways depend to upon model parameterization, model simulations indicated that factors influencing cattle aggregation, such as temperature, were likely strong drivers of transmission dynamics of enteric pathogens.

AB We propose a method to solve models with heterogeneous agents and aggregate uncertainty. The law of motion describing aggregate behavior is obtained by explicitly aggregating the individual policy rule. The algorithm is simpler and faster than existing algorithms that rely on parameterization of the cross-sectional distribution and/or a computationally intensive Simulation Step. Explicit aggregation establishes a link between the individual policy rule and the set of necessary aggregate state variables, an insight that can be helpful in determining what state variables to include in other algorithms as well.

AB Interfaces of fluid-fluid systems play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions in chemistry, biology, consumer products, and foods. For most applications, surface active agents are added and adsorbed onto the interface to enhance stability, making the rheological behavior of the interface more complex. To understand the phenomena of these complex interfaces, various techniques are used to determine the interfacial properties. One of the most popular methods is the pendant drop technique. From the equilibrium state of the pendant drop, the interfacial tension of a system can be obtained quite easily in the absence of surface active agents. But when complex viscoelastic interfacial characteristics are considered, in particular in oscillatory measurements, interfacial constitutive relations need to be defined. Interfaces containing proteins, particles or Langmuir monolayers formed by insoluble low weight surfactants appear to act like viscoelastic solid membranes. In this work, a two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model is designed to study the behavior of complex interfaces in pendant drop experiments. The bulk fluid consists of a Newtonian fluid, while the interface behaves according to the Kelvin-Voigt model as elastic interfacial forces dominate. To be able to capture large deformations, the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive model is made quasi-linear by using a combination of two non-linear strain tensors. A parameter study is performed to investigate the influence of the five model parameters of the quasi-linear Kelvin-Voigt equation. To demonstrate the applicability of the numerical model, a small amplitude oscillatory measurement is simulated.

TI Sexual networks, partnership mixing, and the female-to-male ratio of HIV
   infections in generalized epidemics: An agent-based simulation study

DT Article

   CONCURRENCY; PREVALENCE
AB BACKGROUND
   Empirical estimates of the female-to-male ratio of infections in generalized HIV epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa range from 1.31 in Zambia to 2.21 in Ivory Coast. Inequalities in the gender ratio of infections can arise because of differences in exposure (to HIV-positive partners), susceptibility (given exposure), and survival (once infected). Differences in susceptibility have to date received most attention, but neither the relatively high gender ratio of infections nor the heterogeneity in empirical estimates is fully understood.
   OBJECTIVE
   Demonstrate the relevance of partnership network attributes and sexual mixing patterns to gender differences in the exposure to HIV-positive partners and the gender ratio of infections.
   METHOD
   Agent-based simulation model built in NetLogo.
   RESULTS
   The female-to-male ratio of infections predicted by our model ranges from 1.13 to 1.75. Gender-asymmetric partnership concurrency, rapid partnership turnover, elevated partnership dissolution in female-positive serodiscordant couples, and lower partnership re-entry rates among HIV-positive women can produce (substantial) differences in the gender ratio of infections. Coital dilution and serosorting have modest moderating effects.
   CONCLUSION
   Partnership network attributes and sexual mixing patterns can have a considerable effect on the gender ratio of HIV infections. We need to look beyond individual behavior and gender differences in biological susceptibility if we are to fully understand, and remedy, gender inequalities in HIV infection in generalized epidemics.

DE multiple scattering; contrast agent microbubbles; full-wave equation;
   finite difference time domain (FDTD)
AB Ultrasound contrast agents (UCA), such as microbubbles, enhance the scattering properties of blood, which is otherwise hypoechoic. The multiple scattering interactions of the acoustic field with UCA are poorly understood due to the complexity of the multiple scattering theories and the nonlinear microbubble response. The majority of bubble models describe the behavior of UCA as single, isolated microbubbles suspended in infinite medium. Multiple scattering models such as the independent scattering approximation can approximate phase velocity and attenuation for low scatterer volume fractions. However, all current models and simulation approaches only describe multiple scattering and nonlinear bubble dynamics separately. Here we present an approach that combines two existing models: (1) a full-wave model that describes nonlinear propagation and scattering interactions in a heterogeneous attenuating medium and (2) a Paul-Sarkar model that describes the nonlinear interactions between an acoustic field and microbubbles. These two models were solved numerically and combined with an iterative approach. The convergence of this combined model was explored in silico for 0.5 x 10(6) microbubbles ml(-1), 1% and 2% bubble concentration by volume. The backscattering predicted by our modeling approach was verified experimentally with water tank measurements performed with a 128-element linear array transducer. An excellent agreement in terms of the fundamental and harmonic acoustic fields is shown. Additionally, our model correctly predicts the phase velocity and attenuation measured using through transmission and predicted by the independent scattering approximation.

AB Using an agent-model, we conducted an analysis of a two-party system, in order to identify a pattern of behavior in the influence exercised by the number core votes on the proportion of the number of annulled votes, which are cast during an election. In a 2d toroidal grid network, where each node is connected with its four closest neighbors, we introduce the concept of an opinion network with uniformly distributed nodes that can have one of three different states, also known as spin: +1, -1 and 0. Initially, the states +1 and -1 correspond respectively to active votes for candidate A and candidate B, with the specific feature that these are not able to change their state core vote (i.e., that do not change their political preferences). The rest is established as having a state of 0, known as undecided voters, who will try to become active votes in favor of one of the two contending candidates, during the process of interaction with their four closest neighbors (because of their influence, in real life these would be interpreted as the voters' immediate surroundings). The model dynamics tend to a state of equilibrium, in which there are no more voters changing their opinion upon interaction with his four closest neighbors. Finally, active voters who decide become part of the valid vote, while the undecided become part of the annulled vote.

AB Since it was first theorized more than half-century ago, nanotechnology has proven to be the perfect boost for existing technologies and the oil industry has made use of this avant-garde discipline to upsurge the productivity of mature oilfields. With respect to polymer flooding, recent research has stressed the importance of the (macro) molecules' architecture on the physical properties. This paper presents the numerical simulation of these two agents in standard, not combined, oil recovery processes. The polymer solution viscosity is calculated considering the polymer's architecture, its degradation and the salinity. The nanoparticles affect the carrier-phase viscosity and the rock formation wettability, which modifies the oil mobility. Results evidenced the improved capabilities of branched (i.e. star/comb) polymers with respect to traditional linear ones. The modified architecture improves not only the rheological but also the viscoelastic properties, which ultimately increases the microscopic sweeping efficiency. Nanoparticles increase slightly the carrier phase viscosity, but their main recovery mechanism is their adsorption onto the rock and subsequent wettability modification, reducing the residual oil saturation. Furthermore, it is also important to properly characterize both the particles' average size and also their aggregation rate, since these affect the recovery efficiency. Simulations show the importance of a good characterization of oil recovery agents and their effect on the phases' physical properties as well as the potential of nanoparticles to act as a boost of traditional enhanced recovery processes.

AB An empirical study of the parking behaviour of Conventional Vehicles (CVs), Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) was carried out with the data collected in a paper-based questionnaire survey in Beijing, China. The study investigated the factors that might influence the parking behaviour, with a focus on the maximum acceptable time of walking from parking lot to trip destination, parking fee, the availability of charging posts, the state of charge of EVs and the range anxiety of BEVs. Several Multinomial Logit (MNL) models were developed to explore the relationships between individual attributes and parking choices. The results suggest that (1) the maximum acceptable walking time generally increases with the rise in the amount of saving for parking fee; (2) the availability of charging posts does not influence the maximum acceptable walking time when PHEVs and BEVs have sufficient charge, but the percentage of people willing to walk longer than eight minutes increases from around 35% to 46% when PHEVs are in a low stage of charge; (3) more than half of BEV drivers want the driving range of their vehicles to be one and a half times the driving distance before they depart, given the distance is 50 km. Based on the empirical findings above, a conceptual framework was proposed to explicitly simulate the parking behaviour of both CVs and EVs using agent-based modelling.

AB Two of the most commonly encountered friction-reducing agents used in plastic sheet production are. the amides known as erucamide and behenamide, which despite being almost identical chemically, lead to markedly different values of the friction coefficient. To understand the origin of this contrasting behavior, in this work we model brushes made of these two types of linear-chain molecules using quantum mechanical numerical simulations under the density functional theory at the B97D/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. Four chains of erucamide and behenamide were linked to a 2 X 10 zigzag graphene sheet and optimized both in vacuum and in continuous solvent using the SMD implicit solvation model. We find that erucamide chains tend to remain closer together through pi-pi stacking interactions arising from the double bonds located at C13-C14, a feature behenamide lacks, and thus a more spread configuration is obtained with the latter. It is argued that this arrangement of the erucamide chains is responsible for the lower friction coefficient of erucamide brushes, compared with behenamide brushes, which is a macroscopic consequence of cooperative quantum mechanical interactions. While only quantum level interactions are modeled here, we show that behenamide chains are more spread out in the brush than erucamide chains as a consequence of those interactions. The spread-out configuration allows more solvent particles to penetrate the brush, leading in turn to more friction, in agreement with macroscopic measurements and mesoscale simulations of the friction coefficient reported in the literature.

AB Since the stakeholder theory was proposed to explain the interaction among its agents, extensive approaches have been developed. However, the literature continues to suggest the development of new methodologies that allow an analysis of the dynamics and uncertainty of the relationships between each agent. In this sense, this research proposes a novel methodology for the treatment of subjective stakeholder dynamics using fuzzy decision-making. The study proposes a mathematical methodological perspective for the treatment of subjective relationships among stakeholders, which allows a predictive simulation tool to be developed for attitude and personal preferences to analyze the links among all stakeholders. A mathematical application is developed to help the decision-making process in uncertainty concerning the ordering-according-to-their-importance and linking-of-relation algorithms, which are based on notions of relation, gathering and ordering. A numerical example is proposed to understand the method's usefulness and feasibility. The results approximate how stakeholder ambiguity and fuzziness can be managed considering the decision-maker's preference subjectivity. In addition, these results highlight the different relationships among each stakeholder, their intensity levels, the incidence linkage loops and the incidence relative on stakeholder behaviors. The main implication of this proposition is to deal with the subjective preferences provide by decision-maker to better interpret environmental and subjective factors. Furthermore, this study contributes to the strategic planning and decision-making processes for operative units within uncertain environment in the short term.

AB The purpose of this article is to develop a framework for assessing the effects of tour information systems and information dissemination strategies by incorporating tourists' decision processes into an activity-based model. There are two important features in tourists' decision-making processes: (1) They generally have limited information and experiences on tour sites, and (2) their value of time is higher than normal travelers' because of their time limitations. These two features are, however, the main reasons that make tour information services attractive to tourists and thus should also be incorporated into a modeling framework for investigating the effects of the real-time tour information system. This study develops an agent-based simulation model that incorporates activity chaining behavior into tour scheduling systems. The underlying assumption used in the model is that tourists schedule their activities within their time and budget constraints to maximize their utilities. The model seeks individuals' optimal tour schedules by solving a prize-collecting multiple-day traveling salesman problem (PC-MD-TSP). The simulation model also includes real-time and end-of-day rescheduling capabilities by taking tourists' unpredicted delays into consideration. From a numerical test, the pros and cons of tour information services are found and the optimal strategy for a tour information service is also discussed. The results show that tour information services increase tourists' satisfaction with less expenditure by allowing tourists to visit more places in an effective way.

AB Occupancy is an important factor driving building performance. Static and homogeneous occupant schedules, commonly used in building performance simulation, contribute to issues such as performance gaps between simulated and measured energy use in buildings. Stochastic occupancy models have been recently developed and applied to better represent spatial and temporal diversity of occupants in buildings. However, there is very limited evaluation of the usability and accuracy of these models. This study used measured occupancy data from a real office building to evaluate the performance of an agent based occupancy simulation model: the Occupancy Simulator. The occupancy patterns of various occupant types were first derived from the measured occupant schedule data using statistical analysis. Then the performance of the simulation model was evaluated and verified based on (1) whether the distribution of observed occupancy behavior patterns follows the theoretical ones included in the Occupancy Simulator, and (2) whether the simulator can reproduce a variety of occupancy patterns accurately. Results demonstrated the feasibility of applying the Occupancy Simulator to simulate a range of occupancy presence and movement behaviors for regular types of occupants in office buildings, and to generate stochastic occupant schedules at the room and individual occupant levels for building performance simulation. For future work, model validation is recommended, which includes collecting and using detailed interval occupancy data of all spaces in an office building to validate the simulated occupant schedules from the Occupancy Simulator.

AB Different classes of nanoparticles (NPs) have been developed for controlling and improving the systemic administration of therapeutic and contrast agents. Particle shape has been shown to be crucial in the vascular transport and adhesion of NPs. Here, we use mesoporous silicon non-spherical particles, of disk and rod shapes, ranging in size from 200 nm to 1800 nm. The fabrication process of the mesoporous particles is described in detail, and their transport and adhesion properties under flow are studied using a parallel plate flow chamber. Numerical simulations predict the hydrodynamic forces on the particles and help in interpreting their distinctive behaviors. Under microvascular flow conditions, for disk-like shape, 1000 x 400 nm particles show maximum adhesion, whereas smaller (600 x 200 nm) and larger (1800 x 600 nm) particles adhere less by a factor of about two. Larger rods (1800 x 400 nm) are observed to adhere at least 3 times more than smaller ones (1500 x 200 nm). For particles of equal volumes, disks adhere about 2 times more than rods. Maximum adhesion for intermediate sized disks reflects the balance between adhesive interfacial interactions and hydrodynamic dislodging forces. In view of the growing evidence on vascular molecular heterogeneity, the present data suggests that thin disk-like particles could more effectively target the diseased microvasculature as compared to spheres and slender rods.

AB Objective The BD Odon Device is a new instrument for operative vaginal birth with potential for preventing maternal, fetal and newborn morbidity/mortality during a complicated second stage of labour. The device is a plastic sleeve with an air chamber inflated around the baby's head which is gently pulled through the birth canal. The aim was to monitor changes in cerebral circulation during constriction of the neck to evaluate a risk of potential malposition of the device.
   Design Randomised prospective study.
   Population or sample Twelve newborn piglets.
   Methods The anaesthetised piglets were exposed to hypoxia until base excess was -20mmol/l and/or mean arterial blood pressure had decreased to 20mmHg. At reoxygenation, an air chamber was inflated around the neck to 300mmHg and the piglets randomised into three groups: 10 (n=5), 5 (n=5) or 2 (n=2) minutes' occlusion. Cerebral perfusion was evaluated with transcranial contrast-enhanced ultrasound at four time-points, and analysed in the carotid arteries, basal ganglia, cortex and whole brain. Statistical analysis used ANOVA, linear mixed model, Kruskal-Wallis H-test.Main outcome measures Perfusion parameters; peak intensity, time to peak intensity, upslope, mean transit time, area under the curve.
   Results The haemodynamic response was comparable between groups. Perfusion parameters showed a slight increase at end hypoxia followed by a decrease during occlusion, especially in the cortex (P=0.00-0.2). After deflation, perfusion returned towards baseline values.
   Conclusions Simulation of malposition of the Odon Device was performed using a newborn hypoxic piglet model. Considerable compression of the neck vessels was applied, with only a moderate decrease in perfusion and with restoration of haemodynamics/cerebral perfusion after decompression.

ID PATIENT-CONTROLLED ANALGESIA; HEMODYNAMIC-RESPONSES; ANESTHESIA; LABOR;
   REQUIREMENTS; ETOMIDATE
AB Objectives: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is standard treatment of severe depression. The induction of a seizure is a core event in successful ECT. Although propofol is a frequently used anesthetic agent, one of its limitations is a reduction of seizure duration. No such effects have been reported regarding remifentanil, an ultrarapid-acting opioid that is used to induce and maintain anesthesia. The simultaneous administration of propofol and rentifentanil may have similar safety and efficacy in terms of induction of anesthesia during ECT as propofol alone and significantly increase seizure duration.
   Methods: Twenty-one ECT patients (10 men, 11 women, aged 24 to 81 years) were recruited. Muscle paralysis was achieved with succinylcholine (0.5-0.75 mg/kg intravenously [IV]). Unconsciousness was induced by either propofol (I mg/kg IV) or propofol (0.5 mg/kg IV) + remifentanil (1 mu g/kg) in a crossover format. ECT was administered according to established clinical protocols at the Sheba Medical Center, Israel. No changes in ECT current were permitted in the 2 protocols of each patient. Statistical analysis was based on paired t tests.
   Results: In all but 2 cases, seizure duration was significantly longer in the remifentanil group than in the control group (motor seizure 53.7 +/- 28.3 seconds vs. 29.5 +/- 10.9 seconds, t = 4.017, P = 0.0007; Electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures 60.8 +/- 25.1 seconds vs. 40.1 +/- 17.0 seconds, t = 3.971, P = 0.001). No significant differences were found in mean recovery time, post-treatment elevation in blood pressure, heart-beat, or oxygen saturation.
   Conclusion: During anesthesia, the addition of remifentanil to propofol appears to be as effective as propofol alone with regard to anesthesia efficacy and cardiovascular function while significantly increasing seizure,duration. Whether this discovery is of relevance to the clinical efficacy of ECT remains to be tested.

   PHOSPHORYLATION
AB A stable period length is a characteristic property of circadian oscillations.  The question about whether higher frequency oscillators (0.5-8 hr) contribute to or establish the stable circadian periodicity cannot be answered at present.  A sequential coupling of quantal subcycles appears possible on the basis of known "ultradian" oscillations.  There is, however, no supporting evidence for such a concept.  Phase response curves of the circadian clock derived from various perturbing pulses allow qualitative conclusions concerning the perturbed clock process.  Deductions from computer simulations also allow conclusions about the phase of this oscillatory process.
   The distinction between processes (a) essential to the clock mechanism, (b) maintaining and controlling the clock (inputs) and (c) depending on the clock (outputs) on the basis of "oscillatory" and "change of psi or tau after perturbation" seems to be useful but not stringent.  Protein synthesis may be an essential or input process.  Oscillatory changes of this process may be due to periodic translational control or RNA-supply.  Circadian changes in protein concentration and/or activity may depend on periodic synthesis, proteolysis, covalent modifications or aggregations.  Specific essential proteins have not been identified conclusively.  The large overlap between the group of agents and treatments that phase shift the clock and the group that induces stress proteins suggest that the latter may play a role in the controlling (input) or essential domain.
   The role of membranes in the clock mechanism is not clear: concepts assuming an essential function are based on circumstantial evidence.  The membrane potential as well as Ca2+ may be involved in either input or essential function.  Ca2+ -calmodulin may also be important as concluded from inhibitor experiments.  It is tempting to assume that a calmodulin-dependent kinase is part of a periodic protein phosphorylation process, yet it is not clear whether the periodic protein phosphorylation that has been observed is essential or is just another output process.

AB Objectives. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the influence of preparation design, and ceramic material, masticatory fatigue and fracture resistance of non-retentive all-ceramic full-coverage restorations luted on human mandibular molars.
   Methods. Full-coverage occlusal restorations were laboratory fabricated from leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (IPS Empress Esthetic) or lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e. max Press). For each ceramic material four groups with eight specimens each were randomly assigned. Groups had either a non-retentive, occlusal preparation with chamfer finishing line or straight-beveled finishing line and the preparation was either completely within enamel or within dentin with a finishing line in enamel. Restorations were adhesively luted to the teeth using composite resin. After storage in water for 1 week specimens were cyclic loaded 600,000 times with a weight of 10 kg and additionally, thermocycled 3500 times (5/55.degrees C) in a masticatory simulator. Surviving specimens were loaded until, fracture in a universal testing machine. Statistical analysis was done using three-way ANOVA.
   Results. All specimens survived the masticatory fatigue. Mean fracture resistance ranged from 2895 to 4173N. Influence of ceramic material on fracture resistance was significant (p = 0.0001). Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations had higher fracture resistances than leucite reinforced glass-ceramic restorations. Different preparation designs showed no significant influence on fracture resistance (p = 0.0969). The design of the finishing line did not influence the fracture resistance (p = 0.9461).
   Significance. The fracture resistance of adhesively luted non-retentive full-coverage molar restorations, made of lithium disilicate or leucite reinforced glass-ceramic is promising and seems to permit clinical application.

AB Fluorescent Au nanoclusters (NCs) are new excellent nanomaterials for biomedical applications but plagued by the problems of limited emission efficiency, unclear emission mechanism, and poor biological application ability. Herein, a novel strategy was developed to facilely synthesize poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimer-hosted Au-5 NCs (poly-Au-5) with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 25%. Most importantly, a two-stage growth process of poly-Au-5 was demonstrated through in situ time-course experiments. Stage I was a simultaneous self-nucleation and self-assembly with a rapid rate of fluorescence increase; stage II was a sole self-assembly after the end of reduction with a relatively slower rate of fluorescence increase but contributed 30% to the overall emission intensity of end products. In both stages, enhanced aurophilic interactions promoted the excited state relaxation dynamics; enhanced rigid structures reduced the level of nonradiative relaxition of excited states, and these two factors ensured high emission efficiency of poly-Au-5. To further evidence the inference above, we successfully used PAMAM to realize the self-assembly of presynthesized, separated, and red-emitting Au-GSH NCs through electrostatic interaction between negative charges of carboxylic groups in Au-GSH NCs and positive charges of amine groups in PAMAM. As expected, the emission efficiency of Au-GSH NCs was obviously enhanced by PAMAM-mediated self-assembly. Moreover, the as-synthesized poly-Au-5 assemblies exhibited excellent cell permeability and great biostability against various metal ions, high REDOX stress, and complex intracellular environments. By virtue of MnO4- as an intermediary agent, poly-Au-5 was successfully used for sensitive and stable intracellular fluorescent imaging of endogenous GSH. This study lights up the emission origin of dendrimer-hosted Au NCs with strong emission and implies their huge applications in biomedical sensing and imaging.

AB BACKGROUND: Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs), which contain different coagulation proteins, are attractive alternatives to the standard methods to treat dilution-induced (and, generally, traumatic) coagulopathy. We investigated the ability of a novel PCC composition to restore normal thrombin generation in diluted blood. The performance of the proposed PCC composition (coagulation factors [F] II, IX, and X and the anticoagulant antithrombin), designated PCC-AT, was compared with that of FVIIa and PCC-FVII, which is the PCC composition containing FII, FVII, FIX, and FX (main components of most PCCs).
   METHODS: We used a thoroughly validated computational model to simulate thrombin generation in normal and diluted blood for 472 healthy subjects in the control group of the Leiden Thrombophilia Study. For every simulated thrombin curve, we calculated and analyzed five standard thrombin generation parameters.
   RESULTS: The three therapeutic agents (FVIIa, PCC-FVII, and PCC-AT) caused statistically significant changes in each of the five thrombin generation parameters in diluted blood. Factor VIIa tended to primarily impact clotting time, thrombin peak time, and maximum slope of the thrombin curve, whereas in the case of PCC-FVII, thrombin peak height and the area under the thrombin curve were affected particularly strongly. As a result, these two therapeutics tended to push those respective parameters outside their normal ranges. PCC-AT significantly outperformed both FVIIa and PCC-FVII in its ability to normalize individual thrombin generation parameters in diluted blood. Furthermore, PCC-AT could simultaneously restore all five thrombin generation parameters to their normal levels in every subject in the study group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our computational results suggest that PCC-AT may demonstrate a superior ability to restore normal thrombin generation compared with FVIIa and PCC-FVII. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2012; 73: S95-S102. Copyright (C) 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins)

AB The effect of chemical structure of different biologically compatible S-nitrosothiols on the solvation environment at catalytic copper sites in a metal organic framework (MOF) suspended in a solution of ethanol is probed using computational methods. The use of a copper based MOF as a storage vehicle and catalyst (copper sites of the MOF) in the controlled and sustained release of chemically stored nitric oxide (NO) from S-nitrosocysteine has been shown to occur both experimentally and computationally [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2012, 134, 3330-3333; Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2015, 17, 23403]. Previous studies on a copper based MOF, namely HKUST-1, concluded that modifications in the R-group of s-nitrosothiols and/or organic linkers of MOFs led to a method capable of modulating NO release. In order to test the hypothesis that larger R-groups slow down NO release, four different RSNOs (R = cysteine, N-acetylcysteine, N-acetyl-D, L-penicillamine or glutathione) of varying size were investigated, which in turn required the use of a larger copper based MOF. Due to its desirable copper centers and more extensive framework, MOF-143, an analog of HKUST-1 was chosen to further explore both the effect of different RSNOs as well as MOF environments on NO release. Condensed phase classical molecular dynamics simulations are utilized to study the effect of the complex MOF environment as well as the chemical structure and size of the RSNO on the species on the catalytic reaction. The results indicate that in addition to the size of the RSNO species and the organic linkers within the MOF, the reaction rates can be modulated by the molecular structure of the RSNO and furthermore combining different RSNO species can also be used to tune the rate of NO release.

AB P>Traditionally, using a long post can cause progressive removal of the root structure, complicate the ability to re-treat the tooth if necessary and make it difficult to apply an adhesive bonding agent into the root canal. It is unclear if a shorter post length can be applied when a light translucent glass fibre post and adhesive resin cement are used. The aim of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical performance of endodontically treated teeth restored with three post materials, glass-fibre, stainless steel and cast-nickel chromium posts and cores of different lengths of 7, 10 and 13 mm. A 3D finite element analysis model of the maxillary central incisor was constructed. An occlusal load of 300 N was applied to a node at the palatal surface of the crown at 45 degrees to the long axis of the tooth. von Mises stress analyses were carried out in three regions. Simulated data were collected for plotting various pattern graphics and conducting statistical tests. The pattern graphics showed that when the post length changed from 13 to 7 mm, the stress patterns were even and flat in all fibre-post groups, while the stress patterns of the metal-post groups showed an M-shaped peak and trough. Statistical tests showed that the shorter fibre post was superior to the longer metal post in some situations. Within the limitations of this study, it was concluded that when a metal post is used, the post should be as long as possible, while the biomechanical performance of a glass-fibre post combined with a composite resin core was less sensitive to post length.

AB Risk assessment of developmental toxicants is almost exclusively based on single chemicals studied in animals under controlled experimental conditions, as to reduce stress. Although humans may be exposed simultaneously to numerous hazards, little is known about the interaction of prenatal chemical exposures with other factors, such as maternal stress, itself a modifier of fetal development. Gestational stress has been hypothesized to enhance the developmental toxicity of chemicals. This review identified 36 animal studies investigating if maternal stress may enhance the effects of prenatal chemical exposure, and evaluated the presented hypothesis. Studies of a broad range of chemicals and developmental endpoints support the notion, that maternal stress is able to enhance the effects of developmental toxicants, although stress mitigated chemically induced effects in a few cases. Maternal stress most often enhanced chemical developmental toxicity at dose levels associated with severe maternal toxicity or where test agents were already above threshold for effect. Thus, LOAEL(chemical) was generally similar to LOAEL(chemical+ stress), although not necessarily for the same endpoint. It should be noted that the database contained a limited number of studies, and only a single high dose level was applied in most studies, rendering establishment of NOAELs for combined exposures impossible. Furthermore, for some compounds, the margin between human exposure levels and the LOAEL(chemical +stress) seems small. Future studies are recommended to investigate compounds, for which maternal stress was already proven as an enhancer, at lower dose levels. Interactive response seems to depend on stressor severity and timing of chemical exposure relative to maternal stress which should be further scrutinized. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study evaluated the effect of cutting teeth with different types of burs at various speeds on shear bond strength using Prime and Bond NT (Dentsply/DeTrey). A simulated pulpal pressure of 25-mmHg, equivalent to 34 cm-H2O, was created in a false pulpal chamber filled with distilled water and maintained for seven days. The human teeth were divided into six groups of 10 teeth each: fine grit straight fissure diamond bur in air rotor (DA), fine grit straight fissure diamond bur in micromotor (DM), crosscut fissure carbide bur in air rotor (CCA), crosscut fissure carbide bur in micromotor (CCM), plain fissure carbide bur in micromotor (CM) and #600-grit silicon carbide paper (SiC). The tooth surfaces in these groups were cut under copious air-water spray and treated with Prime and Bond NT after etching with 38% phosphoric acid. Composite restorations were then prepared with TPH spectrum (Dentsply/DeTrey). After soaking in water at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, the specimens were loaded at a 45 degrees angle to their longitudinal axes by using a Z 010 Universal Testing Machine (Zwick), and shear bond strengths were determined at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/minute. All of the specimens were then observed under Stereomicroscope at 10x. Statistical analysis was made using one-way and two-way ANOVA and t-test (p < 0.05). The bond strengths achieved with a fine grit straight fissure diamond bur, a crosscut fissure carbide bur in air rotor and a crosscut fissure carbide bur in micromotor, were significantly higher than a fine grit straight fissure diamond bur, a plain fissure carbide bur and #600-grit silicon carbide abrasive paper in the micromotor. Therefore, selecting an appropriate bur and its speed may improve bonding for adhesive systems, although crosscut fissure carbide burs produced high bond strengths at either speed used.

AB Background. Antithymocyte antibody (ATA) remains the most commonly used induction immunosuppressive agent in renal transplantation (RT). To date, few case reports of ATA-induced coagulopathy exist.
   Methods. We performed a single-center, retrospective analysis of renal transplant recipients (RTRs) who underwent RT followed by ATA therapy between 2007 and 2011. The protocol used for deceased donor and unrelated living donor recipient immunosuppression was Thymoglobulin (TMG), methylprednisolone, Cellcept, Prograf, and Rapamune. In related living donor recipients, Simulect (SIM) was substituted for TMG. The international normalized ratio (INR) was routinely checked on days 0 and 2, and thereafter at the discretion of the surgeon. RTRs were transfused packed red blood cells (PRBCs) or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) at the discretion of the surgeon.
   Results. During the study period, 257 RTs were performed at our institution. The following 18 RTR were excluded: simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant recipients (4), RTRs on warfarin at the time of admission (2), RTRs who received OKT3 (2), and RTRs with INR >= 1.2 at the time of admission (10). Of the remaining 239 RTR, 208 (87%) underwent TMG induction therapy; 31 RTR (13%) underwent SIM induction therapy. The mean INR peaked in both groups on day 4 but was higher in TMG recipients (TMG 1.35, SIM 1.20). FFP was transfused in 65 TMG (31%) and 3 SIM (10%) recipients (P = .01); PRBCs were transfused in 88 TMG (44%) and 6 SIM (19%) recipients (P = .02). No patients returned to the operating room for bleeding complications within 7 days of RT. Patient age, gender, ethnicity, and diabetes status were not statistically significant factors in the development of coagulopathy.
   Conclusion. TMG administration is associated with coagulopathy. Using an INR screening protocol and an aggressive transfusion protocol, bleeding complications associated with coagulopathy can be avoided in this higher-risk group.

AB Objective: To evaluate wear resistance, by weight loss and roughness changes, of resin cements and indirect restorative materials to toothbrushing and toothbrushing associated with pH challenge simulation.
   Method and Materials: The following materials were studied: Enforce resin cement (Dentsply), Rely X resin cernent (3M ESPE), Variolink 11 resin cement (Ivociar/Vivadent), Artglass indirect resin composite (Heraeus Kulzer), and Duceram Plus porcelain (Degussa). Twenty cylindrical specimens were prepared for each material for a total of 10 groups (n = 10). After finishing and polishing, the specimens were subjected to toothbrushing. One group of each material was pH cycled before abrasion. For toothbrushing, a machine containing soft-bristle tips, dentifrice, and water was used. One hundred thousand brusihing cycles were pet-formed. Weight loss was determined as the percentage difference between initial (before brushing) and final (after brushing) measurements. Roughness changes were evaluated by the difference between initial and final measurements. Data were analyzed with the paired t test, 2-way ANOVA, and Tukey test (alpha-0.05).
   Results: Paired It test showed significant differences in weight loss and roughness after toot[ brushing (P <.01), Statistically significant differences were found among materials for both weight loss, which ranged from 0.34% (Duceram Plus) to 1.8511/6 (Enforce/pH), and roughness changes, which ranged from -0.03 mu m (Duceram Plus) to 0.29 mu m (Rely X/pH).
   Conclusions: Among cements, Variolink II exhibited the least weight loss and roughness increase. Of all materials, Duceram Plus porcelain presented the lowest weight loss and became smoother after abrasion. of I cycling had no influence on material weight or roughness changes after abrasion.

AB Background: Angiogenesis, the growth of capillaries from preexisting blood vessels, has been extensively studied experimentally over the past thirty years. Molecular insights from these studies have lead to therapies for cancer, macular degeneration and ischemia. In parallel, mathematical models of angiogenesis have helped characterize a broader view of capillary network formation and have suggested new directions for experimental pursuit. We developed a computational model that bridges the gap between these two perspectives, and addresses a remaining question in angiogenic sprouting: how do the processes of endothelial cell elongation, migration and proliferation contribute to vessel formation?
   Results: We present a multiscale systems model that closely simulates the mechanisms underlying sprouting at the onset of angiogenesis. Designed by agent-based programming, the model uses logical rules to guide the behavior of individual endothelial cells and segments of cells. The activation, proliferation, and movement of these cells lead to capillary growth in three dimensions. By this means, a novel capillary network emerges out of combinatorially complex interactions of single cells. Rules and parameter ranges are based on literature data on endothelial cell behavior in vitro. The model is designed generally, and will subsequently be applied to represent species-specific, tissue-specific in vitro and in vivo conditions.
   Initial results predict tip cell activation, stalk cell development and sprout formation as a function of local vascular endothelial growth factor concentrations and the Delta-like 4 Notch ligand, as it might occur in a three-dimensional in vitro setting. Results demonstrate the differential effects of ligand concentrations, cell movement and proliferation on sprouting and directional persistence.
   Conclusion: This systems biology model offers a paradigm closely related to biological phenomena and highlights previously unexplored interactions of cell elongation, migration and proliferation as a function of ligand concentration, giving insight into key cellular mechanisms driving angiogenesis.

AB Acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS equivalent to ACS/CODH equivalent to CODH/ACS) from Moorella thermoacetica catalyzes the synthesis of acetyl-CoA from CO, CoA, and a methyl group of a corrinoid-iron-sulfur protein (CoFeSP). A time lag prior to the onset of acetyl-CoA production, varying from 4 to 20 min, was observed in assay solutions lacking the low-potential electron-transfer agent methyl viologen (MV). No lag was observed when MV was included in the assay. The length of the lag depended on the concentrations of CO and ACS, with shorter lags found for higher [ACS] and sub-saturating [CO]. Lag length also depended on CoFeSP. Rate profiles of acetyl-CoA synthesis, including the lag phase, were numerically simulated assuming an autocatalytic mechanism. A similar reaction profile was monitored by UV-vis spectrophotometry, allowing the redox status of the CoFeSP to be evaluated during this process. At early stages in the lag phase, Co2+FeSP reduced to Co+FeSP, and this was rapidly methylated to afford CH3-Co3+FeSP. During steady-state synthesis of acetyl-CoA, CoFeSP was predominately in the CH3-Co3+FeSP state. As the synthesis rate declined and eventually ceased, the Co+FeSP state predominated. Three activation reductive reactions may be involved, including reduction of the A- and C-clusters within ACS and the reduction of the cobamide of CoFeSP. The B-, C-, and D-clusters in the beta subunit appear to be electronically isolated from the A-cluster in the connected alpha subunit, consistent with the similar to70 Angstrom distance separating these clusters, suggesting the need for an in vivo reductant that activates ACS and/or CoFeSP.

AB In the present study an effort is made to numerically characterize the elastic mechanical behaviour of a polymer based nanocomposite made of nylon-12, also known as polyamide-12 (PA-12), which is uniformly reinforced with C-60 or C-75 fullerenes. For this purpose, a numerical study is conducted in two stages.
   In the first one, a molecular dynamics (MD) approach is formulated to provide numerical solutions regarding the elastic properties of the nanocomposites under investigation, for a wide range of concentrations of the C-60 or C-70 reinforcing agents up to 8% by weight. During the analysis, appropriate cubic representative volume elements (RVEs) are developed which contain at its centers single fullerene nanocrystals surrounded by PA-12 polymer chains, in accordance with the assumed uniform nanoparticle distribution.
   In the second stage, the reinforcing ability of the most spherical fullerene C-65 in nylon-12 matrix is only tested. Given the high computational cost of the MD-only simulations for small C-60 mass fractions, a classical continuum mechanics (CM) method, grounded on the finite element method (FEM), is developed. The proposed method pre-requires the utilization of some MD data regarding the RVE of a nanocomposite of a rather high C-60 mass fraction, in order to develop a same sized, continuum, equivalent volume unit. Then, nanocomposite RVEs of higher filler concentrations are treated in a continuum manner, by placing centrally the developed volume unit in perfect contact with the surrounded PA-12 matrix. Both components are discretized with appropriate solid finite elements to realize the simulations.
   The performance of the MD-only as well as the FEM-MD combined method is investigated through comparisons with relevant experimental measurements.

AB The research and development of a simulation-based decision support system (SB-DSS) capable of assisting early collaborative design processes is presented. The requirements for such a system are included. Existing collaborative DSSs are shown to lack the capability to manipulate complex simulation-based relationships. On the other hand, advances within the machine learning in design community are shown to have a potential for providing, but have not yet addressed, simulation-based support for collaborative design processes. The developed SB-DSS is described in terms of its four principal components. First, the behavior-evaluation (BE) model is used to both structure individual, domain-specific decision models and organize these models into a collaborative decision model. Second, a probabilistic framework for the BE model enables management of the uncertainty inherent in learning and using simulation-based knowledge. Significantly, this framework provides a constraint satisfaction environment in which simulation-based knowledge is used. Third, a statistical neural network approach is used to capture simulation-based knowledge and build the probabilistic behavior models based on this knowledge. Fourth, since a probability distribution theory does not exist for the nonlinear neural network approaches, Monte Carlo simulation is introduced as a method to sample the trained neural networks and approximate the likelihoods of design variable values. Consequently, constraint satisfaction problem-solving capability is obtained. In addition, a mapping of the SB-DSS architecture onto a collaborative design agent framework is provided. Experimental evaluation of a prototype SB-DSS system is summarized, and performance of the SB-DSS with respect to search and usability metrics is documented. Initial results in developing the simulation-based support for collaborative design are encouraging. Lastly, a categorization of the machine learning approach and a critique of the proposed categorization scheme is presented.

AB At present, disrupting p53-MDM2 interactions through small molecule ligands is a promising approach to safe treatment and management of human cancer. Tumor cells unlike the normal cells, are rapidly evolving affecting the efficacy of many approved anti-cancer agents due to drug resistance. Therefore, identifying a potential anticancer compound is crucial. Pharmacophore based virtual screening, followed by molecular docking, ADMET evaluation, and molecular dynamics studies against MDM2 protein was investigated to identify potential ligands that may act as inhibitors. The model (AHRR_1) with survival score (4.176) was selected among the top ranked generated Pharmacophore hypothesis. Validation of the model hypothesis by an external dataset of actives and inactive compounds produced significant validation attributes including; AUC = 0.85, BEDROC = 0.56 at alpha = 20.0, RIE = 8.18, AUAC = 0.88, and EF of 6.2 at the top 2% of the dataset. The model was use for screening the ZINC database, and the top 1375 hits satisfying the model hypothesis were subjected to molecular docking studies to understand the molecular and structural basis of selectivity of compounds for MDM2 protein. A sub-set of 25 compounds with binding energy lower than the reference inhibitors were evaluated for pharmacokinetic properties. Four compounds (ZINC02639178, ZINC06752762, ZINC38933175, and ZINC77969611) showed the most desired pharmacokinetic profile. Lastly, investigation of the dynamic behaviour of leads-protein complexes through MD simulation showed similar RMSD, RMSF, and H-bond occupancy profile compared to a reference inhibitor, suggesting stability throughout the simulation time. However, ZINC02639178 was found to satisfy the molecular enumeration the most compared to the other three leads. It may emerge as potential treatment option after extensive experimental studies.

AB A model used for velocity control during car following is proposed based on reinforcement learning (RL). To optimize driving performance, a reward function is developed by referencing human driving data and combining driving features related to safety, efficiency, and comfort. With the developed reward function, the RL agent learns to control vehicle speed in a fashion that maximizes cumulative rewards, through trials and errors in the simulation environment. To avoid potential unsafe actions, the proposed RL model is incorporated with a collision avoidance strategy for safety checks. The safety check strategy is used during both model training and testing phases, which results in faster convergence and zero collisions. A total of 1,341 car-following events extracted from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset are used to train and test the proposed model. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated by the comparison with empirical NGSIM data and with adaptive cruise control (ACC) algorithm implemented through model predictive control (MPC). The experimental results show that the proposed model demonstrates the capability of safe, efficient, and comfortable velocity control and outperforms human drivers in that it 1) has larger TTC values than those of human drivers, 2) can maintain efficient and safe headways around 1.2s, and 3) can follow the lead vehicle comfortably with smooth acceleration (jerk value is only a third of that of human drivers). Compared with the MPC-based ACC algorithm, the proposed model has better performance in terms of safety, comfort, and especially running speed during testing (more than 200 times faster). The results indicate that the proposed approach could contribute to the development of better autonomous driving systems.

AB Background: Microtine species in Fennoscandia display a distinct north-south gradient from regular cycles to stable populations. The gradient has often been attributed to changes in the interactions between microtines and their predators. Although the spatial structure of the environment is known to influence predator-prey dynamics of a wide range of species, it has scarcely been considered in relation to the Fennoscandian gradient. Furthermore, the length of microtine breeding season also displays a north-south gradient. However, little consideration has been given to its role in shaping or generating population cycles. Because these factors covary along the gradient it is difficult to distinguish their effects experimentally in the field. The distinction is here attempted using realistic agent-based modelling.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: By using a spatially explicit computer simulation model based on behavioural and ecological data from the field vole (Microtus agrestis), we generated a number of repeated time series of vole densities whose mean population size and amplitude were measured. Subsequently, these time series were subjected to statistical autoregressive modelling, to investigate the effects on vole population dynamics of making predators more specialised, of altering the breeding season, and increasing the level of habitat fragmentation. We found that fragmentation as well as the presence of specialist predators are necessary for the occurrence of population cycles. Habitat fragmentation and predator assembly jointly determined cycle length and amplitude. Length of vole breeding season had little impact on the oscillations.
   Significance: There is good agreement between our results and the experimental work from Fennoscandia, but our results allow distinction of causation that is hard to unravel in field experiments. We hope our results will help understand the reasons for cycle gradients observed in other areas. Our results clearly demonstrate the importance of landscape fragmentation for population cycling and we recommend that the degree of fragmentation be more fully considered in future analyses of vole dynamics.

AB The accurate determination of cell cycle, immunophenotypes and morphology at single-cell level is not fully achieved by current flow cytometry protocols. Acetone, a coagulant fixative/permealizing agent, is widely used in static cytometry, but is impractical in flow cytometry because of its shrinking effect. We sought for conditions of acetone treatment that could permit the simultaneous analysis of physical parameters, surface and intracellular immunostaining, and DNA content. We evaluated different experimental conditions (concentration, duration of fixation, temperature, presence of proteins) to test the capacity of acetone fixation/permeabilization to preserve cell physical parameters (forward and side scatters, FSC, and SSC) and immunophenotyping while allowing stoichiometric DNA staining. The commonly used ethanol fixation technique was used as reference method. To detect phenotypes and DNA content simultaneously, we employed 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) as "intercalating" dye for DNA in spite of, or just for, its controversial ability in stoichiometric DNA staining. Cells were resting peripheral blood monucleated cells (PBMCs), T- and B-cell blasts obtained by PBMCs stimulation, and the human cell lines Ramos and Shep. Acetone fixation, preserving both the recovery and the physical parameters of cells, is drastically influenced by temperature of treatment and is practicable only when the protocol is realized at 8C. Under this condition, acetone maintains the immunophenotypic fluorescences (realized before or after the fixation) better than ethanol. Stoichiometric DNA staining of acetone processed cells, the variation coefficients (CV) of frequency distributions of G1/GO and G2/M phases, the modes ratio of these distributions and doublets generation are at least comparable to those obtained with ethanol treatment. The assay developed in the present study, that we called flow acetone-staining technique (FAST), accurately analyzes cell cycle, physical parameters and immunophenotypes in heterogenous cell populations, and thus provides a useful tool for cytomics.

TI Drop size distributions in high holdup fraction dispersion systems:
   Effect of the degree of hydrolysis of PVA stabilizer
SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Although turbulence-stabilized dispersions are of considerable industrial importance, their behaviour is generally not well understood, especially for the high dispersed phase volume fractions encountered in suspension polymerization reactors. The dispersion is formed by two dynamic processes, namely, drop breakage and coalescence. Breakage mainly occurs in regions of high shear stress near the impeller or as a result of turbulent velocity and pressure fluctuations along the surface of a drop. Droplet coalescence is prevented by the combined action of turbulent agitation and the addition of protective colloids such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). Depending on the combination of the degree of agitation and the concentration and type of surface active agent, the average droplet size can exhibit a U-shaped variation with respect to the impeller speed or the degree of hydrolysis of the PVA stabilizer. This U-type behaviour has been confirmed both experimentally and theoretically and has been attributed to a manifestation of the balance between breakage and coalescence rates of the monomer drops. Both processes are related to the interfacial tension and its variation with time as a result of the varying polymer concentration and conformation at the monomer/water interface. In the present study, a series of experiments were carried out with a model system of 50% n-butyl chloride in water in the presence of PVA with varying degrees of hydrolysis at different agitation rates. A generalized numerical algorithm incorporating the most comprehensive models describing the breakage and coalescence processes has been used for simulating the steady-state drop size distributions in a high holdup liquid-liquid dispersion system in order to elucidate the breakage and coalescence mechanisms as a function of the droplet interfacial characteristics. It is shown that the model simulations are in satisfactory agreement with measurements of the drop size distributions over the whole range of the experimental conditions investigated.

TI Evaluation of characteristic diameter on barite settling in drilling
   fluids by Monte Carlo method

AB Several researchers have discussed the settling behaviour of particulate materials because of the challenges and applications in different engineering fields. Particularly, settling of such weighting agents as barite, commonly added to drilling fluids, can cause problems in oil production, either on drilling processes or in production. Typically, sedimentation models consider a single value of particle size, which in this work, we refer to as characteristic diameter. This particle size can be chosen by statistical methods, such as the Sauter mean diameter, or it can be extracted directly from particle size distribution such as its mean, median, or mode. There are some conventions by how to choose the characteristic diameter; however, discarding the whole size variability from the particle size distribution is unwise. Regarding the literature, only a few works have, to the best of our knowledge, discussed the effects of this choice on the models' performance. This work then presents a new perspective on evaluating the uncertainty of the particle size distribution and choosing the best characteristic diameter, using a novel method based on Monte Carlo simulations. To evaluate the method, research team chose a barite settling model (recently published) for drilling fluids. Experimental data of barite concentration in batch settling test supported the Monte Carlo simulations. Five characteristic diameters were evaluated. Results showed different column heights have different characteristic diameters which differed from classical values such as Sauter's diameter by up to 200%, producing different model output variables. New particle size also affected estimation of remaining parameters and changed predicted properties such as media permeability by up to 90%. This work opens a discussion on how well-represented a particle size distribution is when researchers choose only a characteristic diameter is chosen without evaluating the whole distribution.

AB Zinc uptake in roots is believed to be mediated by ZIP (ZRT-, IRT-like proteins) transporters. Once inside the symplast, zinc is transported to the pericycle, where it exits by means of HMA (heavy metal ATPase) transporters. The combination of symplastic transport and spatial separation of influx and efflux produces a pattern in which zinc accumulates in the pericycle. Here, mathematical modelling was employed to study the importance of ZIP regulation, HMA abundance and symplastic transport in creation of the radial pattern of zinc in primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.
   A comprehensive one-dimensional dynamic model of radial zinc transport in roots was developed and used to conduct simulations. The model accounts for the structure of the root consisting of symplast and apoplast and includes effects of water flow, diffusion and cross-membrane transport via transporters. It also incorporates the radial geometry and varying porosity of root tissues, as well as regulation of ZIP transporters.
   Steady-state patterns were calculated for various zinc concentrations in the medium, water influx and HMA abundance. The experimentally observed zinc gradient was reproduced very well. An increase of HMA or decrease in water influx led to loss of the gradient. The dynamic behaviour for a change in medium concentration and water influx was also simulated showing short adaptation times in the range of seconds to minutes. Slowing down regulation led to oscillations in expression levels, suggesting the need for rapid regulation and existence of buffering agents.
   The model captures the experimental findings very well and confirms the hypothesis that low abundance of HMA4 produces a radial gradient in zinc concentration. Surprisingly, transpiration was found also to be a key parameter. The model suggests that ZIP regulation takes place on a comparable timescale as symplastic transport.

AB P-Glycoprotein, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily, is a multidrug transporter responsible for cellular efflux of hundreds of structurally unrelated compounds, including natural products, many clinically used drugs and anticancer agents. Expression of P-glycoprotein has been linked to multidrug resistance in human cancers. ABC transporters are driven by ATP hydrolysis at their two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains, which interact to form a closed ATP-bound sandwich dimer. Intimate knowledge of the catalytic cycle of these proteins is clearly essential for understanding their mechanism of action. P-Glycoprotein has been proposed to hydrolyse ATP by an alternating mechanism, for which there is substantial experimental evidence, including inhibition of catalytic activity by trapping of ortho-vanadate at one nucleotide-binding domain, and the observation of an asymmetric occluded state. Despite many studies of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity over the past 20 years, no comprehensive kinetic analysis has yet been carried out, and some puzzling features of its behaviour remain unexplained. In this work, we have built several progressively more complex kinetic models, and then carried out simulations and detailed analysis, to test the validity of the proposed reaction pathway employed by P-glycoprotein for ATP hydrolysis. To establish kinetic parameters for the catalytic cycle, we made use of the large amount of published data on ATP hydrolysis by hamster P-glycoprotein, both purified and in membrane vesicles. The proposed kinetic scheme(s) include a high affinity priming reaction for binding of the first ATP molecule, and an independent pathway for ADP binding outside the main catalytic cycle. They can reproduce to varying degrees the observed behavior of the protein's ATPase activity and its inhibition by ortho-vanadate. The results provide new insights into the mode of action of P-glycoprotein, and some hypotheses about the nature of the occluded nucleotide-bound state.

AB We have reported previously [Fedorocko, P.; Int. J. Ridiat. Biol. 65:465, 1994] that liposomal muramyl tripeptidephosphatidyl ethanolamine (MTP-PE/MLV) given prior to irradiation results in augmented hemopoietic recovery and enhanced animal survival as evidenced by increased pluripotent stem cells (CFU-S) and progenitor cells committed to granulocyte and/or macrophage development (GM-CFC) or white blood cells, neutrophil counts, as well as by survival rates of lethally irradiated mice.
   In this report the effects of liposomal MTP-PE (radioprotective immunomodulator; 10 mg/kg i.p., 24 h before irradiation) and indomethacin (inhibitor of prostaglandin production; 2 mg/kg i.m., 24 h and 3 h before irradiation) were studied. Both of the agents were administered either alone or in combination. The results included the assessment of preirradiation hemopoietic effects of drugs and postirradiation hemopoietic recovery in terms of bone marrow cellularity, number of bone marrow GM-CFC, endogenous spleen colony formation (endoCFU-S), and the determination of the survival of lethally irradiated mice.
   Experimental evidence elevated by the increased preirradiation numbers of GM-CFC and hydroxyurea kill of GM-CFC as well as a simultaneous significant diminution in bone marrow cellularity indicated that the beneficial action of the combined treatment could be a consequence of increased cell proliferation in the hemopoietic tissue and mobilization with redistribution of stem cells from bone marrow into the circulation. In the postirradiation period (3-14 days), combined pretreatment of mice accelerated myelopoietic regeneration in the bone marrow compared to treatment with MTP-PE/MLV alone or indomethacin alone.
   Combined administration of MTP-PE/MLV (10 mg/kg, -24 h, i.p.) and indomethacin (2 mg/kg, -24 h and -3 h, i.m.) to mice, prior to lethal irradiation, exerted an additional radioprotective effect and protected 100% of the C57B1/6 mice.

SO ENERGY & ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE

ID HYDROGEN-PRODUCTION; TEMPERATURE
AB The efficiency limits, gas-crossover behavior, formation of local pH gradients near the electrode surfaces, and safety characteristics have been evaluated experimentally as well as by use of multi-physics modeling and simulation methods for an integrated solar-driven water-splitting system that operates with bulk electrolyte solutions buffered at near-neutral pH. The integrated membrane-free system utilized a triple-junction amorphous hydrogenated Si (a-Si:H) cell as the light absorber, Pt and cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen-evolution reaction (OER), respectively, and a bulk aqueous solution buffered at pH = 9.2 by 1.0 M of boric acid/borate as an electrolyte. Although the solar-to-electrical efficiency of the stand-alone triple-junction a-Si:H photovoltaic cell was 7.7%, the solar-to-hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency for the integrated membrane-free water-splitting system was limited under steady-state operation to 3.2%, and the formation of pH gradients near the electrode surfaces accounted for the largest voltage loss. The membrane-free system exhibited negligible product-recombination loss while operating at current densities near 3.0 mA cm(-2), but exhibited significant crossover of products (up to 40% H-2 in the O-2 chamber), indicating that the system was not intrinsically safe. A system that contained a membrane to minimize the gas crossover, but which was otherwise identical to the membrane-free system, yielded very low energy-conversion efficiencies at steady state, due to low transference numbers for protons across the membranes resulting in electrodialysis of the solution and the consequent formation of large concentration gradients of both protons and buffer counterions near the electrode surfaces. The modeling and simulation results showed that despite the addition of 1.0 M of buffering agent to the bulk of the solution, during operation significant pH gradients developed near the surfaces of the electrodes. Hence, although the bulk electrolyte was buffered to near-neutral pH, the electrode surfaces and electrocatalysts experienced local environments under steady-state operation that were either highly acidic or highly alkaline in nature, changing the chemical form of the electrocatalysts and exposing the electrodes to potentially corrosive local pH conditions. In addition to significant pH gradients, the STH conversion efficiency of both types of systems was limited by the mass transport of ionic species to the electrode surfaces. Even at operating current densities of <3 mA cm(-2), the voltage drops due to these pH gradients exceeded the combined electrocatalyst overpotentials for the hydrogen- and oxygen-evolution reactions at current densities of 10 mA cm(-2). Hence, such near-neutral pH solar-driven water-splitting systems were both fundamentally limited in efficiency and/or co-evolved explosive mixtures of H-2(g) and O-2(g) in the presence of active catalysts for the recombination of H-2(g) and O-2(g).
   Broader context
   Development of an integrated solar-driven water-splitting system has received increasing attention for large-scale solar-energy-conversion and storage applications. To develop an efficient, scalable and safe technology, a cation-exchange membrane ran anion-exchange membrane is typically employed to separate the gaseous products and minimize the recombination losses in the system, as well as for other system design reasons. As a result, acidic or strong alkaline electrolytes are required to reduce the solution transport losses in the cell and to obtain high transference numbers for protons through the membrane. Alternatively, several studies have reported solar-drived water-splitting devices that operate in bulk electrolytes buffered to near-neutral pH in the absence of a membrane. However, the potential losses due to the pH gradient at the surface of the electrodes, and losses due to product crossover and recombination were not fully understood for those devices. To develop a stable, scalable and safe technology, these loss mechanisms and safety characteristics need to be critically addressed.

AB NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is currently an emerging target in pancreatic cancer. In this report, we describe a series of indolequinones, based on 5-methoxy-1,2-dimethyl-3-[(4-nitrophenoxy)methyl]indole-4,7-dione (ES936), and evaluate NQO1 inhibition and growth inhibitory activity in the human pancreatic MIA PaCa-2 tumor cell line. The indolequinones with 4-nitrophenoxy, 4-pyridinyloxy, and acetoxy substituents at the (indol-3-yl)methyl position were NADH-dependent inhibitors of recombinant human NQO1, indicative of mechanism-based inhibition. However, those with hydroxy and phenoxy substituents were poor inhibitors of NQO1 enzyme activity, due to attenuated elimination of the leaving group. The ability of this series of indolequinones to inhibit recombinant human NQO1 correlated with NQO1 inhibition in MIA PaCa-2 cells. The examination of indolequinone interactions in complex with NQO1 from computational-based molecular docking simulations supported the observed biochemical data with respect to NQO1 inhibition. The design of both NQO1-inhibitory and noninhibitory indolequinone analogues allowed us to test the hypothesis that NQO1 inhibition was required for growth inhibitory activity in MIA PaCa-2 cells. ES936 and its 6-methoxy analogue were potent inhibitors of NQO1 activity and cell proliferation; however, the 4-pyridinyloxy and acetoxy compounds were also potent inhibitors of NQO1 activity but relatively poor inhibitors of cell proliferation. In addition, the phenoxy compounds, which were not inhibitors of NQO1 enzymatic activity, demonstrated potent growth inhibition. These data demonstrate that NQO1 inhibitory activity can be dissociated from growth inhibitory activity and suggest additional or alternative targets to NQO1 that are responsible for the growth inhibitory activity of this series of indolequinones in human pancreatic cancer.

AB The main purpose of this article is to develop a meta-analysis about the relationships and potential perspectives of modeling and simulation in supply chains. The research methodology used in this paper was a systematic literature review, exploring the state of the art in Supply Chain Simulation. The methodological procedures were based on a systematic literature review and statistical analysis of a sample of papers. The results indicated that modeling and simulation in supply chains can be better integrated. The models could be more sophisticated to capture the dynamics and behavior of these networks. The combination of optimization methods with agent-based simulation is an observed trend. Hybrid simulations involving normative models and empirical applications can be useful to represent the reality of supply chains, generating alternative solutions that improve supply chain performance. The relevance of this article is to analyze the interfaces related to this field of research, in order to establish a theoretical framework that improves the process of modeling, simulation and decision-making in supply chains.

AB The Potts dynamic system is investigated to reproduce and analyze the fluctuation and noises of the financial markets in the present paper. A random financial agent-based model is developed by applying the stochastic dynamic systems to uncover the cross-correlation complexity and synchronization between different markets. In attempt to verify the rationally of the established model, the descriptive statistical analysis and cross-correlation of return behaviors between different series are exhibited by comparing with the actual market returns, SSE, SZSE, HSI, N225, GDAX and IXIC. Furthermore, the multiscale cross-sample entropy (MSCE) analysis and the multiscale generalized complexity synchronization (MGCS) analysis are employed to measure the cross-correlation between different series at multiple scales, where the MGCS method is firstly introduced to verify the synchrony behaviors between simulative series and actual series. Empirical results reveal that the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed financial model, and exhibit the cross-correlation and synchronization behaviors among the return series from the perspective of complexity analysis.

AB Causes of cyclic fluctuations in the abundance of Fraser River sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been the focus of considerable debate for much of this century. Most hypotheses to explain cyclic behaviour in Fraser River sockeye centre on identifying agents of depensatory mortality, and several recent papers argue that sockeye cycles are maintained primarily by depensatory fishing patterns. We assess the evidence for depensatory fishing as an explanation for these cycles. Using simulations, we demonstrate that empirical evidence for depensatory fishing is likely an artifact caused by bias in estimating stock composition of catches in mixed-stock fisheries. Moreover, recent trends in harvest rates among comigrating stocks with asynchronous cycles are inconsistent with the depensatory fishing hypothesis. It also seems very unlikely that aboriginal and early commercial fisheries were intensive enough to maintain cycles that persisted prior to 1860. Only during the unregulated, early commercial fishery prior to the collapse of the upriver runs following the 1913-14 disaster at Hell's Gate is there any convincing evidence of depensatory fishing.

AB Enhanced Co migration in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA, referred to below as Y) at U.S. Department of Energy waste sites may be due to the presence of Co(III)-Y rather than Co(II)-Y chelates in groundwaters. To examine the implication of this for the attenuation of Co in soils and subsoils, the absorption of equimolar Co and Y by delta-Al2O3 was examined for ranges of pH (5-9.5), adsorbate concentration (0.2-10 muM), adsorbent concentration (0.1-10 g/L), and ionic strength (0.1-0.001 M NaClO4) in the presence of dissolved Al (0.2-10 muM in equilibrium with delta-Al2O3. The anionic Co(II)-Y and Co(III)-Y chelates exhibited ligand-like adsorption behavior as a function of pH; however, under identical conditions, Co(III)-Y adsorption was much less than that of Co(II)-Y. Dissolved Al competed with Co(II) for Y and, in both Co(II)-Y and Y-only experiments, Al-Y appeared to adsorb, although the affinity of surface hydroxyls (XOH) is greater for Co(II)-Y than for Al-Y. Significant variation in Co(II)-Y and Al-Y adsorption with ionic strength suggests that there is a major electrostatic contribution to adsorption and supports the hypothesis that these chelates form outer-sphere complexes (ion pairs) with XOH. Evidence for competition between XOH and Y for the Co(II) occurs only at the highest adsorbent-to-adsorbate ratio (10 g/L: 0.5 muM = Co(II) = Y), where Co(II)- and Co(II)-Y adsorption occur simultaneously for pH > 8. Outer-sphere surface complexes between XOH and the free carboxylate groups of the chelated Al and Co are proposed to describe absorption.

AB Objectives. To develop a protocol for assessment of the bulk viscoelastic behavior of dentin extracellular matrix (ECM), and to assess relationships between induced collagen cross linking and viscoelasticity of the dentin ECM.
   Methods. Dentin ECM was treated with agents to induce exogenous collagen cross-linking: proanthocyanidins (PACs) from Vitis vinifera - VVe, PACs from Pinus massoniana PMe, glutaraldehyde - (GA), or kept untreated (control). A dynamic mechanical strain sweep method was carried out in a 3-point bending submersion clamp at treatment; after protein destabilization with 4 M urea and after 7-day, 6-month, and 12-month incubation in simulated body fluid. Tan 8, storage (E'), loss (E"), and complex moduli (E*) were calculated and data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and post-hoc tests (a = 0.05). Chemical analysis of dentin ECM before and after protein destabilization was assessed with ATR-FTIR spectroscopy.
   Results. Significant interactions between study factors (treatment vs. time points, p < 0.001) were found for all viscoelastic parameters. Despite a significant decrease in all moduli after destabilization, PAC-treated dentin remained statistically higher than control (p < 0.001), indicating permanent mechanical enhancement after biomodification. Covalently crosslinked, GA-treated dentin was unaffected by destabilization (p = 0.873) and showed the lowest damping capacity (tan 8) at all time points (p < 0.001). After 12 months, the damping capacity of PMe and VVe groups decreased significantly. Changes in all amide IR resonances revealed a partial chemical reversal of PAC-mediated biomodification.
   Significance. Viscoelastic measurements and IR spectroscopy aid in elucidating the role of inter-molecular collagen cross-linking in the mechanical behavior of dentin ECM. (C) 2020 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Human behaviour is commonly optimised in economic models of adaptation to climate change. These models assume that people work to maximise profit, subject to financial and technological limitations. In effect, these models simulate adaptive potential. In reality, adaptation falls short of this potential. This shortfall is conceptualised as the adaptation deficit, and it has been causing increasing concern.
   This study demonstrates the impacts of the ways by which people's real-world adaptive behaviours depart from those assumed under pure optimisation. These departures, known as adaptation constraints, are formalised as numerical preference functions based on an empirical case study in New Zealand, and they are used to constrain an agent-based model of climate change adaptation. We show that these empirically-specified adaptation constraints reduce profits relative to an optimised specification by roughly one third. This demonstrates that unconstrained economic models are likely to significantly underestimate the costs of adaptation to climate change, the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and the residual loss and damage that climate change will cause.

AB Introduction: Caspase-3 is one of the executioner caspases activated as a result of apoptosis. Radiolabeled isatins bind to caspase-3 with high affinity and are potential tracers for use with positron emission tomography to image apoptosis. We compared the ability of two novel radiolabeled isatins, [F-18]WC-IV-3 and [C-11]WC-98, to detect caspase-3 activation in a rat model of cycloheximide-induced liver injury.
   Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with cycloheximide and then imaged with microPET 3 h later with [F-18]WC-IV-3 and [C-11]WC-98. Biodistribution studies were also performed simultaneously, with caspase-3 activation verified by fluorometric enzyme assay and Western blots.
   Results: MicroPET imaging studies demonstrated similar behavior of both tracers but with a lower maximum peak with [C-11]WC-98 than with [F-18]WC-IV-3. Biodisuibution studies demonstrated increased uptake of both tracers in the liver and spleen, but this was statistically significant only in the liver with both compounds. The level of [F-18]WC-IV-3 uptake appeared to correlate roughly with rates of caspase-3 activation by the enzyme assay, but the magnitude of difference between treated and control groups was lower than that observed in previously published data with [F-18]WC-II-89, another radiolabeled isatin analog. Activation was also confirmed in the liver and spleen but not in fat by Western blot.
   Conclusion: [F-18]WC-IV-3 uptake appears to correlate with increased caspase-3 enzyme activity, but the dynamic range of uptake of these two tracers appears to be less than that seen with [F-18]WC-II-89. Studies are ongoing to verify these results in other animal models of apoptosis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   logit regression; extra time
ID DESIGNATED HITTER RULE; HOME ADVANTAGE; MORAL HAZARD; SOCCER; STRATEGY;
   PLAYERS
AB Assessing the effect of the timing and sequencing of various policy regimes on optimizing agent behavior is both important and difficult. To offer some insights, this article examines a timing decision from sports. The penalty shootout in football (soccer) has long been seen as problematic, among other reasons because it creates incentives for excessively cautious play during extra time. One proposal to alleviate this has been to alter the timing, and stage the shootout before (rather than after) extra time with the result binding only if the subsequent extra time offers no resolution. Carrillo's (2007) theoretical model shows that since the effect of this rule change is ambiguous in theory, the proposal's desirability needs to be assessed empirically. Using a comprehensive match data set, the authors compare scoring outcomes of various treatment and control groups, whereby the former simulate closely players' incentives from the proposed rule change, and the latter represent the current timing. Most importantly, the authors examine how extra time scoring probabilities depend on a goal being scored in the first 5 (or 15) min of extra time. Their estimates suggest that bringing the shootout before extra time would substantially alter the players' incentives in extra time and produce more overall attacking play. Quantitatively, the rule change is predicted to increase the odds of extra time scoring about threefold. Specifically, for the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA club competitions, the probability of scoring in extra time is estimated to increase on average by 45-60%, depending on various factors such as the result in regulation time, balancedness of the teams, and home ground advantage. In summary, all these results suggest that the case for trialing the proposed rule is strong. More generally, they highlight the incentive channels through which sequencing of policies may determine their effectiveness.

TI Emergence of macroscopic directed motion in populations of motile
   colloids
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID DENSITY-FLUCTUATIONS; COLLECTIVE MOTION; ACTIVE MATTER; HYDRODYNAMICS
AB From the formation of animal flocks to the emergence of coordinated motion in bacterial swarms, populations of motile organisms at all scales display coherent collective motion. This consistent behaviour strongly contrasts with the difference in communication abilities between the individuals. On the basis of this universal feature, it has been proposed that alignment rules at the individual level could solely account for the emergence of unidirectional motion at the group level(1-4). This hypothesis has been supported by agent-based simulations(1,5,6). However, more complex collective behaviours have been systematically found in experiments, including the formation of vortices(7-9), fluctuating swarms(7,10), clustering(11,12) and swirling(13-16). All these (living and man-made) model systems (bacteria(9,10,16), biofilaments and molecular motors(7,8,13), shaken grains(14,15) and reactive colloids(11,12)) predominantly rely on actual collisions to generate collective motion. As a result, the potential local alignment rules are entangled with more complex, and often unknown, interactions. The large-scale behaviour of the populations therefore strongly depends on these uncontrolled microscopic couplings, which are extremely challenging to measure and describe theoretically. Here we report that dilute populations of millions of colloidal rolling particles self-organize to achieve coherentmotion in a unique direction, with very few density and velocity fluctuations. Quantitatively identifying the microscopic interactions between the rollers allows a theoretical description of this polar-liquid state. Comparison of the theory with experiment suggests that hydrodynamic interactions promote the emergence of collective motion either in the form of a single macroscopic 'flock', at low densities, or in that of a homogenous polar phase, at higher densities. Furthermore, hydrodynamics protects the polar-liquid state from the giant density fluctuations that were hitherto considered the hallmark of populations of self-propelled particles(2,3,17). Our experiments demonstrate that genuine physical interactions at the individual level are sufficient to set homogeneous active populations into stable directed motion.

TI STANDARDIZED NONINVASIVE ASSESSMENT OF MYOCARDIAL FREE FATTY-ACID

   (I-123-PARAPPA) SCINTIGRAPHY .2. CLINICAL-RESULTS

DT Article
AB Our results establish that myocardial regions supplied by a significantly stenosed coronary vessel can be distinguished with high statistical significance from healthy regions on account of changes in the myocardium/background ratio, i.e. a reduction of regional uptake of 15-(p-iodo-phenyl) pentadecanoic acid (pPPA). The statistical significance applies to patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), to all examined CAD areas without areas of infarction as well as to infarcted regions. Our results also confirm the suitability of labelled fatty acids, such as pPPA, for the visualization of damaged myocardial regions. The results further indicate that pPPA practically is of comparable value to Tl-201 with regard to their respective qualities as 'static' imaging agents for the heart muscle.
   This study, with the help of a simultaneous analysis of regional myocardial perfusion rates (rMBF) and of a parameter for the metabolism of fatty acids, practised here for the first time, could demonstrate interindividual differences between patients and groups of patients with a correlation between perfusion and the utilization of pPPA in patients with CAD. The reciprocal of the rMBF, the mean transit time (MTT), was significantly prolonged after stress in patients with CAD (P < 0.05), suggesting impaired 'microcirculation' in the patient group.
   The determination of elimination half-lives (T1/2) contributes little if any information towards delineation of cardiac disease entities. The wide overlap of T1/2 values between various clinical syndromes and entities with extreme standard deviations remained an annoying problem in our studies. Nevertheless, certain trends in T1/2 behaviour could be recorded, but they did not yield any statistical significances, because of the high degree of individual variability. A considerable variability of T1/2 values among healthy controls was recorded as well as intra-individually in different regions of the heart muscle. The wide range of 'normal' values rendered statistical evaluation almost, if not entirely, impossible. It appears that the high degree of variability results amongst others, from technical shortcomings in the external recording instruments, i.e. gamma cameras, as well as from the presence of interfering alternate substrates such as glucose and lactate. Nevertheless, the wide range of measured results in healthy control subjects suggests the presence of a considerable regional intra-individual heterogeneity of cardiac substrate metabolism.
   One must therefore accept, at least in our opinion, that T1/2 values are not sufficiently reliable as an indicator of myocardial metabolism and are of little value with respect to clinical diagnostic considerations and to prognosis as well. Possible explanations for this finding are offered and discussed in this paper.

TI Zealots in multistate noisy voter models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICAL PHYSICS; INDUCED BISTABILITY; TRANSITIONS
AB The noisy voter model is a stylized representation of opinion dynamics. Individuals copy opinions from other individuals, and are subject to spontaneous state changes. In the case of two opinion states this model is known to have a noise-driven transition between a unimodal phase, in which both opinions are present, and a bimodal phase, in which one of the opinions dominates. The presence of zealots can remove the unimodal and bimodal phases in the model with two opinion states. Here we study the effects of zealots in noisy voter models with M > 2 opinion states on complete interaction graphs. We find that the phase behavior diversifies, with up to six possible qualitatively different types of stationary states. The presence of zealots removes some of these phases, but not all. We analyze situations in which zealots affect the entire population, or only a fraction of agents, and show that this situation corresponds to a single-community model with a fractional number of zealots, further enriching the phase diagram. Our study is conducted analytically based on effective birth-death dynamics for the number of individuals holding a given opinion. Results are confirmed in numerical simulations.

AB In Braak's model of ascending degeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD), involvement of the amygdala occurs simultaneously with substantia nigra degeneration. However, the clinical manifestations of amygdalar involvement in PD have not been fully delineated. Considered a multitask manager, the amygdala is a densely connected hub, coordinating and integrating tasks ranging from prompt, multisensorial emotion recognition to adequate emotional responses and emotional tuning of memories. Although phylogenetically predisposed to handle fear, the amygdala handles both aversive and positive emotional inputs. In PD, neuropathological and in vivo studies suggest primarily amygdalar hypofunction. However, as dopamine acts as an inverted U-shaped amygdalar modulator, medication-induced hyperactivity of the amygdala can occur. We propose that amygdalar (network) dysfunction contributes to reduced recognition of negative emotional face expressions, impaired theory of mind, reactive hypomimia, and impaired decision making. Similarly, impulse control disorders in predisposed individuals, hallucinations, anxiety, and panic attacks may be related to amygdalar dysfunction. When available, we discuss amygdala-independent trigger mechanisms of these symptoms. Although dopaminergic agents have mostly an activation effect on amygdalar function, adaptive and compensatory network changes may occur as well, but these have not been sufficiently explored. In conclusion, our model of amygdalar involvement brings together several elements of Parkinson's disease phenomenology heretofore left unexplained and provides a framework for testable hypotheses in patients during life and in autopsy analyses.

AB The eye movements of skilled readers are typically very regular (K. Rayner, 1998). This regularity may arise as a result of the perceptual, cognitive, and motor limitations of the reader (e.g., limited visual acuity) and the inherent constraints of the task (e.g., identifying the words in their correct order). To examine this hypothesis, reinforcement learning was used to allow an artificial "agent" to learn to move its eyes to read as efficiently as possible. The resulting patterns of simulated eye movements resembled those of skilled readers and suggest that important aspects of eye-movement behavior might emerge as a consequence of satisfying the constraints that are imposed on readers. These results also suggest novel interpretations of some contentious empirical results, such as the fixation duration costs associated with word skipping (R. Kliegl & R. Engbert, 2005), and theoretical assumptions, for example the familiarity check in the E-Z Reader model of eye-movement control (E. D. Reichle, A. Pollatsek, D. L. Fisher, & K. Rayner, 1998).

AB Owing to increasing resistance rates in Europe, pharmacodynamic analyses were proposed to determine optimal empirical antibiotic therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated in Hungary. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 180 non-duplicate P. aeruginosa collected from 14 hospitals in Hungary were determined by Etest methodology. A 5000-subject Monte Carlo simulation was performed to calculate the bactericidal cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for standard dosing regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. In the case of poor CFR, alternative dosage regimens were simulated for selected agents by increasing the infusion time, dose and frequency. Owing to high resistance rates in Hungary, no regimen achieved > 90% CFR. CFRs for standard dosing regimens were: meropenem 1 g every 8 h (q8h), 77.1%; ceftazidime 2 g q8h, 75.3%; imipenem 0.5 g every 6 h (q6h), 71.7%; and piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g and 3.375 g q6h, 72.4% and 71.0%, respectively. Ciprofloxacin achieved significantly lower bactericidal CFRs than any beta-lactam. Prolonged infusion regimens improved the CFR for cefepime, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam. Overall, the highest CFR (88.1%) was achieved by a 3-h infusion of meropenem 2 g q8h. Given the poor CFR predicted with standard dosage regimens against these isolates, it seems prudent to consider alternative dosage strategies such as increasing doses, frequencies or infusion times as well as combination therapy when empirically treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa in Hungary.

AB Rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens preferences for Lyngbya majuscula collected from three bloom locations in Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia, were tested along with a range of local plant species in the laboratory. Consumption of L. majuscula by fish did not differ between wild and captive-bred fish (P = 0.152) but did differ between bloom location (P = 0.039). No relationship was found between consumption rates and lyngbyatoxin-a concentration (r(2) = 0.035, P = 0.814). No correlation existed between C : N and proportion of food consumed when all food types were analysed statistically, whereas a clear correlation was observed when L. majuscula was removed from the calculations. In simulated bloom conditions, fish avoided ingestion of L. majuscula by feeding through gaps in the L. majuscula coverage. Both wild and captive-bred S. fuscescens showed a distinct feeding pattern in 10 day no-choice feeding assays, with less L. majuscula being consumed than the preferred red alga Acanthophora spicifera. Lyngbya majuscula however, was consumed in equal quantities to A. spicifera by wild S. fuscescens when lyngbyatoxin-a was not detectable. Wild fish probably do not preferentially feed on L. majuscula when secondary metabolites are present and are not severely impacted by large L. majuscula blooms in Moreton Bay. Furthermore, poor feeding performance in both captive-bred and wild S. fuscescens suggests that they would exert little pressure as a top-down control agent of toxic L. majuscula blooms within Moreton Bay.

AB Objective: It is well established that gonadal steroids have direct in vivo and in vitro effects on neurons. To further study these effects, we used rat PC12 cells to examine the effects of estrogen receptor (ER) ligands on neuronal morphology.
   Design: PC12 cells constitutively express ER beta, but only strongly express ER alpha after long-term priming with nerve growth factor (NGF). We therefore primed PC12 cells with NGF for 14 days before testing them for estradiol (10(-9) M)- and/or raloxifene (10(-7) M)-induced neurite growth. Neurite growth was assessed by quantitative light microscopy. As control, ER status of the PC12 cells was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
   Results: In this study, both estradiol and raloxifene induced the outgrowth of neurites in NGF-treated PC12 cells (p < 0.05). The combination of estradiol- and raloxifene-induced neurite growth was statistically greater than the effects of either agent alone. RT-PCR confirms that NGF-treated PC12 cells express both ER alpha and ER beta.
   Conclusions: This report is the first on the neurotrophic effect of raloxifene. At 10(-7) M, raloxifene's effect equaled that of estradiol; moreover, raloxifene did not block the neurite growth of simultaneously estradiol-treated PC12 cells, despite its functional antiestrogenic effects in vivo. We conclude that raloxifene is estrogen agonistic in this animal model and therefore studies are warranted to delineate the relationship between steroidal estrogen and raloxifene.

AB Due to its low volatile characteristics of lean coal, it is difficult to catch fire and burn out. Therefore, high temperature is needed to maintain combustion efficiency, while, this leads to high nitrogen oxide emission. For power plant boilers burning lean coal, stable combustion with lower nitrogen oxide emission is a challenging task. This study applied the 3D numerical simulation on the analysis of a novel de-coupling burner for low-volatile coal and its structure and operation parameters optimization. Results indicate that although it was more difficult for lean coal decoupling burner to ignite lean coal than high volatile coal, the burner formed a stepwise ignition trend, which promoted the rapid ignition of lean coal. Comparison of three central partition plate structure shows that in terms of characteristics of the flow field distribution, rich and lean separation and combustion, the structure with an inclination of Cr showed good performance, with its rich-lean air ratio being 0.85 and concentration ratio being 22.94, and there was an apparent decoupling combustion characteristic. Finally, the structure of the selected burner was optimized for its operational conditions. The optimal operating parameters was determined as the primary air velocity of 24.9 m.s(-1) and the mass flow rate of pulverized coal of 2.5 kg.s(-1), in which the pyrolysis products were utilized as reductive agent more fully. Eventually, the nitrogen oxide was efficiently reduced to nitrogen, which emission concentration was 61.88% lower than that in the design condition.

TI Preliminary Efficacy Testing of the Disinfectant MicrobeCare XLP for
   Potential Use in Military Operational Environments
SO MILITARY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction: A safe, easy-to-use, permanently bonded antiseptic that does not require post-exposure bioload reduction but maintains effectiveness over time would have far-reaching implications across multiple industries. Health care is one such arena, particularly in austere military settings where resources are at a premium. MicrobeCare XLP (MicrobeCare, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) is a commercially available spray-on agent that is advertised to covalently bond to surfaces and provide a long-lasting antimicrobial coating inhospitable to >99.99% of surface microorganisms. A pilot study was devised to gather baseline data regarding product efficacy and laboratory parameters before consideration of extended investigations and military utilization. The product manufacturer recommends bioload reductions before product application, following product application, and after each pathogenic exposure. To investigate the product's efficacy in circumstances more closely simulating a military operational setting in which post-pathogenic exposure bioload reduction would not be possible, this step was deliberately excluded from the test sequences. Materials and Methods: Using autoclaved surgical forceps, growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii was evaluated in a controlled manner under multiple conditions. Test variations included duration of submersion in the MicrobeCare XLP solution and air-drying and a second autoclave sterilization. Control and treated forceps were exposed to a bacterial suspension and air-dried before being submerged in sterile saline and vortex mixed. The saline solution was serially diluted and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) II plates. Plates were incubated for 24 h and bacterial colony-forming units (CFU)/mL were counted. Results: Statistical significance was defined according to the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) International passing criteria of 3 Log io or 99.9% reduction of microorganisms. Additionally, p-values were calculated using two-tailed unpaired two-sample t-tests with unequal variance with a threshold of 0.05. In the S. aureus tests, none of the reduction calculations met the ASTM International passing criteria. In addition, the difference between the means of the colony counts in the MicrobeCare XLP-treated forceps and untreated control forceps was not statistically significant (p-value 0.109). Conversely, in the A. baumannii tests, each of the percent reduction calculations met the ASTM International passing criteria; the difference between the means of the colony counts in the treatment and control groups was statistically significant (p-value 0.008). Conclusion: In these independent tests, MicrobeCare XLP effectively prevented growth of A. baumannii but had unpredictable results suppressing S. aureus. These results may relate to inherent properties of the bacteria or autoclave exposure, although the manufacturer asserts that the coating withstands such degradation. Additional testing could be performed using a broader range of microorganisms and exposure to varying conditions including other sterilization methods.

AB Objective: To examine the cost-effectiveness of vancomycin versus linezolid in the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonias incorporating results from a recent prospective, double-blind, multicenter, controlled trial in adults with suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureas (MASA) nosocomial pneumonia. Methods: A decision-analytic model examining the cost-effectiveness of linezolid versus vancomycin for the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia was created. Publicly available cost, efficacy, and utility data populated relevant model variables. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis varied parameters in 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations, and univariate sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of model uncertainties and the robustness of our conclusions. Results: Results indicated that the cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) increased 6% ($22,594 vs. $23,860) by using linezolid versus vancomycin for nosocomial pneumonia. The incremental cost per QALY gained by using linezolid over vancomycin was $6,089, and the incremental cost per life saved was $68,615 with the use of linezolid. Vancomycin dominated linezolid in the subset of patients with documented MRSA. The incremental cost per QALY gained using linezolid if no mortality benefit exists between agents or a 60 day time horizon was analyzed was $19,608,688 and $443,662, respectively. Conclusions: Linezolid may be a cost-effective alternative to vancomycin in the empiric treatment of patients with suspected MRSA nosocomial pneumonia; however, results of our model were highly variable on a number of important variables and assumptions including mortality differences and time frame analyzed.

AB Trophy hunting, the selective removal of animals for human recreation, can contribute to conservation when appropriately managed. Yet, little is known about how harvest rates or different definitions of trophy affect age structure and trophy size in harvested animals and in survivors because no controlled studies exist. To investigate the impacts of different management regimes, we developed an individual-based model for bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis), based on empirical data on survival from a protected population and data on horn growth from 2 populations that differed in their growth rates. One population showed slow horn growth and the other population fast horn growth. We subjected these model populations to varying harvest rates and 2 different hunting regulations: 4/5 curl and full-curl definitions of a trophy male. We found that the effect of hunting regulations depends on horn growth rate. In populations with fast horn growth, the effects of trophy hunting on male age structure and horn size were greater and the effect of a change in the definition of legal male smaller than in populations with slow growth rates. High harvest rates led to a younger age structure and smaller horn size. Both effects were weakened by a more restrictive definition of trophy male. As harvest rates increased past 40% of legal males, the number of males harvested increased only marginally because an increasing proportion of the harvested males included those that had just become legal. Although our simulation focused on bighorn sheep, the link between horn growth rate and harvest effects may be applicable for any size-selective harvest regime. (C) 2017 The Wildlife Society.

IOAgent has been implemented for Linux and takes into account different I/O characteristics like synchronous and asynchronous calls, buffered and unbuffered accesses, as well as different numbers of disks, intermediate buffers and number of agents simulating the workload. Second, we propose statistical models that help us to analyze the I/O behaviour of an IBM e-server OpenPower 710, with 4 SCSI drives. The observations used to build the model have been obtained using IOAgent.

AB Autonomous vehicles (AVs) represent potentially disruptive and innovative changes to public transportation (PT) systems. However, the exact interplay between AV and PT is understudied in existing research. This paper proposes a systematic approach to the design, simulation, and evaluation of integrated autonomous vehicle and public transportation (AV + PT) systems. Two features distinguish this research from the state of the art in the literature: the first is the transit oriented AV operation with the purpose of supporting existing PT modes; the second is the explicit modeling of the interaction between demand and supply.
   We highlight the transit-orientation by identifying the synergistic opportunities between AV and PT, which makes AVs more acceptable to all the stakeholders and respects the social-purpose considerations such as maintaining service availability and ensuring equity. Specifically, AV is designed to serve first-mile connections to rail stations and provide efficient shared mobility in low-density suburban areas. The interaction between demand and supply is modeled using a set of system dynamics equations and solved as a fixed-point problem through an iterative simulation procedure. We develop an agent-based simulation platform of service and a discrete choice model of demand as two subproblems. Using a feedback loop between supply and demand, we capture the interaction between the decisions of the service operator and those of the travelers and model the choices of both parties. Considering uncertainties in demand prediction and stochasticity in simulation, we also evaluate the robustness of our fixed-point solution and demonstrate the convergence of the proposed method empirically.
   We test our approach in a major European city, simulating scenarios with various fleet sizes, vehicle capacities, fare schemes, and hailing strategies such as in-advance requests. Scenarios are evaluated from the perspectives of passengers, AV operators, PT operators, and urban mobility system. Results show the trade off between the level of service and the operational cost, providing insight for fleet sizing to reach the optimal balance. Our simulated experiments show that encouraging ride-sharing, allowing in-advance requests, and combining fare with transit help enable service integration and encourage sustainable travel. Both the transit-oriented AV operation and the demand-supply interaction are essential components for defining and assessing the roles of the AV technology in our future transportation systems, especially those with ample and robust transit networks.

AB Current models of psychological development rely heavily on connectionist models that use supervised learning. These models adapt network weights when the network output does not match the target outputs computed by some agent. The authors present a model of motor learning in which the child uses exploration to discover appropriate ways of responding. The model is consistent with what is known about how neural systems evaluate behavior. The authors model the development of reaching and investigate N. Bernstein's (1967) hypotheses about early motor learning. Simulations show the course of learning as well as model the kinematics of reaching by a dynamical arm.

ID GRIFFITHS PHASES; CONTACT
AB Bursty dynamics of agents is shown to appear at criticality or in extended Griffiths phases, even in case of Poisson processes. I provide numerical evidence for a power-law type of intercommunication time distributions by simulating the contact process and the susceptible-infected-susceptible model. This observation suggests that in the case of nonstationary bursty systems, the observed non-Poissonian behavior can emerge as a consequence of an underlying hidden Poissonian network process, which is either critical or exhibits strong rare-region effects. On the contrary, in time-varying networks, rare-region effects do not cause deviation from the mean-field behavior, and heterogeneity-induced burstyness is absent.

Contingent events, reinforced by positive feedbacks, determined both particular standards and the geographic extent of standardization in Britain, Continental Europe, North America, and Australia. The model, solved using numerical simulation, shows the allocation process to be path dependent. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate how the distribution of possible outcomes varies with historically varying systematic factors. Both history and an extension to the model demonstrate the role of externality-internalizing behavior in resolving diversity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB In recent years there has been significant interest in the connection between energy policy and carbon-emitting factors, with significant emphasis on fixing policy gaps. This paper explores the impact of energy policy in curbing the effect of carbon emission in the United States, China and Nigeria. It offers an empirical insight into the effect of energy policy on carbon emission disclosure of the selected countries' economies. Since understanding future decisions on energy use is uncertain, the study develops, interacts and simulates a simple model for analysing the nexus between the energy sector and environmental policy within the uncertain business environment. The omission in the majority of available literature is that it is unclear if the precise reduction in carbon emission is consistent with the carbon tax levied on economic agents. At best, the evidence gathered points to a fresh impetus on energy policy to accommodate business cycles, even if carbon emission must be mitigated. This study, therefore, analyses the subjective behaviour of an economic agent in the context of carbon emission and the depreciating quality of life. The empirical evidence is based on the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model. The paper submits that policy direction towards a carbon-free environment, when properly channelled, would impact positively on decarbonisation. Simulation conducted shows that pollution is highly connected with macroeconomic fluctuation, and environmental policy can only be effective when both variables are considered in the context of the DSGE framework. Thus, the study strongly recommends broader carbon tax reform and a proactive monetary stance to mitigate carbon emission and motivate new renewable energy investors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Recent analysis of a Yard Sale (YS) exchange model supplemented with redistributive proportional taxation suggested an asymptotic behavior P(w) similar to 1/w(mu) for the wealth distribution, with a parameter-dependent exponent mu. Revisiting this problem, it is here shown analytically, and confirmed by extensive numerical simulation, that the asymptotic behavior of P(omega) is not power-law but rather a Gaussian. When taxation is weak, we furthermore show that a restricted -range power-law behavior appears for wealths around the mean value. The corresponding power-law exponent equals 3/2 when the return distribution has zero mean.

Having the possibility to observe the Pescara wholesale fish market, we build an agent based simulation model to find out which buyers' behavior is able to replicate its price dynamics. The present work differentiates itself from other works on perishable products because the market under investigation has a centralized structure organized as a Dutch auction instead of being based on bilateral trading. From this point of view the paper also contributes to understand the anomalies of price dynamics highlighted by the empirical papers on sequential auctions for art, wine and jewelry.

AB When conducting active experiments in the ionosphere which give rise to artificial disturbances of electron density, it is necessary to diagnose such disturbances. The study of irregularities using ground-based radio sounding methods often involves recording and analyzing ionogram traces, depending on the position, dynamics and phase of development of an artificial disturbance. Within the context of solving the problem of diagnostics, we offer a numerical model that includes blocks for calculating disturbance parameters and parameters of the recorded signal of ground-based radio sounding of the disturbance. By considering an example of the release of a plasma neutralizing agent, we study successive evolutionary stages of the disturbance and their reflection in the behaviour of additional traces on complex ionograms.

AB Recent experimental studies indicate that oligomeric complexes of misfolded proteins and peptides are the primary agents of cytotoxicity in amyloid-related diseases. Given the prevalence of mixed-polarity interfaces in physiological environments, an understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between amorphous (pre-fibrillar) aggregates and surfaces is important for completing our knowledge of the behaviour of peptide aggregation phenomena. We have employed fully solvated molecular dynamics simulations to study the morphology, interactions and peptide conformations of disordered aggregates of the amyloidogenic NFGAIL (derived from human islet amyloid polypeptide) and non-amyloidogenic AGAIL peptides upon adsorption to vapour-water, decane-water, bilayer and solid-water interfaces. All of the interfaces studied promote elongation and surface-spreading of both peptide aggregates, with the liquid-liquid interface being particularly efficient at altering the gross morphology of disordered aggregates. NFGAIL aggregates are more effective at disrupting lipid bilayers compared to AGAIL. Additionally, the interfaces studied cause greater changes in peptide conformations within the NFGAIL aggregates compared to AGAIL. We propose that simulations may elucidate the capability of interfaces to effect changes in the behaviour of disordered peptide aggregates, which may also serve to provide measures of the intrinsic fibrillogenicity of a given peptide sequence.

AB The ability to examine the behavior of biological systems in silico has the potential to greatly accelerate the pace of discovery in diseases, such as stroke, where in vivo analysis is time intensive and costly. In this paper we describe an approach for in silico examination of responses of the blood transcriptome to neuroprotective agents and subsequent stroke through the development of dynamic models of the regulatory processes observed in the experimental gene expression data. First, we identified functional gene clusters from these data. Next, we derived ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from the data relating these functional clusters to each other in terms of their regulatory influence on one another. Dynamic models were developed by coupling these ODEs into a model that simulates the expression of regulated functional clusters. By changing the magnitude of gene expression in the initial input state it was possible to assess the behavior of the networks through time under varying conditions since the dynamic model only requires an initial starting state, and does not require measurement of regulatory influences at each time point in order to make accurate predictions. We discuss the implications of our models on neuroprotection in stroke, explore the limitations of the approach, and report that an optimized dynamic model can provide accurate predictions of overall system behavior under several different neuroprotective paradigms.

AB This article presents an experimental study concerning near-surface mounted (NSM) carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites for the effective tension zone of a reinforced concrete beam. The test specimen consists of a concrete prism with one No. 3 reinforcing steel bar, representing the effective tension zone, and is preloaded to 50% of the cracking load of the specimens to simulate existing concrete structures in service conditions. A total of 16 specimens, 11 of which are retrofitted with NSM CFRP strips, are monotonically loaded in axial tension until failure takes place. Of particular interest is the interaction between the concrete and the reinforcement at service load levels when exposed to wet-dry environment. Test parameters include the effect of wet-dry cycles, the type of bonding agents (epoxy adhesive and cement-grout), the number of CFRP strips, and the size of groove for the composite. The specimens with epoxy adhesive show better performance than those with cement-grout, while the contribution of the geometrical properties (e.g., groove size and number of CFRP strips) to the behavior of the retrofitted specimens is not significant. The variation of a tension stiffening index and the effective axial stiffness is studied to examine the effects of wet-dry cycles on the serviceability of the retrofitted specimens.

AB Redox changes occur in some circumstances when organic compounds are analyzed by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS). However, these processes are limited in scope and the data presented here suggest that there are only limited analogies between the redox behavior in DESI and the well-known solution-phase electrochemical processes in standard electrospray ionization (ESI). Positive and negative ion modes were both investigated and there is a striking asymmetry between the incidence of oxidation and of reduction. Although in negative ion mode DESI experiments, some aromatic Compounds were ionized as odd-electron anion radicals, examples of full reduction were not found. By contrast, oxidation in the form of oxygen atom addition (or multiple oxygen atom additions) was observed for several different analytes. These oxidation reactions point to chemically rather than electrochemically controlled processes. Data is presented which suggests that oxidation is predominantly caused by reaction with discharge-created gas-phase radicals. The fact that common reducing agents and known antioxidants such as ascorbic acid are not modified, while a saturated organic acid like stearic acid is oxidized in DESI, indicates that the usual electrochemical redox reactions are not significant but that redox chemistry can be induced under special experimental conditions.

AB Reported literature in sponsored search advertising markets asserts that at equilibrium an advertiser has no incentive to swap her position with another advertiser and her bid on a keyword would be bound with the click value acting as an upper bound. We investigate a closer-to-practice case where advertisers do not have an ex-ante known value per click and her bid on a keyword is an outcome of simple cost-cap heuristics on a portfolio of keywords. Using simulations and an experimental setup containing advertisers that have the same upper-cap on cost, we show that the distribution of advertisers' cost per click and bids are emergent in nature. Keywords exhibit ex post heterogeneity in observed valuation even when all advertisers bid under the same cost-cap constraint. We explore the dynamics of the market, such as temporal stability of advertiser's bids, and advertiser's rank based on the click-share along with the distribution of ex post valuation of keywords associated with this closer to practice setup. The results call for a richer understanding of these markets that can incorporate temporal interdependence between auctions of a keyword as well as boundedly rational behavior of advertisers working under imperfect information.

AB This paper presents the behavior of near-surface-mounted (NSM) carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) strips for strengthening concrete members subjected to thermomechanical distress (thermal and mechanical loads are applied simultaneously). The focus of the research lies on examining temperature-dependent interfacial responses that control the performance of such a CFRP-strengthening system. An experimental investigation is conducted to study various technical aspects associated with the thermal relaxation, heat conduction, load-carrying capacity, failure mode, and damage characterization of the NSM CFRP-concrete interface. Analytical approaches are entailed to generate practical information that can promote use of CFRP-strengthening technologies, based on the two-parameter Weibull function along with probability-based capacity simulation. The thermal relaxation of a polymeric bonding agent influences the transfer of interfacial stresses, including the stress-decrease response time of the interface with temperature. Transient heat flow is apparent across the interface until the strengthening system fails due to the thermomechanical load. The failure plane of the interface is controlled by the progression of heat energy in conjunction with the phase transition of the adhesive. The slip of the interface articulates a thermal hysteresis mechanism when loaded cyclically. The characteristic parameters proposed aid the design of NSM CFRP systems exposed to elevated temperatures.

AB Change detection, and which information to attend to, are key research problems relevant to understanding adaptive behavior. Rational analyses of change detection have been developed in optimal foraging theory (McNamara & Houston, 1987; Stephens, 1987) and psychology (Gallistel, Krishan, Liu, Miller, & Latham, 2014). Information foraging models (Pirolli, 2007) have been developed to predict the optimal choice of information, and when to terminate collecting additional information. Optimal performance depend crucially on changing behavior when the world changes. For example, intelligence analysts track the dynamically changing strategies of adversaries and must choose information to weigh the utility of alternate actions regarding these agents. Neurobiologically-plausible descriptions of these behaviors have thus far been fragmentary (cf., Hayden, Pearson, & Platt, 2011). Here, behavioral and mechanistic differences in belief updating about an agent's strategy, and information foraging choices were investigated in a variant of the patch foraging task. Human subjects typically displayed non-normative updating and information foraging decisions which influenced future belief updating and foraging behaviors. To explore the biological basis of these behaviors, a neural model which forages, processes, and updates the beliefs of competing hypotheses was created. Strategy updating and information foraging behaviors were modeled in the temporal and prefrontal cortices consistent with theories of human cognitive processing during adversarial game play. The neural model reproduced human behaviors observed in foraging, belief updating, and change detection. These results highlight the importance of updating strategy, foraging, and fatigue behaviors and provide a simulation framework for future studies to investigate other high-level cognitive behaviors.

AB The water-soluble 3-n-propyl-4-picolinium silsesquioxane chloride (Si4Pic(+)Cl(-)) polymer was prepared, characterized and used as a stabilizing agent for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (nAu). The ability of Si4Pic(+)Cl(-) to adsorb anionic metal complexes such as AuCl4- ions allowed well-dispersed nAu to be obtained with an average particle size of 4.5nm. The liquid suspension of nAu-Si4Pic(+)Cl(-) was deposited by the drop coating method onto a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) surface to build a sensor (nAu-Si4Pic(+)Cl(-)/GCE) which was used for the detection of o-nitrophenol (o-NP) and p-nitrophenol (p-NP). Under optimized experimental conditions the reduction peak current increased with increasing concentrations of both nitrophenol isomers in the range of 0.1-1.5 mu mol L-1. The detection limits were 46 nmol L-1 and 55 nmol L-1 for o-NP and p-NP, respectively. These findings indicate that the nAu-Si4Pic(+)Cl(-) material is a very promising candidate to assemble electrochemical sensors for practical applications in the field of analytical chemistry.

AB In most fields of technological application of superhydrophobic materials, such as protection against corrosion, icing, and capillary condensation, or micro fluidics applications, a superhydrophobic surface has to operate in contact with aggressive aqueous media. Therefore, the peculiarities of behaviour of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces on prolonged contact with water and the mechanisms of possible degradation of superhydrophobicity need to be discussed. In this study, a consideration of the physicochemical processes accompanying the contact of hydrophobic and superhydrophobic materials with water, acid, alkaline and saline aqueous solutions is presented on the basis of experimental data on three-phase equilibrium obtained by the sessile drop method. It is shown that simultaneous analysis of the contact angle and contact diameter of the sessile drop and liquid/vapour surface tension allows one to attribute degradation of the superhydrophobic and hydrophobic state to reversible and irreversible processes such as hydrolysis of hydrophobic molecules, growth of an oxide layer and so on. A method for estimating both the portion of wetted area and the intrinsic wettability state (hydrophobic versus hydrophilic) of texture elements for a heterogeneous wetting regime is proposed and discussed.

AB Polyamine flocculants were synthesized by the polycondensation of dimethylamine and epichlorohydrin, in which organic amines, e.g. 1,2-diaminoethane, were used as modifying agents. Different products were obtained by varying the reaction parameters, such as the molar ratio of epichlorohydrin to dimethylamine, the amount of 1,2-diaminoethane and reaction temperature. The polyamine flocculants were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM). Their flocculation performance was evaluated with simulated dye liquor and actual printing and dyeing wastewater. The behavior of the flocculants was compared with that of inorganic coagulant, polyaluminum chloride (PAC). The experimental results show that polyamine with the highest viscosity and cationicity could be prepared under following conditions: an epichlorohydrin to dimethylamine molar ratio of 1.5, a reaction temperature of 70 degrees C, a 3% content of 1,2-diaminoethane in the total reaction monomers and a reaction time of 7 h. Polyamine polymers can, as flocculants for treating simulated and actual dye wastewater, remove color and COD efficiently. The rate of color removal from reactive red liquor, reactive blue liquor and reductive yellow liquor reached as high as 96%, 97% and 96%, respectively. The highest efficiency of color removal and COD removal from polyamine for treating dye wastewater was 90% and 89%, respectively. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Combination of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT) has become a promising cancer treatment in recent years. However, their applications are limited by complex synthetic protocols and low efficacy. Hence, optimizing experimental approach and improving the efficiency of phototherapy is the current research focus. In this work, various pyrolysis temperatures and sizes of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) derived carbon nanoparticles (ZCNs) are obtained by a simple direct pyrolysis of the ZIF-8 nanoparticles. Meanwhile, the ZCNs can be used as photothermal agents and photosensitizers to produce heat and reactive oxygen species simultaneously upon near-infrared laser irradiation. Moreover, it is observed that the phototherapy effects and photoacoustic (PA) signal of ZCNs could be enhanced with the increase in the nanoparticle size. Subsequently, guided by PA imaging, the therapeutic effect of ZCNs is investigated on a small animal model, where tumors are entirely eliminated with minimal side effect, demonstrating the high efficacy of the larger size of ZCNs through combination of PTT and PDT. Therefore, it is expected that the ZCN is a simple and highly effective phototherapeutic platform for oncotherapy, and the concept of size-dependent enhanced behavior of phototherapy and PA imaging will be very useful in the development of nanomaterials for cancer therapy.

AB Aggregation of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides is a significant event that underpins Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology. A beta aggregates, especially the low-molecular weight oligomers, are the primary toxic agents in AD and hence, there is increasing interest in understanding their formation and behavior. Aggregation is a nucleation-dependent process in which the pre-nucleation events are dominated by A beta homotypic interactions. Dynamic flux and stochasticity during pre-nucleation renders the reactions susceptible to perturbations by other molecules. In this context, we investigate the heterotypic interactions between A beta and fatty acids (FAs) by two independent tool-sets such as reduced order modelling (ROM) and ensemble kinetic simulation (EKS). We observe that FAs influence A beta dynamics distinctively in three broadly-defined FA concentration regimes containing non-micellar, pseudomicellar or micellar phases. While the non-micellar phase promotes on-pathway fibrils, pseudomicellar and micellar phases promote predominantly off-pathway oligomers, albeit via subtly different mechanisms. Importantly off-pathway oligomers saturate within a limited molecular size, and likely with a different overall conformation than those formed along the on-pathway, suggesting the generation of distinct conformeric strains of A beta, which may have profound phenotypic outcomes. Our results validate previous experimental observations and provide insights into potential influence of biological interfaces in modulating A beta aggregation pathways.

AB The present study is focused on the in vitro study of the biphasic octacalcium phosphate (OCP)-dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) system transformations in simulated body fluid (SBF) for possible applications as bone substitute materials. The aim of this paper is to outline the role of the additional component DCPD during a transformation/crystallization processes. Energy dispersive X-ray diffraction and FTIR spectroscopy techniques were used for in situ monitoring of the processes taking place in the system in real time. Morphological investigations were performed applying the scanning electron microscopy technique. Several OCP-DCPD combinations were investigated: (1) 100% OCP; (2) 70% OCP-30% DCPD; (3) 100% DCPD. The obtained experimental results allowed us to conclude that when only OCP is present in SBF, the formation of carbonated hydroxyapatite takes place, whereas for the OCP-DCPD (30%) system in SBF, less kinetically favorable hydroxyapatite (HA) is formed. The additional component (DCPD) influences significantly the structural behavior of hydroxyapatite, acting as the HA crystallization inhibition agent. By means of this approach, allowing for the control of the HA crystallization, the calcium phosphate based biomaterials can be suitably modified for implant use in bone tissue engineering. The results obtained in this work provided some insights into the biomineralization mechanism.

AB Two isomeric Zinc (II) complexes constructed by 3,5-bis(1-imidazoly) pyridine has been synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction, elemental analyses and infrared spectroscopy. The binding mode and ability of complex 1-2 with CT-DNA were studied by UV and fluorescence spectra. The intrinsic binding constant K-b (K-b1=2.305x10(4)M(-1), K-b2=3.095x10(4)M(-1)) and the observed association constant K-obs (K-obs1=1.523*10(6)M(-1), K-obs2=2.057*10(6)M(-1)) indicated that the insertion ability of complex 2 with CT-DNA is stronger than complex 1. Gel electrophoresis showed that complexes have a good ability to hydrolyze cleavage pBR322 plasmid DNA. The cytotoxicity and apoptosis studies showed that complexes exhibited excellent cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells, especially complex 2 had better growth inhibition than Cisplatin. Molecular docking study simulated the binding model of complexes with DNA (PDB:4av1), showing an imidazole plane of complex 2 can be inserted into a DNA base pair in relative parallel. Both complexes can be used as potential anticancer agents.

AB Both cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) and cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are nanoscale cellulose fibers that have shown reinforcing effects in polymer nanocomposites. CNCs and CNFs are different in shape, size and composition. This study systematically compared their morphologies, crystalline structure, dispersion properties in polyethylene oxide (PEO) matrix, interactions with matrix, and the resulting reinforcing effects on the matrix polymer. Transparent PEO/CNC and PEO/CNF nanocomposites comprising up to 10 wt % nanofibers were obtained via solution casting. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA), and tensile testing were used to examine the above-mentioned properties of nanocellulose fibers and composites. At the same nanocellulose concentration, CNFs led to higher strength and modulus than did CNCs due to CNFs' larger aspect ratio and fiber entanglement, but lower strain-at-failure because of their relatively large fiber agglomerates. The Halpin-Kardos and Ouali models were used to simulate the modulus of the composites and good agreements were found between the predicted and experimental values. This type of systematic comparative study can help to develop the criteria for selecting proper nanocellulose as a biobased nano-reinforcement material in polymer nanocomposites.

AB In the past decades, great effort has been put in finding new electrode surface modifiers and enzyme immobilizer agents that prevent the enzyme leakage, minimize the effect of interfering species, retain the enzyme bioactivity, and enhance the sensor sensitivity. In this work, a sandwich-type glucose biosensor that keeps its sensitivity and operational linear range for more than a year is presented. After 5 months of intermittent use, where the biosensor was exposed to more than 500 standard additions, it presented a limit of detection of 5 mu M, and the linear behavior was from 5 mu M to 3 mM with a value of r(2) = 0.999. Besides, after 7 months of its assembling, the biosensor was employed for assessing the glucose concentration of real serum samples and its performance was compared with the response of a commercial autoanalyzer. A year later, the biosensor still exhibited very good performance of its analytical parameters. The performance of identical sandwich-type biosensors is analyzed when they are exposed to three different storage conditions. Simulated curves are compared with experimental data to explain the dependence of sensitivity and response-time on the aging and storage conditions of the biosensors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB mathematical model of solute transient diffusion across the cornea to the anterior chamber of the eye was developed for topical drug delivery. Solute bioavailability was predicted given solute molecular radius and octanol-to-water distribution coefficient (Phi), ocular membrane ultrastructural parameters, tear fluid hydrodynamics, as well as solute distribution volume (V-d) and clearance rate (Cl-a) in the anterior chamber. The results suggest that drug bioavailability is primarily determined by solute lipophilicity. In human eyes, bioavailability is predicted to range between 1% and 5% for lipophilic molecules ((Phi > 1), and to be less than 0.5% for hydrophilic molecules (Phi < 0.01). The simulations indicate that the distribution coefficient that maximizes bioavailability is on the order of 10. It was also found that the maximum solute concentration in the anterior chamber (C-max) and the time needed to reach C-max significantly depend on Phi, V-d, and Cl-a. Consistent with experimental findings, model predictions suggest that drug bioavailability can be increased by lowering the conjunctival-to-corneal permeability ratio and reducing precorneal solute drainage. Because of its mechanistic basis, this model will be useful to predict drug transport kinetics and bioavailability for new compounds and in diseased eyes. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The water sorption properties (i.e. diffusivity and solubility) of three unfilled vulcanized EPDMs were investigated in wet atmosphere (typically between 0 and 95% RH) and in pure distilled water (denoted as 100% RH) at 70 degrees C with an IGAsorp dynamic sorption analyzer. In the 0-0.5 activity range, all EPDMs obey to the usual Fick and Henry's laws. In contrast, at activities higher than 0.5, the water sorption behavior of all EPDMs deviates from these two laws because of the formation of water clusters. Park's equation was used for simulating accurately the sorption isotherms and thus, accessing Henry's constant and the average size of water clusters. In wet atmospheres, clusters would be composed of about 8 +/- 4 molecules corresponding approximately to the size of free volume holes. In contrast, in pure distilled water, clusters consist in a much larger number of water molecules (between 55 and 71) presumably because of an exacerbated swelling of EPDM samples. Thus, immersion in water solution is more drastic than exposure to fully saturated wet atmosphere. The impact of the EPDM formulation (nature and content of crosslinking agent) on these experimental results is clearly of the second order of magnitude. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An investigation into the influence of viscous media on tablet disintegration and drug dissolution was performed with the aim to simulate the potential formulation-specific food effect for a selected highly soluble model drug. Literature data on the in vivo drug absorption in fasted and fed state have been evaluated for in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) purposes. In vitro studies were conducted in simple buffer media with or without addition of HPMC K4M as a viscosity enhancing agent. Good IVIVC correlation (r > 0.95) was obtained for paracetamol dissolution in viscous media at 50 rpm and fed state absorption profiles, while in vitro dissolution in simple media at lower stirring speed was predictable of drug products in vivo behaviour in the fasted state. The data obtained support the existing idea that relatively simple dissolution media and/or set of experimental conditions may be used to differentiate formulation-specific food-drug interactions. Such tests would be a useful tool in the development of formulations that would not be susceptible to the influence of co-administered meal and, furthermore, facilitate regulatory decision on the necessity to conduct food effect studies in vivo.

AB An approach to evaluate macroscopic elastic properties of rice husk composite from its morphology is demonstrated. Hard shells of rice husks were used as a low-cost reinforcing agent in thin polypropylene sheet. Composite samples containing 5-20% mass fractions of rice husks were formed by compression molding, and the orientation distributions of rice husks in the samples were evaluated from micrographs of the composite structure. Effective elastic properties of the composite were calculated from the Mori-Tanaka model that includes the effect of reinforcement orientation. The homogeneous Mori-Tanaka model was benchmarked against an equivalent composite model using explicit modeling of the reinforcements in a finite element simulation; good agreement between the in-plane moduli of the two models was confirmed. Predictive capabilities of the Mori-Tanaka model were demonstrated by matching the model responses to the composite response under uniaxial tensile tests and four-point bending tests. Predicted effective axial moduli compared favorably with the experimental values. However, discrepancy exists in the predicted flexural moduli due to the shortcoming of the Mori-Tanaka model in capturing the out-of-plane response. The comparisons show that the proposed approach is adaptable to predict the in-plane anisotropic elastic properties of compression-molded rice husk reinforced polypropylene composite.

AB The general objective of the present study was to investigate the potential application of the UV spectroscopic method for determination of the polymeric additives present in papermaking fibrous stock solutions. The study also intended to establish the surface-chemical retention model associated with the adsorption kinetics of additives on fiber surfaces. Polyamide epichlorohydrin (PAE) wet strength resin and imidazolinium quaternary (IZQ) softening agents were selected to evaluate the analytical method. Concentrations of PAE and IZQ in solution were proportional to the UV absorption at 314 and 400 nm, respectively. The time-dependent behavior of polymeric additives obeyed a mono-molecular layer adsorption as characterized in Langmuir-type expression. The kinetic modeling for polymeric adsorption on fiber surfaces was based on a concept that polymeric adsorption on fiber surfaces has two distinguishable stages including initial dynamic adsorption phase and the final near-equilibrium state. The simulation model predicted not only the real-time additive adsorption behavior for polymeric additives at high accuracy once the kinetic parameters were determined, but showed a good agreement with the experimental data. The spectroscopic method examined on the PAE and IZQ adsorption study could potentially be considered as an effective tool for the wet-end retention control as applied to the paper industry.

AB We investigate the large time behavior of an agent based model describing tumor growth. The microscopic model combines short-range repulsion and cell division. As the number of cells increases exponentially in time, the microscopic model is challenging in terms of computational time. To overcome this problem, we aim at deriving the associated macroscopic dynamics leading here to a porous media type equation. As we are interested in the long time behavior of the dynamics, the macroscopic equation obtained through usual derivation method fails at providing the correct qualitative behavior (e.g. stationary states differ from the microscopic dynamics). We propose a modified version of the macroscopic equation introducing a density threshold for the repulsion. We numerically validate the new formulation by comparing the solutions of the micro- and macro- dynamics. Moreover, we study the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics as the repulsion between cells becomes singular (leading to non-overlapping constraints in the microscopic model). We manage to show formally that such asymptotic limit leads to a Hele-Shaw type problem for the macroscopic dynamics. We compare the micro- and macro- dynamics in this asymptotic limit using explicit solutions of the Hele-Shaw problem (e.g. radially symmetric configuration). The numerical simulations reveal an excellent agreement between the two descriptions, validating the formal derivation of the macroscopic model. The macroscopic model derived in this paper therefore enables to overcome the problem of large computational time raised by the microscopic model, but stays closely linked to the microscopic dynamics.

AB A series of porous intelligent hydrogels, which exhibited appropriate lower critical solution temperature (LCST) and fast response behavior, were synthesized by radiation method. The structure and surface morphology of hydrogels were examined by the infrared radiation and the scanning electron microscopy, respectively. The influences of the content of crosslinking agent and relative molecular mass of polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the swelling properties of hydrogels were discussed. The molecular mechanics simulations were performed to investigate the phase transformation mechanism of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPA) hydrogel. The results show that macropores are observed in hydrogels, whereas hydrogels prepared without using PEG have a dense surface. LCST of hydrogels increases with the increase of relative molecular mass of PEG. The swelling mechanism of PNIPA porous hydrogels follows non-Fickian diffusion model. The theoretical maximum water absorption S-a is approximately consistent with experimental value according to the second-order kinetics model established by Schott. The molecule chains of PNIPA hydrogel begin folding and curling, resulting in volume shrinkage at 305 K. There are much intramolecular nonbonding interactions in molecule chains of hydrogels. The porous hydrogels are expected to be applied in the field of artificial intelligence material.

AB A polystyrene (PS)/rubber blend compatibilized with PS-g-rubber copolymer, prepared via emulsion polymerization using redox initiator system, is used to investigate the utilization of central composite design (CCD) and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches in correlating polymerization conditions to mechanical properties (tensile strength and abrasion loss) of unfilled compound vulcanizates. The conditions were manipulated by changing four factors: reaction temperature and time, percentage of deproteinized rubber in the mixture containing natural rubber, and amount of chain transfer agent. The results show that the relationships between the conditions and the mechanical properties for compatibilized PS/rubber blend are too complex to be explained by polynomials, but are well described by the ANN models, developed for each response. In addition, simulation results for the tensile strength response as a function of those factors using the obtained ANN are in agreement with literature, whereas those results for the abrasion loss do not quite agree with literature due to the interference of the large measurement error. This suggests that only experimental data with high precision should be used to train an ANN to achieve a model with not only best performance but also high reliability.

AB The MR signal decay in gradient echo sequences includes signal loss due to spin dephasing caused by static magnetic field in homogeneities. This decay can be calculated for different geometries of the susceptibility distribution, such as spheres, cylinders, or cylinder networks. In particular, them del of an infinitely long cylinder is a good approximation for single straight blood vessels. Blood oxygenation and blood volume fraction are important parameters, which influence the signal in a characteristic way. In this work the signal decays for a single cylindrical vessel were investigated and evaluated in simulations, phantom measurements as well as in vivo measurements of small single veins in the human brain by using a 3D multiecho gradient echo sequence. Good agreement between simulations and phantom experiments was obtained for different experimental settings. Based on the simulations, physiologically consistent values of venous blood oxygenation level, Y, were extracted from the in vivo measurements of different veins and volunteers (Y = 0.55 +/- 0.02). The methods ability to measure changes in venous blood oxygenation induced by carbogen breathing was demonstrated in one volunteer, where an increase from Y approximate to 0.5 to Y approximate to 0.7 was observed.

AB Ultrasound stimulated microbubbles have been shown to be capable of breaking up blood clots through micro-scale interactions occurring near the clot surface. However, only a small fraction of bubbles circulating in the bloodstream will be in close proximity to such boundaries, where they must be to elicit therapeutic effects. Here, the accumulation and subsequent behavior of microbubbles displaced from an overlying flow channel to a boundary under radiation forces were examined. Experimental data were acquired using a novel high speed microscopy configuration and simulations were conducted to provide insight into the accumulation process. There was broad agreement between experiments and simulations, both indicating that the size distribution and number of bubbles arriving at the boundary depended on channel flow rate, applied pressure, and bubble concentration. For example, higher flow rates and lower pressures favored the accumulation of larger bubbles relative to the native agent distribution. Moreover, bubble dynamics were dependent on the surface type, exhibiting rapid translation along agarose gel surfaces whereas on fibrin surfaces, they accumulated in localized regions inducing repetitive strain cycles. The results indicate that the process of bringing bubbles from within a vessel to a boundary is complex and should be an important consideration in the development of therapeutic applications such as sonothrombolysis.

AB Experimental data that can be obtained during investigation of a real system in operation, under different working conditions and different input parameters (combined with different control parameters), are usually not sufficient. Unsuitable working conditions can cause losses during production (which cannot be afforded), while some of the input parameters (like moisture content of the input material) are not under the control of the investigator. A suitable way to avoid this problem is to use a simulation program in order to explore different regimes and to obtain the optimal one. Investigations can be carried out using simulation programs in order to ascertain the influence of different control parameters on the behavior of the entire system, and to obtain control parameters that give the smallest deviations of a certain variable from the nominal value. It is also possible to obtain the values of control parameters causing nonstability of the system. The developed simulation program for the control system of a dehydrator includes a model of the drying process, a model describing the behavior of different functional blocks of the dehydrator (including the inertia of the system), simulation of the control of drying agent temperature at the dryer exit as a function of the fuel flow rate, and simulation of the fuel consumption as well as the dried material production.

AB Ultrasound in the presence of gas-filled microbubbles can be used to enhance local uptake of drugs and genes. To study the drug delivery potential and its underlying physical and biological mechanisms, an in vitro vessel model should ideally include 3-D cell culture, perfusion flow, and membrane-free soft boundaries. Here, we propose an organ-on-a-chip microfluidic platform to study ultrasound-mediated drug delivery: the OrganoPlate. The acoustic propagation into the OrganoPlate was determined to assess the feasibility of controlled microbubble actuation, which is required to study the microbubble-cell interaction for drug delivery. The pressure field in the OrganoPlate was characterized non-invasively by studying experimentally the well-known response of microbubbles and by simulating the acoustic wave propagation in the system. Microbubble dynamics in the OrganoPlate were recorded with the Brandaris 128 ultrahigh-speed camera (17 million frames/s) and a control experiment was performed in an OptiCell, an in vitro monolayer cell culture chamber that is conventionally used to study ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. When insonified at frequencies between 1 and 2 MHz, microbubbles in the OrganoPlate experienced larger oscillation amplitudes resulting from higher local pressures. Microbubbles responded similarly in both systems when insonified at frequencies between 2 and 4 MHz. Numerical simulations performed with a 3-D finite-element model of ultrasound propagation into the OrganoPlate and the OptiCell showed the same frequency-dependent behavior. The predictable and homogeneous pressure field in the OrganoPlate demonstrates its potential to develop an in vitro 3-D cell culture model, well suited to study ultrasound-mediated drug delivery.

AB The blocking of corrosive sites of soft (mild) steel has been studied using ravage drugs Pyrazinamide (Z), Isoniazid (H) and Rifampicin (R) in 0.5 M HCl medium. The degree of ability of these drugs to act as corrosion controlling agents was investigated by gravimetric measurements, potentiostatic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Their inhibition efficacy has, further been validated through theoretical and simulation studies. Though, all the drugs have shown good anticorrosive impact, but, rifampicin (R) has proven its greater efficacy as 97.06% at 1000 ppm and at 303 K. Polarization curves depict that the H and R drugs act through mixed mode of inhibition while Z drug is predominantly anodic in nature. The result of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy specifies that the corrosion reaction is resisted by charge transfer process. Morphology of un-corroded and corroded coupons was studied by scanning electron microscopy. The mechanism of adsorption is obeyed well through Langmuir isotherm and advocated a significant physiochemical type of interaction by the compounds on the metal surface. Thus, all the findings got via various experimental techniques along with that of obtained using Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Density Functional Theory (DFT) for the three compounds are in proper harmony.

AB Anxiety is one of the complications of metabolic disorders (MDs). Obeticholic acid (OCA), the bile acids (BAs) derivative, is a promising agent for improving MDs in association with gut dysbiosis. Yet, its protective effect on MDs-driven anxiety remains unknown. Here, we assessed the serum biochemical parameters and behavioral performance by open field and Morris water maze tests in HFHS diet-induced MDs mice after OCA intervention for nine and 18 weeks. Moreover, antibiotics intervention for microbial depletion was conducted simultaneously. We found that OCA treatment inhibited the initiation and progression of anxiety in HFHS diet-MDs mice via a microbiota-BAs-brain axis: OCA decreased the neuroinflammatory microglia and IL-1 beta expression in the hippocampus, reversed intestinal barrier dysfunction and serum proinflammatory LPS to a normal level, modified the microbial community, including the known anxiety-related Rikenellaceae and Alistipes, and improved the microbial metabolites especially the increased BAs in feces and circulation. Moreover, the OCA-reversed bile acid taurocholate linked disordered serum lipid metabolites and indole derivatives to anxiety as assessed by network analysis. Additionally, microbial depletion with antibiotics also improved the anxiety, microgliosis and BAs enrichment in the experimental MDs mice. Together, these findings provide microbiota-BAs-brain axis as a novel therapeutic target for MDs-associated neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB The compositional variability of many alternative fuels, coupled with fuel agnostic behaviour like engine ageing and vehicle-to-vehicle differences, leads to the desire for some form of online calibration in order to optimise fuel efficiency. This has led to the incorporation of extremum seeking techniques within the field in order to continually fine tune engine performance. These typically address steady state engine performance and are characterised by slow convergence times, hindering their deployment in typical dynamic driving scenarios. To address this potential shortcoming, in this paper a novel multiplexed extremum seeking scheme is proposed to track a time-varying extremum caused by a measurable disturbance. It consists of multiple extremum seeking agents that are individually activated based on the disturbance. The multiplexed approach accommodates the rigorous practical stability results of the "traditional" extremum seeking approaches, but offers improved results in dynamic scenarios. The proposed approach is implemented both in simulation and experimentally on a compressed natural gas (CNG) engine operating over a drive cycle. The experimental results show that under proper tuning, the proposed controller can improve the engine fuel efficiency for unknown natural gas compositions without requiring gas composition sensing at little additional calibration effort.

AB Microtubules (MTs) are protein filaments found in all eukaryotic cells which are crucial for many cellular processes including cell movement, cell differentiation, and cell division, making them a key target for anti-cancer treatment. In particular, it has been shown that at low dose, MT targeted agents (MTAs) may induce an anti-migratory effect on cancer and endothelial cells, leading to new prospects in cancer therapy. In that context, we propose to better understand the role of MT dynamics and thus of MTAs on cell migration using a mathematical cell centered model of cell migration taking into account the action of microtubules in the process. The model use a fluid based approach that describes, through level-set techniques, the deformation of the membrane during cell migration. The fluid part of the model is mainly composed of Stokes equations and the biochemical state of the cell is described using Reaction-Diffusion equations. Microtubules act on the biochemical state by activating or inactivating proteins of the Rho-GTPases family. The numerical simulation of the model is performed using Discrete Duality Finite Volume techniques. We describe the different schemes used for the simulation, focusing on the adaptation of preexisting methods to our particular case. Numerical simulation are performed, showing a realistic behavior of the simulated cells in term of shape, speed and microtubules dynamics. Different strategies for a depolymerizing MTA (Vincristin) mechanisms are investigated and show the robutness of our model.

AB Introduction: Individual and environmental factors dynamically interact in shaping income inequalities in healthy food consumption. The agent-based model, Health Behaviors Simulation (HEBSIM), was developed to describe income inequalities in healthy food consumption. It simulates interactions between households and their environment. HEBSIM was used to explore the impact of interventions aimed at reducing food consumption inequalities.
   Methods: HEBSIM includes households and food outlets. Households are characterized by location, composition, income, and preference for food. Decisions about where to shop for food (fruit/vegetable stores, supermarkets, or discount supermarkets) and whether to visit fast food outlets are based on distance, price, and food preference. Food outlets can close and new food outlets can enter the system. Three interventions to reduce healthy food consumption inequalities were tested: (1) eliminating residential segregation; (2) lowering the prices of healthy food; and (3) providing health education. HEBSIM was quantified using data from Statistics Netherlands, Statistics Eindhoven, and the GLOBE study (2011).
   Results: The model mimicked food consumption in Eindhoven. High-income households visited healthy food shops more often than low-income households. Eliminating residential segregation had the largest impact in reducing income inequalities in food consumption, but resulted partly from a worsening in healthy food consumption in high-income households. Lowering prices and health education could also substantially reduce inequalities. Most interventions took 5-10 years to reach their (almost) full effects.
   Conclusions: HEBSIM is a promising tool for studying dynamic interactions between households and their environment and for assessing the impact of interventions on income inequalities in food consumption. (C) 2015 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB This paper investigated the mechanism of fracture in concrete due to the deflagration phenomenon. For this purpose, the electric discharge impulse crushing method was selected, with liquid nitromethane (NM) taken as the deflagration agent. Employing this technique, NM is set inside charge holes and initiated by electric discharge. The pressure generated by the deflagration of NM in a steel chamber was modeled using the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state. The modeled and measured pressures agreed well and the applicability of the pressure model was validated. Then, assuming controlled splitting along the expected fracture surface in concrete, dynamic fracture process analysis (DFPA) based on two-dimensional dynamic finite element method was conducted. The results showed that fracture patterns predicted in the DFPAs agreed well with those obtained from experiments. The mechanism of fracture in concrete due to deflagration was then discussed in terms of the fracture process in the controlled splitting. Owing to stress interference from each charge hole, compressive stress zones (CSZs) formed above and below the middle regions between charge holes where maximum and minimum principle stresses were both in compression. The CSZs was found to be important in obtaining a flatter fracture surface in the case of controlled splitting. In conclusion, the proposed method was shown to be useful for the investigation of the fracture mechanism in the case of the use of deflagration agents and could be useful for the design optimization of such controlled splitting.

AB The production of composites of epoxy molding compounds (EMCs), which can feature a good balance between thermal conductivity and Flame-retardant behavior in terms of flammability and burning behavior, was achieved by incorporating high thermal conductivity Si3N4 and Flame retardant Al(OH)(3) (ATH) fillers in the epoxy matrix. The experimental results were obtained from thermal conductivity measurements and limiting oxygen index (LOI) and UL-94 tests. These results showed that the Si3N4 filler has a great influence on thermal conductivity, which markedly increased for Si3N4 volume fractions >40%, whereas the ATH filler greatly improved the flame resistance of EMCs. The simultaneous presence of both Si3N4 and ATH fillers in the EMCs positively influenced both properties. The aim of this study was to produce composites suitable for electronic packaging applications: an optimum combination of the two fillers was determined for a total volume fraction of fillers in EMC of 60 vol.% and a volume ratio of Si3N4:ATH at 3:2: this composite had a thermal conductivity of 2.15 W/m K, an LOI of 53.5, and a UL-94 vertical burning test ranking of V-0.

AB The sorption characteristics of crosslinked polymers may be analysed by equilibrating the sample either with the liquid or with the gaseous solvent. However, for a number of polymer/solvent systems, measurements at the point of saturation have revealed differences in solvent uptake from the liquid versus the vapour phase (Schroeder's paradox). Attempts at explanation are numerous, but far from comprehensive. Yet, understanding the sorption behaviour of crosslinked polymers is of crucial importance for the development of accurate mass transfer models, especially when applications such as membrane pervaporation or solid polymer electrolytes are concerned where membranes are simultaneously exposed to gaseous and liquid phases.
   The present study aims at the systematic examination of water sorption into physically crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) membranes in both the gaseous and the liquid phase, covering a wide range of solvent activities. For the determination of liquid-phase sorption isotherms, an appropriate method was devised, employing a suitably pretreated polymeric deswelling agent which does not penetrate into the sample network. Sorption data obtained for both equilibration modes suggest that, identical thermal histories of the membrane material provided, Schroeder's paradox is resolved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB A variety of numerical methods exist for the study of deformable particles in dense suspensions. None of the standard tools, however, currently include volume-changing objects such as oscillating microbubbles in three-dimensional periodic domains. In the first part of this work, we develop a novel method to include such entities based on the boundary integral method. We show that the well-known boundary integral equation must be amended with two additional terms containing the volume flux through the bubble surface. We rigorously prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution. Our proof contains as a subset the simpler boundary integral equation without volume-changing objects (such as red blood cell or capsule suspensions) which is widely used but for which a formal proof in periodic domains has not been published to date. In the second part, we apply our method to study microbubbles for targeted drug delivery. The ideal drug delivery agent should stay away from the biochemically active vessel walls during circulation. However, upon reaching its target it should attain a near-wall position for efficient drug uptake. Though seemingly contradictory, we show that lipid-coated microbubbles in conjunction with a localized ultrasound pulse possess precisely these two properties. This ultrasound-triggered margination is due to hydrodynamic interactions between the red blood cells and the oscillating lipid-coated microbubbles which alternate between a soft and a stiff state. We find that the effect is very robust, existing even if the duration in the stiff state is more than three times lower than the opposing time in the soft state.

AB In this paper, a new method for prediction of future performance and demand on emergency department (ED) in Spain is presented. Increased life expediency and population aging in Spain, along with their corresponding health conditions such as non-communicable diseases (NCDs), have been suggested to contribute to higher demands on ED. These lead to inferior performance of the department and cause longer ED length of stay (LoS). Prediction and quantification of behavior of ED is, however, challenging as ED is one of the most complex parts of hospitals. Using detailed computational approaches integrated with clinical data behavior of Spain's ED in future years was predicted. First, statistical models were developed to predict how the population and age distribution of patients with non-communicable diseases change in Spain in future years. Then, an agent-based modeling approach was used for simulation of the emergency department to predict impacts of the changes in population and age distribution of patients with NCDs on the performance of ED, reflected in ED LoS, between years 2019 and 2039. Results from different projection scenarios indicated that Spain would experience a continuous increase in total ED LoS from 5.7 million hours in 2019 to 6.2 million hours in 2039 if same human and physical resources, as well as same ED configuration, are used. The results from this study can provide health care provider with quantitative information on required staff and physical resources in the future and allow health care policymakers to improve modifiable factors contributing to the demand and performance of ED.

AB Foam assisted CO2 enhanced oil recovery has attracted increasing attention of oil companies and research institutions, mainly due to the potentially high benefit of foam on CO2-EOR performance. Numerous theoretical and experimental studies, limited numbers of pilot tests as well as cases of field applications have indicated that foaming of CO2 can greatly improve the EOR process, at both the microscopic and macroscopic levels. However, there are still various conceptual and operational challenges, which may compromise the success and application of foaming process.
   The oil recovery mechanisms involved in a CO2 foam flood, the complex flow behavior of the system, and the synergy between gas mobility control foaming agent and ultra-low IFT surfactants have been identified as the main challenges of this process. The unavailability of reliable predictive tools due to the less understood concepts and phenomena adds more challenges to the process results and application justifications.
   A literature review of the foam assisted CO2-EOR process is presented in this paper to reveal its strengths, highlight the knowledge gaps, and suggest ways to bring physical understandings of experiments into foam projects' performance evaluation and simulation models for potential field application purposes.

AB With increasing environmental concerns about petrochemical-based materials, the development of high-performance polymer nanocomposites with sustainable filler phases has attracted significant attention. Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are promising nanocomposite reinforcing agents due to their exceptional mechanical properties, low weight, and bioavailability. However, there are still numerous obstacles that prevent these materials from achieving optimal performance, including high water adsorption, poor nanoparticle dispersion, and filler properties that vary in response to moisture. Surface modification is an effective method to mitigate these shortcomings. We use computational approaches to obtain direct insight into the water adsorption and interfacial mechanics of modified CNC surfaces. Atomistic grand-canonical Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate how surface modification of sulfated Na-CNCs impacts water adsorption. We find that methyl(triphenyl)phosphonium (MePh3P+)-exchanged CNCs have lower water uptake than Na-CNCs, supporting experimental dynamic vapor sorption measurements. The adsorbed water molecules show orientational ordering when distributed around the cations. Steered molecular dynamics simulations quantify traction separation behavior of CNC CNC interfaces. We find that exchanging sodium for MePh3P+ effectively changes the surface hydrophilicity, which in turn directly impacts interfacial adhesion and traction separation behavior. Our analysis provides guidelines for controlling moisture effects in cellulose nanocomposites and nanocellulose films through surface modifications.

AB Mathematical models to describe dose-dependent cellular responses to drug combinations are an essential component of computational simulations for predicting therapeutic responses. Here, a new model, the additive damage model, is introduced and tested in cases where varying concentrations of two drugs are applied with a fixed exposure schedule. In the model, cell survival is determined by whether cellular damage, which depends on the concentrations of the drugs, exceeds a lethal threshold, which varies randomly in the cell population with a prescribed statistical distribution. Cellular damage is assumed to be additive, and is expressed as a sum of separate terms for each drug. Each term has a saturable dependence on drug concentration. The model has appropriate behavior over the entire range of drug concentrations, and is predictive, given single-agent dose-response data for each drug. The proposed model is compared with several other models, by testing their ability to fit 24 data sets for platinum-taxane combinations and 21 data sets for various other combinations. The Akaike Information Criterion is used to assess goodness of fit, taking into account the number of unknown parameters in each model. Overall, the additive damage model provides a better fit to the data sets than any previous model. The proposed model provides a basis for computational simulations of therapeutic responses. It predicts responses to drug combinations based on data for each drug acting as a single agent, and can be used as an improved null reference model for assessing synergy in the action of drug combinations.

AB Shell structures have increasingly widespread applications in biomedical ultrasound fields such as contrast agents and drug delivery, which requires the precise prediction of the acoustic radiation force under various circumstances to improve the system efficiency. The acoustic radiation force exerted by a zero-order quasi-Bessel-Gauss beam on an elastic spherical shell near an impedance boundary is theoretically and numerically studied in this study. By means of the finite series method and the image theory, a zero-order quasi-Bessel-Gauss beam is expanded in terms of spherical harmonic functions, and the exact solution of the acoustic radiation force is derived based on the acoustic scattering theory. The acoustic radiation force function, which represents the radiation force per unit energy density and per unit cross-sectional surface, is especially investigated. Some simulated results for a polymethyl methacrylate shell and an aluminum shell are provided to illustrate the behavior of acoustic radiation force in this case. The simulated results show the oscillatory property and the negative radiation force caused by the impedance boundary. An appropriate relative thickness of the shell can generate sharp peaks for a polymethyl methacrylate shell. Strong radiation force can be obtained at small half-cone angles and the beam waist only affects the results at high frequencies. Considering that the quasi-Bessel-Gauss beam possesses both the energy focusing property and the non-diffracting advantage, this study is expected to be useful in the development of acoustic tweezers, contrast agent micro-shells, and drug delivery applications.

AB Other-perspective taking (OPT), distancing, time discounting as well as risk and loss aversion highly affect decision-making. Even though they influence each other, so far these cognitive processes have been unrelated or only partly related to each other in neuroscience. This article proposes a philosophical interpretation of these cognitive processes that is elaborated in the updated theory of Adam Smith's prudence (UTSP). The UTSP is inspired by Smith's account of prudence and is in line with the neuroscientific and behavioral studies on OPT, distancing, time discounting as well as risk and loss aversion. The UTSP represents a framework aiming to interpret and connect these cognitive processes and providing a consistent and empirically sound account of a "Smithianly" prudent style of decision-making. The two pillars of the UTSP are the shift of perspective in space and time (from the individual to others and from the present self to the future self) and loss aversion. On the basis of this theory, a normative updated theory of Smithian prudence is outlined (NUTSP). The latter is useful for moral philosophy for two reasons: firstly, according to preliminary evidence, it is effective in guiding the agent in decisional contexts in which her well-being is at stake and she can affect other people with her actions. Secondly, since the NUTSP is based on neuroscientific findings on decision-making, it has a sound empirical basis that prevents a source of alienation for the agent.

AB In this work, we established a three-dimensional coupled heat transfer model to evaluate the heat transfer during the hydrogenation reaction process in a uranium-based hydride bed. We constructed numerical simulations combined with the proposed model using Fluent to systematically investigate the influence of structure configurations, cooling media, and material thermal-physical properties on the thermal performance. Importantly, because the coolant temperature and the bed wall continuously changed during the hydrogen recovery process, the solid-liquid interface temperature had to be considered for an efficient thermal design of the bed wall cooling system. Accordingly, a coupling iteration algorithm was developed to improve the temperature prediction accuracy. In addition, we systematically investigated the effects of layer thickness, thermal conductivity, and cooling systems on the heat transfer behavior. The results demonstrated that reducing the hydride layer thickness, mixing the metal hydride bed with high-conductivity materials, increasing the cooling agent flow velocity, and using a cooling agent with a lower temperature were more beneficial in improving the thermal performance of the metal hydride bed. In addition, thinning the hydride layer and enhancing the hydride material thermal conductivity were found to decrease the peak temperature. Furthermore, the heat transfer efficiencies of hydride materials, bed structures, and cooling systems should be well matched to obtain optimal operating parameters. The results highlighted the applicability of the proposed model and the coupled heat transfer method to effectively characterize the temperature patterns of uranium-based hydride beds during hydrogen absorption.

AB Recent empirical research has documented the clustered volatility and fat tails of return distribution in stock markets, yet returns are uncorrelated over time. Certain agent-based theoretical models attempt to explain the empirical features in terms of investors' order-splitting or dynamic switching strategies, both of which are frequently used by actual stock investors. However, little theoretical research has discriminated among the behavioral assumptions within a model and compared the impacts of the assumptions on the empirical features. Nor has the research simultaneously replicated the return features and empirical features on market microstructure, such as patterns of order choice. This study constructs an artificial limit order market in which investors split orders into small pieces or use fundamental and trend-following predictors interchangeably over time. We demonstrate that, on one hand, the market that features strategies with order splitting and dynamic predictor selection can independently replicate clustered volatility and fat tails with near-zero return autocorrelations. However, we also show that patterns of order choice do not match those found in certain previous empirical studies in both types of economies. Thus, we conclude that, in reality, the two strategies can work to generate the empirical return features but that investors may also use other strategies in actual stock markets. We also demonstrate that the impact of both strategies on the volatility persistence tends to be greater as the number of traders increases in the market; this finding implies that the order-splitting strategy and dynamic predictor selection are more crucial for the empirical phenomena pertaining to larger capital stocks.

AB Background: Short QT syndrome (SQTS) is a newly identified clinical disorder associated with atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias and increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD). The SQTS variant 3 is linked to D172N mutation to the KCNJ2 gene that causes a gain-of-function to the inward rectifier potassium channel current (I-K1), which shortens the ventricular action potential duration (APD) and effective refractory period (ERP). Pro-arrhythmogenic effects of SQTS have been characterized, but less is known about the possible pharmacological treatment of SQTS. Therefore, in this study, we used computational modeling to assess the effects of amiodarone, class III anti-arrhythmic agent, on human ventricular electrophysiology in SQT3.
   Methods: The ten Tusscher et al. model for the human ventricular action potentials (APs) was modified to incorporate I-K1 formulations based on experimental data of Kir2.1 channels (including WT, WT-D172N and D172N conditions). The modified cell model was then implemented to construct one-dimensional (1D) and 2D tissue models. The blocking effects of amiodarone on ionic currents were modeled using IC50 and Hill coefficient values from literatures. Effects of amiodarone on APD, ERP and pseudo-ECG traces were computed. Effects of the drug on the temporal and spatial vulnerability of ventricular tissue to genesis and maintenance of re-entry were measured, as well as on the dynamic behavior of re-entry.
   Results: Amiodarone prolonged the ventricular cell APD and decreased the maximal voltage heterogeneity (dV) among three difference cells types across transmural ventricular wall, leading to a decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD along a 1D model of ventricular transmural strand. Amiodarone increased cellular ERP, prolonged QT interval and decreased the T-wave amplitude. It reduced tissue's temporal susceptibility to the initiation of re-entry and increased the minimum substrate size necessary to sustain re-entry in the 2D tissue.
   Conclusions: At the therapeutic-relevant concentration of amiodarone, the APD and ERP at the single cell level were increased significantly. The QT interval in pseudo-ECG was prolonged and the re-entry in tissue was prevented. This study provides further evidence that amiodarone may be a potential pharmacological agent for preventing arrhythmogenesis for SQT3 patients.

ID ZERO-INTELLIGENCE; PRICE FORMATION; DESIGN
AB This research builds upon two early efforts to explore robot trading strategies within the double auction market: (1) Gode and Sunder's Zero Intelligence robots, a simple, loss avoiding, random, persistent, liquidity-providing strategy that produced, in double auction markets, high efficiency of allocation and market price convergence (within-period) towards the predictions of competitive theory; and (2) an entirely parasitic version of Todd Kaplan's Snipers, a simple, loss-avoiding, deterministic, liquidity-removing strategy. The original version of Kaplan's Snipers achieved the highest profit in an early tournament (the Santa Fe Double Auction Tournament) in part by accepting others' orders when there was an excellent price, a low bid-ask spread, or time was running out. As we increase the proportion of snipers in a market, we find that sniping is not generally superior to the ZI strategy and that the snipers' parasitic and end-of-period behaviors eventually cause extreme price variance and divergence from competitive equilibrium, lower market efficiencies, and rising Gini coefficients of inequality. Our results contrast with earlier claims by Gode and Sunder and others that double auction market efficiency and convergence to competitive equilibria are market properties relatively insensitive to agent strategies. Instead, we find a need to consider agent strategy in explaining how our market outcomes differ from those previously obtained either by Gode and Sunder or by Kaplan's successful tournament entry. Specifically, the interaction of parasitic sniper strategies creates a trading constraint: snipers will never trade with each other. These strategy-induced trading constraints force the standard market efficiency metric lower as the sniper population rises. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TIME
AB This research paper aims at achieving a better understanding of rule-based activity-based models, by proposing a new level of validation at the process model level in the A Learning-based Transportation Oriented Simulation System (ALBATROSS) model. To that effect, the work activity process model, which includes six decision steps, has been investigated. Each decision step is evaluated during the prediction of the individuals' schedules. There are specific decision steps that affect the execution pattern of the work activity process model. So, the comportment of execution in the process model contains activation dependency. This branches the execution and evaluation of each agent under examination. Sequence Alignment Methods (SAM) can be used to evaluate how similar/dissimilar the predicted and observed decision sequences are on an agent level. The original Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector decision trees at each decision step utilized in ALBATROSS are compared with other well known induction methods chosen to appraise the purpose of the analyses. The models are validated at four levels: the classifier or decision step level whereby confusion matrix statistics are used; The work activity trips Origin-Destination matrix level; the time of day work activity start time level, using a correlation coefficient; and the process model level, using SAM. The results of validation on the proposed process model level show conformity to all validation levels. In addition, the results provide additional information in better understanding the process model's behavior. Hence, introducing a new level of validation incur new knowledge and assess the predictive performance of rule-based activity-based models. And assist in identifying critical decision steps in the work activity process model.

AB In this work, the problems of knowledge acquisition and information processing are explored in relation to the definitions of concepts and conceptual processing, and their implications for artificial agents.
   The discussion focuses on views of cognition as a dynamic property in which the world is actively represented in grounded mental states which only have meaning in the action context. Reasoning is understood as an emerging property consequence of actions-environment couplings achieved through experience, and concepts as situated and dynamic phenomena enabling behaviours.
   Re-framing the characteristics of concepts is considered crucial to overcoming settled beliefs and reinterpreting new understandings in artificial systems.
   The first part presents a review of concepts from cognitive sciences. Support is found for views on grounded and embodied cognition, describing concepts as dynamic, flexible, context-dependent, and distributedly coded.
   That is argued to contrast with many technical implementations assuming concepts as categories, whilst explains limitations when grounding amodal symbols, or in unifying learning, perception and reasoning.
   The characteristics of concepts are linked to methods of active inference, self-organization, and deep learning to address challenges posed and to reinterpret emerging techniques.
   In a second part, an architecture based on deep generative models is presented to illustrate arguments elaborated. It is evaluated in a navigation task, showing that sufficient representations are created regarding situated behaviours with no semantics imposed on data. Moreover, adequate behaviours are achieved through a dynamic integration of perception and action in a single representational domain and process. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article introduces an ant colony search algorithm (ACSA) to solve the optimal capacitor placement problem. This ACSA is a relatively new meta-heuristic for solving hard combinational optimization problems. It is a population-based approach that uses exploration of positive feedback as well as greedy search. The ACSA was inspired from the natural behavior of the ant colonies on how they find the food source and bring them back to their nest by building the unique trail formation. Therefore, through a collection of cooperative agents called ants, the near-optimal solution to the capacitor placement problem can be effectively achieved. In addition, in the algorithm, the state transition rule, local pheromone-updating rule, and global pheromone-updating rule are all added to facilitate the computation. Through operating the population of agents simultaneously, the process stagnation can be effectively prevented. Namely the optimization capability can thus be significantly enhanced. Moreover the capacitor placement problem is a combinatorial optimization problem having an objective function composed of power losses and capacitor installation costs subject to bus voltage constraints, which is commonly solved by employing mathematical programming methods, and will be solved using ACSA in this article. The proposed approach is demonstrated employing two application examples. Numerical results of a small-size example system show that the proposed method can achieve an optimal solution like the exhaustive search, but with much less computational burden. Also, this proposed method is superior to some other methods adopted herein in terms of power loss and costs.

AB Both oxidative stress and inflammation are elevated in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, but their pathogenic significance still remains unclear. Current evidence support the hypothesis that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antioxidant therapy might protect against the development of Alzheimer's disease, and ibuprofen has the strongest epidemiological support. In the present work our attention was focused on (R)-alpha-lipoic acid considered as a potential neuroprotective agent in Alzheimer's disease therapy. In particular, we investigated a new co-drug (1) obtained by joining (R)-alpha-lipoic acid and ibuprofen via a diamide bond, for evaluating its potential to antagonize the deleterious structural and cognitive effects of beta-amyloid (1-40) in an infused Alzheimer's disease rat model. Our results indicated that infusion of beta-amyloid (1-40) impairs memory performance through a progressive cognitive deterioration; however, ibuprofen and co-drug 1 seemed to protect against behavioural detriment induced by simultaneous administration of beta-amyloid (1-40) protein. The obtained data were supported by the histochemical findings of the present study: beta-amyloid protein was less expressed in 1-treated than in ibuprofen and (R)-alpha-lipoic acid alone-treated cerebral cortex. Taken together, the present findings suggest that co-drug 1 treatment may protect against the cognitive dysfunction induced by intracerebroventricular infusion of beta-amyloid (1-40) in rats. Thus, co-drug 1 could prove useful as a tool for controlling Alzheimer's disease-induced cerebral amyloid deposits and behavioural deterioration.

AB Intelligent Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has recently gained a lot of attention due to its ability to optimally control the complex behavior of the HVAC system. However, more exploration is needed on understanding the adaptability challenges that the DRL agent could face during the deployment phase. Using online learning for such applications is not realistic due to the long learning period and likely poor comfort control during the learning process. Alternatively, DRL can be pre-trained using a building model prior to deployment. However, developing an accurate building model for every house and deploying a pre-trained DRL model for HVAC control would not be cost-effective. In this study, we focus on evaluating the ability of DRL-based HVAC control to provide cost savings when pre-trained on one building model and deployed on different house models with varying user comforts. We observed around 30% of cost reduction by pre-trained model over baseline when validated in a simulation environment and achieved up to 21% cost reduction when deployed in the real house. This finding provides experimental evidence that the pre-trained DRL has the potential to adapt to different house environments and comfort settings.

AB Firms often worry about how buyers will react when there is an inventory shortage, but the anticipation of facing a shortage may also impact buyer behavior. In this paper we use a combination of theoretical modeling, computational methods, and laboratory experiments to understand buyers' search behavior in markets where there is potential for either a costly or costless inventory shortage. When inventory shortages are costly to buyers we find their equilibrium purchasing strategy generates a newsvendor problem among the firms. In turn, experimental data suggests buyer behavior can be explained by prospect theory better than by standard assumptions of fully rational expected utility maximizing agents, indicating that potential inventory shortages generate loss aversion among buyers, and there is systematic misidentification of the probability with which they will be able to procure an item. Using computational methods, we find firms are able to extract more surplus from behavioral buyers via higher prices than would be predicted by the standard model. On the other hand, when inventory shortages are not costly to buyers the effect of behavioral biases on the part of buyers is not relevant. But in this case there can be a benefit to reducing inventory via a reduction in price competition. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the present work is to analyze the morphology, mechanical properties and fracture behaviour of solid and foamed plates made of glass fiber-reinforced PP. The morphology exhibited a solid skin/-foamed core structure, dependent on the foaming ratio. Simulation of the microcellular injection molding process with Moldex 3D (R) software provided a good approach to the experimental results. The flexural properties and impact resistance showed lower values as the apparent density decreased, but constant specific properties. The fracture characterization was carried out by determining the Crack Tip Opening Displacement (CTOD) at low strain rate, as well as the fracture toughness (K-Ic) at impact loading. Foamed specimens presented higher values of CTOD than the solid ones and higher as the foaming ratio increases, due to cells acting as crack arrestors by blunting the crack tip. However, the fracture toughness K-JC decreased with decreasing the apparent density. Anisotropy due to fiber orientation was also observed. Fibers were aligned in the filling direction in the surface layers, while they were oriented in the transverse direction in the core. According to the amount of fibers oriented in one direction or another, different properties were obtained. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In swarm robotic systems, task allocation is a challenging problem aiming to decompose complex tasks into a series of subtasks. We propose a self-organizing method to allocate a swarm of robots to perform a foraging task consisting of sequentially dependent subtasks. The method regulates the proportion of robots to meet the task demands for given tasks. Our proposed method is based on the response threshold model, mapping the intensity of task demands to the probability of responding to candidate tasks depending on the response threshold. Each robot is suitable for all tasks but some robots have higher probability of taking certain tasks and lower probability of taking others. In our task allocation method, each robot updates its response threshold depending on the associated task demand as well as the number of neighbouring robots performing the task. It relies neither on a centralized mechanism nor on information exchange amongst robots. Repetitive and continuous task allocations lead to the desired task distribution at a swarm level. We also analyzed the mathematical convergence of the task distribution among a swarm of robots. We demonstrate that the method is effective and robust for a foraging task under various conditions on the number of robots, the number of tasks and the size of the arena. Our simulation results may support the hypothesis that social insects use a task allocation method to handle the foraging task required for a colony& x2019;s survival.

AB Complex cognitive processes corresponding to human control behaviors cannot be easily inferred using (1) a logical rule-based model, (2) a statistical model, or (3) an analytical predictive model. Predicting human behaviors in complex and uncertain environments like emergency evacuation is considered almost impossible (at least NP hard) in systems theory. In this paper, we explore simulating human behaviors using affordance-based finite state automata (FSA) modeling, based on the ecological concept of affordance theory. To this end, we introduce the conceptual and generic framework of affordance-based human behavior simulation developed through our previous work. Following the generic framework, formal simulation models of affordance-based human behaviors are developed, especially for emergency evacuation, to mimic perception-based dynamic human actions interacting with emergent environmental changes, such as fire. A "warehouse fire evacuation" case is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework. The human action planning algorithms in the simulation model are developed and implemented using the Adjusted Floor Field Indicators, which represent not only the evacuee's prior knowledge of the floor layout but the perceivable information about dynamic environmental changes. The results of our simulation study verify that the proposed framework accurately simulates human fire evacuation behavior. The proposed framework is expected to capture the natural manner in which humans behave in emergency evacuation and enhance the simulation fidelity of analyses and predictions of perceptual human behaviors/responses in the systems by incorporating cognitive intent into human behavior simulations.

AB Evolutionary computation (EC) paradigm has undergone extensions in the recent years diverging from the natural process of genetic evolution to the simulation of natural life processes exhibited by the living organisms. Bee colonies exemplify a high level of intrinsic interdependence and co-ordination among its members, and algorithms inspired from the bee colonies have gained recent prominence in the field of swarm based metaheuristics. The artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm was recently developed, by simulating the minimalistic foraging model of honeybees in search of food sources, for solving real-parameter, non-convex, and non-smooth optimization problems. The single parameter perturbation in classical ABC resulted in fairly commendable performance for simple problems without epistasis of variables ( separable). However, it suffered from narrow search zone and slow convergence which eventually led to poor exploitation tendency. Even with the increase in dimensionality, a significant deterioration was observed in the ability of ABC to locate the optimum in a huge search volume. Some of the probable shortcomings in the basic ABC approach, as observed, are the single parameter perturbation instead of a multiple one, ignoring the fitness to reward ratio while selecting food sites, and most importantly the absence of environmental factors in the algorithm design. Research has shown that spatial environmental factors play a crucial role in insect locomotion and foragers seem to learn the direction to be undertaken based on the relative analysis of its proximal surroundings. Most importantly, the mapping of the forager locomotion from three dimensional search spaces to a multidimensional solution space calls forth the implementation of multiple modification schemes. Based on the fundamental observation pertaining to the dynamics of ABC, this article proposes an improved variant of ABC aimed at improving the optimizing ability of the algorithm over an extended set of problems. The hybridization of the proposed fitness learning mechanism with a weighted selection scheme and proximity based stimuli helps to achieve a fine blending of explorative and exploitative behaviour by enhancing both local and global searching ability of the algorithm. This enhances the ability of the swarm agents to detect optimal regions in the unexplored fitness basins. With respect to its immediate surroundings, a proximity based component is added to the normal positional modification of the onlookers and is enacted through an improved probability selection scheme that takes the TIE (total reward to distance) ratio metric into account. The biologicallymotivated, hybridized variant of ABC achieves a statistically superior performance on majority of the tested benchmark instances, as compared to some of the most prominent state-of-the-art algorithms, as is demonstrated through a detailed experimental evaluation and verified statistically.

AB Molecular modeling studies were carried out on a series of substituted acyl sulfonamides and acyl sulfamides derivatives of imidazole as angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonists in order to determine the structural properties required for their antihypertensive activity. To elucidate the structural properties required for antihypertensive activity, four different molecular modeling techniques; two-dimensional (2D-QSAR), Group-Based QSAR (G-QSAR), 3D-QSAR and pharmacophore identification studies have been carried out on a series of substituted acyl sulfonamides and acyl sulfamides derivatives of imidazole. The partial least square (PLS) regression method and kNN-MFA methodology coupled with feature selection methods viz., stepwise (SW) and simulated annealing (SA) were applied to derive QSAR models which were further validated for statistical significance and predictive ability by internal and external validation. The statistically significant best 2D-QSAR model having r(2) = 0.8711 and q(2) = 0.8054 with pred_r(2) = 0.8410 was developed by SW-PLS and best G-QSAR model having r(2) = 0.8196 and q(2) = 0.7299 with pred_r(2) = 0.7693 was developed by SW-PLS method. The best 3D-QSAR model using SA-kNN-MFA method, showing good correlative and predictive capabilities in terms of q(2) = 0.7862 and pred_r(2) = 0.7119. The contour maps generated by the kNN models were used to identify the key structural requirements responsible for the biological activity. Continuing with substituted acyl sulfonamides and acyl sulfamides derivatives of imidazole, chemical feature based pharmacophore model with lowest RMSD value (0.0436 A), consists of one AroC feature (aromatic), two AlaC features (aliphatic), one HAc (hydrogen bond acceptor), and one negative ionizable was developed. It could rationalize the antihypertensive activity profile of many compounds used in such study as well as the important structural features responsible for antihypertensive activity. The findings of these molecular modeling studies can serve as a useful guide for future rational design of potential agents with better antihypertensive activity.

AB Background and purpose: To simulate human stroke, we developed a model of focal cerebral embolic ischemia in the unanesthetized rat. Using this model, we tested the hypothesis that intra-arterial administration of TNK-tPA, a fibrin specific second generation thrombolytic agent, is effective in reducing ischemic volume without increasing intra-cerebral hemorrhage. Methods: Under anesthesia, a catheter was inserted to the origin of the MCA of male Wistar rats. Forty-five minutes after recovery from anesthesia, the MCA was occluded in the awake rat by a single fibrin rich clot placed via the catheter. TNK-tPA (1.5 mg/kg) was administered intraarterially via the catheter at either 2 h or 4 h after stroke. All rats were sacrificed at 48 h after ischemia. Neurological deficits, gross hemorrhage and ischemic lesion volume were measured. Results: A clot was detected at the origin of the MCA 4 h after MCA occlusion in the awake rats (n = 4). Rats (n = 12) subjected to MCA occlusion showed immediate neurological deficits which persisted for 48 h of ischemia. Ischemic rats had a lesion volume of 38.2+/-3.8% and 25% of rats exhibited gross hemorrhage. Ischemic rats (n=10) treated with TNK-tPA at 2 h showed a significant (P<0.05) reduction of neurological deficits, body weight loss and infarct volume (22.8+/-2.1%) without an increase in gross hemorrhage (10%) compared with the non treated ischemic rats (25%). Although treatment with TNK-tPA of ischemic rats (n=12) at 4 h did not significantly (P=0.06) reduce infarct volume (28.6+/-3.0%), it also did not increase gross hemorrhage (25%) compared with the control group (25%). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that intraarterial administration of TNK-tPA at 2 h of ischemia in the unanesthesthetized rat is effective in reducing neurological deficits and ischemic lesion volume without increasing hemorrhagic transformation and that administration of TNK-tPA at 4 h of ischemia does not increase the incidence of hemorrhagic transformation.

TI Effect of external and internal plasticization on the glass transition

ID PARTICLE MESH EWALD; COPOLYMERS; ACRYLATE
AB The differences between internal and external plasticization as well as how the molecular structure of a plasticizer effects the glass transition temperature, T-g, of a (meth)acrylate terpolymer is analyzed with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and measured with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). 1-phenoxy-2-propanol (PPH), butyl carbitol (BC) and ethylene glycol-2-ethylhexyl ether (EEH) are added either as free external plasticizers or are integrated into the polymer as internal bonded plasticizers. The simulation model is validated by finding excellent agreement of predicted T-g-values of various relevant homopolymers and terpolymers with measured values and values that are derived from established empirical equations. Simulation results suggest an aggregation of polymer alkyl groups into non-polar nano-domains. Moreover, addition of the three external plasticizers lowers T-g substantially. This T-g-loss is partially recovered after directly integrating the free plasticizers into the polymer. Bulkier plasticizers, such as BC, are more effective internal plasticizers because their larger size increase the distance between polymer chains to a larger extend, which leads to weaker average interactions among the chains, thereby reducing T-g. On the other hand, more compact free plasticizers, such as PPH, exhibit a lower diffusive energy barrier that causes more frequent diffusive moves. This stimulates the diffusive movement also of the polymer, which reduces T-g. Hence, integrating such a compact plasticizer into the polymer leads to a larger recovery of the T-g - loss that was induced by its free form. Overall, the complementary use of MD simulations and DSC measurements provide insights on the differences on how internal and external plasticizers influence T-g, respectively, and identifies the underlying molecular causes. External plasticization reduces T-g more effectively than internal plasticization. Hence, a drop in T-g caused by an external plasticizer can be partially recovered by integrating the plasticizer into the polymer. A possible application is the design of reactive coalescing agents for coatings that bind to the polymer after application and that could replace conventional and potentially harmful coalescing agents that evaporate into the environment.

AB Early trials of garlic preparations on blood lipids mainly supported a lipid-lowering effect, whereas later well-designed garlic tablet trials were mainly entirely null. However, enteric simulation tests suggest that this discordance may result from ineffective delivery of bioactive agents from the brands of garlic powder (GP) and cyclodextrin-bound garlic oil (GO) tablets tested in some recent negative trials. In contrast, enteric simulation tests show that the preformed bioactive agents present in "traditional" gelatin capsules of GO are efficiently released, although such capsules have rarely been investigated in lipid-lowering trials. It was hypothesized that gelatin capsules of GO given to normal subjects would improve specified coronary heart disease risk factors. Effects of a GP preparation were also investigated. Subjects (n = 51;men and women, mean age 27 y) were randomly assigned to receive either 8.2 mg/d of GO (allyl sulfides) or placebo for 11 wk. Another 27 subjects received garlic powder (GP) of similar biopotential (7.8 mg allicin/d). Outcome measures were 95% confidence intervals (CI) between GO and placebo groups for differences between baseline and subsequent sample times. Men and women combined showed no significant differences save for an improved total antioxidant capacity at 6 wk (P = 0.01). Hence, no benefit from GO after 11 wk is one plausible conclusion. However, there were significant differences in effect of GO between men and women for HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) (P = 0.004) and total cholesterol (TC)/HDL-C (P = 0.003), Women showed favorable effects in terms of CHD risk factors (i.e., increases in HDL-C and reductions in TC/HDL-C), whereas men had small adverse effects. There was a significant difference in the GO effect for glucose (P = 0.006), with a reduction seen for men and an increase for women. The gender effects were unexpected and such analyses were not planned in advance. Confirmation of these findings with larger numbers of subjects would have importance for the use of garlic against CHD and for the design of future garlic studies.

TI Aripiprazole in schizophrenia with cocaine dependence - A pilot study

LA English

AB The debilitation of schizophrenia (SCHZ) worsens markedly with comorbid cocaine dependence (CD) and alcohol abuse. To date, no medications have conclusively demonstrated effects against both SCHZ and CD (SCHZ + CD) simultaneously. Because of its dopamine-modulating properties, we hypothesized that aripiprazole would alleviate cocaine craving in patients with SCHZ + CD. We conducted a prospective, 8-week, open-label trial in poorly compliant SCHZ + CD subjects. Each received aripiprazole as their sole neuroleptic agent at a maximum dose of 15 mg/d. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Brief Substance Craving Scale (BSCS) measured psychosis and subjective cocaine and alcohol cravings. Urine tests for cocaine provided data on actual use. Of 10 male subjects entered, 6 (60%) completed the 8-week trial. In those cases, positive urine tests dropped significantly (P < 0.001) after 2 weeks, when aripiprazole had reached steady state. Mean cocaine craving scores declined significantly (P = 0.026) as did mean alcohol craving scores (P = 0.006). Declining psychosis scores were associated with declining cocaine craving (r = 0.87, P < 0.01) and alcohol craving (r = 0.88, P < 0.01), respectively. This experience suggests possible aripiprazole effects in lowering both desire for and the use of cocaine in comorbid SCHZ subjects. These data suggest double-blind, randomized, comparison study in this severely ill, comorbid patient group.

AB Periodic nanostructures of poly(glycidyl methacrylate) (pGMA) were grafted onto poly(ethylenealt-tetrafluorethylene) (ETFE) films by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. ETFE samples were first irradiated in an interference lithographic setup using EUV (extreme ultraviolet) light followed by exposure to air to introduce surface peroxide groups serving as thermal initiators for the graft polymerization. The dependence of height and morphology of the grafted pGMA structures on the exposure dose and on the grafting parameters such as time and concentration of RAFT chain transfer agent was studied with atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). RAFT mediation reduces the grafted layer thickness by a factor of 5-10 compared to uncontrolled free radical polymerization and significantly improves the spatial resolution into the 50 nm range. A mushroom to brush transition was observed for low absorbed doses. This transition was found to occur at similar to(1.5 +/- 0.7) x 10(-3) and similar to(3 +/- 1.3) x 10(-3) chains/nm(2) for the free radical and RAFT-mediated polymerization, respectively. The grafting density increased with increasing absorbed dose up to a maximum of 0.1-0.2 chains/nm(2). The data interpretation is supported by simulations based on photon statistics.

AB We describe a novel Bayesian approach to estimate acquisition and clearance rates for many competing subtypes of a pathogen in a susceptibleinfectedsusceptible model. The inference relies on repeated measurements of the current status of being a non-carrier (susceptible) or a carrier (infected) of one of the nq?>?1 subtypes. We typically collect the measurements with sampling intervals that may not catch the true speed of the underlying dynamics. We tackle the problem of incompletely observed data with Bayesian data augmentation, which integrates over possible carriage histories, allowing the data to contain intermittently missing values, complete dropouts of study subjects, or inclusion of new study subjects during the follow-up. We investigate the performance of the described method through simulations by using two different mixing groups (family and daycare) and different sampling intervals. For comparison, we describe crude maximum likelihood-based estimates derived directly from the observations. We apply the estimation algorithm to data about transmission of Streptococcus pneumonia in Bangladeshi families. The computationally intensive Bayesian approach is a valid method to account for incomplete observations, and we found that it performs generally better than the simple crude method, in particular with large amount of missing data.

AB Gaussian graphical models are recently used in economics to obtain networks of dependence among agents. A widely used estimator is the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (GLASSO), which amounts to a maximum likelihood estimation regularized using the L-1,L-1 matrix norm on the precision matrix Omega. The L-1,L-1 norm is a LASSO penalty that controls for sparsity, or the number of zeros in Omega. We propose a new estimator called structured GLASSO (SGLASSO) that uses the L-1,L-2 mixed norm. The use of the L-1,L-2 penalty controls for the structure of the sparsity in Omega. We show that when the network size is fixed, SGLASSO is asymptotically equivalent to an infeasible GLASSO problem which prioritizes the sparsity-recovery of high-degree nodes. Monte Carlo simulation shows that SGLASSO outperforms GLASSO in terms of estimating the overall precision matrix and in terms of estimating the structure of the graphical model. In an empirical illustration using a classic firms' investment data set, we obtain a network of firms' dependence that exhibits the core-periphery structure, with General Motors, General Electric and US Steel forming the core group of firms.

AB Background: Because of the high frequency of multidrug resistant bacteria in our intensive care units (ICUs), we implemented a ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) clinical pathway based on unit-specific minimum inhibitory concentration (M IC) distributions and pharmacodynamic modeling in 3 of our ICUs.
   Methods: This was a prospective, observational evaluation with a historical control group in adult patients (n = 168) who met clinical and radiologic criteria for VAP. Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine antibiotic regimens having the greatest likelihood of achieving bactericidal exposures against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Antibiotic regimens were incorporated into an ICU-specific computerized clinical pathway as empiric agents of choice.
   Results: Pharmacodynamic modeling found 3-hour infusions of cefepime 2 g every 8 hours or meropenem 2 g every 8 hours plus tobramycin and vancomycin would provide the greatest probability of empirically treating VAP in these ICUs. Infection-related mortality was reduced by 69% (8.5% vs 21.6%; P = .029), infection-related length of stay was shorter (11.7 +/- 8.1 vs 26.1 +/- 18.5; P < .001), and fewer superinfections were observed in patients treated on the pathway. A number of patients with nonsusceptible P aeruginosa were successfully treated with high-dose, 3-hour infusion regimens.

AB Smart system applications (SSAs)-a heterogeneous landscape of applications of Internet of things, cyber-physical systems, and smart sensing systems-are composed of autonomous yet inherently cooperating components. An important problem in this area is how to hoist the cooperation of software components forming dynamic groups-ensembles-at the architectural level of an SSA. This is hard since ensembles can overlap, be nested, and be dynamically formed and dismantled based on several criteria. A related problem is how to combine component and ensemble specification with a well-established language supported on multiple platforms. To target these problems, we propose a specification and implementation language Trait-based COmponent Ensemble Language (TCOEL) based on Scala internal DSL, to describe both the architecture and formation of dynamic ensembles of components and their functional internals. To raise the level of expressivity, we introduce the concept of domain-specific extensions (traits) to the TCOEL core to reflect different paradigms' concerns-such as movement in a 2D map, state-space modeling of physical processes, and statistical reasoning about uncertainty. This allows for configuring TCOEL for the needs of a specific SSA use case and, at the same time, facilitates reuse. To evaluate TCOEL, we show how it can be beneficially used in addressing the coordination of agents in a RoboCup Rescue Simulation application.

AB Farmer's lung disease (FLD) is common in eastern France. It is the main form of occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis, caused by chronic inhalation of microorganisms (antigens) from mouldy hay, straw, or grain. The purpose of this study was to assess, with a panel of data collected between 1997-2003, environmental factors and agricultural practices that independently modify concentrations in hay of microorganisms potentially responsible for FLD. A total of 629 hay samples from 86 farms Were included in statistical analyses using linear multilevel regression models allowing to consider the nested structure of the data: individual-level (batch of hay) and group-level (farm). The Outcome variable of these models was the concentration in hay (logarithmic value of concentration+1) of microorganisms incriminated in FLD (Absidia corymbifera, Eurotium spp., thermophilic actinomycetes). The simultaneous analysis of batch of hay-and farm-level factors showed that bad climatic conditions of harvest, high-density hay-packing modes, (especially round bales) and altitude (2(nd) plateau, ]700-900] m) were the main factors associated with high concentrations of these microorganisms in hay. This study allowed clarification of the factors that influence the microbial concentration of hay with etiological agents of FLD.

TI Unitary Owen Points in Cooperative Lot-Sizing Models with Backlogging
SO MATHEMATICS

DT Article
DE unitary Owen points; cooperation; cost allocation; coalitional stability
ID PRODUCTION-INVENTORY GAMES; CORE
AB This paper analyzes cost sharing in uncapacitated lot-sizing models with backlogging and heterogeneous costs. It is assumed that several firms participate in a consortium aiming at satisfying their demand over the planning horizon with minimal operating cost. Each individual firm has its own ordering channel and holding technology, but cooperation with other firms consists in sharing that information. Therefore, the firms that cooperate can use the best ordering channels and holding technology among members of the consortium. This mode of cooperation is stable. in that allocations of the overall operating cost exist, so that no group of agents benefit from leaving the consortium. Our contribution in the current paper is to present a new family of cost sharing allocations with good properties for enforcing cooperation: the unitary Owen points. Necessary and sufficient conditions are provided for the unitary Owen points to belong to the core of the cooperative game. In addition, we provide empirical evidence, through simulation, showing that, in randomly-generated situations, the above condition is fulfilled in 99% of the cases. Additionally, a relationship between lot-sizing games and a certain family of production-inventory games, through Owen's points of the latter, is described. This interesting relationship enables easily constructing a variety of coalitionally stable allocations for cooperative lot-sizing models.

AB Noroviruses (NoVs) are the most common cause of sporadic and epidemic gastroenteritis in the United States and Europe and are responsible for 20% of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. Over the past decade, the understanding of NoV immunology has grown immensely. Studies of the natural immune response to NoV in humans and animal models have laid the foundation for innovations in cell culture systems for NoV and development of new therapeutics. Evidence from animal models, NoV surrogates, observational human research, and human challenge studies suggest that the innate immune response is critical for limiting NoV infection but is insufficient for viral clearance. NoV may antagonize the innate immune response to establish or prolong infection. However, once a robust adaptive immune response is initiated, the immune system clears the infection through the action of T and B cells, simultaneously generating highly specific protective immunologic memory. We review here both the current knowledge on NoV immunity and exciting new developments, with a focus on ongoing vaccine development work, novel cell culture systems, and advances in understanding the role of the gut microbiome. These changes reinforce the need for a better understanding of the human immune response to NoV and suggest novel hypotheses.

   functionalization; Molecular mechanics
ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; SMILES
AB Due to their flexibility, large surface area and high specific mechanical properties, single layer graphene sheets (SLGSs) are potential candidates as filler materials for improving mechanical properties of polymers. Their effective utilization as reinforcements requires strong interfacial binding with the matrix surrounding them. The covalent functionalization of SLGSs is an effective technique to enhance this binding. However, covalent bonds introduced by a functional group usually alter the pristine structure of the SLGS that may affect its mechanical properties. Thus it is important to delineate effects of covalent functionalization on elastic moduli of an SLGS. We consider five groups of different polarities, namely, hydrogen (-H), hydroxyl (-OH), carboxyl (-COOH), amine (-NH2), and fluorine (-F) as model functional groups and investigate their effects on values of Young's modulus and the shear modulus of the SLGS. We use molecular mechanics (MM) simulations with the MM3 potential and the software TINKER to conduct the study. The pristine and the functionalized SLGSs are deformed in simple tension and simple shear, and from curves of the strain energy density of deformation vs. the axial strain and the shear strain, values of Young's modulus and the shear modulus, respectively, are derived. These values are based on the hypothesis that the response of an SLGS is the same as that of an energetically and geometrically equivalent continuum structure of wall thickness 3.4 angstrom. It is found that functionalization reduces the elastic moduli of the SLGSs which could be due to nearly 120% local strains induced at the functionalized sites of relaxed but unloaded SLGS, and the change in hybridization from sp(2) to sp(3). The decrease in the value of the modulus increases with an increase in the amount of functionalization but is essentially independent of the functionalizing agent. For 10% functionalization, Young's modulus and the shear modulus of the SLGS are found to decrease by about 73% and 42%, respectively. However, the moduli of a fully functionalized SLGS are about the same as those of a 4% functionalized sheet. Even though the moduli of the pristine armchair and zigzag SLGSs are the same, the moduli of functionalized armchair SLGSs are about 20% less than those of the corresponding zigzag SLGSs. The work will help material scientists interested in designing graphene sheet reinforced polymeric composites. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amid an increasing number of reports in the literature concerning epithelial barrier enhancement by various nutrient compounds, there has never been a study performing side-by-side comparisons of these agents in a single epithelial model. We compare five nutrient compounds (previously reported in various epithelial models to enhance barrier function) regarding their ability to increase transepithelial electrical resistance (R-t) and decrease transepithelial mannitol permeability (J(m)) across LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cell layers. The effects of these nutrients on the abundance of various tight junctional proteins are also compared. In the overall group of nutrients tested - zinc, indole, quercetin, butyrate and nicotine - only nicotine failed to improve barrier function by either parameter. Nicotine also was without effect on tight junctional proteins. Quercetin simultaneously increased R-t and decreased J(m). Zinc, butyrate and indole only exhibited statistically significant enhancement of R-t. Each of these four effective nutrient compounds had unique patterns of effects on the panel of tight junctional proteins studied. No two compounds produced the same pattern of effects. This unique pattern of effects on tight junctional complex composition by each compound establishes the chance for additive or even synergistic improvement of barrier function by combinations of compounds. A synergistic effect of the combination of quercetin and zinc on R-t is shown.

AB Radioactive iodine-131 (131I) is used in the treatment and diagnosis of thyroid gland injuries. However, because it emits ionizing radiation, it causes harmful effects to cells. Given that beta-carotene (BC) has antioxidant and antigenotoxic properties, this study aimed to investigate its radioprotective and antimutagenic activity in relation to 131I at the dose that is used to treat hyperthyroidism using a test system of bone marrow cells from Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus). The doses were 0.2 mL of 8 mg BC/mL corn oil and 25 mu Ci 131I per 100 g body weight, and they were given via gavage in acute and subchronic treatments. Treatment groups included simultaneous, pre-treatment, post-treatment, and continuous treatment types. In all antimutagenic acute treatments, BC had a significant antimutagenic/radioprotective activity in relation to 131I. In subchronic antimutagenic treatments, BC reduced the damage that was caused by the radioisotope; however, this reduction was not statistically significant because of the relatively low percentage of chromosomal abnormalities that were observed with only 131I compared to the acute treatment. These results demonstrate the radioprotective and antimutagenic activity of BC, indicating its use by the population, which inevitably is exposed to mutagenic agents, as a means of health protection.

AB The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies were performed on a series of 42 chalcone derivatives to find out the structural requirements of their antimalarial activities. The multiple linear regression (MLR) and partial least square (PLS) regression methods coupled with various feature selection methods, viz., stepwise (SW), genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) were applied to derive QSAR models which were further validated for statistical significance and predictive ability by internal and external validation. The statistically significant 2D-QSAR model having r (2) = 0.8892 and q (2) = 0.7508 with pred_r (2) = 0.7403 was developed by SW-MLR and best Group-based QSAR (GQSAR) model having r (2) = 0.7884 and q (2) = 0.7038 with pred_r (2) = 0.7339 was developed by SW-PLS. Molecular field analysis was used to construct the best 3D-QSAR model using k-nearest neighbour method, showing good correlative and predictive capabilities in terms of q (2) = 0.6818 and pred_r (2) = 0.7708. A docking study revealed the binding orientations of these inhibitors at active site amino acid residues (Gln36, Cys39, Lys37, Asp35, Trp206) of falcipain-2 enzyme (PDB ID: 3BPF). Both QSAR and docking studies of such derivatives provide guidance for further lead optimization and designing of more potent antimalarial agents.

AB Ceftaroline (CPT) is a new cephalosporin exhibiting bactericidal activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP), as well as common Gram-negative pathogens. This study investigated the in vivo efficacy of a 48-hour simulated human dose regimen of CPT compared with ceftriaxone (CRO) against isolates of S. pneumoniae with different susceptibilities to penicillin in a rabbit pneumonia model. Three S. pneumoniae strains were used: CRO-susceptible penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae (CRO-S PSSP), CRO-susceptible penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (CRO-S PISP), and CRO-resistant penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (CRO-R PRSP). Animals were randomized to the control group (no treatment) (n = 22) or to a group given intravenous (IV) CPT human equivalent (HE) dosage (600 mg/12 h; n = 19) or IV CRO HE dosage (1 g/24 h; n = 19). The total doses needed to achieve the HE dosage were 71 and 82 mg/kg of body weight/24 h for CRO and CPT, respectively. One group of rabbits infected with the CRO-R PRSP strain received intramuscular (IM) administration of CPT (5 or 20 mg/kg twice daily; n = 5 for each). Evaluation of efficacy was based on bacterial counts in the lungs and spleen. For IV CPT and IV CRO, the mean areas under the concentration-time curves from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)s) were 155 and 938 mg . h/liter, respectively, the maximum concentrations in serum (C(max)s) were 20 and 158 mg/liter, respectively, and the minimum concentrations in serum (C(min)s) were 1.3 and 6 mg/liter, respectively. Both agents effectively treated pulmonary infections caused by CRO-S PSSP or CRO-S PISP with complete bacterial eradication in the lungs and spleen after 2 days of treatment. Against PRSP, CPT demonstrated excellent bactericidal activity, reducing bacterial counts in the lungs and spleen by approximately 8 and 4 log units, respectively (P < 0.001); CRO treatment resulted in a 2-log-unit reduction in the bacterial counts in lungs that did not reach statistical significance. Twice-daily IM CPT (5 mg/kg) reduced the bacterial burden by approximately 6 log units in the lungs and 3 log units in the spleen, and the 20-mg/kg dosage effectively eradicated PRSP infection. These findings further validate the in vivo bactericidal activity of CPT against pneumococci.

AB This paper proposes a nonlinear panel data model which can endogenously generate both 'weak' and 'strong' cross-sectional dependence. The model's distinguishing characteristic is that a given agent's behaviour is influenced by an aggregation of the views or actions of those around them. The model allows for considerable flexibility in terms of the genesis of this herding or clustering type behaviour. At an econometric level, the model is shown to nest various extant dynamic panel data models. These include panel AR models, spatial models, which accommodate weak dependence only, and panel models where cross-sectional averages or factors exogenously generate strong, but not weak, cross sectional dependence. An important implication is that the appropriate model for the aggregate series becomes intrinsically nonlinear, due to the clustering behaviour, and thus requires the disaggregates to be simultaneously considered with the aggregate. We provide the associated asymptotic theory for estimation and inference. This is supplemented with Monte Carlo studies and two empirical applications which indicate the utility of our proposed model as a vehicle to model different types of cross-sectional dependence.

AB Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity regulation by chemical agents or, potentially, nanomaterials is important for both toxicology and pharmacology. Competitive inhibition via direct catalytic active sites (CAS) binding or noncompetitive inhibition through interference with substrate and product entering and exiting has been recognized previously as an AChE-inhibition mechanism for bespoke nanomaterials. The competitive inhibition by peripheral anionic site (PAS) interaction without CAS binding remains unexplored. Here, we proposed and verified the occurrence of a presumed competitive inhibition of AChE without CAS binding for hydrophobically functionalized C-60 nano particles (NPs) by employing both experimental and computational methods. The kinetic inhibition analysis distinguished six competitive inhibitors, probably targeting the PAS from the pristine and hydrophilically modified C-60 NPs. A simple quantitative nanostructure activity relationship (QNAR) model relating the pocket accessible length of substituent to inhibition capacity was then established to reveal how the geometry of the:surface group decides. the NP difference in AChE inhibition. Molecular docking identified the PAS as the potential binding site interacting with the NPs via a T-shaped plug-in mode. Specifically, the fullerene core covered the enzyme gorge as a lid through pi-pi stacking with Tyr72 and Trp286 in the PAS, while the hydrophobic ligands on the fullerene surface inserted into the AChE active site to provide further stability for the complexes. The modeling predicted that :inhibition would be severely compromised by Tyr72 and Trp286 deletions, and the subsequent site-directed mutagenesis experiments proved this prediction. Our results demonstrate AChE competitive inhibition of NPs without CAS partidpatidn to fnrther understanding of both the neurotoxicity and the curative effect of NPs.

AB Current drugs for the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis are inadequate and their efficacies are also compromised due to suppression of immune function associated during the course of infection. To overcome this problem, efforts are needed to develop therapies with effective immunomodulatory agents where decrease of parasitic burden and simultaneous enhancement of adaptive immunity can be achieved. In this study we have evaluated a new therapeutic approach based on combination of Asparagus racemosus, an immunomodulatory drug, in combination with cisplatin against Leishmania donovani infected BALB/c mice. We demonstrate that A. racemosus (650 mg/kg b.wt./day for 15 days, orally) in combination with cisplatin (5 mg/kg b.wt./day for 5 days, intraperitoneally) enhanced the clearance of parasites as determined by Giemsa-stained liver impression smears. Besides having better killing activity, this combination group achieved increased production of disease resolving Th-1 response (IFN-gamma, IL-2), heightened DTH (delayed type hypersensitivity) response and augmented levels of IgG2a. Moreover, A. racemosus in combination with cisplatin not only provided enhanced protective immune response but also resulted in remarkable improved kidney and liver function tests as manifested by normal levels of SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine and urea in blood plasma with normal histological observations as compared to only cisplatin treated L. donovani infected BALB/c mice. Through this study we have ascertained that A. racemosus in combination with cisplatin in L. donovani infected BALB/c mice boosted as well as restored both cellular and humoral immunity. Thus in view of severe immunosuppression in visceral leishmaniasis, a better and effective strategy for optimum efficacy of future antileishmanial drugs would direct not only killing of parasite by the drug, but also simultaneous generation of immunity against the disease.

AB We have strategically designed a series of noscapine derivatives by inserting biaryl pharmacophore (a major structural constituent of many of the microtubule-targeting natural anticancer compounds) onto the scaffold structure of noscapine. Molecular interaction of these derivatives with alpha,beta-tubulin heterodimer was investigated by molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation. The predictive binding affinity indicates that the newly designed noscapinoids bind to tubulin with a greater affinity. The predictive binding free energy (Delta G(bind, pred)) of these derivatives (ranging from -5.568 to -5.970 kcal/mol) based on linear interaction energy (LIE) method with a surface generalized Born (SGB) continuum solvation model showed improved binding affinity with tubulin compared to the lead compound, natural alpha-noscapine (-5.505 kcal/mol). Guided by the computational findings, these new biaryl type alpha-noscapine congeners were synthesized from 9-bromo-alpha-noscapine using optimized Suzuki reaction conditions for further experimental evaluation. The derivatives showed improved inhibition of the proliferation of human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549), compared to natural noscapine. The cell cycle analysis in MCF-7 further revealed that these compounds alter the cell cycle profile and cause mitotic arrest at G2/M phase more strongly than noscapine. Tubulin binding assay revealed higher binding affinity to tubulin, as suggested by dissociation constant (K-d) of 126 +/- A 5.0 A mu M for 5a, 107 +/- A 5.0 A mu M for 5c, 70 +/- A 4.0 A mu M for 5d, and 68 +/- A 6.0 A mu M for 5e compared to noscapine (K-d of 152 +/- A 1.0 A mu M). In fact, the experimentally determined value of Delta G(bind, expt) (calculated from the K-d value) are consistent with the predicted value of Delta G(bind, pred) calculated based on LIE-SGB. Based on these results, one of the derivative 5e of this series was used for further toxicological evaluation. Treatment of mice with a daily dose of 300 mg/kg and a single dose of 600 mg/kg indicates that the compound does not induce detectable pathological abnormalities in normal tissues. Also there were no significant differences in hematological parameters between the treated and untreated groups. Hence, the newly designed noscapinoid, 5e is an orally bioavailable, safe and effective anticancer agent with a potential for the treatment of cancer and might be a candidate for clinical evaluation.

AB It has been suggested that the brain controls hand movements via internal models that rely on visual and proprioceptive cues about the state of the hand. In active inference formulations of such models, the relative influence of each modality on action and perception is determined by how precise (reliable) it is expected to be. The 'top-down' affordance of expected precision to a particular sensory modality is associated with attention. Here, we asked whether increasing attention to (i.e., the precision of) vision or proprioception would enhance performance in a hand-target phase matching task, in which visual and proprioceptive cues about hand posture were incongruent. We show that in a simple simulated agent-based on predictive coding formulations of active inference-increasing the expected precision of vision or proprioception improved task performance (target matching with the seen or felt hand, respectively) under visuo-proprioceptive conflict. Moreover, we show that this formulation captured the behaviour and self-reported attentional allocation of human participants performing the same task in a virtual reality environment. Together, our results show that selective attention can balance the impact of (conflicting) visual and proprioceptive cues on action-rendering attention a key mechanism for a flexible body representation for action.

AB In this paper, we investigate distributed inference schemes, over binary-valued Markov random fields, which are realized by the belief propagation (BP) algorithm. We first show that a decision variable obtained by the BP algorithm in a network of distributed agents can be approximated by a linear fusion of all the local log-likelihood ratios. The proposed approach clarifies how the BP algorithm works, simplifies the statistical analysis of its behavior, and enables us to develop a performance optimization framework for the BP-based distributed inference systems. Next, we propose a blind learning-adaptation scheme to optimize the system performance when there is no information available a priori describing the statistical behavior of the wireless environment concerned. In addition, we propose a blind threshold adaptation method to guarantee a certain performance level in a BP-based distributed detection system. To clarify the points discussed, we design a novel linear-BP-based distributed spectrum sensing scheme for cognitive radio networks and illustrate the performance improvement obtained, over an existing BP-based detection method, via computer simulations.

TI Effect of photodynamic therapy on the mechanical properties and bond
   strength of glass-fiber posts to endodontically treated intraradicular
   dentin
SO JOURNAL OF PROSTHETIC DENTISTRY

AB Statement of problem. The use of photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy promotes intraradicular microbial reduction during nonsurgical endodontic therapy. However, studies are lacking on the consequences of the application of these agents on the mechanical properties of intraradicular dentin and on the bond strength of glass-fiber posts.
   Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of photodynamic therapy on the bond strength of glass-fiber posts using a push-out test and, additionally, to measure the Martens hardness (MH) and elastic indentation modulus (Eit) of intraradicular dentin when different photosensitizers are used.
   Material and methods. Eighty bovine teeth were used to simulate experimental endodontic treatments. Biomechanical instrumentation was performed for all root canals, and the teeth were distributed into 5 groups: control-deionized water; methylene blue 50 mg/L + red laser; methylene blue 100 mg/L + red laser; curcumin 500 mg/L + blue LED; and curcumin 1000 mg/L + blue LED. The MH and Eit of intraradicular dentin were measured using an ultramicrohardness tester under a load of 3 mN (n=8). The push-out bond strength of glass-fiber posts to dentin was measured using a universal testing machine (n=8). Mechanical properties and bond strength data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test, ANOVA, and Fisher least significant difference test (alpha=.05). Images of representative specimens were obtained using a scanning electron microscope.
   Results. The MH, Eit, and bond strength of intraradicular dentin were influenced by the photo-sensitizer used. In general, curcumin promoted lower mechanical properties values but higher bond strength values.
   Conclusions. Photosensitizers influenced the mechanical properties of intraradicular dentin and the bond strength of glass-fiber posts, and methylene blue at 50 mg/L had no marked effect on the mechanical properties of the dentin or the bond strength values.

AB Background and Purpose-Experimental evidence supports a major role of increased intracellular calcium [Ca2+](i) levels in the induction of neuronal damage during cerebral ischemia. However, the source of Ca2+ rise has trot been fully elucidated. To clarify further the role and the origin of Ca2+ in cerebral ischemia, we have studied the effects of various pharmacological agents in an in vitro model of oxygen (O-2)/glucose deprivation.
   Methods-Pyramidal cortical neurons were intracellularly recorded from a slice preparation. Electrophysiological recordings and microfluorometric measurements of [Ca2+](i) were performed simultaneously in slices perfused with a glucose-free physiological medium equilibrated with a 95% N-2/5% CO2 gas mixture.
   Results-Eight to twelve minutes of O-2/glucose deprivation induced all initial membrane hyperpolarization, followed by a delayed, large but reversible membrane depolarization. The depolarization phase was accompanied by a transient increase in [Ca2+](i) levels. When O-2/glucose deprivation exceeded 13 to 15 minutes, both membrane depolarization and [Ca2+](i) rise became irreversible. The dihydropyridines nifedipine and nimodipine significantly reduced either the membrane depolarization or the [Ca2+](i) elevation. In contrast, tetrodotoxin had no effect on either of these parameters. Likewise, antagonists of ionotropic and group I and II metabotropic glutamate receptors failed to reduce the depolarization of the cell membrane and the [Ca2+](i) accumulation. Finally, dantrolene, blocker of intracellular Ca2+ release, did not reduce both electrical and [Ca2+](i) changes caused by O-2/glucose depletion.
   Conclusions-This work supports a role of L-type Ca2+ channels both in the electrical and ionic changes occurring during the early phases of O-2/glucose deprivation.

AB Purpose: To investigate intraocular pharmacokinetics of 10-fold dose of intravitreally injected ranibizumab compared with the conventional dose in an experimental model.
   Methods: Ranibizumab 30 mu L at 10 mg/mL (conventional) and 100 mg/mL (10-fold) doses was injected separately into each eye of 28 rabbits. Ranibizumab concentrations in the aqueous humor, vitreous, and retina were estimated at each time period after injection, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The pharmacokinetic properties of ranibizumab were determined using a one-compartment model in all three ocular tissues. The time-concentration profile and predictive trends were plotted to determine drug efficacy in the retina.
   Results: Maximum concentrations after conventional and 10-fold dosing were observed in the retina at 1 and 4 days after injection, respectively. The half-life of ranibizumab after conventional and 10-fold dosing did not differ in the anterior chamber and vitreous, whereas the half-life was prolonged approximately twice with the 10-fold dose in the retina (36.74 h vs. 76.85 h) and serum (91.93 h vs. 179.01 h). Similarly, the estimated time for ranibizumab concentration in the retina over 27 ng/mL (minimum effective concentration of ranibizumab) was prolonged approximately twice with the 10-fold dose (1315 h [55 days] vs. 2393 h [100 days]). No adverse effects were observed in either group.
   Conclusions: The retinal half-life and concentration of ranibizumab in rabbit eyes were increased approximately twice after a 10-fold dose compared with the conventional dose. This finding indicates a possibility to lengthen the injection interval to improve the efficacy of ranibizumab in human eyes.
   Translational Relevance: Our results highlight the potential for clinical application of a high-dose (10-fold) of anti-VEGF agents to prolong the intravitreal injection intervals, simultaneously improving the drug efficacy.

AB Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Glitazones or thiazolidinediones (TZD) are drugs that act as insulin-sensitizing agents whose molecular target is the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma). The euglycemic action of TZD has been linked with the induction of type 4 glucose transporter. However, it has been shown that the effect of TZD depends on the specific stereoisomer that interacts with PPAR gamma. Therefore, this work is focused on exploring the interactions and geometry adopted by glitazone's stereoisomers and one endogenous ligand on different conformations of the six crystals of the PPAR gamma protein using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations accompanied by the MMGBSA approach. Specifically, the 2,4-thiazolidinedione ring, pioglitazone (PIO), rosiglitazone (ROSI) and troglitazone (TRO) stereoisomers (exogenous ligands), as well as the endogenous ligand 15d-PGJ2, were evaluated. The six crystallographic structures of PPAR gamma are available at Protein Data Bank as the PDB entries 2PRG, 4PRG, 3T03, 1171, 1FM6, and 4EMA. According to the results, a boomerang shape and a particular location of ligands were found with low variations according to the protein conformations. The 15d-PGJ2, TZD, PIO, ROSI and (S,S)-TRO enantiomers were mostly stabilized by twenty hydrophobic residues: Phe226, Pro227, Leu228, 11e281, Phe282, Cys285, Ala292, 11e296, 11e326, Tyr327, Met329, Leu330, Leu333, Met334, Va1339, 11e341, Met348, Leu353, Phe363 and Met364. Most hydrogen bond interactions were found between the polar groups of ligands with Arg288, Ser289, Lys367, G1n286, His323, G1u343 and His449 residues. An energetic analysis revealed binding free energy trends that supported known experimental findings of other authors describing better binding properties for PIO, ROSI and (S,S)-TRO than for 15d-PGJ2 and the TZD ring.

   VARIANT
AB To assess whether Tie2-mediated vascular stabilization ameliorates neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), we investigated the impact of adeno-associated virus-mediated gene therapy with cartilage oligomeric matrix protein angiopoietin-1 (AAV2.COMP-Ang1) on choroidal neovascularization (CNV), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) in a mouse model of the disease. We treated mice with subretinal injections of AAV2.COMP-Ang1 or control (AAV2.AcGFP, AAV2.LacZ, and phosphate-buffered saline). Subretinal AAV2 localization and plasmid protein expression was verified in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid of mice treated with all AAV2 constructs. Laser-assisted simulation of neovascular AMD was performed and followed by quantification of HIF, VEGF, and CNV in each experimental group. We found that AAV2.COMP-Ang1 was associated with a significant reduction in VEGF levels (29-33%, p < 0.01) and CNV volume (60-70%, p < 0.01), without a concomitant decrease in HIF1-alpha, compared to all controls. We concluded that a) AAV2 is a viable vector for delivering COMP-Ang1 to subretinal tissues, b) subretinal COMP-Ang1 holds promise as a prospective treatment for neovascular AMD, and c) although VEGF suppression in the RPE/choroid may be one mechanism by which AAV2.COMP-Ang1 reduces CNV, this therapeutic effect may be hypoxia-independent. Taken together, these findings suggest that AAV2.COMP-Ang1 has potential to serve as an alternative or complementary option to anti-VEGF agents for the long-term amelioration of neovascular AMD.

AB Recent microcosm studies have revealed that fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics can have ecotoxicological impacts on photosynthetic organisms, but little is known about the mechanisms of toxicity. We employed a combination of modeling and experimental techniques to explore how FQs may have these unintended secondary toxic effects. Structure-activity analysis revealed that the quinolone ring and secondary amino group typically present in FQ antibiotics may mediate their action as quinone site inhibitors in photosystem II (PS-II), a key enzyme in photosynthetic electron transport. Follow-up molecular simulations involving nalidixic acid (Naldx), a nonfluorinated quinolone with a demonstrated adverse impact on photosynthesis, and ciprofloxacin (Cipro), the most commonly used FQ. antibiotic, showed that both may interfere stereochemically with the catalytic activity of reaction center II (RC-II), the pheophytin-quinone-type center present in PS-II. Naldx can occupy the same binding site as the secondary quinone acceptor (Q(B)) in RC-II and interact with amino acid residues required for the enzymatic reduction of Q(B). Cipro binds in a somewhat different manner, suggesting a different mechanism of interference. Fluorescence induction kinetics, a common method of screening for PS-II inhibition, recorded for photoexcited thylakoid membranes isolated from Cipro-exposed spinach chloroplasts, indicated that Cipro interferes with the transfer of energy from excited antenna chlorophyll molecules to the reaction center in RC-II ([Cipro] >= 5 mu M in vitro and >= 10 mu M in vivo) and thus delays the kinetics of photoreduction of the primary quinone acceptor (Q(A); [Cipro] >= 0.6 mu M in vitro). Spinach plants exposed to Cipro exhibited severe growth inhibition characterized by a decrease in both the synthesis of leaves and growth of the roots ([Cipro] >= 0.5 mu M in vivo). Our results thus demonstrate that Cipro and related FQ antibiotics may interfere with photosynthetic pathways, in addition to causing morphological deformities in higher plants.

AB One of the categories of drugs most frequently used by the elderly, and probably the most commonly self-prescribed class of drug in this age group, is NSAIDs. However, NSAIDs are one of the primary causes of adverse drug reactions and are notorious for their gastric toxicity. They also inhibit renal function and reduce the efficacy of diuretics and ACE inhibitors, drugs that are commonly used by elderly patients.
   Recent studies have shown that cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 is important in renal physiology. This means that selective COX-2 inhibitors, while undoubtedly safer than NSAIDs in terms of gastric toxicity, are not devoid of renal toxicity (in addition to their now clearly established adverse effects on coronary heart disease risk). Both the gastric and renal toxicities induced by traditional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors seem to be related to inhibition of prostaglandin, but not leukotriene, synthesis. Maintaining the correct balance between prostaglandins and leukotrienes is essential for continuing good health, but both classes of mediators also play an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases.
   Recently, a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs, the lipoxygenase (LOX)/COX inhibitors, has been developed as a means of simultaneously inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. Inhibition of leukotriene synthesis increases anti-inflammatory efficacy, particularly in rheumatic diseases, while reducing the risk of gastric damage. The LOX/COX inhibitor licofelone, which is currently in phase III trials, is the first of this new class and in the most advanced stage of development. Preliminary data with this drug seem promising, but further well designed clinical trials of this agent in the elderly will be necessary before a final evaluation is possible.

AB The price dynamics of energy futures market is important factor affecting the global economy. This paper introduces a novel stochastic interacting energy futures price model to simulate price dynamics mechanism of energy futures market, where the two-dimension stochastic interacting epidemic system and random jump process are used to describe the most common and small price changes from interaction mechanism and the extreme and large changes from some external environments, respectively. Then, two statistics - daily logarithmic return and volatility duration average intensity (VDAI) are used to study the price fluctuation and volatility dynamics of the proposed model. In order to validate the rationality of the energy futures price model, the return series and VDAI series of the simulation data are investigated by some statistical analysis methods and complexity methods, which are compared with those of three important crude oil futures. The empirical results show that the proposed model can reproduce the price fluctuation and volatility dynamics of real crude oil futures market in terms of some statistical properties and complexity behaviors.

AB RNA polymerase II catalyzes the nucleotidyl transfer reaction for messenger RNA synthesis in eukaryotes. Two crystal structures of this system have been resolved, each with its own defects in the coordination sphere of Mg2+(A) resulting from chemical modifications. We have used both structures and also a novel hybrid of the two that allows a better exploration of the parts of configuration space that reflect substrate-enzyme interactions. MD and QM/MM calculations have been performed, the latter with the semiempirical AM1/d-PhoT method, calibrated against density functional theory. Reaction path scans in 1-D provided insights about the role of Mg2+ (A) which turns out to be more structural than catalytic. In contrast, 1-D scans of the incorporation of the nucleotidyl group yielded barriers that were much too high, necessitating the use of 2-D reaction coordinates. Three different proton acceptors for the initial reaction step were examined. For those models based on the two PDB structures the 2-D scans continued to yield very high barriers, indicating that the reaction is unlikely to proceed from these configurations. On the other hand, two hybrid models, chosen from the early and late parts of a 12ns molecular dynamics simulation yielded greatly reduced barriers in the range of approximate to 17 to approximate to 27 kcal/mol for the three proton acceptors, as compared to the experimental estimate of 18 kcal/mol. The final step, release of pyrophosphate, was found to be facile. Our overall mechanism involves only active site residues or water without the need for external reactive agents such as the hydroxide ion previously proposed. Proteins 2015; 83:268-281.

AB Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, celecoxib, and etoricoxib are reported to act as chemopreventive agents in experimental colon cancer induced by 1,2- dimethylhydrazine (DMH) as they are known cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme inhibitors. To determine whether NSAIDs can also effectively modulate the membrane lipid compositions and the fluidity parameters of colonic brush border membrane, rats were injected subcutaneously (s. c.) with DMH 30 mg/kg body weight per week for 6 weeks. The animals were simultaneously treated with NSAIDs orally at the dose of aspirin, 60 mg/kg body weight; celecoxib, 6 mg/kg body weight; and etoricoxib, 0.6 mg/kg body weight. The animals were sacrificed after 6 weeks of treatments. Brush border membrane was isolated from proximal and distal portions of the colon. Membrane lipids were extracted and analyzed while the fluidity parameters were assessed by steady-state fluorescence polarization technique using the membrane extrinsic fluorophore 1,6- diphenyl-1,3,5- hexatriene (DPH). The translational diffusion was measured by using the excimer formation of pyrene incorporated in the membrane. Colonic mucosal changes in DMH alone and DMH + NSAID treated animals were assessed histologically. The results demonstrate that (a) there is a distinct occurrence of premalignant alterations in DMH-induced colon in the form of multiple plaque lesions (MPLs), which were greatly reduced by the NSAIDs used, (b) the membrane lipid changes in DMH- induced colon were completely restored back, (c) the alterations in membrane fluorescence polarization and the fluidity parameters are partially recovered, particularly with etoricoxib, and (d) the pyrene excimer formation process was completely restored. It may be concluded that the NSAIDs, particularly the coxib group of the drugs (COX- 2 selective), are effective in chemoprevention in the DMH- induced colon carcinogenesis and membrane alterations.

AB Fatty foods, the most common diet today are the crux of many metabolic disorders which need urgent attention. Garcinia pedunculata Roxb. (GP, Clusiaceae) is a plant found available in Northeast (NE) region of India, is considered to have versatile therapeutic properties. The people of this region has been using dried pulp of GP fruit for the treatment of different stomach related diseases traditionally. This study aimed at evaluating the potential therapeutic action of the polyphenol-rich methanolic extract of the fruit in experimental induced obese rats. In vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic activity of GP extracts, i.e., fruit extract (GF) and seed extract (GS) were determined by using various methods viz., 1,1-dipheny1-2 picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-Azinobis (3-ethyl benzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS(center dot+)), nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) and a-glucosidase inhibition assay for detection of antihyperglycemic activity. In vivo antilipidemic and antiobesity activities were evaluated by administrating oral dose of GF for 60 days on a high-fat diet (HFD) induced hyperlipidemia in the rat. GF showed higher antioxidant activity than GS by DPPH radical scavenging (IC50 = 4.01 mu g/ml), ABTS(center dot+)(IC50 = 0.82 mu g/ml), NBT (IC50 = 0.07 mu g/ml) and also showed notable alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50 = 19.26 mu g/ml). Furthermore, GF treated rat revealed a reduction in the body weight (similar to 60%), serum total cholesterol (33%), triglycerides (32%), low-density lipoprotein (38%) and liver biomarker enzymes after 60 days HFD fed animals. Simultaneously, GF supplementation significantly protected the HFD induced changes in hematological parameters. Histological observations clearly differentiate the structural changes in liver of HFD and GF treated group. This novel dietary lipid adsorbing agent of GF exhibited prevention of hyperlipidemia induced by HFD in the rat.

AB We present a two-dimensional (2D) lattice model based on the exclusion principle and Arrhenius microscopic dynamics to study bi-direction pedestrian flows. This model implements stochastic rules for pedestrians' movements based on the configuration of the surrounding conditions of each pedestrian, pedestrian-pedestrian interactions, and their walking preference. Our rules simplify tactically the decision-making process of pedestrians in their movements and can effectively reflect the behaviors of pedestrians at the microscale while attaining realistic emergent macroscale activity. Our computational approach is an agent-based method, which uses an efficient list-based kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm to evolve the pedestrian system. The simulations focus on two aspects: different directional splits of the pedestrians and different strengths of walking preference for the right-hand side. Both results exhibit a phase transition from freely flowing to fully jammed, as a function of initial density of pedestrians. At different phases the relationships of density-flow and density-velocity are different from each other. The KMC simulations show some pedestrian flow self organization phenomena including lane formation phases and reflect transition trends of the corresponding empirical data from real traffic.

AB The high proportion of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria makes it a highly effective barrier to small molecules, antibiotic drugs, and other antimicrobial agents. Given this vital role in protecting bacteria from potentially hostile environments, simulations of LPS bilayers and outer membrane systems represent a critical tool for understanding the mechanisms of bacterial resistance and the development of new antibiotic compounds that circumvent these defenses. The basis of these simulations is parameterizations of LPS, which have been developed for all major molecular dynamics force fields. However, these parameterizations differ in both the protonation state of LPS and how LPS membranes behave in the presence of various ion species. To address these discrepancies and understand the effects of phosphate charge on bilayer properties, simulations were performed for multiple distinct LPS chemotypes with different ion parameterizations in both protonated or deprotonated lipid A states. These simulations show that bilayer properties, such as the area per lipid and inter-lipid hydrogen bonding, are highly influenced by the choice of phosphate group charges, cation type, and ion parameterization, with protonated LPS and monovalent cations with modified nonbonded parameters providing the best match to the experiments. Additionally, alchemical free energy simulations were performed to determine theoretical pK(a) values for LPS and subsequently validated by P-31 solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance experiments. Results from these complementary computational and experimental studies demonstrate that the protonated state dominates at physiological pH, contrary to the deprotonated form modeled by many LPS force fields. Overall, these results highlight the sensitivity of LPS simulations to phosphate charge and ion parameters while offering recommendations for how existing models should be updated for consistency between force fields as well as to best match experiments.

AB Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, and no disease-modifying therapy is yet available for this devastating pathology. Deposition of different physicochemical forms of amyloid-beta peptides is a critical phase in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. beta-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) is a major enzyme responsible for amyloid-beta production; therefore, inhibition of this enzyme represents a promising approach for the discovery of amyloid-beta-lowering agents. In this study, a series of novel 2,6-dialkyl-4-chromon-3-yl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylates (14-23) were synthesized and assessed as BACE-1 inhibitors using the Forster resonance energy transfer-based enzyme assay. Synthesized dihydropyridines exhibited weak-to-relatively-good BACE-1 inhibitory activities. Enzyme inhibitory activities ranged from 6.84 +/- A 6.62 (23) to 51.32 +/- A 1.04 (14) percent enzyme inhibitions at the concentration of 10 mu M. The structure-activity relationship study showed that the presence of 4-[7-(ethanoyloxy)-4-oxo-4H-chromen-3-yl] moiety at C4 position of dihydropyridine ring (14, 16 and 18) confers higher activity compared with other substitutions at this position. Docking simulation predicted a key H-bond interaction between Asp32 residue and dihydropyridine NH group. Moreover, all docked dihydropyridines made good hydrophobic contacts with S1 and S2 subpockets of BACE-1. A good correlation between estimated binding affinities (pK(i)) and experimental BACE-1 inhibitory activities at 10 mu M was obtained (R (2) = 0.639). The findings of this study suggested that 2,6-dialkyl-4-chromon-3-yl-1,4-dihydropyridine-3,5-dicarboxylates could be promising scaffolds for the discovery of novel BACE-1 inhibitors for management of Alzheimer's disease.

AB Background: Dysfunction of the microcirculation is a prominent feature of sepsis and endotoxemia. Recently, it has been shown that microcirculatory alterations are completely reversed by local or systemic application of vasodilators in severely septic patients. Therefore, we investigated the influence of vasodilator therapy on microcirculatory dysfunction of the ileum during endotoxic shock in a prospective, controlled animal study.
   Methods: After baseline measurements, shock was induced in 12 domestic pigs by lipopolysaccharide via the mesenteric vein until the mean arterial pressure fell below 60 mmHg. After 30 min in shock, six animals were resuscitated with either fluid alone (control) or fluid and 2 mu g/kg/min of the vasodilator 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1). The systemic and regional hemodynamics and oxygenation parameters, tonometric ileal Pco(2) and microvascular oxygen pressures (mu Po-2) (by oxygen-dependent Pd-porphyrin phosphorescence) were measured simultaneously.
   Results: The ileal-arterial Pco(2) gap increased during shock and the ileal mucosal and serosal mu Po-2 decreased concurrently. SIN-1 in addition to fluid resuscitation significantly improved the ileal-arterial Pco(2) gap, whereas fluid alone failed to decrease the Pco(2) gap. The SIN-1-induced improvement in the Pco(2) gap was accompanied by an increase in serosal mu Po-2 above shock levels. Mucosal mu Po-2 was resuscitated to baseline levels in both groups.
   Conclusion: The application of the vasodilator SIN-1 in addition to fluid resuscitation improves the ileal-arterial Pco(2) gap and mucosal mu Po-2, together with a moderate increase in serosal mu Po-2, after endotoxic shock. This finding is consistent with the concept that vasodilators may correct pathologic flow distribution within the intestinal wall.

AB The radical chemistry and cytotoxicity of a series of quinoxaline di-N-oxide (QDO) compounds has been investigated to explore the mechanism of action of this class of bioreductive drugs. A series of water-soluble 3-trifluoromethyl (4-10), 3-phenyl (11-19), and 3-methyl (20-21) substituted QDO compounds were designed to span a range of electron affinities consistent with bioreduction. The stoichiometry of loss of QDOs by steady-state radiolysis of anaerobic aqueous formate buffer indicated that one-electron reduction of QDOs generates radicals able to initiate chain reactions by oxidation of formate. The 3-trifluoromethyl analogues exhibited long chain reactions consistent with the release of the HO center dot, as identified in EPR spin trapping experiments. Several carbon-centered radical intermediates, produced by anaerobic incubation of the QDO compounds with N-terminal truncated cytochrome P450 reductase (POR), were characterized using N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone (PBN) and 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-l-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) spin traps and were observed by EPR. Experimental data were well simulated for the production of strongly oxidizing radicals, capable of H atom abstraction from methyl groups. The kinetics of formation and decay of the radicals produced following one-electron reduction of the parent compounds, both in oxic and anoxic solutions, were determined using pulse radiolysis. Back oxidation of the initially formed radical anions by molecular oxygen did not compete effectively with the breakdown of the radical anions to form oxidizing radicals. The QDO compounds displayed low hypoxic selectivity when tested against oxic and hypoxic cancer cell lines in vitro. The results from this study form a kinetic description and explanation of the low hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity of QDOs against cancer cells compared to the related benzotriazine 1,4-dioxide (BTO) class of compounds.

AB Farnesyltransferase (FTase) catalyzes the transfer of farnesyl front farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to cysteine residues at or near the C-terminus of protein acceptors with a CaaX motif (a, aliphatic, X, Met). Farnesylation is a critical modification to many switch proteins involved ill the extracellular signal transduction pathway, which facilitates their fixation on the cell membrane where the extracellular signal is processed. The malfunction caused by mutations in these proteins often Causes uncontrolled cell reproduction and leads to tumor formation. FTase inhibitors have been extensively Studied as potential anticancer agents in recent years, several of which have advanced to different phases of clinical trials. However, the mechanism of this biologically important enzyme has not been firmly established. Understanding how FTase recruits the FPP substrate is the first and foremost step toward further mechanistic investigations and the design of effective FTase inhibitors. Molecular dynamic simulations were carried out on the tertiary structure of FTase complexed with the FPP Substrate and an acetyl-capped tetrapeptide (acetyl-CVIM), which revealed that the FPP Substrate maintains all inactive conformation and the binding of the diphosphate group call be largely attributed to residues R291 beta, K164 alpha, K294 beta, and H248 beta. The FPP Substrate assumes an extended conformation in the binding site with restricted rotation of the backbone dihedral angles; however, it does not have a well-defined conformation When unbound in Solution. This is evident from multinanosecond MID simulations of the FPP substrate in a vacuum and Solution. Our conclusion is further Supported by theoretical J Coupling calculations. Our results oil the FPP binding are in good agreement with previous experimental kinetic Studies on FTase Mutants. The hypothetical conformational activation of the FPP Substrate is currently under investigation.

AB In the context of a medium-term study designed to integrate the simulation of different types and processes of learning-such as classical, operant, and some cognitive types-one must start with other more elementary ones that are facilitators of the more complex types and processes. Of special interest is habituation, owing to the filtering out of irrelevant stimuli, which means that the simulated agent does not have to respond to them. This paper presents two difference functions constructed to computationally simulate the characteristics that define habituation. The behavior of these functions is described, as are differences arising from stimulus intensity and interstimulus intervals. Results are compared with existing empirical data.

AB Fixed strategy models, in which agents are endowed with a behavioral strategy as a primitive of the economy, are widely used in distributed systems where interaction is governed by local effects. We introduce a methodology for analyzing such models using partial differential equation systems. This method is developed in detail and applied to an extended economic example, the demographic prisoner's dilemma. We show using this methodology that both analytical and numerical results may be obtained for the long-run dynamics of the stochastic system. The method thus complements existing simulation techniques for analyzing the long-run behavior of stochastic fixed strategy distributed systems. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FORM GAMES
AB The paper applies the approach of reinforcement learning to Arthur's [American Economic Review 84 (1994a) 406] El Farol problem, where repeatedly a population of agents decides to go to a bar or stay home, and going is enjoyable if, and only if, the bar is not crowded. The numerical simulations show that the learning process is fairly efficient in that attendances tend to fluctuate around the bar's capacity. On the other hand, the shape of the long-run equilibrium frequency distribution is usually quite distinct from the Nash equilibrium solutions and furthermore rather sensitive to some of the model's specification details.

AB This paper investigates Euler equations involving security prices and household-level consumption data. It provides a useful complement to many existing studies of consumption-based asset pricing models that use a representative-agent framework, because the Euler equations under investigation hold even if markets are incomplete. It also provides a useful complement to simulation-based studies of market incompleteness. The empirical evidence indicates that the theory is rejected by the data along several dimensions. The results therefore indicate that some well-documented asset-pricing puzzles do not result from aggregation problems for the preferences under investigation.

AB This paper presents a simple macro-econometric simultaneous equation model for the Russian economy. The consumption function is based on Friedman's permanent income hypothesis. We assume that permanent income is estimated by households based on aggregate income dynamics using adaptive expectations. The paper compares two permanent income model specifications whereby either GDP or disposable income serves as the aggregate income variable. The specification based on the hypothesis where households consume a constant share of permanent GDP in constant consumer prices proved to be the best. The superior explanatory potential of this model when compared with alternative specifications supports the hypothesis that the behaviour of economic agents in the Russian economy considers Ricardian equivalence.

AB Trust is a key dimension in the principal-agent relationship and it has been studied extensively. However, the dynamics, evolution, and intrinsic motivation and mechanisms have received less attention. This paper investigates the intrinsic motivation of trust and it proposes a theoretical model of trust evolution that is based on the notion of trust response' and trust spiral'. We then specifically focus on trust within the lending relationship between banks and small businesses, and we run numerical simulations to further illustrate the evolution of involved mutual trust over time. Our model provides implications for future research in both trust evolution and small business lending relationships.

AB A range of different value systems have been proposed for self-motivated agents, including biologically and cognitively inspired approaches. Likewise, these value systems have been integrated with different behavioral systems including reflexive architectures, reward-based learning and supervised learning. However, there is little literature comparing the performance of different value systems for motivating exploration and learning by robots. This paper proposes a neural network architecture for integrating different value systems with reinforcement learning. It then presents an empirical evaluation and comparison of four value systems for motivating exploration by a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot. Results reveal the different exploratory properties of novelty-seeking motivation, interest and competence-seeking motivation.

AB Objectives: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of naltrexone for relapse prevention in detoxified formerly opioid-dependent individuals compared with any strategy that does not use naltrexone, including treatment with placebo, other pharmacological treatments, psychosocial interventions or no treatment.
   Data sources: Major electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2005.
   Review methods: Selected studies were screened and quality assessed. Meta-analyses were carried out as appropriate. A decision-analytic model using Monte Carlo simulation was developed that compared naltrexone as an adjunctive therapy to no naltrexone. It assumed compliance rates that were not enhanced by contingent management rewards (because this is current UK practice). Utility values could not be identified from the literature and so were obtained by research specially commissioned from the Value of Health Panel.
   Results: The methodological quality of the 26 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that met the inclusion criteria was poor to moderate. The results suggest that naltrexone as maintenance therapy may be better than placebo in terms of retention in treatment, but this was not statistically significant. A meta-analysis of seven included RCTs gave the relative risk (RR) of loss of retention in treatment in the naltrexone arm as 0.94. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) reported in five of the RCTs for retention in treatment data followed up to 35 weeks was calculated as 0.90 in favour of naltrexone and also did not reach statistical significance. The risk of drug abuse in naltrexone versus placebo, with or without psychological support given in both arms, gave a pooled RR of 0.72, which was a statistically significant difference in favour of naltrexone. The pooled HR from three RCTs for opioid relapse-free rates was significantly different from placebo in favour of naltrexone 0.53; however, this fell off over time and may be of limited clinical significance. The RR of reimprisonment while on naltrexone therapy showed results in favour of naltrexone in the combined two studies of parolees or people on probation, but the number of participants was small. One study of 52 participants found that the difference in improvement score for risky sexual behaviour in the naltrexone group compared with the placebo group was not statistically significant. The adverse events data reported showed no significant difference between the naltrexone and placebo arms. The quality of the nine RCTs of interventions designed to increase retention with naltrexone was poor to moderate; however, all three different modalities of enhanced care showed some evidence of effectiveness. All of the contingency management programmes used incentive vouchers; the mean duration of treatment retention was 7.4 weeks for the contingency management intervention compared with 2.3-5.6 weeks for the naltrexone treatment alone. The mean length of time for which patients stayed on naltrexone was 84-103 days with additional psychosocial therapy compared with 43-64 days for the control group. In trials with added pharmacological agents the RRs of stopping treatment were 1.63 at 6 months and 1.31 at 12 months (in favour of naltrexone plus fluoxetine). It became statistically significant at 6 months, but not at 12 months. A meta-analysis of the RR of stopping treatment at week 12 (the minimum follow-up period) was carried out using six of the nine studies. The pooled RR of stopping treatment was 0.81. The results indicated that overall the intervention groups had 19% fewer patients who stopped treatment compared with the control group, but there was only a small number of studies and their quality was relatively poor. No existing economic evaluations were identified. The point estimate for the cost-effectiveness of naltrexone was 42,500 pound per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Sensitivity analysis was carried out and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio varied between 34,600 pound and 42,500 pound per QALY gained.
   Conclusions: Following successful withdrawal from opioids, naltrexone may be administered on a chronic basis to block any future effects of opioids. Naltrexone appears to have some limited benefit in helping formerly opioid-dependent individuals to remain abstinent, although the quality of the evidence is relatively poor and heterogeneous. The limited quality and extent of the studies precluded an analysis of subgroups likely to benefit from naltrexone prescribing. Oral naltrexone is used infrequently in current UK practice, and this review suggests that this is appropriate as there is little evidence to support its wider implementation. There is an important deficit in information about the quality of life of people who use illicit opioids and this would perhaps be a worthwhile area of research in informing policy questions about the cost-effectiveness of different programmes and interventions.

AB We propose a minority route choice game to investigate the effect of the network structure on traffic network performance under the assumption of drivers' bounded rationality. We investigate ring-and-hub topologies which capture the nature of traffic networks in cities, and employ a minority game-based inductive learning process to model the characteristic behavior under the route choice scenario. Through numerical experiments, we find that topological changes in traffic networks can induce a phase transition from an uncongested phase to a congested one. Understanding this phase transition is helpful in planning new traffic networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The extraction process of the non-toxic simulants has been monitored by means of spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques. The kinetics of the removal process was analyzed by different empirical models. Based on the analysis of the kinetics, we can assess the influence of the amounts of oil and water and the microemulsion structure on the extraction process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB Motion camouflage is a stealth behaviour observed both in hover-flies and in dragonflies. Existing controllers for mimicking motion camouflage generate this behaviour on an empirical basis or without considering the kinematic motion restrictions present in animal trajectories. This study summarises our formal contributions to solve the generation of motion camouflage as a non-linear optimal control problem. The dynamics of the system capture the kinematic restrictions to motion of the agents, while the performance index ensures camouflage trajectories. An extensive set of simulations support the technique, and a novel analysis of the obtained trajectories contributes to our understanding of possible mechanisms to obtain sensor based motion camouflage, for instance, in mobile robots.

AB RATIONALE: The study of self-assembly processes of surfactant molecules in the gas phase is of great interest for several theoretical and technological reasons related to their possible exploitation as drug carriers, protein shields and cleaning agents in the gas phase.
   METHODS: The stability and fragmentation patterns of singly and multiply charged (either positively or negatively) aggregates of the surfactant (1R, 2S)-dodecyl(2-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)dimethyl ammonium bromide (DMEB) in the gas phase have been studied by ion mobility mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of positively and negatively singly and multiply charged DMEB aggregates have been performed to obtain structural and energetics information. Finally, in order to ascertain some clues on the DMEB growth mechanism, quantum mechanics calculations were carried out.
   RESULTS: It has been evidenced that positively and negatively singly charged aggregates at low collision energy decompose preferentially by loss of only one DMEB molecule. Increasing the collision energy, the loss of neutrals becomes increasingly abundant. Multiply charged DMEB aggregates are unstable and decompose forming singly charged monomers or dimers. MD simulations show reverse micelle-like structures with polar heads somewhat segregated into the aggregate interior. Finally, a good correlation between experimental and calculated collisional cross sections (CCS) was found.
   CONCLUSIONS: The fragmentation pathways of DMEB charged species evidenced for singly charged aggregates exhibit features similar to that of other detergent aggregates, but multiply charged aggregates showed a system-specific behavior. QM calculations on the optimized structures (2(1+), 3(1+), 1(1-) and 2(1-)) indicate that the most determinant interactions are due to an OH---Br hydrogen bonding that is also involved in the link between monomeric DMEB units. The MD models gave CCS values in good agreement with experimental ones, evidenced by a less strict reverse micelle-like structure and a reasonably spread bromine anion distribution.

AB Objective: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs. For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms.
   Methods: According to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen. or 800 mg ibuprofen. Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml s(-1)). Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli. Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales.
   Results: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but - relative to placebo - an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these spacial experimental conditions. Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery. By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID. The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.

AB This work analyzes the relationship between hydrogen permeation behavior and palladium layer morphology, particularly taking into account the palladium introduction into the pores for composite membranes prepared by Electroless Pore-Plating (ELP-PP) over porous stainless steel supports. Fully dense membranes have been achieved with hydrogen permeances in the range 7-18.10(-5) mol/m(2) s Pa-0.5 by varying the hydrazine concentration used for the palladium plating. Permeation measurements for pure gases and mixtures have been carried out at different conditions: pressure driving force, temperature and feed composition. Both morphology and permeation properties are clearly influenced by the concentration of hydrazine, used as reducing agent during the ELP-PP process. In this manner, higher hydrazine concentrations provoke the formation of thicker external palladium films and, consequently, the reduction of both external porosity and roughness. On the other side, lower hydrazine concentrations reduce the required amount of palladium to obtain a fully dense membrane. In the last case, however, part of palladium is introduced into the pores of the support in a huger extension. This fact, in turns, generates an additional hydrogen permeation resistance, which diminishes the permeation flux and introduces a threshold in the minimum trans-membrane pressure value required for a hydrogen permeate flux. A new mathematical model, based on the classical Sieverts' law, is proposed to predict this particular behavior by including a new fitting parameter defined as the ratio of the gas-palladium surface in both retentate and permeate sides of the membrane. This new parameter has been denoted as eta, achieving good accuracy between both predicted and experimental data when considering the gap in the trans-membrane pressure. Therefore, the presented model can be used in multiple cases to design and optimize membranes modules, whereas the retentate and permeate gas-palladium surface ratio will be different, as for instance in case of palladium is introduced partially into the pores of supports.

AB Background: The pharmacodynamic characteristics of antibiotics should be considered when choosing empiric dosage regimens for the treatment of pneumonia.
   Objective: This study compared the probabilities of achieving requisite pharmacodynamic exposure (ie, f T > MIC, AUC/MIC) for antibiotics given for the empiric treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) as recommended by the 2005 guidelines of the American Thoracic Society and the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
   Methods: In a 5000-patient Monte Carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic analyses were performed for standard doses of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Prolonged 3-hour infusion regimens were also evaluated for anti-pseudomonal beta-lactams. MIC data were incorporated from the 2007 Meropenem Yearly Susceptibility Test Information Collection, a national surveillance study. The weighted cumulative fraction of response (wCFR) against common pneumonia pathogens was determined for each regimen. A second scenario was conducted by altering the pathogen prevalence to assess wCFR for late-onset pneumonia (le, HAP in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation). Optimal wCFR was defined a priori as >= 90%.
   Results: Among the 0.5-hour infusions, cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem had the highest wCFRs (>= 90%) against pathogens that cause HAP (cefepime, 1 g q8h, 92.8%; 2 g q8h, 97.2%; 2 g q12h, 94.3%; ceftazidime, 2 g q8h, 93.2%; meropenem, 1 g q8h, 90.9%; 2 g q8h, 93.9%). Imipenem (500 mg q6h, 85.5%; 1 g q8h, 88.1%) and piperacillin/tazobactam (4.5 g q6h, 80.5%) as 0.5-hour infusions were nearly optimal, whereas ceftriaxone, ertapenem, and the fluoroquinolones had the lowest wCFR values. All regimens howed lower wCFRs for late-onset pneumonia than for HAP. Optimal wCFRs were found only with prolonged (3-hour) infusions of 2 g q8h for ceftazidime (94.5%) and meropenem (90.1%), whereas cefepime 2 g q8h achieved optimal wCFR with both a 0.5-hour infusion (93.1%) and a 3-hour infusion (95.3%).
   Conclusions: Results of this model suggest that standard doses of most antipseudomonal beta-lactams (cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem) had high probabilities of achieving optimal pharmacodynamic exposure as empiric therapy for HAP, whereas the low probabilities predicted from ceftriaxone, ertapenem, and the fluoroquinolones suggest that these agents would be inappropriate as monotherapy. For late-onset HAP, prolonged infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, and meropenem offered the highest probabilities of achieving bactericidal exposure.

AB Geometry optimizations and energy calculations have been carried out via molecular orbital methods at the density functional B3LYP/LANL2DZ level on the molecules PO3-, OPO33-, HOPO32-, CH3OPO32-, H(CH3OPO3)(-), O(PO3)(2)(4-), HO(PO3)(2)(3-), CH2(PO3)(2)(4-), (CH3OPO2)O(PO3)(3-) O(PO3)(3)(5-), HO(PO3)(3)(4-), (PO3)(3)(3-), (CH3OPO2)O(PO3)(2)(4-) [Mg{O(PO3)(2)} ](2-), [Ca{O(PO3)(2)}](2-), [Ca{CH2(PO3)(2)}](2-), [Ca{CH3OPO2}O(PO3)}](-), [Ca(PO3)(3)](-), [Ca{O(PO3)(3)}](3-), and [Ca{CH3OPO2)O(PO3)(2)}](2-) with the aim to find reliable and easily accessible computational methods to simulate some phosphate-containing molecules of importance for the living cells and to study the energetics for protonation and metal-complex formation reactions. The analysis is part of a general investigation on phosphate-containing molecules as potential dissolving agents for calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals which deposit in certain articular diseases. The basis set was expanded to 6-31G** for the P atoms for all the molecules investigated and to 6-31G* for the O atoms for OPO33-. Calculations at the semi-empirical MNDO/d level were also carried out for comparison purposes on the free ligand molecules and on [Mg{O(PO3)(2)}](2-). The density functional analysis reproduced well the geometry found at the solid state via X-ray diffraction. The analyses of the geometrical parameters and the total electronic energy of the molecules shows that O(PO3)(2)(4-) and other di- and tri-phosphates are versatile ligands for divalent metal ions like Ca2+. The computed P-O-P bond angle for free O(PO3)(2)(4-) is 180 degrees and the conformation of the two PO3- groupings is staggered along the P P vector. The linear arrangement for P-O-P is assisted by P-O pi interactions. The bending of the P-O-P angle when accompanied by a slight P-O(b) elongation requires a very small amount of energy; 4.65 kcal/mol to pass from 180 to 140 degrees, as calculated at the DFT level.
   The computed Ca-O and Mg-O bond distances for [M{O(PO3)(2)}](2-) are 2.378 and 2.079 Angstrom, when the metal ions link two oxygen atoms from each PO3 group. The computed Ca-O bond lengths for [Ca{CH3OPO2)O(PO3)}](-) are 2.482 (PalphaO2) and 2.358 Angstrom (PbetaO2), showing a significant lengthening for Ca-OPalpha, when compared to the pyrophosphate derivative. The Ca-O bond lengths for [Ca{O(PO3)(3)}](3-) and [Ca{CH3OPO2(PO3)(2)}](2-) are 2.251 Angstrom and 2.525 (PalphaO2), 2.407 and 2.338 (PbetaO2), and 2.251 and 2.228 Angstrom (PgammaO2), showing a shortening for the Ca-OP gamma bond upon methylation. The (P-beta)O-P-gamma bond length increases significantly (0,09 Angstrom) upon Ca.(II) coordination to (CH3OPO2)O(PO3)(2)(4-) via all the three PO3 groups. This latter result suggests that metal complexes of linear organic-triphosphates have a larger tendency to release the P gamma O-3, group when compared to the free ligand molecules. The electronic contribution to the energy of the complex formation reaction for [Ca{CH2(PO3)(2)}](2-) is only slightly higher (some 1.8 kcal) than that for [Ca{O(PO3)(2)}](2-); but is much higher (some 63 kcal) than that relevant to the formation of [Ca{CH3OPO2)O(PO3)(2)}](2-). Therefore the linear methyltriphosphates (and reasonably nucleoside triphosphates) are predicted to form metal complexes which are less stable than diphosphonate or inorganic diphosphate ligands, at least in the case the organic moiety does not have any appreciable coordination ability toward the metal. The energy of complex formation for [Ca{O(PO3)(3)}](3-) is much higher than that for [Ca{O(PO3)(2)}](2-) and [Ca(PO3)(3)}](-) (some 116 and 345 kcal, respectively). This is in part a rationale for the high dissolving ability (DA) toward CPPD crystals, shown by solutions of pentasodium tripolyphosphate. DA values of 65.4+/-3.0 mu g Ca/mL were detected, via atomic absorption spectroscopy, in solutions of Na-5{O(PO3)(3)} 0.06 M after digestion (1.00 h, 37 degrees C, pH 7.4) in the presence of CPPD crystals. Efficient non-toxic dissolving agents for CPPD crystals are needed to cure chondrocalcinosis desease. The semi-empirical computations gave correct overall optimized structures and conformations for, at least, the free not-substituted ligands and the relevant Mg(II)-complexes. The optimized structure for [Mg(O(PO3)(2)}](2-) has computed P-O(t) and P-O(d) bond distances of 1.503 and 1.598 Angstrom, in perfect agreement with the results from DFT calculations.

AB Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and early coronary thrombolysis are now widely used to treat selected patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction, respectively. However. the efficacy of these procedures may be limited by the occurrence of thrombotic complications. Restenosis of the dilated vessel, which occurs in about 30% of the patients, is considered the Achilles' heel of PTCA. Experimental and clinical data suggest that restenosis after PTCA may be mediated by platelet attachment at the site of balloon dilation, with a consequent release of platelet-derived mitogen factors able to stimulate intimal hyperplasia. Similarly, a thrombotic reocclusion of the infarct-related coronary artery may significantly reduce the potential benefits of early thrombolysis. This reocclusion occurs in up to 30-35% of the patients successfully reperfused after suspension of the thrombolytic agent, despite the concomitant use of heparin. Increasing evidence indicates that intracoronary platelet activation and aggregation play a major role in the pathophysiology of reocclusion. First, it has been demonstrated that a marked increase in thromboxane A2 production occurs at the moment of reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing successful thrombolysis. Second, in experimental models of coronary thrombosis, reocclusion after thrombolysis can be prevented or markedly delayed by antiplatelet interventions, such as administration of a monoclonal antibody against the platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb and IIIa-the putative fibrinogen receptor on platelet membrane whose exposure seems to be an obligatory step for platelet aggregation to occur. Furthermore. our group has demonstrated that thromboxane A2 and serotonin, released during platelet activation, cooperatively mediate reocclusion, as simultaneous administration of a thromboxane A2 and a serotonin receptor antagonist prevents or markedly delays the occurrence of reocclusion in a canine model of coronary thrombosis. This combination of drug is also able to significantly shorten the time to thrombolysis. The initial promising results of PTCA and thrombolytic therapy have greatly altered the care of patients with coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction. However, despite the substantial progress made during the past few years, a number of unresolved issues still exists. Specifically, much more effort needs to be made with regard to reducing the incidence of restenosis after PTCA, shortening the interval between onset of ischemia and achievement of reperfusion and prevention of reocclusion after thrombolysis.

AB Background: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an etiological agent of porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs). Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as the most important PCVD is considered a multifactorial disease. It was demonstrated that not only PCV2 but several viruses are associated with PMWS. Studies of viral co-infections in PMWS pigs led often to controversial results. The aim of this work was to determine the presence of emerging (PRRSV), re-emerging (PTV) and newly-emerging (TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PBoV1) viruses in samples of dead pigs suffering from PMWS. The impact of vaccination against PCV2 and the influence of age on the occurrence of single and multiple viral infections in pigs were also investigated.
   Results: Viruses were detected by PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR in the pooled tissue samples (lymph nodes, liver and spleen) of pigs with PMWS (n = 56) which were divided into three groups: suckling piglets, post-weaning pigs and fattening pigs. In addition, lymph node samples were collected from apparently healthy fattening pigs (n = 59). The effect of vaccination against PCV2 with Ingelvac CircoFlex vaccine was also investigated. Between non-vaccinated pigs, the highest prevalence of individual viruses and multiple viral infections were found in diseased post-weaning and fattening animals with PMWS. Severe clinical disease was observed in swine co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV. The prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was high in all groups of pigs and did not appear to have a significant effect on the syndrome. Simultaneous infection with TTSuV1 and PBoV1 was frequently confirmed in pigs with PMWS. No healthy pig was found to be infected with PRRSV, PTV or PBoV1. Vaccination against PCV2 did not influence the prevalence of TTSuVs, but significantly protected pigs against multiple viral infections.
   Conclusions: Post-weaning PMWS pigs were more often co-infected with viral pathogens than suckling or fattening pigs. Co-infection with PRRSV enforces clinical signs of PMWS, the influence of other viral co-infections is not clear. Vaccination against PCV2 significantly reduced viral co-infections in pigs.

AB Advancements in nanotechnology and the expected increases in production of commercial products with incorporated manufactured nanomaterials will very likely lead to increasing contamination of nanoparticles (NPs) in the environment. Though studying adverse impacts of NPs in the environment and their ecotoxicological fate and behavior is not new, limited information is available. A major challenge in this respect is the lack of a proper sampling technique that could provide data on concentrations of these materials in the environment. Diffusive gradient in thin-films (DGT) is a well-established method that can measure available concentrations of trace metals in soils and waters. Using this approach, different binding resins are employed as a sink to collect targeted chemicals during fixed times. Here, we examine the suitability of two common types of the DGT binding agents, commercially available Chelex-100 and Metsorb, to investigate whether these materials could irreversibly retain a model nanoparticle, ZnO, and if so, what would be the difference between bound ZnO NP and Zn2+ ion. Attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to study the binding materials before and after exposure to ZnO NP and Zn2+. Based on computational analysis using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis (PCA-LDA), it was demonstrated that both Chelex-100 and Metsorb form chemical bonds with ZnO NP and Zn2+, however the binding mechanisms of these zinc species as inferred from their infrared (IR) spectra are statistically different (95% confidence level). The experimental results suggest that the binding resins hold ZnO NP with fewer and weaker chemical bonds compared to Zn2+. This research shows the potential of the DGT method to measure available concentrations of nanoparticles in the environment and demonstrate how ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, when used with computational analysis, can differentiate between diverse chemical species that are simultaneously retained by the binding layer in a DGT device.

AB Leveraging explicit communication and cooperation of multiple robots brings about multiple advantages in the solution of tasks with autonomous robotic agents. For this reason, to the end of transporting polygonal objects with a group of mobile robots, the aim of this article is to develop a fully distributed decision-making and control scheme that lets the robots cooperate as equals, without any kind of central control instance. Apart from coordinating the motions of the robots in a distributed manner, challenges include the self-reliant determination of configurations of the robots around the object, as well as the interrobot negotiation on which robot takes which role or position in the transportation process. Based on some assumptions on the properties of the robots and the considered types of objects, all major aspects of the control scheme are explained in detail, with the most crucial parts making use of optimization-based schemes. This enables unprecedented flexibility by letting the robots automatically adapt to a wide range of scenarios, with different numbers of robots cooperating, and accommodating intricate object shapes. A simulation-based analysis reveals some of the key properties of the proposed scheme, whereas hardware-in-the-loop experiments show the practical applicability with inexpensive hardware. Note to Practitioners-This article was motivated by the potential to further the state of the art of what is possible to achieve with autonomous robots when, instead of using one single robot, a group of robots cooperates self-reliantly to solve a task. The scenario studied in this article is a transportation task in which the robots shall cooperatively push an object to transport it along the desired path. The scheme proposed in this article deals with all major aspects of solving this transportation task, with simulations and hardware-in-the-loop experiments showing the practical applicability of the scheme. While the experiments have been conducted in a laboratory environment, one may readily imagine a more productive application, e.g., in logistics, when employing suitably designed hardware. On another note, maybe more importantly, the general architecture devised to solve the present task may serve as an inspiration or blueprint for the development of decision-making and control schemes that deal with alternative cooperative robotic tasks, especially with regard to the usage of optimization-based schemes on multiple levels allowing a flexible, yet still intuitive problem formulation.

AB The crux of this research was the pragmatic investigation into the formulation of a reconstitutable multiparticulate anti-tuberculosis drug delivery system for facilitated administration for the attainment of segregated gastrointestinal (GI) delivery of rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH) in order to address issues of unacceptable RIF bioavailability on coadministration with INH. Ionotropically crosslinked polymeric enterospheres for delivery of INH to the small intestine were developed via a response surface methodology for the design and optimization of the formulation and processing variables. A 3(4) Box-Behnken statistical design was constructed. The concentration of zinc sulfate salting-out and crosslinking electrolyte, the crosslinking reaction time, the drying temperature (DT), and the concentration of triethyl citrate plasticizer were varied for determination of their effect on the molar amount of zinc (n(Zn)) incorporated in the crosslinked enterosphere, drug entrapment efficiency (DEE), and mean dissolution time (MDT) at t(2h) in acidic media (0.1 M HCl). Complexometric determination of zinc cations (Zn2+) revealed that 23.70-287.89 mol of Zn2+ per mole of polymer were implicated in crosslink formation. DEE of 27.92% to 99.77% were obtained. Drug release at t(2h) ranged from 1.67% to 73.04%. The salting-out and crosslinking agent significantly affected n(Zn) (p = 0.034) and the DEE (p = 0.000), as did the concentration of plasticizer employed (p = 0.000 and 0.002, respectively). High DTs (>42.5 degrees C) also significantly improved DEE (p = 0.029). ZnSO4 had a significant effect on the MDT (p = 0.000). A dry dispersible multiparticulate system incorporating the optimally designed INH-loaded enterospheres and RIF was developed. Bivariate regression analysis of UV spectrophotometric absorbance data allowed in vitro resolution of RIF and INH release at simulated gastric pH.

AB Long implicated in the invasion process, live-bait anglers are highly mobile species vectors with frequent overland transport of fishes. To test hypotheses about the role of anglers in propagule transport, we developed a social-ecological model quantifying the opportunity for species transport beyond the invaded range resulting from bycatch during commercial bait operations, incidental transport, and release to lake ecosystems by anglers. We combined a gravity model with a stochastic, agent-based simulation, representing a 1-yr iteration of live-bait angling and the dynamics of propagule transport at fine spatiotemporal scales (i.e., probability of introducing n propagules per lake per year). A baseline scenario involving round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) indicated that most angling trips were benign; irrespective of lake visitation, anglers failed to purchase and transport propagules (benign trips, median probability P = 0.99912). However, given the large number of probability trials (4.2 million live-bait angling events per year), even the rarest sequence of events (uptake, movement, and deposition of propagules) is anticipated to occur. Risky trips (modal P = 0.00088 trips per year; approximate to 1 in 1136) were sufficient to introduce a substantial number of propagules (modal values, Poisson model = 3715 propagules among 1288 lakes per year; zero-inflated negative binomial model = 6722 propagules among 1292 lakes per year). Two patterns of lake-specific introduction risk emerged. Large lakes supporting substantial angling activity experienced propagule pressure likely to surpass demographic barriers to establishment (top 2.5% of lakes with modal outcomes of five to 76 propagules per year; 303 high-risk lakes with three or more propagules per year). Small or remote lakes were less likely to receive propagules; however, most risk distributions were leptokurtic with a long right tail, indicating the rare occurrence of high propagule loads to most waterbodies. Infestation simulations indicated that the number of high-risk waterbodies could be as great as 1318 (zero-inflated negative binomial), whereas a 90% reduction in bycatch from baseline would reduce the modal number of high risk lakes to zero. Results indicate that the combination of invasive bycatch and live-bait anglers warrants management concern as a species vector, but that risk is confined to a subset of individuals and recipient sites that may be effectively managed with targeted strategies.

AB Many cell functions rely on the ability of microtubules to self-organize as complex networks. In plants, cortical microtubules are essential to determine cell shape as they guide the deposition of cellulose microfibrils, and thus control mechanical anisotropy of the cell wall. Here we analyze how, in turn, cell shape may influence microtubule behavior. Building upon previous models that confined microtubules to the cell surface, we introduce an agent model of microtubules enclosed in a three-dimensional volume. We show that the microtubule network has spontaneous aligned configurations that could explain many experimental observations without resorting to specific regulation. In particular, we find that the preferred cortical localization of microtubules emerges from directional persistence of the microtubules, and their interactions with each other and with the stiff wall. We also identify microtubule parameters that seem relatively insensitive to cell shape, such as length or number. In contrast, microtubule array anisotropy depends on local curvature of the cell surface and global orientation follows robustly the longest axis of the cell. Lastly, we find that geometric cues may be overcome, as the network is capable of reorienting toward weak external directional cues. Altogether our simulations show that the microtubule network is a good transducer of weak external polarity, while at the same time, easily reaching stable global configurations.

AB Background and Purpose Oseltamivir is the most widely prescribed anti-influenza medication. However, in rare instances, it has been reported to stimulate behavioural activities in adolescents. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism responsible for these behavioural activities. Experimental Approach We performed an in vitro assay of MAO-A, the enzyme responsible for neurotransmitter degradation, using either the active form oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) or the inactive prodrug oseltamivir ethyl ester (OEE). We also analysed the docking of MAO-A with OEE or OCin silico. Mouse behaviours after OEE or OC administration were monitored using automated video and computer analysis. Key Results OEE, but not OC, competitively and selectively inhibited human MAO-A. The estimated Ki value was comparable with the Km values of native substrates of MAO-A. Docking simulations in silico based on the tertiary structure of MAO-A suggested that OEE could fit into the inner pocket of the enzyme. Behavioural monitoring using automated video analysis further revealed that OEE, not OC, significantly enhanced spontaneous behavioural activities in mice, such as jumping, rearing, sniffing, turning and walking. Conclusions and Implications Our multilevel analyses suggested OEE to be the cause of the side effects associated with oseltamivir and revealed the molecular mechanism underlying the stimulated behaviours induced by oseltamivir in some circumstances.

TI A novel anthraquinone-quinazoline hybrid 7B blocks breast cancer
   metastasis and EMT via targeting EGFR and Rac1

AB At present, effective therapeutic drugs for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are lacking due to the absence of identified or available targets. Therefore, the present study aimed to identify key molecular targets and a specific targeted therapeutic drug to aid with the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TNBC. Based on the high expression of EGFR and Rac1 in TNBC and inspired by a novel antitumor strategy termed combi-targeting, novel anthraquinone-quinazoline hybrid 7B was synthesized to simultaneously target EGFR and Rac1. It was hypothesized that hybrid 7B may possess enhanced potency compared with its parent compounds. Breast cancer cell viability was detected by performing MTT assays. Flow cytometry was conducted to detect the effects of hybrid 7B on the cell cycle, apoptosis and the mitochondrial outer membrane potential. Ultrastructural alterations were observed by transmission electron microscopy. Cell invasion and migration were assessed by performing Transwell and wound-healing assays, respectively. The expression levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers and metastasis-related proteins were detected by western blotting. Compared with Rhein and gefitinib, hybrid 7B displayed superior antiproliferative activity in MDA-MB-231 cells with an IC50 value of 2.31 mu M, which was 14-fold higher compared with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. Further experiments demonstrated that hybrid 7B significantly reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced MDA-MB-231 cell apoptosis and induced cell cycle arrest at the G(2)/M phase compared with the control group. Typical morphological alterations of apoptotic cells were observed in hybrid 7B-treated MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Compared with the control group, hybrid 7B significantly inhibited MDA-MB-231 cell invasion and migration by downregulating Rac1, EGFR, matrix metalloproteinases, snail family transcriptional repressor 1, Vimentin and beta-catenin protein expression levels, and upregulating E-cadherin protein expression levels. The present study demonstrated that hybrid 7B inhibited TNBC cell migration and invasion by reversing EMT and targeting EGFR and Rac1; therefore, hybrid 7B may serve as a promising therapeutic agent for TNBC.

AB Objective: To evaluate surface roughness, hardness, and morphology changes of various bulk-fill resin composites eroded by different food-simulating liquids and beverages.
   Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirteen specimens were fabricated in polytetrafluoroethylene cylindrical mold (10 mm in diameter and 4 mm in thickness). Before immersion, baseline data of roughness, Vicker's microhardness were recorded and surface characteristics were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Each product of specimens (SDR, Dentsply; SonicFill, Kerr; Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill, Ivoclar Vivadent AG; and Filtek Bulk Fill, 3M ESPE) were divided into 5 groups for spicy and sour soup, spicy soup (Tom Yum), pineapple juice, passionfruit juice, and deionized water (served as a control). Specimens were then alternately immersed in storage agents for 5 seconds and artificial saliva for 5 seconds over 10 cycles. Specimens were stored in artificial saliva for 22 hours. This process was repeated for 28 days. After immersion, surface hardness and roughness of specimens were evaluated at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and data were analyzed by two-way repeated ANOVA and Tukey's HSD (alpha = 0.05). Surface morphology of specimens was also examined on day 28.
   Results: The SDR group had the most statistically significant decrement in hardness (25.651.74 kg/mm(2) in mean difference) and increment in roughness (0.260.10 m in mean difference; P < .05). Passionfruit juice caused the most surface changes in bulk-fill resin composites. SEM photomicrographs showed surface changes of all resin composites in varying degrees.
   Conclusion: Acidic food-simulating liquids and beverages significantly increased the surface roughness and decreased surface microhardness of bulk-fill resin composites after evaluation at the end of the 28-day immersion period.
   Clinical significance
   For restoration of the affected teeth in patients who consume acidic food and beverages, roughness and erosion of resin composites should be considered. All of bulk-fill resin-based composites except SDR may be suitable for restorations in these patients.

AB An emerging field of educational data mining (EDM) is building on and contributing to a wide variety of disciplines through analysis of data coming from various educational technologies. EDM researchers are addressing questions of cognition, metacognition, motivation, affect, language, social discourse, etc. using data from intelligent tutoring systems, massive open online courses, educational games and simulations, and discussion forums. The data include detailed action and timing logs of student interactions in user interfaces such as graded responses to questions or essays, steps in rich problem solving environments, games or simulations, discussion forum posts, or chat dialogs. They might also include external sensors such as eye tracking, facial expression, body movement, etc. We review how EDM has addressed the research questions that surround the psychology of learning with an emphasis on assessment, transfer of learning and model discovery, the role of affect, motivation and metacognition on learning, and analysis of language data and collaborative learning. For example, we discuss (1) how different statistical assessment methods were used in a data mining competition to improve prediction of student responses to intelligent tutor tasks, (2) how better cognitive models can be discovered from data and used to improve instruction, (3) how data-driven models of student affect can be used to focus discussion in a dialog-based tutoring system, and (4) how machine learning techniques applied to discussion data can be used to produce automated agents that support student learning as they collaborate in a chat room or a discussion board.

AB Understanding the conformational preferences of carbohydrates is crucial to explain the interactions with their biological targets and to improve their use as therapeutic agents. We present experimental data resolving the conformational landscape of the monosaccharide D-lyxose, for which quantum mechanical (QM) calculations offer model-dependent results. This study compares the structural preferences in the gas phase, determined by rotational spectroscopy, with those in solution, resolved by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In contrast to QM calculations, D-lyxose adopts only pyranose forms in the gas phase, with the alpha-anomer exhibiting both the C-4(1) and C-1(4) chairs (60:40). The predominantly populated beta-anomer shows the C-4(1) form exclusively, as determined experimentally by isotopic substitution. In aqueous solution, the pyranose forms are also dominant. However, in contrast to the gas phase, the alpha-anomer as C-1(4) chair is the most populated, and its solvation is more effective than for the beta derivative. Markedly, the main conformers found in the gas phase and solution are characterized by the lack of the stabilizing anomeric effect. From a mechanistic perspective, both rotational spectroscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) corroborate that alpha <->beta or furanose <-> pyranose interconversions are prevented in the gas phase. Combining microwave (MW) and NMR results provides a powerful method for unraveling the water role in the conformational preferences of challenging molecules, such as flexible monosaccharides.

AB This study evaluated ticks and rickettsial exposure in 220 free-ranging lowland tapirs, Tapirus terrestris, from 2006 to 2018 in selected areas of three major biomes of Brazil ? Atlantic Forest, Pantanal, and Cerrado. Overall, a total of 5970 tick specimens representing the following nine species were collected from tapirs: Amblyomma brasiliense, Amblyomma coelebs, Amblyomma dubitatum, Amblyomma ovale, Amblyomma parvum, Amblyomma sculptum, Amblyomma triste, Haemaphysalis juxtakochi, and Rhipicephalus microplus. Amblyomma sculptum was the most prevalent and abundant tick species in all three biomes; however, mean intensity values for A. sculptum were significantly lower in Atlantic Forest than in the Pantanal or Cerrado, and at the same time, statistically similar among tapirs from Pantanal and Cerrado. Contrastingly, mean intensity values for A. coelebs were significantly higher in the Atlantic Forest than in the other biomes. The remaining tick species were collected in lower numbers, or were exclusive for one biome, e.g., A. brasiliense and H. juxtakochi only in the Atlantic Forest. A total of 177 blood sera (123 individuals plus 54 recaptures) were collected from tapirs and tested for the presence of reactive antibodies to six Rickettsia species by immunofluorescence assay. Overall, 69% (9/13), 49% (62/126), and 66% (25/38) tapir sera from Atlantic Forest, Pantanal and Cerrado, respectively, were seroreactive to at least one Rickettsia species, with no significant difference between the three areas. Although many tapir sera reacted simultaneously to ?2 Rickettsia species, Rickettsia parkeri elicited highest % seroprevalence and endpoint titers, and was incriminated as the possible agent involved in a homologous reaction in tapirs from the three biomes, where A. ovale was previously found infected by R. parkeri. In fact, seroconversion to R. parkeri was demonstrated in five tapirs that were captured at least twice during the study. This study demonstrated that tapirs were found to be constantly infested by several tick species in the Atlantic Forest, Pantanal and Cerrado biomes; however, the richness of tick infestations was concordant to the tick species known to be established in each biome. Under natural conditions, lowland tapirs were shown to be exposed to tick-borne spotted fever group rickettsiae.

AB new model for a positively charged calcite surface was developed to allow realistic molecular dynamics studies of wettability alteration on carbonate rocks. The surface charge was introduced in a manner consistent with the underlying calcite geochemistry and with the conclusions of recent quantum mechanical studies. The simulations using the new surface model demonstrate that the experimentally observed wettability behavior of calcite is represented correctly. In particular, the model surface became oil-wet due to the adsorption of the carboxylate species. Furthermore, the oil-wet conditions were reversed more effectively by a cationic surfactant than by an anionic one, in agreement with the majority of experimental observations. Finally, with simulated smart water, the well-documented wettability alteration abilities of Ca2+ and SO42- could be explained by the formation of ion-pairs and competitive adsorption onto the surface, respectively. The simulation results with the new surface model conceptually agree with the electric double layer expansion being the predominant mechanism for the low salinity effect in oil recovery enhancement. The proposed calcite surface model will benefit future simulation studies on the wettability characteristics of carbonate rocks, and facilitate the design and optimizations of chemical agents and formulations to enhance the oil recovery from carbonate reservoirs.

AB Solid selective adsorption to partition mercury speciation (Hg-0, Hg2+) in flue gas is known as the innovative technology in developing solid agents application in online measurement of mercury speciation by continuous emission monitoring system (Hg-CEMS). Porous materials SiO2, TiO2 and gamma-Al2O3 were chosen as the selective adsorbents and the systematical experiments were conducted in a fixed-bed reactor. Adsorption tests indicated that Hg-0 was scarcely adsorbed by these three porous adsorbents while Hg2+ exhibited an apparent adsorption behavior. gamma-Al2O3 was verified to be efficient in Hg2+/Hg-0 separation because of its high HgCl2 adsorption capacity and SO2 anti-interference ability. The intrinsic mechanisms of HgCl2 selective adsorption and SO2 competition over gamma-Al2O3 surface sites were further investigated. Temperature programmed desorption (TPD) analyses demonstrated that the weak interaction between Hg-0 and gamma-Al2O3 surface was ascribed to a physisorption manner while the adsorption of HgCl2 was characterized chemical bonding. Hydroxyl (Al-OH), Lewis Aln+-Bronsted On- pairs and the coordinatively unsaturated oxygen (O2- ions) were deduced to be effective basic sites for the chemisorption of HgCl2 on gamma-Al2O3. Simultaneously, the competitive adsorption between SO2 and HgCl2 in O2- ions was confirmed to be responsible for the increased breakthrough of HgCl2 over gamma-Al2O3 layer with the existence of SO2.

AB This review covers the structure of, and chemical reactions on, well-defined cerium oxide surfaces. Ceria, or mixed oxides containing ceria, are critical components in automotive three-way catalysts due to their well-known oxygen storage capacity. Ceria is also emerging as an important material in a number of other catalytic processes, particularly those involving organic oxygenates and the water gas shift reaction. Ceria's acid base properties, and thus its catalytic behavior, are closely related to its surface structure where different oxygen anion and cerium cation environments are present on the low-index structural faces. The actual structure of these various faces has been the focus of a number of theoretical and experimental investigations. Ceria is also easily reducible from CeO2 to CeO2-X. The presence of oxygen vacancies on the surface often dramatically alters the adsorption and subsequent reactions of various adsorbates, either on a clean surface or on metal particles supported on the surface. Most surface science studies have been conducted on the surfaces of thin-films rather than on the surfaces of bulk single crystal oxides. The growth, characterization and properties of these thin-films are also examined. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID FIBROUS CONCRETE; CRACKED CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; PLAIN
AB A large proportion of reinforced concrete structures are cracked and subjected to cyclic loading in service. The presence of cracks enhances the ingress of aggressive agents into the concrete, resulting in faster structure deterioration. On the other hand, crack self-healing and inclusion of fibers in concrete can improve structure durability. Self-healing under constant loading is a well-known phenomenon; however, the possibility for self-healing to occur under cyclic loading has received insufficient attention. This study used an innovative permeability device to investigate the water permeability of reinforced normal-strength concrete (NSC) and fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) simultaneously subjected to tensile cyclic loading. Complementary mechanical tests were performed under the same loading procedure to assess the crack-pattern evolution. The experimental results showed that, at an equivalent stress level in the reinforcement, the water permeability was significantly lower in the FRC than in the NSC-both under constant and cyclic loading. Moreover, two opposite phenomena occurred during cyclic loading: crack propagation and self-healing. In the NSC, the self-healing, which occurred under cyclic loading, compensated for the increase of permeability resulting from the crack propagation. In the FRC, crack growth was minor; therefore, the self-healing was not affected by the cyclic loading and may have even been promoted in comparison to self-healing under constant loading. The results emphasize the benefit of using FRC in structures.

AB Positive feedback plays a major role in the emergence of many collective animal behaviours. In many ants pheromone trails recruit and direct nestmate foragers to food sources. The strong positive feedback caused by trail pheromones allows fast collective responses but can compromise flexibility. Previous laboratory experiments have shown that when the environment changes, colonies are often unable to reallocate their foragers to a more rewarding food source. Here we show both experimentally, using colonies of Lasius niger, and with an agent-based simulation model, that negative feedback caused by crowding at feeding sites allows ant colonies to maintain foraging flexibility even with strong recruitment to food sources. In a constant environment, negative feedback prevents the frequently found bias towards one feeder (symmetry breaking) and leads to equal distribution of foragers. In a changing environment, negative feedback allows a colony to quickly reallocate the majority of its foragers to a superior food patch that becomes available when foraging at an inferior patch is already well underway. The model confirms these experimental findings and shows that the ability of colonies to switch to a superior food source does not require the decay of trail pheromones. Our results help to resolve inconsistencies between collective foraging patterns seen in laboratory studies and observations in the wild, and show that the simultaneous action of negative and positive feedback is important for efficient foraging in mass-recruiting insect colonies.

AB This article investigates the following basic question: in the relatively stable molecular environment of a vertebrate body, can a dynamic idiotypic immune network develop a natural tolerance to endogenous components? Our approach is based on stability analysis and computer simulation using a model that takes into account the dynamics of two agents of the immune system, namely, B-lymphocytes and antibodies. We investigate the behavior of simple immune networks in interaction with an Ag whose concentration is being held constant as a function of the connectivity matrix of the network. The latter is characterized by the total number of clones, N, and the number of clones, C, with which each clone interacts. The idiotypic network models typically become unstable in the presence of this type of Ag. We show that idiotypic networks that can be found in particular connected regions of NO-space show tolerance towards auto-Ag without the need for ad hoc mechanisms that prevent an immune response. These tolerant network structures provide dynamical regimes in which the clone which interacts with the auto-dg is suppressed instead of being excited such that an unbounded immune response does not occur. Possible implications for the future treatment of auto-immune disease such as IvIg-treatment are discussed in the light of these results. Moreover, we propose an experimental approach to verify the results of the present theoretical study.

AB Background: The metabolic changes associated with diabetes can lead to nephropathy eventually resulting in end-stage renal disease. Current antidiabetic therapies do not effectively prevent the onset of diabetic kidney diseases as well as progression. Aim: To evaluate the effect of Coccinia indica leaf extract alone and in combination with pioglitazone, an antihyperglycemic agent was used to modulate the progressive kidney damage induced by type 2 diabetes in rats. Hypotheses: Pioglitazone causes severe adverse effects when administered for long-term therapy. The hypotheses in this study is to examine the renoprotective effect of Coccinia indica leaf extract (200 mg/kg p.o.) when co-administered with low-dose pioglitazone (7 mg/kg) in type-2-diabetes-induced nephropathy in rats and simultaneously evaluate the hypoglycemic response as well. Methods: Rats (Males, Sprague Dawley) were kept on a high-fat diet and were given a single dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg, i.p.) to induce diabetic nephropathy. Treatment groups received either Coccinia indica leaf extract or pioglitazone or pioglitazone with Coccinia indica extract, fenofibrate, or lisinopril for 7 weeks. Blood glucose, antioxidant status, triglycerides, total cholesterol, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and proteinuria levels were estimated and compared with the normal control and disease control (untreated) groups. Results: The untreated diabetic rats showed increased blood glucose levels, lipid profiles, and renal oxidative stress, along with an increase in nephropathy markers such as blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and proteinuria. Histopathological examination revealed glomerular damage. Combination treatment with Coccinia indica leaf extract and a low dose of pioglitazone normalized the nephropathic markers as well as histopathological changes. Conclusion: Coccinia indica leaf extract when co-administered with a low dose of pioglitazone as antidiabetic therapy showed good glycemic control and a beneficial renoprotective effect. Combination therapy would lower the dose of pioglitazone and also protect kidneys from drug-induced toxicity as observed from normalized nephropathic markers in a diabetic rat model.

AB The effect of interface modification on the interfacial adhesion and tensile properties of glass fabric/epoxy composites was evaluated in two directions of 0 degrees and +45 degrees. Herein, the glass fabric surface was modified by colloidal nanosilica particles and by a new blend of silane-coupling agents including both reactive and non-reactive silanes. Composite samples with high strength and toughness were obtained. A simultaneous improvement of tensile strength and toughness was observed for an epoxy composite reinforced with a hybrid-sized glass fabric including silane mixture and nanosilica. In fact, the incorporation of colloidal silica into the hybrid sizing dramatically modified the fiber surface texture and created mechanical interlocking between the glass fabric and resin. The results were analyzed by the rule of mixtures (ROM), Halpin-Tsai (H-T), and Chamis equations. It was found that the ROM equations provided approximate upper bound values for all investigated composite samples. In the samples containing nanosilica, the shear and elastic moduli values calculated by the Chamis and ROM equations showed good agreement with those obtained from experiments. However, in other samples, the values calculated by the H-T equation showed a better agreement with the experimental data. The analysis of fracture surfaces indicated that both silane and nanosilica particles had influence on the mode of failures at the interface.

AB The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is a multicellular system that drives daily rhythms in mammalian behavior and physiology. Although the gene regulatory network that produces daily oscillations within individual neurons is well characterized, less is known about the electrophysiology of the SCN cells and how firing rate correlates with circadian gene expression. We developed a firing rate code model to incorporate known electrophysiological properties of SCN pacemaker cells, including circadian dependent changes in membrane voltage and ion conductances. Calcium dynamics were included in the model as the putative link between electrical firing and gene expression. Individual ion currents exhibited oscillatory patterns matching experimental data both in current levels and phase relationships. VIP and GABA neurotransmitters, which encode synaptic signals across the SCN, were found to play critical roles in daily oscillations of membrane excitability and gene expression. Blocking various mechanisms of intracellular calcium accumulation by simulated pharmacological agents (nimodipine, IP3- and ryanodine-blockers) reproduced experimentally observed trends in firing rate dynamics and core-clock gene transcription. The intracellular calcium concentration was shown to regulate diverse circadian processes such as firing frequency, gene expression and system periodicity. The model predicted a direct relationship between firing frequency and gene expression amplitudes, demonstrated the importance of intracellular pathways for single cell behavior and provided a novel multiscale framework which captured characteristics of the SCN at both the electrophysiological and gene regulatory levels.

AB Objective: Aggression is a common response to many types of social rejection. Men who respond aggressively to a woman's sexual rejection are likely to score high on risk factors associated with sexual aggression and to convince themselves that she is at fault. This study investigated how sexual dominance motivation and casual sex attitudes interact with "in-the-moment" hostile perceptions of the woman to predict the likelihood of an aggressive response. Method: Male participants (N = 77) completed an online survey including self-report measures of sexual dominance motivation and casual sex attitudes. In a separate session, participants completed a laboratory study in which they interacted with a female agent in a dating simulation, allowing them to make nonsexual choices, sexual choices that were accepted, and sexual choices that were rejected. Immediate responses to sexual rejection were categorized as aggressive (n = 25) or nonaggressive (n = 52). After the simulation ended, participants answered questions about their perceptions of the situation and the woman. Moderated multiple logistic regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses. Results: The hypothesized interactions were found such that men with high scores on sexual dominance motivation and positive attitudes about casual sex had a greater probability of responding aggressively when they formed extremely hostile perceptions of the woman who rejected them. Conclusions: These findings provide insight into the processes by which men respond aggressively to women's refusals and highlight the need for training that encourages benevolent attributions and nonviolent strategies to deal with sexual rejection.

AB In this article we present a computational approach to developing effective training systems for virtual simulation environments. In particular, we focus on a Naval simulation system, used for training of conning officers. The currently existing training solutions require multiple expert personnel to control each vessel in a training scenario, or are cumbersome to use by a single instructor. The inability of current technology to provide an automated mechanism for competitive realistic boat behaviors thus compromises the goal of flexible, anytime, anywhere training. In this article we propose an approach that reduces the time and effort required for training of conning officers, by integrating novel approaches to autonomous control within a simulation environment. Our solution is to develop intelligent, autonomous controllers that drive the behavior of each boat. To increase the system's efficiency we provide a mechanism for creating such controllers, from the demonstration of a navigation expert, using a simple programming interface. In addition, our approach deals with two significant and related challenges: the realism of behavior exhibited by the automated boats and their real-time response to changes in the environment. In this article, we describe the control architecture we developed that enables the real-time response of boats and the repertoire of realistic behaviors we designed for this application. We also present our approach for facilitating the automatic authoring of training scenarios and we demonstrate the capabilities of our system with experimental results.

AB Statement of problem: Adhesive cementation is the most common bonding strategy for zirconia restorations. Although cementation with a bioactive luting agent has been proposed as an alternative, how the bond strength compares is unclear.
   Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate shear bond strength after cementing a monolithic zirconia ceramic to human dentin with a bioceramic cement, compare it with a traditional cement, and evaluate its bioactive properties.
   Material and methods: A total of 120 dentin specimens and 120 yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) (BruxZir) cylindrical specimens were used. Zirconia and dentin specimens were randomly divided into 8 study groups (n=15) based on 2 luting cement types (a bioceramic cement or glass ionomer cement as control), 2 airborne-particle abrasion protocols (50 mu m or 110 mu m), and 2 water storage durations (24 hours or 30 days). After the shear bond strength test using a universal machine at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, fracture patterns were evaluated under a stereomicroscope and a scanning electron microscope. Strength values were statistically analyzed with a 3-factor ANOVA model (alpha=.05). Bioactivity was evaluated in simulated body fluid (SBF).
   Results: The control glass ionomer cement achieved significantly greater shear bond strength compared with the tested bioceramic cement. Mean bond strength values ranged from 2.52 MPa to 5.23 MPa for the bioceramic cement tested and from 4.20 MPa to 6.61 MPa for the control cement. The duration of water storage played a significant role in the bond strength, with groups stored for 30 days reaching higher bond strength values, whereas the particle size of airborne-particle abrasion did not have a significant effect. Failure types were primarily mixed. No apatite formation was recorded on the surface of the specimens even after 30 days of immersion in SBF.
   Conclusions: The evaluated cement did not develop apatite in SBF, and its bond strength values were below the control glass ionomer cement.

AB The corrosion behavior of NiCr-based coatings including 45CT, NiCrBSi, and Inconel 718 was studied under simulated coal-fired boiler conditions. It was found that these arc-sprayed coatings applied to TP347 boiler steel were comprised of Cr1.12Ni2.88 compound. Hot corrosion tests were performed to study the corrosion resistance of the coatings in simulated flue gases and synthetic fly ashes at 650 degrees C. The composition (wt.%) of synthetic ashes was 92.9fly ash-0.1NaCl-2.0Na(2)SO(4)-5.0CaSO(4). The 45CT coating had optimal corrosion resistance while the NiCrBSi coating suffered from severe corrosion according to the experimental results. During corrosion tests, Cr2O3 and Ni3S2 were formed on the coating surfaces due to the oxidation and corrosion of the coatings. A protective Cr2O3 scale acted as a corrosion barrier, which led to the decrease in the corrosion rates. The Cr2O3 scale would lose protectiveness due to its dissolving caused by molten NaCl salt. The results indicated that compounds such as SiO2, CaO, and Al2O3 from the synthetic fly ashes were covered on the coating surfaces. Sulfur was found to be the most corrosive agent, substantially increasing corrosion rates. The mechanisms of S-induced corrosion and dissolving of Cr2O3 scale for NiCr-based coatings are discussed.

AB Hepatic fibrosis is overly exuberant wound healing in which excessive connective tissue builds up in the liver. The treatment of hepatic fibrosis is still difficult and remains a challenge to the clinician. In recent years, the TGF- signaling pathway regulator tyrosine kinase Abl has been raised as a new and promising target of hepatic fibrosis therapy. Here, considering that there are numerous drugs and drug-like compounds being approved or under clinical development and experimental investigation, it is expected that some of the existing drugs can be re-exploited as new agents to target Abl with the capability of suppressing hepatic fibrosis. To achieve this, a synthetic protocol that integrated molecular docking, affinity scoring dynamics simulation and free energy analysis was described to systematically profile the inhibitory potency of various drugs and drug-like compounds against the kinase domain of Abl. Consequently, 4 out of 13 tested drug candidates were successfully identified to have high-Abl inhibitory activities. By visually examining the dynamics behavior, structural basis and energetic property of few typical Abl-drug complex cases, a significantly different pattern of non-bonded interactions between the binding of active and inactive drug ligands to Abl receptor was revealed; the former is defined by strong, specific chemical forces, while the latter can only form non-specific hydrophobic contacts with slight atomic collisions.

AB Using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, the mechanical properties of a buckypaper/epoxy composite were calculated. In order to simulate a large model within a large enough timescale, a general MD code fully implemented on graphical processing units (GPUs) was developed. The code, which enables the simulation of large systems with about five hundreds speed up in simulation time relative to a single CPU core, is capable of running on CUDA enabled GPUs. In this study the buckpaper/epoxy composite consists of single wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs), epoxy resin (EPON-862) and the curing agent diethyltoluenediamine (DETDA). Next, the mechanical properties of buckypaper/epoxy composite, namely elastic modulus and Poisson's ratio, were studied through the simulation of a set of tension tests. For the first time directional properties of this material is calculated. A comparison with previously published data is also included. The results prove that the proposed procedure is suitable for investigating the mechanical properties of the buckypaper/epoxy composites. In addition, the results show a negative Poisson ratio and high modulus of elasticity for the buckypaper/epoxy composites, which proves the application of such material in producing artificial muscles, and advanced composites in aviation industries, respectively. Finally, a study on the failure mechanisms of the material is conducted and the integrity of the results was checked by the available experimental and analytical data.

AB Optimal balance between energy usage and feeding is crucial to an animal's fitness, and thus is a driving force in the evolution of species. Animals show varieties of different foraging strategies, each adapted to particular ecological and physical constraints. For example, while both the paddlefish and the zooplankton Daphnia filter-feed on patchy food sources, they differ greatly in size and in their methods of propulsion, affecting the degrees of influence of the viscous and inertial forces on these swimmers. To examine the effects of these physical constraints on the evolution of foraging strategies, we modified a recent evolution simulation designed for Daphnia by adding an energy penalty proportional to each turning angle used by modelled foraging agents. This modification accounts for the loss of linear momentum of larger swimmers as they change directions, directly contrasting with Daphnia, which, as smaller, rowing organisms, never build an appreciable momentum since they are halted by the surrounding medium after each forward stroke. While realistic random-walk-like trajectories were predicted by the simulation for Daphnia, distinct circling trajectories and nonzero peaks in the turning angle distributions were predicted for larger species, such as paddlefish. These results are strikingly similar to experimental data also reported here: the circling patterns and bimodal turning angle distributions observed in juvenile paddlefish.

AB The objective of this research was to determine whether chitosan microparticles could be developed as potential satiety enhancing ingredients by investigating their swelling behaviour in the gastro-intestinal tract using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Previous work undertaken using a covalently cross-linked composite of chitosan and bovine serum albumin (BSA) showed this system swells in gastric conditions in vitro (Butler, Clark, & Adams, 2006). This paper describes the preparation and characterisation of chitosan/BSA microparticles cross-linked using 25 mM and 100 mM glutaraldehyde (GDA). 1.5% chitosan/15% BSA microparticles cross-linked with 25 mM GDA swell by 100% in simulated gastric conditions. We found an experimental correlation between the transverse NMR relaxation time, T(2), and swelling of the microparticles in vitro. Our study of four volunteers showed swelling of these microparticles in the human stomach, observed from increases in T(2) of the microparticles using non-invasive MRI. As such, our initial results, with 4 volunteers, suggest that this system could be used as a potential satiety enhancing agent in vivo as we would expect it to provide gastric distension due to swelling at low pH. Further studies with more volunteers would be necessary to confirm our initial findings. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The bismuth film electrode (BiFE), in combination with anodic stripping voltammetry, offers convenient measurement of low concentrations of tin. The procedure involves simultaneous in situ formation of the bismuth film electrode on a glassy carbon substrate electrode, together with electrochemical deposition of tin, in a non-deaerated model solution containing bismuth ions, catechol as complexing agent and the metal analyte, followed by an anodic stripping scan. The BiFE is characterized by an attractive electroanalytical performance, with two distinct voltammetric stripping signals corresponding to tin, accompanied with low background contributions. Several experimental parameters were optimized, such as concentration of bismuth ions and catechol, deposition potential, deposition time and pH of the model solution. In addition, a critical comparison is given with bare glassy carbon and mercury film electrodes, revealing the superior characteristics of BiFE for measurement of tin. BiFE exhibited highly linear behavior in the examined concentration range from 1 to 100 mu gL(-1) of tin (R-2 = 0.997), an LoD of 0.26 mu g L-1 tin, and good reproducibility with a calculated R.S.D. of 7.3% for 10 mu g L-1 tin (n = 10). As an example, the practical applicability of BiFE was tested with the measurement of tin in a real sample of seawater. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An experimental study focused on the identification of the flow regimes and quantification of the velocity field at pore scale in microporous media is presented and discussed. Transparent porous media are fabricated by removing a pore forming agent in slightly sintered glass beads of size 50 mu m between two glass slides, leaving typical pores with a size of 500 mu m. Pressure-drop measurements and particle image velocimetry measurements are conducted simultaneously in order to evaluate the flow regimes and flow behaviors at pore size based Reynolds numbers from 0.1 to 140. Four different regimes, pre-Darcy, Darcy, Forchheimer, and turbulent, are found and presented. Spatial distribution and characteristics of the time-averaged velocity in all regimes and fluctuation intensity in transitional and turbulent regimes are investigated. Critical Reynolds numbers are identified using both velocity and pressure-drop measurements and the results agree very well, providing direct evidence underpinning the transition. The effects of porosity on these flow properties are also studied, and finally the flow regime boundaries are compared with the literature. These data provide an insight into the flow properties in microporous media with various porosities and an improved understanding that could be further utilized to enhance the flow and heat transfer performance of microporous media. It also demonstrates that velocity and pressure measurements used in combination can be an effective method for studying microporous media.

AB In CO2-assisted polyurethane (PU) foaming, the solubility and diffusion coefficient of CO2 is vitally important to the cell nucleation and growth. This work is aimed at the effect of molecular weights (M-n) and crosslinking densities (V-e) on the solubility and diffusion coefficient of CO2 in PU oligomers. A series of PU oligomers with different M-n and V-e were synthesized. The solubility and diffusivity of CO2 in PU oligomers were measured experimentally in the temperature from 80 to 140 degrees C and with pressures up to 15MPa. It was shown that the solubility and diffusion coefficients of CO2 was decreased 20.5 and 21.0%, respectively, with the M-n increasing from 5864 to 153,754gmol(-1) at 80 degrees C, 15MPa. The solubility and the diffusion coefficient also decreased 11.1 and 38.0% as the V-e was increased from 64 to 1493molm(-3). Furthermore, the diffusion mechanism of CO2 in PU oligomers was explored via molecular dynamics simulations. The results indicated that the calculated diffusivity of CO2 showed the same changing trend as the experimental values, and the smaller M-n or crosslinking degree contributed to an increase in fractional free volume and stronger polymer-CO2 interactions.

TI Streamline-Based Simulation of Non-Newtonian Polymer Flooding
SO SPE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID FLOW; DISPLACEMENT; FLUIDS
AB Current commercial simulators for polymer flooding often make physical assumptions that are not consistent with available experimental data and pore-scale modeling predictions. This may lead to overly optimistic recovery predictions for shear-thinning polymers, while the potential advantages of reducing flow rate or using shear-thickening agents are overlooked.
   We develop a streamline-based simulator that overcomes these limitations and demonstrate how it can be used to design polymer-flooding projects. The simulator implements an iterative approach to solve the pressure field because the pressure depends on the aqueous-phase viscosity, which, in turn for non-Newtonian fluids, depends on shear stress and, hence, the pressure gradients. This is in contrast to the common approach in commercial simulators where this viscosity/pressure interdependence is ignored, leading to overestimation of sweep efficiency. Furthermore, in the simulator, non-Newtonian viscosities are defined to be cell-centered while current simulators use a face-centered approach, thereby overpredicting viscosities and the stability of the displacing fronts. In addition, we use a physically based rheological model where non-Newtonian viscosities in two-phase flow are taken at actual effective stresses instead of single-phase equivalents.
   To validate the simulator, we construct ID analytical solutions for waterflooding with a non-Newtonian fluid. We then compare our results to those from commercial simulators. We discuss the significance of current assumptions to demonstrate the effect of non-Newtonian behavior on sweep efficiency and recovery.

AB Solar radiative energy represents an important source of renewable energy. Of late, hybrid colloidal nanodispersion as an elevated heat transport agent acquires immense interest among researchers rather than unitary nanoliquids. The aim of this investigation was to quantify the flow patterns and heat transfer behaviour of hybrid nanoliquids in presence of nonlinear solar radiation for various solar thermal apparatus. Alumina-copper nanoingredients with water as host fluid are considered. The leading PDEs of our system are turned into ODEs by using prevalent similarity transformation. After that those ODEs have been solved by RK-4-based shooting method. Subsequently, the influences of relevant parameters on the heat transfer of fluid have been talked over on behalf of graphical and tabular approach. Extracted results are verified with experimental plus simulated data. Results communicate that solar radiation fosters heat transport in suction. Hybrid solution exhibits impressive increment in heat transport for suction. Though injection reduces the effect, the decay rate is slower for hybrid nanocomposite. Flipping nature of velocity is perceived for Reynolds number, rotational parameter, and nanoparticle concentration except the variations of suction/injection parameter. We believe that this comprehensive investigation will have potential applications in solar thermal power fabrication, solar ponds, solar thermo electric cells, etc.

AB Ester compounds are widely used in applications such as solvents, plasticizers, polymers, lubricants, cosmetics, medicinals, agrochemicals, soaps and other surface active agents, to mention a few. In many of these applications the simultaneous knowledge of the phase behavior and interfacial properties is an advantage for designing better products and improved processes. The van der Waals density gradient theory is an interesting theory providing such information. In this work it is applied for the first time to compute the surface tension of esters in a broad temperature range. A total of 37 ester compounds were evaluated, including formates, acetates, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl and unsaturated methyl esters.
   For calculating the Helmholtz energy density and the bulk properties, the cubic-plus-association equation of state was used. It is demonstrated that ester surface tensions can be estimated within 1.5% deviation to the experimental data using a simple correlation for the temperature dependence of the gradient theory influence parameter. Whenever the influence parameters are considered to be temperature independent only slightly higher deviations, below 5%, were obtained.
   The results suggest that the proposed methodology can be a valuable tool for modeling surface and interfacial tensions of esters and ester mixtures such as biocliesels. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Monolayers of biotinylated DNA were immobilized on a streptavidin-dextran-gold triple-layer. Small portions of the drugs (approximately 30 pmol/ml) were injected in continuous flow. The mass corresponded to the amount of the bound molecules. Injections of 50 mM sodium hydroxide pulses separated the DNA double strands, releasing the effector molecules. Subsequent treatments with the effecters gave reproducible results. The maximum interaction between drug and DNA was observed in the case of Tilorone. 41 molecules could bind to the 36-b.p. DNA duplex.
   To investigate the microscopic behavior in condensed nucleic acid phases, SFM (Scanning Force Microscopy)-imaging and polarizing microscopic observations of DNA-effector complexes were carried out. Supplementary UV-absorption thermal denaturation curves of DNA with the above-mentioned effecters in dilute solutions were measured. As an additional aid to understand the geometries of DNA-drug interactions, computer simulations were performed and compared with the experimental data.

TI Synchronization in Autonomous Mercury Beating Heart Systems
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A
LA English

ID COUPLED OSCILLATORS; MECHANISM; MODES; CELLS
AB The ability of the mercury beating heart (MBH) system to exhibit sustained mechanical and electrochemical activities simultaneously without any external agent (fluctuating or constant), has attracted researchers for decades. The interplay of these activities could mimic the biological phenomena such as a pulsating heart that occurs due to the coupled tissues exhibiting mechanical as well as electrical dynamics. In the present work, we have studied experimentally the dynamics of electrically coupled two and three autonomous MBH systems. A dynamical triangular (heart) shape, in the traditional watch glass geometry, has been chosen for the experiments. It is found that the redox potentials (electrical behavior) of the quasi-identical (due to the inherent heterogeneities in the setup) MBH systems get synchronized at the intermediate coupling strengths whereas coherence in their mechanical activities occur only at large coupling strengths. To the best of our knowledge, this synchronization phenomenon involving two distinct activities (electrical and mechanical) and different coupling thresholds has not been reported, so far. The coherent mechanical activities means the simultaneous occurrence of compressions and expansions in the coupled Hg drops, which are shown using snapshots. In addition to this, the redox time series have also been provided to demonstrate the synchronization in the electrical behavior of MBH systems. Moreover, a mathematical framework considering only electrical and mechanical components of the MBH systems is presented to validate the experimental findings that the strong synchrony in the redox potentials of the MBH systems is a prerequisite for the synchrony in their mechanical activities.

AB Foam mobility control technique has been extensively applied to encounter unfavorable sweep efficiency during CO2 injection in heterogeneous reservoirs. Harsh reservoir conditions have encouraged a need of effective mobility control agent. In this study, we present a comprehensive experimental investigation utilizing a newly developed water-soluble associative polymer as additive to foam system for stability and rheology enhancement. The performance of polymer enhanced foam on residual oil displacement was also evaluated in porous media. A significant increment in foam longevity and improved foam rheological behavior were obtained with associative polymer presence. Compared to conventional polymer's performance, the associative polymer enhanced foam could establish the higher flow resistance and better compatibility with reservoir conditions. The addition of associative polymer profoundly increased the foam apparent viscosity and gas mobility reduction factor at optimum foam quality in the absence and presence of oil. A noticeable improvement in oil recovery efficiency was also observed in the case with associative polymer by which 28% incremental oil recovery was achieved, 14% higher than that obtained from polymer-free foam injection. The utilization of associative polymer enhanced foam is considered promising for a deepers foam propagation in the formation to recover substantial amount of residual oil. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Gold nanoparticles stabilized with ionic liquid 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide ([C(12)mim] Br) as protecting agent was successfully anchored to acid treated multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) by simple electrostatic interaction. A thin film of hybrid nanocomposite (MWCNTs-Au) was then successfully formed on glassy carbon electrode with the aid of ionic liquid N-octyl-pyridinium hexafluorophosphate. The application of the electrode for electrooxidation of dihydroxybenzene isomers was studied by cyclic voltammetry. Well-defined voltammetric peaks were obtained for a mixture of hydroquinone (HQ), catechol (CC), and resorcinol (RS) in 0.1-M PBS (pH 7.0) with a peak potential separation of 0.112 V between HQ and CC, and 0.329 V between CC and RS. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the differential pulse voltammetry current response on the fabricated electrode was linear over the wide concentration range of 0.5-110.0 mu M for HQ, 0.5-200.0 mu M for CC, and 2.0-200.0 mu M for RS. Low detection limits of 0.2, 0.2, and 0.8 mu M were obtained for HQ, CC, and RS, respectively. The developed electrochemical sensor was successfully used for the determination of dihyroxybenzene isomers in tap water sample.

ID PROFILE CONTROL; POLYMER; BEHAVIOR
AB A dispersed low-elastic microsphere system, consisting of low-viscoelastic microspheres and polymers, is a novel suspension system for enhanced oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. In this study, experiments were performed to characterize the morphology, viscoelasticity, and swelling performance of the synthetic low-elastic microspheres. The stability and rheological property of the dispersed low-elastic microsphere system was investigated using a Turbiscan Lab Expert stability analyzer and an MCR301 rheometer. In the flow and displacement experiments, the parallel-sandpacks model and microscopic visualization models were used to study the oil-displacement effect and micromigration mechanism of the low-elastic microspheres. The experimental results showed that the storage modulus (G') of the synthetic low-elastic microspheres was only 23.6 Pa and they also had a good swelling property in the simulated formation water. The parallel-sandpacks test and micromodel test indicated that the dispersed low-elastic microsphere system was a promising agent for both conformance control and improved oil recovery in heterogeneous reservoirs. Moreover, the low-elastic microspheres had good deformation and shear resistance performances. Five transport behaviors, such as deformable passing through, partition passing through, blockage, adhesion, and directly passing through, of low-elastic microspheres in a porous medium have been put forward. This study not only provides an understanding of the properties of the dispersed low-elastic microsphere system but also supplies theoretical support for the mechanism of improving oil recovery for the dispersed low-elastic microsphere system.

AB WC cemented carbides are used extensively as cutting and drilling tools in the cutter heads of the full face Tunneling Boring Machines (TBMs).
   This paper describes the effects of microstructural properties of selected cemented carbide grades, operating as cutting tools in dry and foam conditioned soil, towards abrasive wear resistance. The work was carried out with the purpose of identifying the most promising cemented carbide microstructural formulation against abrasive wear and of defining the possible changes induced on the wear mechanisms by conditioning agents.
   Microstructures of six commercial grades of cemented carbides with different Co content and WC grain size were characterized. The wear tests were carried out using a testing device simulating the working environment of TBM cutter heads both in dry and conditioned soil.
   According to all experimental findings, wear resistance of the investigated cemented carbides strongly decreases as the grain size and mean binder free path increase, regardless of the test conditions. Furthermore, the carbides distribution, hereinafter called Delaunay distance, plays a crucial role on wear behavior, having a linear relation with the specific volume loss. Moreover, the optimal microstructural features to promote wear resistance are here described. Finally, foam conditioning of soils was found to strongly influence the wear resistance, by reducing binder ploughing and WC microcracking.

AB Polyphenols are bioactive components that have attracted attention by chemists over many years. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a polyphenol that is widely investigated for its broad range of potential applications as an anti-carcinogenic agent, an anti-inflammatory drug, and antioxidant. The spectroscopic properties of this molecule are addressed in details in this study. The absorption and fluorescence of RA are investigated at different pH values, characterizing the dissociated forms of RA. In a similar manner, RA was characterized in a set of different solvents. The spectral shifts of RA in the different solvents were addressed by using the Lippert-Mataga and the Stokes' shift vs. E(T)30 plots, which revealed two sets of linearity for the behavior of RA in polar protic and aprotic solvents. The lifetime decay profile of the dissociated forms of RA and those of RA in different solvents are characterized by bi-exponential lifetime decay functions. A theoretical study on the molecular structure of the different dissociated forms of RA is also reported. The simulated UV-vis spectra of the dissociated forms of RA were studied and compared to the experimental spectra by performing TDDFT calculations. Besides the UV-simulated spectra, the frontier molecular orbitals (FMO) of the different RA dissociated forms were also calculated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), is a critical target for several inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The main restriction on designing desirable antagonists against CCR2 is the lack of appropriate crystal structure for this target. In the absence of such experimental data, computational methods triggering structure prediction provide a cost-effective option. Homology modeling has been widely used to explore GPCR structure. Within the present contribution, homology modeling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were applied to construct a reliable model for CCR2. In the present contribution, we docked INCB3344, one of the most potent CCR2 inhibitors, into the active site of the CCR2 protein. Subsequently, we studied the dynamic behavior of INCB3344-CCR2 complex in the presence of lipid membrane. Moreover; a detailed molecular mechanism of INCB3344 action has been proposed. It was revealed that Tyr120, His121, Tyr259 and Glu291 formed H-bond interactions with INCB3344 while residues such as Trp98, His202, Thr203 and Thr173 participated in hydrophobic interactions. As a consequence, a reliable homology model of CCR2 could be successfully developed on the basis of CCR5 crystallographic structure. Finally it was found that binding of INCB3344 led to the structural changes in CCR2 that provided more interaction sites. Results of this study may be useful to design further CCR2 inhibiting structures with the aim of developing desirable therapeutic agents.

The chemical and spatial network structures of the copolymer were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), and environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM). The salt, temperature, aging resistance, and rheological behavior of the copolymer were investigated in detail. The experimental results showed that the performance of DTHAP were influenced by the amount of AA, PETMAM, SDS, and NaCl in the reaction system. Compared with HPAM, DTHAP solution showed excellent temperature resistance and salt tolerance. No matter in the solution varying NaCl or CaCl2 concentration from 8 to 80 and 1 to 1.8 g/L, respectively, DTHAP behaved an obvious salt-thickening phenomenon. The simulative tertiary oil recovery tests at 80 degrees C indicated that DTHAP can remarkably enhance 16.9% of the oil recovery ratio. Even at 100 g/L salt solution, DTHAP exhibited an excellent performance which can also enhance 9.9% of oil recovery ratio. The experiment results indicated that DTHAP was superior to HPAM as a kind of oil displacement agent for enhanced oil recovery, especially in high-temperature and high-mineralization oil fields.

AB 1 SOMKO is a new simulation model of soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics aimed at predicting long-term and short-term SOM dynamics based on a mechanistic approach focusing on microbes as the key agents of decomposition.
   2 SOM is partitioned into cohorts and chemical quality pools (classified by age and chemical composition), the microbial community processes are explicitly represented, and the C : N stoichiometric constraints are accounted for through a new mechanism of offer and demand.
   3 The analysis of model equations shows that: (1) SOM C : N cannot decrease below microbial C : N; and (2) the nitrogen limitation of decomposition depends on SOM C : N, microbial biomass and soil mineral nitrogen. First tests of the: model show good qualitative behaviour for simulating the dynamics of short-term litter-bag type decomposition, longterm SOM increase, pulsed mineral nitrogen production, the priming effect due to easily decomposable carbon addition, and the effects of vegetation clearance and climate change on SOM. Simulations are in good agreement with long-term experimental data.
   4 SOMKO is an integrated component of the coupled soil-vegetation models within the ETEMA (European Terrestrial Ecosystem Modelling Activity) framework. Future extensions of this work include: (1) estimating microbial parameters from specific experiments; (2) spatial distribution of SOMKO in multistrata models; and (3) implementing nitrification/denitrification processes, phosphorus limitation and microfaunal activity.

AB Ligand-stabilized human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA is believed to be an anticancer agent, as it can impede the continuous elongation of telomeres by telomerase in cancer cells. In this study, five well-established human telomeric G-quadruplex DNA models were probed on their binding behaviors with thioflavin T (ThT) via both conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and well-tempered metadynamics (WT-MetaD) simulations. Novel dynamics and characteristic binding patterns were disclosed by the MD simulations. It was observed that the K+ promoted parallel and hybridized human telomeric G-quadruplex conformations pose higher binding affinities to ThT than the Na+ and K+ promoted basket conformations. It is the end, sandwich, and base stacking driven by pi-pi interactions that are identified as the major binding mechanisms. As the most energy favorable binding mode, the sandwich stacking observed in (3 + 1) hybridized form 1 G-quadruplex conformation is triggered by reversible conformational change of the G-quadruplex. To further examine the free energy landscapes, WT-MetaD simulations were utilized on G-quadruplex-ThT systems. It is found that all of the major binding modes predicted by the MD simulations are confirmed by the WT-MetaD simulations. The results in this work not only accord with existing experimental findings, but also reinforce our understanding on the dynamics of G-quadruplexes and aid future drug developments for G-quadruplex stabilization ligands.

AB The elevated plus-maze is an apparatus widely used to study the level of anxiety in rodents. The maze is plus-shaped, with two enclosed arms and two open arms, and elevated 50 cm from the floor. During a test, which usually lasts for 5 min, the animal is initially put at the center and is free to move and explore the entire maze. The level of anxiety is measured by variables such as the percentage of time spent and the number of entries in the enclosed arms. High percentage of time spent at and number of entries in the enclosed arms indicate anxiety. Here we propose a computational model of rat behavior in the elevated plus-maze based on an artificial neural network trained by a genetic algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is composed of reward (positive) and punishment (negative) terms, which are incremented as the computational agent (virtual rat) moves in the maze. The punishment term is modulated by a parameter that simulates the effects of different drugs. Unlike other computational models, the virtual rat is built independently of prior known experimental data. The exploratory behaviors generated by the model for different simulated pharmacological conditions are in good agreement with data from real rats. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Deriving No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) or benchmark dose is important for risk assessment and can be influenced by study design considerations. In order to define the di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) dose-response curve for reproductive malformations, we retained more offspring to adulthood to improve detection of these malformations in the reproductive assessment by continuous breeding study design. Sprague-Dawley rats were given a dietary administration of 1.5 (control), 10, 30, 100, 300, 1000, 7500, and 10,000 ppm DEHP. Male pups were evaluated for gross reproductive tract malformations (RTMs) associated with the "phthalate syndrome." DEHP treatment had minimal effects on P0 males. There was a statistically significant increase in F1 and F2 total RTMs (testis, epididymides, seminal vesicle, and prostate) in the 7500-ppm dose group and F1 10,000-ppm dose group. The 10,000-ppm exposed F1 males did not produce an F2 generation. The NOAEL for F1 and F2 RTM combined data, because in utero exposures were similar, were 100 ppm (4.8 mg/kg/day), which was close to the 5% response benchmark dose lower confidence limit of 142 ppm. The utility of evaluating more pups per litter was examined by generating power curves from a Monte Carlo simulation. These curves indicate a substantial increase in detection rate when three males are evaluated per litter rather than one. A 10% effect across male pups would be detected 5% of the time if one pup per litter was evaluated, but these effects would be detected 66% of the time if three pups per litter were evaluated. Taken together, this study provides a well-defined dose response of DEHP-induced RTMs and demonstrates that retention of more adult F1 and F2 males per litter, animals that were already produced, increases the ability to detect RTMs and presumably other low-incidence phenomena.

ID MULTICRITICAL BEHAVIOR; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; COLORS
AB We introduce a dynamical model of coupled directed percolation systems with two particle species. The two species A and B are coupled asymmetrically in that A particles branch B particles, whereas B particles prey on A particles. This model may describe epidemic spreading controlled by reactive immunization agents. We study nonequilibrium phase transitions with attention focused on the multicritical point where both species undergo the absorbing phase transition simultaneously. In one dimension, we find that the inhibitory coupling from B to A is irrelevant and the model belongs to the unidirectionally coupled directed percolation class. On the contrary, a mean-field analysis predicts that the inhibitory coupling is relevant and a new universality appears with a variable dynamic exponent. Numerical simulations on small-world networks confirm our predictions.

DE DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEM; FINITE ELEMENT ANALYSIS; GELS; HYDROGELS
AB Hydrogels are being investigated as drug delivery mechanisms. Gels can be impregnated with a drug and then stimulated through various means to release it. Having the capability to predict the dynamic behaviour of the release process numerically would benefit the design and control of such a process. In this paper, a finite element analysis is used to simulate the dynamic behaviour of an eroding polyelectrolyte gel. The gel is impregnated in a collapsed state. It is then subjected to a higher pH environment, causing it to swell. When it has swollen to a specified extent, the gel erodes, thereby releasing the drug agent. Such gels are currently being investigated in drug delivery schemes to the colon.

The described software TEAGPERT designs such separation processes by using heuristic rules for the selection and the design of flowsheet elements as well as numeric programs and databases. Based on an analysis of the boiling behavior of tie mixture TEAGPERT selects thermodynamically proven separation units. In addition, a first mass balance is calculated which serves as a starting point for further detailed simulations with common flowsheet simulators. The paper describes in detail the use of the software for the prediction of separating cuts. In addition, a design procedure for heteroazeotropic distillation processes with mass agents is presented.

AB In this work, we present a systematic study of the nature of the Ru-NO bond, reduction potential, and behavior in the solution of several ruthenium nitrosyl complexes of the typetrans-[Ru(NH3)(4)(L)(NO)](2+/3+)(L= Cl, H2O, NH3, OH, py = pyridine, POEt3= triethylphosphite, TVP = trivinyl phosphite) and [Ru(salen)(L)(NO)](2+/3+)(L= Cl, H2O) in different charge and spin states. We employed density functional theory, complete active space self-consistent field, the quantum theory of atoms in molecules, charge decomposition analysis, and Monte Carlo statistical simulation in aqueous solution to investigate how the different ligands on the coordination sphere of the ruthenium atom can affect the nature of the Ru-NO bond and, therefore, its reactivity, reduction potential, and solvation properties. The nature of the Ru-NO bond varies significantly between the singlet, doublet, and triplet electronic states of these complexes, in part due to the change in the coordination mode of the NO ligand and also due to the electron correlation effects along the Ru-NO bond that changes drastically. For all complexes studied, the Ru-NO bond shows some intriguing characteristics, such as large kinetic energy density and considerable amount of electron localization between the atoms, besides high multiconfigurational character, with a significant contribution from the Ru-III-NO(0)configuration. In addition, for all the complexes investigated, the NO ligand does not interact with the solvent through hydrogen bonds, making this group accessible for chemical reactions in solution. Another important finding was that some of the Ru-III-NO compounds can be reduced by biological reducing agents in the singlet ground state, while all of them have high reduction potentials in the triplet excited state, making them suitable candidates for the photorelease of nitric oxide.

AB The diffusion of tracer particles in 3D macromolecular crowded media has been studied using two methodologies, simulation and experimental, with the aim of comparing their results. First, the diffusion of a tracer in an obstructed 3D lattice with mobile and big size obstacles has been analyzed through a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation procedure. Secondly, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments have been carried out to study the diffusion of a model protein (alpha-chymotrypsin) in in vitro crowded solution where two type of Dextran molecules are used as crowder agents. To facilitate the comparison, the relative size between the tracer and the crowder is the same in both studies. The results indicate a qualitative agreement between the diffusional behaviors observed in the two studies. The dependence of the anomalous diffusion exponent and the limiting diffusion coefficient on the obstacle size and excluded volume shows, in both cases, a similar tendency. The introduction of a reduced mobility parameter in the simulation model accounting for the short-range tracer-obstacle interactions allows obtaining a quantitative agreement between the limiting diffusion coefficient values yielded by both procedures. The simulation-experiment quantitative agreement for the anomalous diffusion exponent requires further improvements. As far as we know, this is the first reported work where both techniques are used in parallel to study the diffusion in macromolecular crowded media.

AB Stanford type A aortic dissection often rapidly leads to death from aortic rupture. We considered the possibility of introducing a passive counterpulsating damper into the dissected aorta in order to limit the physical stress associated with ventricular ejection and increase the diastolic aorto-ventricular pressure gradient. We conceived a damping device comprising an intravascular balloon connected to an adjustable external reservoir to regulate the air pressure inside the balloon, and performed a simulation study using a mechanical model of the cardiovascular system, mimicking aortic dissection. When the balloon was completely deflated, the behavior of the aortic pressure signal was typical of low-compliance aortic dissection, as characterized by an augmented maximum systolic value, accentuated diastolic decay, and a very low end-diastolic value. Balloon inflation (at incremental steps to 90 mmHg) progressively restored the aorto-ventricular pressure gradient and reduced peak systolic pressure values, leading to progressive improvements in the characteristics of the aortic pressure curve in terms of reduction in the maximum systolic value and slower diastolic decay. The proposed mechanism might exert beneficial effects at two levels: (1) directly, by reducing mechanical stress on the arterial wall; (2) indirectly, by allowing safer use of pharmaceutical agents (beta-blockers etc.). In vivo animal simulation studies are warranted to verify the effects of the device and optimize balloon shape and volume in a realistic pathophysiological setting. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose. To determine corneal absorption and desorption rate constants in a corneal epithelial cell culture model and to apply them to predict ocular pharmacokinetics after topical ocular drug application.
   Method. In vitro permeation experiments were performed with a mixture of six beta-blockers using an immortalized human corneal epithelial cell culture model. Disappearance of the compounds from the apical donor solution and their appearance in the basolateral receiver solution were determined and used to calculate the corneal absorption and desorption rate constants. An ocular pharmacokinetic simulation model was constructed for timolol with the Stella(R) program using the absorption and desorption rate constants and previously published in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters.
   Results. The corneal absorption rates of beta-blockers increased significantly with the lipophilicity of the compounds. The pharmacokinetic simulation model gave a realistic mean residence time for timolol in the cornea (57 min) and the aqueous humor (90 min). The simulated timolol concentration in the aqueous humor was about 1.8 times higher than the previously published experimental values.
   Conclusions. The simulation model gave a reasonable estimate of the aqueous humor concentration profile of timolol. This was the first attempt to combine cell culture methods and pharmacokinetic modeling for prediction of ocular pharmacokinetics. The wider applicability of this approach remains to be seen.

AB The last decade has seen sharp progress in the field of human evolutionary genetics and a great amount of genetic evidence of natural selection has been provided so far. Since host-pathogen co-evolution is difficult to trace due to the polygenic nature of human susceptibility to microbial diseases, of particular interest is any signal of natural selection in response to the strong selective pressure exerted by pathogens. Analysis of ancient DNA allows for the direct insight into changes of a gene pool content over time and enables monitoring allele frequency fluctuations. Among pathogenic agents, mycobacteria are proved to have remained in an intimate, long-lasting relation with humans, reflected by the current high level of host resistance. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of several polymorphisms within innate immune response genes related to susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases (in SLC11A1, MBL2, TLR2, P2RX7, IL10, TNFA) in time series data from North and East Poland (1st-18th century AD, it = 207). The comparison of allele frequencies over time revealed a predominant role of genetic drift in shaping past gene pool of small, probably isolated groups, which was explained by the high level of population differentiation and limited gene flow. However, the trajectory of frequency fluctuations of two SNPs suggested the possibility of their non-neutral evolution and the results of applied forward simulations further strengthened the hypothesis of natural selection acting on those loci. However, we observed an unusual excess of homozygosity in the profile of several SNPs, which pinpoints to the necessity of further research on temporally and spatially diverse samples to support our inference on non-stochastic evolution, ideally employing pathway-based approaches. Nevertheless, our study confirms that time series data could help to decipher very recent human adaptation to life-threatening pathogens and assisting demographic events.

AB Significant computational efforts have been focused toward exposing the molecular mechanisms of anesthesia in recent years. In the past decade, this has been aided considerably by a momentous increase in the number of high-resolution structures of ion channels, which are putative targets for the anesthetic agents, as well as advancements in high-performance computing technologies. In this review, typical simulation methods to investigate the behavior of model membranes and membrane-protein systems are briefly reviewed, and related computational studies are surveyed. Both lipid- and protein-mediated mechanisms of anesthetic action are scrutinized, focusing on the behavior of ion channels in the latter case.

AB Drug delivery technologies are an important area within biomedicine. Targeted drug delivery aims to reduce the undesired side effects of drug usage by directing or capturing the active agents near a desired site within the body. This is particularly beneficial in, for instance, cancer chemotherapy, where the side effects of general (systemic) drug administration can be severe.
   One approach to targeted drug delivery uses magnetic nanoparticles as the constituents of carriers for the desired active agent. Once injected into the body, the behaviour of these magnetic carriers can be influenced and controlled by magnetic fields. In implant assisted magnetic drug targeting systems a magnetic implant, typically a stent, wire or spherical seed can be used to target sites deep within the body as the implant acts as a focus for the resulting magnetic force. This can be easily understood as the force depends on the gradient of the magnetic field and the gradient near the implant is large.
   In designing such a system many factors need to be considered including physical factors such as the size and nature of the implants and carriers, and the fields required. Moreover, the range of applicability of these systems in terms of the regions of the vasculature system, from low blood velocity environments, such as capillary beds to higher velocity arteries, must be considered. Furthermore, assessment criteria for these systems are needed. Mathematical modelling and simulation has a valuable role to play in informing in vitro and in vivo experiments, leading to practical system design.
   Specifically, the implant assisted magnetic drug targeting systems of Aviles. Ebner and Ritter are considered within this review, and two dimensional mathematical modelling is performed using the open source C++ finite volume library OpenFOAM. In the first system treated, a large ferromagnetic particle is implanted into a capillary bed as a seed to aid collection of single domain nanoparticles (radius 20-100 nm). The Langevin function is used to calculate the magnetic moment of the particles, and the model is further adapted to treat the agglomeration of particles known to occur in these systems. This agglomeration can be attributed to interparticle interactions and here the magnetic dipole-dipole and hydrodynamic interactions for two mutually interacting nanoparticles are modelled, following Mikkelsen et al. who treated two particle interactions in microfluidic systems, with low magnetic field (0.05 T). The resulting predicted performance is found to both increase and decrease significantly depending on initial positions of the particles. Secondly, a ferromagnetic, coiled wire stent is implanted in a large arterial vessel. The magnetic dipole-dipole and hydrodynamic interactions for multiple particles are included. Different initial positions are considered and the system performance is assessed. Inclusion of these interactions yields predictions that are in closer agreement with the experimental results of Aviles et al. We conclude that the discrepancies between the non interacting theoretical predictions and the corresponding experimental results can (as suggested by Aviles et al.) be largely attributed to interparticle interactions and the consequent agglomeration.

AB Studies of forest declines are important, because they both reduce timber production and affect successional trajectories of landscapes and ecosystems. Of particular interest is the decline of red pines, which is characterized by expanding areas of dead and chlorotic trees in plantations throughout the Great Lakes region. Here we examine the impact of two bark beetle groups, red turpentine beetles and pine engraver bark beetles, on tree mortality and the subsequent gap formation over time in a plantation in Wisconsin. We construct spatial-temporal statistical models that quantify the relations among red turpentine beetle colonization, pine engraver bark beetle colonization, and mortality of red pine trees while accounting for correlation across space and over time. We extend traditional Markov random-field models to include temporal terms and multiple-response variables aimed at developing a suitable set of statistical models for addressing the scientific questions about the forest ecosystem under study. For statistical inference, we adopt a Bayesian hierarchical modeling approach and devise Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for obtaining the posterior distributions of model parameters as well as posterior predictive distributions. In particular, we implement path sampling combined with perfect simulation for autologistic models while formally addressing the posterior propriety under an improper uniform prior. Our data analysis results suggest that red turpentine beetle colonization is associated with a higher likelihood of pine engraver bark beetle colonization and that pine engraver bark beetle colonization is associated with higher likelihood of red pine tree mortality, whereas there is no direct association between red turpentine beetle colonization and red pine tree mortality. There is strong evidence that red turpentine beetle colonization does not kill a red pine tree directly, but rather predisposes the tree to subsequent colonization by pine engraver bark beetles. The evidence is also strong that pine engraver bark beetles are the ultimate mortality agents of red pine trees.

ID HEALTH
AB The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is still an unresolved problem worldwide. In intensive care units (ICUs), first-line antibiotic therapy is highly standardized and widely empiric while treatment failure because of AMR often has severe consequences. Simultaneously, there is a limited number of reserve antibiotics, whose prices and/or side effects are substantially higher than first-line therapy. This paper explores the implications of resistance-induced substitution effects in ICUs. The extent of such substitution effects is shown in a dynamic fixed effect regression analysis using a panel of 66 German ICUs with monthly antibiotic use and resistance data between 2001 and 2012. Our findings support the hypothesis that demand for reserve antibiotics substantially increases when resistance towards first-line agents rises. For some analyses the lagged effect of resistance is also significant, supporting the conjecture that part of the substitution effect is caused by physicians changing antibiotic choices in empiric treatment by adapting their resistance expectation to new information on resistance prevalence. The available information about resistance rates allows physicians to efficiently balance the trade-off between exacerbating resistance and ensuring treatment success. However, resistance-induced substitution effects are not free of charge. These effects should be considered an indirect burden of AMR. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper embeds time-varying volatility into a dynamic equilibrium model of returns and trading. The model allows us to ask how time-varying volatility might affect the relation among return autocorrelation, volatility, and trading volume, as opposed to the pairwise relations that have been studied previously. It is shown analytically that, with time-varying volatility, the relationship between volume and stock return autocorrelation is ambiguous even if agents have symmetric information, which may explain the contradictory findings in the empirical literature, In the numerical exercise, the model is simulated in a way that mimics the persistent volatility of high-frequency stock data documented in numerous empirical studies, Specially, the time-varying volatility of stock returns is approximated with a highly persistent chaotic tent map, which is known to have the same autocorrelation coefficients as an AR(1) process. The simulated data can approximate GARCH-type behavior very well. Whereas in the simulated data, no significant relation between volume and return autocorrelation can be found, there is a significantly positive relation between volume and one-step-ahead stock return volatility. The ambiguous volume-persistence and positive volume-volatility relations are confirmed empirically by using four heavily traded individual stocks. Therefore, the data simulated from the highly stylized asset pricing model with deterministic time-varying volatility can mimic well the volume-return dynamics revealed in the observed data in these two respects.

AB Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.

AB A sensitive, reliable and accurate UHPLC-MS/MS method has been firstly established and validated for the simultaneous quantification of ginkgo flavonoids, terpene lactones and nimodipine in rat plasma after oral administration of Ginkgo biloba dispersible tablets, Nimodipine tablets and the combination of the both, respectively. The plasma samples were extracted by two step liquid-liquid extraction, nimodipine was extracted by hexane-ether (3:1, v/v) at the first step, after that ginkgo flavonoids and terpene lactones were extracted by ethyl acetate. Then the analytes were successfully separated by running gradient elution with the mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and methanol at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min. The detection of the analytes was performed on a UHPLC-MS/MS system with turbo ion spray source in the negative ion and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The calibration curves for the determination of all the analytes showed good linearity (R-2 > 0.99), and the lower limits of quantification were 0.50-4.00 ng/mL. Intra-day and inter-day precisions were in the range of 3.6%-9.2% and 3.2%-13.1% for all the analytes. The mean extraction recoveries of the analytes were within 69.82%-103.5% and the matrix were within 82.8%-110.0%. The validated method had been successfully applied to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of ginkgo flavonoids, terpene lactones and nimodipine in rat plasma after oral administration of Ginkgo biloba dispersible tablets, Nimodipine tablets with the combination of the both. There were no statistically significant differences on the pharmacokinetic behaviors of all the analytes between the combined and single administration groups. Results showed that the combination of the two agents may avoid dosage adjustments in clinic and the combination is more convenient as well as efficient on different pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia.

AB Based on the seminal work of He and Li (J Econ Dyn Cont 36:973-987, 2012) on a financial market of heterogeneous beliefs and adaptive behavior, we further propose a model of five dimensional differential delay equations with time varying fundamental price. It is shown that not only the rational behavior of heterogeneous agents routes, but also the fluctuant fundamental price to market instability in continuous time. Oscillatory dynamics of the model are studied by analyzing the associated characteristic equation of the delay differential system. Numerical simulations indicate that the fluctuant fundamental price can obviously increases the financial market amplitude of vibration.

AB Body size is a key trait linked to many aspects of an organism's life history, physiology, and behavior. Variation in body size can thus have important fitness consequences across a broad range of ecological contexts. We utilized the variation in multiple abiotic and biotic factors found among urban habitats to test simultaneously their relative effects on body size variation in urban populations of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei). These factors represent major hypotheses regarding body size variation in ectotherms and other animal groups: temperature, food availability, conspecific abundance and predator abundance. We also performed a tethered intruder experiment to determine whether the attack behavior of predatory curly-tailed lizards (Leiocephalus carinatus) depends on the body size of their brown anole prey. Lastly, we conducted a common garden experiment to assess whether brown anole body size differences between sites with and without curly-tailed lizard predators are genetically based. Predator abundance was the primary predictor of brown anole body size for both males and females. No other hypotheses were consistently supported. Brown anole body size increased along with increasing predator abundance, and predator abundance was negatively related to body size variation. Additionally, predators approached larger brown anoles less often and at longer latencies compared to smaller ones. Finally, male brown anoles from sites with predators had faster growth rates compared to those from sites without predators under common conditions in the lab. Brown anole body size differences among populations may result from higher survival of larger lizards during predatory confrontations, and this trait is at least partially heritable in males. Therefore, our results suggest that curly-tailed lizard predators may be important agents of evolution by natural selection for brown anole populations in urban habitats. To further investigate the ecological and evolutionary consequences of predator-prey interactions in urban habitats, future research should focus on measuring predator-induced selection in these novel environments.

AB Background: Patients with chronic lumbar back pain (CLBP) often present with an altered gait profile, which is a crucial element of good functioning in everyday life. In patients with multisegmental spinal pathologies and incongruity between radiologic imaging and clinical presentation, inpatient gradual diagnostics (IGD) is performed to determine the precise origin of the disabling pain. The underlying principle of IGD is the assumption that by locally administering an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent to possible surgical target areas, the surgical effect can be temporarily simulated. The conclusions drawn from IGD are, however, mostly based on the patients' subjective feedback about pain relief.
   Research Question: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether reported pain relief during IGD can be objectified by gait analysis. We hypothesized that patients with greater pain relief during IGD would show greater improvement in their pathologic gait and stance.
   Methods: Treadmill gait and stance analyses were prospectively performed on CLBP patients before and after a one-week IGD. Self-report measures included the numeric pain rating scale (NRS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
   Results and Significance: Compared with a reference group (n = 28), IGD patients (n = 57) at admission showed reduced velocity, cadence, step length, and swing phase (p < .01 each). Their stance phase was increased by 5% of the gait cycle, and a more asymmetrical total load distribution during stance was observed. No difference was seen in stride width or foot rotation. While many patients reported good pain relief during IGD, no correlation was observed between subjective improvement and treadmill measures.
   We can thus confirm a pathologic gait profile in patients with CLBP. Based on our findings, gait analysis would not yet seem suitable to objectify IGD results. The short time interval between admission and discharge may not suffice to change a pathological gait that has developed over years.

AB In this article, we address the interrelated challenges of predicting user comfort and using this to reduce energy consumption in smart heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. At present, such systems use simple models of user comfort when deciding on a set-point temperature. Being built using broad population statistics, these models generally fail to represent individual users' preferences, resulting in poor estimates of the users' preferred temperatures. To address this issue, we propose the Bayesian Comfort Model (BCM). This personalised thermal comfort model uses a Bayesian network to learn from a user's feedback, allowing it to adapt to the users' individual preferences over time. We further propose an alternative to the ASHRAE 7-point scale used to assess user comfort. Using this model, we create an optimal HVAC control algorithm that minimizes energy consumption while preserving user comfort. Through an empirical evaluation based on the ASHRAE RP-884 dataset and data collected in a separate deployment by us, we show that our model is consistently 13.2% to 25.8% more accurate than current models and how using our alternative comfort scale can increase our model's accuracy. Through simulations we show that using this model, our HVAC control algorithm can reduce energy consumption by 7.3% to 13.5% while decreasing user discomfort by 24.8% simultaneously.

Emergent statistical correlation between the distributions of outgoing and incoming links is a key feature of the dynamics of the Web. The growth phase is characterized by temporal fractal structures which are manifested in the hierarchical organization of links. We obtain quantitative agreement with the recent empirical data in the real Web for the distributions of in- and out-links and for the size of the connected component. In a fully grown network of N nodes, we study the structure of connected clusters of nodes that are accessible along outgoing links from a randomly selected node. The distributions of size and depth of the connected clusters with a giant component exhibit supercritical behavior. By decreasing the control parameter - average fraction beta of updated and added links per time step - towards beta (c)(N) < 10% the Web can resume a critical structure with no giant component in it. We find a different universality class when the updates of links are not allowed, i.e., for <beta> equivalent to 0, corresponding to the network of science citations. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB We show that the introduction of Tobin taxes in agent-based models of currency markets can lead to a reduction of both speculative trading and the magnitude of exchange rate fluctuations at intermediate tax rates. In this regime revenues obtained from speculators are maximal for the institutions acting as market makers. We here focus on minority game models of markets, which are accessible by exact techniques from statistical mechanics. Results are supported by computer simulations. Our findings suggest that at finite systems sizes the effect is most pronounced in a critical region around the phase transition of the infinite system, but much weaker if the market is operating far from criticality and does not exhibit anomalous fluctuations.

ID STATISTICS; TUTORIAL
AB A model for continuous-opinion dynamics is proposed and studied by taking advantage of its similarities with a mono-dimensional granular gas. Agents interact as in the Deffuant model, with a parameter alpha controlling the persuasibility of the individuals. The interaction coincides with the collision rule of two grains moving on a line, provided opinions and velocities are identified, with alpha being the so-called coefficient of normal restitution. Starting from the master equation of the probability density of all opinions, general conditions are given for the system to reach consensus. The case when the interaction frequency is proportional to the beta-power of the relative opinions is studied in more detail. It is shown that the mean-field approximation to the master equation leads to the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the opinion distribution. In this case, the system always approaches consensus, which can be seen as the approach to zero of the opinion temperature, a measure of the width of the opinion distribution. Moreover, the long-time behaviour of the system is characterized by a scaling solution to the Boltzmann equation in which all time dependence occurs through the temperature. The case beta = 0 is related to the Deffuant model and is analytically soluble. The scaling distribution is unimodal and independent of alpha. For beta > 0 the distribution of opinions is unimodal below a critical value of vertical bar alpha vertical bar, being multimodal with two maxima above it. This means that agents may approach consensus while being polarized. Near the critical points and for vertical bar alpha vertical bar >= 0.4, the distribution of opinions is well approximated by the sum of two Gaussian distributions. Monte Carlo simulations are in agreement with the theoretical results. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Six field experiments tested the effects of the microbial pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) on pestiferous black flies (primarily the Simulium jenningsi group) as well as nontarget macroinvertebrates and fish in the Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania. The response of black fly drift after the Bti application was similar across all experiments. Black fly drift increased significantly within 0.5 It after application, peaked 2-3 h after application, and then remained high for several hours. Significant changes in drift were observed after Bti application for 31 of the 50 nontarget macroinvertebrate taxa examined, but none of these taxa exhibited an increase in drift density similar in magnitude and timing to that of black flies. Furthermore, none of the 31 taxa exhibited the same drift changes in all experiments, as was observed for black flies; most of the taxa exhibited a drift density change during only one posttreatment sample period within a single experiment. Most nontarget macroinvertebrates therefore appeared unaffected by Bti, including the chironomid midge Rheotanytarsus, which was previously reported as Bti sensitive. Fish species composition and abundance in riffles did not change following the Bti application. The importance of black flies in fish diets varied dramatically among individual fish, sampling periods, and years. Variation in the number of black flies in fish diets may reflect variation in discharge as well as in black fly and fish behavior. The number of black flies consumed did not increase immediately after Bti application (when black fly drift was high) or decrease later (when black fly densities were suppressed). Fish condition and short-term (7-10-d) growth rates did not change consistently across experiments. The absence of repeated responses that paralleled the magnitude of black fly responses suggests that the statistically significant changes observed for nontarget macroinvertebrates and fish were unrelated to the Bti application. Thus, we found no evidence that a single Bti application affected nontarget macroinvertebrates and fish to an ecologically significant extent.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to design a parking space management platform to alleviate the parking problem and a two-stage solution for sharing and allocating parking spaces. Design/methodology/approach The market design mechanism and auction mechanism are integrated to solve the problem of parking space sharing and allocation. In the first stage, the market design mechanism with two rules is applied for making the good use of idle parking spaces. In the second stage, two sequential auction mechanisms are designed by extending first/second-price sealed bid auction mechanism to allocate both private and public parking spaces, which are received in previous stage and owned by the platform. Two stages are connected through a forecasted price which is calculated through the exponential smoothing method. Findings First, we prove three important properties of the proposed sequential auction mechanisms, namely, incentive compatibility, revenue equivalence and individual rationality. Second, a simulation study is used to verify the effectiveness of the mechanisms through numerical analysis. The impact of the system on three parts, namely, agents (private parking space suppliers), bidders (parking space customers) and the platform, is examined. Third, the results show that the sharing mechanism with monetrary incentive will attract a number of agents to join in the platform. The bidders are also able to obtain considerable utility, as compared with the (average) market parking fees. The platform can thus effectively allocate parking spaces with reasonable prices. Originality/value This paper combines the classical sequential auction mechanisms with the market design mechanism for the parking space sharing and allocation problem. The modeling and analysis method can also be used to address the similar allocation and pricing problems of other resources like bicycle sharing.

AB In this paper, an optimal control problem for a large system of interacting agents is considered using a kinetic perspective. As a prototype model, we analyze a microscopic model of opinion formation under constraints. For this problem, a Boltzmann-type equation based on a model predictive control formulation is introduced and discussed. In particular, the receding horizon strategy permits to embed the minimization of suitable cost functional into binary particle interactions. The corresponding Fokker-Planck asymptotic limit is also derived and explicit expressions of stationary solutions are given. Several numerical results showing the robustness of the present approach are finally reported.

SO SYSTEM DYNAMICS REVIEW

DT Article
AB Land use transport interaction models have been developed in various forms dating back to the early 1960s. They have moved from spatial interaction models or statistical models through econometric models to micro-simulation, cell-based automata and agent-based models. There has been a move towards more detail in representing space and individual behaviour. This paper presents an alternative approach which uses an intentionally developed strategic high-level model. Nevertheless this model still delivers comparable levels of statistical fit in terms of validation but is easy to present to decision makers and planners. The paper introduces the concepts behind the MARS model, deals with validation and transferability between cities and provides example applications. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   EVOLUTION; ALTRUISM; RECIPROCITY
AB We investigate and generalize an existing model of competitive helping within a biological market, first introduced for a population of competing individuals in which one individual provides help to all others; the rest compete for the help available from this individual by providing help themselves. Our generalized model comprises two strategies in which each individual of a specific type provides the same amount of help as all other individuals of that type. Each individual's fitness function is dependent on this level of help, the cost of providing the help, and the fact that help is proportionally reciprocated by other individuals. Competitive helping occurs when individuals actively try to help more than other individuals. To assess the emergence of equilibrium help strategies as adopted by proportions of the population, we examine the competition over available help within two settings: replicator dynamics and agent-based numerical simulations. To move one step further in our generalization, we use the agent-based model to study the N-person competitive helping game, where all individuals in the population are heterogeneous with respect to help provided. Our results show that helping does not increase indefinitely with the population size, as concluded previously, and while there are some instances of an increase in help provided as a result of competition, this competition can be detrimental to all individuals and in most cases, one type simply gives up (thus evolving to a "no help" strategy). The degree to which an individual's help is reciprocated by the others in the population has strong implications in the long-term behaviour of equilibrium help levels of types of individuals (and of individuals themselves); these equilibrium help levels diverge from existing conjectures in current literature. Lastly, small amounts of passively provided (costless) help results in runaway competition among all individuals.

AB The utility of Agent Based Models (ABMs) for decision making support as well as for scientific applications can be increased considerably by the availability and use of methodologies for thorough model behaviour analysis. In view of their intrinsic construction, ABMs have to be analysed numerically. Furthermore, ABM behaviour is often complex, featuring strong non-linearities, tipping points, and adaptation. This easily leads to high computational costs, presenting a serious practical limitation. Model developers and users alike would benefit from methodologies that can explore large parts of parameter space at limited computational costs. In this paper we present a methodology that makes this possible. The essence of our approach is to develop a cost-effective surrogate model based on ABM output using machine learning to approximate ABM simulation data. The development consists of two steps, both with iterative loops of training and cross-validation. In the first part, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) is developed to split behaviour space into regions of qualitatively different behaviour. In the second part, a Support Vector Regression (SVR) is developed to cover the quantitative behaviour within these regions. Finally, sensitivity indices are calculated to rank the importance of parameters for describing the boundaries between regions, and for the quantitative dynamics within regions. The methodology is demonstrated in three case studies, a differential equation model of predator-prey interaction, a common-pool resource ABM and an ABM representing the Philippine tuna fishery. In all cases, the model and the corresponding surrogate model show a good match. Furthermore, different parameters are shown to influence the quantitative outcomes, compared to those that influence the underlying qualitative behaviour. Thus, the method helps to distinguish which parameters determine the boundaries in parameter space between regions that are separated by tipping points, or by any criterion of interest to the user.

AB This paper describes a novel method for building affectively intellignt human-interactive agents. The method is based on a key sociological insight that has been developed and extensively verified over the last twenty years, but has yet to make an impact in artificial intelligence. The insight is that resource bounded humans will, by default, act to maintain affective consistency. Humans have culturally shared fundamental affective sentiments about identities, behaviours, and objects, and they act so that the transient affective sentiments created during interactions confirm the fundamental sentiments. Humans seek and create situations that confirm or are consistent with, and avoid and suppress situations that disconfirm or are inconsistent with, their culturally shared affective sentiments. This "affect control principle" has been shown to be a powerful predictor of human behaviour. In this paper, we present a probabilistic and decision-theoretic generalisation of this principle, and we demonstrate how it can be leveraged to build affectively intelligent artificial agents. The new model, called BayesAct, can maintain multiple hypotheses about sentiments simultaneously as a probability distribution, and can make use of an explicit utility function to make value-directed action choices. This allows the model to generate affectively intelligent interactions with people by learning about their identity, predicting their behaviours using the affect control principle, and taking actions that are simultaneously goal-directed and affect-sensitive. We demonstrate this generalisation with a set of simulations. We then show how our model can be used as an emotional "plug-in" for artificially intelligent systems that interact with humans in two different settings: an exam practice assistant (tutor) and an assistive device for persons with a cognitive disability.

AB In vivo and in vitro studies give a paradoxical picture of the actions of the key regulatory factor TGF-beta 1 in epidermal wound healing with it stimulating migration of keratinocytes but also inhibiting their proliferation. To try to reconcile these into an easily visualized 3D model of wound healing amenable for experimentation by cell biologists, a multiscale model of the formation of a 3D skin epithelium was established with TGF-beta 1 literature-derived rule sets and equations embedded within it. At the cellular level, an agent-based bottom-up model that focuses on individual interacting units ( keratinocytes) was used. This was based on literature-derived rules governing keratinocyte behavior and keratinocyte/ECM interactions. The selection of these rule sets is described in detail in this paper. The agent-based model was then linked with a subcellular model of TGF-beta 1 production and its action on keratinocytes simulated with a complex pathway simulator. This multiscale model can be run at a cellular level only or at a combined cellular/subcellular level. It was then initially challenged ( by wounding) to investigate the behavior of keratinocytes in wound healing at the cellular level. To investigate the possible actions of TGF-beta 1, several hypotheses were then explored by deliberately manipulating some of these rule sets at subcellular levels. This exercise readily eliminated some hypotheses and identified a sequence of spatial-temporal actions of TGF-beta 1 for normal successful wound healing in an easy-to-follow 3D model. We suggest this multiscale model offers a valuable, easy-to-visualize aid to our understanding of the actions of this key regulator in wound healing, and provides a model that can now be used to explore pathologies of wound healing.

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the relevance of the in vitro permeation method used at our laboratory in predicting in vivo dermal and transdermal absorption. Two different emulsions, a submicron oil-in-water (o/w) emulsion and a semisolid water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion, containing a model compound were investigated. The in vitro permeation rate of the compound from these emulsions was measured using static diffusion cells with human skin as membrane. The emulsions were allowed to remain in contact with the skin in the donor chamber for 15, 60, and 240 min. The study was monitored for 240 min and the steady state flux was calculated. The systemic concentration of the compound was measured in vivo as a function of time after dermal application to healthy volunteers with 15 and 60 min of application. A short-lasting i.v. infusion study in healthy volunteers was used to simulate the i.v. bolus dose. Numerical convolution was used to predict the in vivo plasma concentration of the compound while the in vivo absorption rate of the compound was estimated using numerical deconvolution. To establish correlation, the predicted in vivo flux was compared with the corresponding observed in vitro parameter after adjusting for the lag time. No major differences were seen in the systemic plasma levels between the two emulsions, which is in close agreement with the steady state flux measured in vitro. A linear correlation representing a point-to-point relationship was established for each of the investigated formulations and application times. The longer application time was predicted more accurately for both emulsions. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmaceutical Association.

AB This study proposes a framework for human-like autonomous car-following planning based on deep reinforcement learning (deep RL). Historical driving data are fed into a simulation environment where an RL agent learns from trial and error interactions based on a reward function that signals how much the agent deviates from the empirical data. Through these interactions, an optimal policy, or car-following model that maps in a human-like way from speed, relative speed between a lead and following vehicle, and inter-vehicle spacing to acceleration of a following vehicle is finally obtained. The model can be continuously updated when more data are fed in. Two thousand car-following periods extracted from the 2015 Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study were used to train the model and compare its performance with that of traditional and recent data driven car-following models. As shown by this study's results, a deep deterministic policy gradient car-following model that uses disparity between simulated and observed speed as the reward function and considers a reaction delay of 1 s, denoted as DDPGvRT, can reproduce human-like car following behavior with higher accuracy than traditional and recent data-driven car-following models. Specifically, the DDPGvRT model has a spacing validation error of 18% and speed validation error of 5%, which are less than those of other models, including the intelligent driver model, models based on locally weighted regression, and conventional neural network-based models. Moreover, the DDPGvRT demonstrates good capability of generalization to various driving situations and can adapt to different drivers by continuously learning. This study demonstrates that reinforcement learning methodology can offer insight into driver behavior and can contribute to the development of human-like autonomous driving algorithms and traffic-flow models.

AB Reactive extrusion was used to modify virgin polyamides 6 (v-PA6) and to prepare chain extended PA6 (CE-PA6) and long-chain branched PA6 (LCB-PA6) for the melt foaming process. This was done using a twin-screw extruder and the following modifiers: a chain extender ADR-4368 and a branching agent maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene. A reaction mechanism was proposed to explain the chain extension and long-chain branching reactions and was verified by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy data. The analysis of the gel permeation chromatography data showed that LCB-PA6 presented a strong increase in the molecular weight and in the dispersity index. Moreover, the rheological properties of the v-PA6 and modified PA6 resins were characterized by a dynamic shear test. The LCB-PA6 compared with CE-PA6 showed much higher shear viscosity and longer characteristic relaxation times, indicating the presence of an LCB structure. A uniaxial elongation test showed that the LCB-PA6 had the highest melt viscosity and melt strength as well as most obvious strain-hardening behavior. A high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter under compressed CO2 was used to investigate the PA6's crystallization properties so as to analyze its minimum temperature of foaming windows. The melt foamability of the CE-PA6 and the LCB-PA6 was verified by batch melt foaming experiments with CO2 as the blowing agent and maximum temperature of foaming windows was also quantitatively determined by numerical simulation of bubble growth based on the rheological measurements. The results showed that the LCB-PA6 foams had a smaller cell diameter, a larger cell density, a greater expansion ratio, and wider foaming temperature window than the CE-PA6.

AB Motorized transport is one of the main contributors to anthropogenic emissions, which cause global warming. Other emissions, like nitrogen oxides or carbon monoxide, are detrimental to human health. A prominent way to understand and thus be able to minimize emissions is by using traffic simulations to evaluate different scenarios. In that way, one can find out which policies, technical innovations, or behavioral changes can lead to a decrease in emissions. Since the effect of COis on a global scale, a macroscopic model is often enough to find reasonable results. However, NOemissions can also have a direct, local effect. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate these emissions on a mesoscopic scale, to gain insight into the local distribution of this pollutant. In this study, we used a traffic model that, contrary to most other state-of-the-art traffic simulations, does not require an origin-destination matrix as an input, but calculates it from mobility behavior extracted from a survey. We then generated agents with realistic mobility behavior that perform their daily trips and calculate key features like congestion and emissions for every edge of the road network. Our approach has the additional advantage of allowing to investigate technical, juridical, as well as behavioral changes, all within the same framework. It is then possible to identify strategies that minimize NOemissions caused by private motorized transport. Evaluation showed good agreement with reality in terms of local and temporal resolution. Especially when looking at the sum of emissions, the main feature for evaluating policies, and deviations between our simulation and available statistics were negligible. We found that, from all scenarios we investigated, the ban of old diesel cars is the most promising policy: By replacing all diesel cars built in 2005 or earlier with petrol cars of the same age, NOemissions could drop by roughly a third.

AB The continuous increases in the numbers of road traffic crashes (RTC) over the years, especially in developing countries, have been a source of worry. The majority of the RTC are attributed to road user behaviours exhibited by the drivers. This study sets out to investigate the road user attitudes and behaviours in Abuja, Nigeria. A total of 1526 questionnaires were distributed, of which 321 questionnaires were completed and returned. The questionnaires tried to understand four major road user behaviours, namely use of seatbelts, drink driving, use of mobile phone while driving, and use of child restraints. The results after analysing the questionnaires showed that the majority of the road users in Abuja showed high non-compliance with the use of seatbelts, either when driving or when being driven. About 64% of the respondents admitted to not using seatbelts. Results from the cross-tabulation process showed that the high non-compliance to seatbelt usage was statistically associated with young, single road users. Around one-third of Abuja road users admitted to drink driving. Road users who were married engaged in more frequent drink driving than road users who were single, and the association was statistically significant. A high percentage of Abuja road users admitted to using mobile phones while driving and 55.8% of the total respondents admitted to not using child restraints while driving. A lack of child restraints was statistically associated more with male road users than female road users. It is recommended that stricter enforcement of road safety laws should be undertaken and that the government should provide road safety agents with the right equipment (e.g., speed guns, breathalyzers) that would aid road safety agents to perform their duties effectively in order to curb the excessive bad road user behaviours in Abuja.

TI A New Permanent Waving Process of Human Hair Based on The Water Set
   Process
SO JOURNAL OF FIBER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
LA Japanese
DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR
AB We have focused on that any hair tresses can be molded into a new shape by the water set process. If the distortion of some disulfide bonds generated during the water set process is removed while retaining its shape, the waving style should be retained permanently. According to this hypothesis, we have conducted a waving process which we have proposed newly as follows: (1) shampooing a small hair tress, (2) winding the tress on the rod, (3) keeping for 20 minutes in oven of 35 degrees C, (4) adequate drying by the dryer, (5) applying a reducing agent at 35 degrees C for 2 min, (6) rinsing with tap water for 1 min, (7) adequate drying by the dryer, (8) applying a neutralizing agent at 35 degrees C for 2 min, and (9) rinsing with tap water for 1 min. As a result, it was verified that the waving shape of straight hair could be achieved permanently by the newly proposed process, as was confirmed by the phenomenon that the waving hair tress was more resistant to immersion treatment in boiling water for 30 sec. This fact suggests that the cleavage of the distorted disulfide bonds in cuticle cells is to reduce the restoring forces present in the fiber surface, resulting in stabilizing the hair structure in the wave configuration. It should be noted that the most important factor in this new process is that the non-keratin protein chain of the whole hair fiber is repositioned by eliminating the distortion of the internal structure caused by winding, and furthermore that the cleavage of the distorted disulfide bonds in cuticle cells serves to remove the restoring forces localized to the fiber surface layer and simultaneously results in the stabilize hair style in wave. Consequently, these results convince us that the newly proposed waving process is of the effective process that may formed the permanent hair wave that persist after shampooing.

AB A large number of cellular level abnormalities have been identified in the hippocampus of schizophrenic subjects. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain how these pathologies interact at a system level to create clinical symptoms, and this has hindered the development of more effective antipsychotic medications. Using a 72-processor supercomputer, we created a tissue level hippocampal simulation, featuring multicompartmental neuron models with multiple ion channel subtypes and synaptic channels with realistic temporal dynamics. As an index of the schizophrenic phenotype, we used the specific inability of the model to attune to 40 Hz (gamma band) stimulation, a well-characterized abnormality in schizophrenia. We examined several possible combinations of putatively schizophrenogenic cellular lesions by systematically varying model parameters representing NMDA channel function, dendritic spine density, and GABA system integrity, conducting 910 trials in total. Two discrete "clusters'' of neuropathological changes were identified. The most robust was characterized by co-occurring modest reductions in NMDA system function (-30%) and dendritic spine density (-30%). Another set of lesions had greater NMDA hypofunction along with low level GABA system dysregulation. To the schizophrenic model, we applied the effects of 1,500 virtual medications, which were implemented by varying five model parameters, independently, in a graded manner; the effects of known drugs were also applied. The simulation accurately distinguished agents that are known to lack clinical efficacy, and identified novel mechanisms (e.g., decrease in AMPA conductance decay time constant, increase in projection strength of calretinin-positive interneurons) and combinations of mechanisms that could re-equilibrate model behavior. These findings shed light on the mechanistic links between schizophrenic neuropathology and the gamma band oscillatory abnormalities observed in the illness. As such, they generate specific falsifiable hypotheses, which can guide postmortem and other laboratory research. Significantly, this work also suggests specific non-obvious targets for potential pharmacologic agents.

AB Spontaneous imbibition has become a role on the development of tight oil reservoirs. Many oilfield cases have confirmed the validity of soaking to produce oil depending on imbibition. Considerable yield has been recovered from soaking for a period of time after hydraulic fracturing by fracturing fluid. In order to study the spontaneous imbibition and its influencing factors in tight oil reservoir with stimulated reservoir volume (SRV), we first conducted wettability and imbibition experiments with/without surfactant treatment using different tight cores. Then, we established a mechanism model of imbibition including the influencing factors in tight oil reservoirs based on the experiments. The model was also validated using the published results. After that, numerical simulation was employed to study the impacts of some essential factors on the effects of spontaneous imbibition. The results indicate that no matter mixed-wet or water-wet tight cores, water can be spontaneously imbibed into the tight cores, and consequently expel the oil. The wettability alteration agent has slight influence on contact angle and imbibition recovery for the water-wet core, but it has a distinct influence on those of the mixed-wet or oil-wet core. Natural fractures in tight rock can promote the imbibition. The size of the tight rock after hydraulic fracturing is a significant factor of imbibition recovery. Interfacial tension is crucial to imbibition in tight reservoir because capillary force becomes more significant in tight rocks than that in conventional reservoirs. Wettability intensely decides the imbibition recovery, and it is indispensable to add modifying agents to enhance imbibition for mix-wet or oil-wet rocks. The reduction of temperature in tight oil reservoir due to fracturing and huff-n-puff may decrease the recovery by more than 1% after 5-6 cycles.

AB The potential application of nanoparticle dispersions as formation-stimulation agents, contrast agents, or simply as tracers in the upstream oil and gas industry requires knowledge of the flow properties of these nanoparticles. The modeling of nanoparticle transport in hydrocarbon reservoirs requires a comprehensive understanding of the rheological behavior of these nanofiuids. Silica nanoparticles have been commonly used because of their low-cost fabrication and cost-effective surface modification. The aqueous silica-nanoparticle dispersions show Newtonian behavior under steady shear measurements controlled by a rheometer, as discussed by Metin et al. (2011b). The viscosity of nanoparticle dispersions depends strongly on the particle concentration, and that this correlation can be depicted by a unified rheological model (Metin et al. 2011b). In addition, during flow in permeable media, the variation of shear associated with complex pore morphology and the interactions between the nanoparticles and tortuous flow channels can affect the viscosity of nanoparticle dispersion. The latter is particularly important if the concentration of nanoparticles in dispersion may change because of nanoparticle adsorption on mineral/fluid and oil/water interfaces or by mechanical trapping of nanoparticles. In this paper, the flow of silica-nanoparticle dispersions through different permeable media is investigated. The rheological behaviors of the dispersions are compared with those determined by use of a rheometer. We established a correlation between the nanoparticle concentration and dispersion viscosity in porous media for various nanoparticle sizes. The effects of pore structure and shear rate are also studied. We have confirmed that the concept of effective maximum packing fraction can be applied to describe the viscosity of aqueous nanoparticle dispersions in both bulk flow and flow in porous media with high permeability and regular pore structures, but not at low permeability because of mechanical trapping. Our work provides new insight to engineering nanoparticle rheology for subsurface applications.

AB A prominent explanation of cooperation in repeated exchange is reciprocity (e. g. Axelrod 1984). However, empirical studies indicate that exchange partners are often much less intent on keeping the books balanced than Axelrod suggested. In particular, there is evidence for commitment behavior, indicating that people tend to build long-term cooperative relationships characterised by largely unconditional cooperation, and are inclined to hold on to them even when this appears to contradict self-interest.
   Using an agent-based computational model, we examine whether in a competitive environment commitment can be a more successful strategy than reciprocity. We move beyond previous computational models by proposing a method that allows to systematically explore an infinite space of possible exchange strategies. We use this method to carry out two sets of simulation experiments designed to assess the viability of commitment against a large set of potential competitors. In the first experiment, we find that although unconditional cooperation makes strategies vulnerable to exploitation, a strategy of commitment benefits more from being more unconditionally cooperative. The second experiment shows that tolerance improves the performance of reciprocity strategies but does not make them more successful than commitment.
   To explicate the underlying mechanism, we also study the spontaneous formation of exchange network structures in the simulated populations. It turns out that commitment strategies benefit from efficient networking: they spontaneously create a structure of exchange relations that ensures efficient division of labor. The problem with stricter reciprocity strategies is that they tend to spread interaction requests randomly across the population, to keep relations in balance. During times of great scarcity of exchange partners this structure is inefficient because it generates overlapping personal networks so that often too many people try to interact with the same partner at the same time.

AB In many animals the ability to navigate over long distances is an important prerequisite for foraging. For example, it is widely accepted that desert ants and honey bees, but also mammals, use path integration for finding the way back to their home site. It is however a matter of a long standing debate whether animals in addition are able to acquire and use so called cognitive maps. Such a 'map', a global spatial representation of the foraging area, is generally assumed to allow the animal to find shortcuts between two sites although the direct connection has never been travelled before. Using the artificial neural network approach, here we develop an artificial memory system which is based on path integration and various landmark guidance mechanisms ( a bank of individual and independent landmark-defined memory elements). Activation of the individual memory elements depends on a separate motivation network and an, in part, asymmetrical lateral inhibition network. The information concerning the absolute position of the agent is present, but resides in a separate memory that can only be used by the path integration subsystem to control the behaviour, but cannot be used for computational purposes with other memory elements of the system. Thus, in this simulation there is no neural basis of a cognitive map. Nevertheless, an agent controlled by this network is able to accomplish various navigational tasks known from ants and bees and often discussed as being dependent on a cognitive map. For example, map-like behaviour as observed in honey bees arises as an emergent property from a decentralized system. This behaviour thus can be explained without referring to the assumption that a cognitive map, a coherent representation of foraging space, must exist. We hypothesize that the proposed network essentially resides in the mushroom bodies of the insect brain.

AB Toxocara infection is associated with an increased prevalence of airway symptoms and may be a possible aetiologic agent of chronic cough. The occurrence of toxocariasis in Hungary is mild and/or sporadic. The purpose of this study was to investigate the levels of serum cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and total IgE, the blood eosinophil count, the results of skin prick and non-specific bronchus provocation tests in Toxocara-seropositive children with chronic cough relative to those in healthy controls. The patients exhibited moderate eosinophilia, significantly elevated levels of serum total IgE, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and IFN-gamma, and higher skin reactivity to common allergens, whereas the bronchial hyperreactivity was similar in the two groups. The protective proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IFN-gamma and IL-13) in association with the anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) were simultaneously increased in Toxocara-infected children with chronic cough. During infections, the activation and suppression of immune processes occur simultaneously and cytokines of Th1/Th2 and regulatory T cells contribute to the regulation of the immune response evoked by helminth infections (depending on the parasite load, the timing and duration of the infection and the status of the host immune system).

AB Dithioerythritol (DTE) is frequently employed as a reducing agent or a protective reagent for thiol groups in biological assays. Owing to its known inhibiting properties in enzyme catalysis reactions, lead is also commonly used in such experiments, and often simultaneously with DTE. Given the potential affinity of these two reactants, their measured individual effects may well depend on their interactions in the medium used. Any quantitative assessment of these interactions necessitates, however, that the complex equilibria between lead and DTE be investigated beforehand. To test this hypothesis, the formation constants of lead(II) complexes with DTE under physiological conditions (37-degrees, NaCl 0.15 M) have been calculated from the results of glass electrode potentiometry, with the help of the MINIQUAD and ESTA computer programs. The pK values for dissociation of DTE have been found equal to 8.926 +/- 0.003 and 9.840 +/- 0.003. The following lead-DTE species have been characterized: ML (12.774 +/- 0.037), MLH-1 (2.858 +/- 0.037), M2LH-1 (13.349 +/- 0.025) and M6L5 (86.586 +/- 0.099); the log *beta-values are given in the parentheses. Appropriate computer simulations effectively show that the interactions of the two reactants are indeed quite significant within the concentration ranges commonly used in in vitro biological assays. They should thus be taken into account in interpretation of the effects observed.

AB A series of imidazolium salt derivatives have demonstrated potent antitumor activity in prior research. A comprehensive in silicon method was carried out to identify the putative protein target and detailed structure-activity relationship of the compounds. The Topomer CoMFA and CoMSIA techniques were implemented during the investigation to obtain the relationship between the properties of the substituent group and the contour map of around 77 compounds; the Topomer CoMFA and CoMSIA models were reliable with the statistical data. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed by combining the Pharmmapper platform and STRING database. After generating the sub-network, the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA with protein data bank ID: 3ZIM) was selected as the putative target of imidazolium salt derivatives. A docking study was carried out to correlate interactions of amino acids in protein active pockets surrounded by the ligand with contour maps generated by the structure-activity relationship method. Then the molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the imidazolium salt derivatives have potent binding capacity and stability to receptor 3ZIM, and the two ligand-receptor complex was stable in the last 2 ns. Finally, the ligand-based structure-activity relationship and receptor-based docking were combined together to identify the structural requirement of the imidazolium salt derivatives, which will be used to design and synthesize the novel PIK3CA inhibitors.

AB We tested the hypothesis that levosimendan, a new positive inotropic drug that activates adenosine triphosphate-regulated potassium (K-ATP) channels in vitro, decreases myocardial infarct size in vivo. Myocardial infarct size was measured after a 60-min left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 3 h of reperfusion in dogs receiving either IV vehicle (0.9% saline) or levosimendan (24 mu g/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 0.4 mu g . kg(-1) . min(-1)) in the presence or absence of glyburide (a K-ATP channel antagonist) pretreatment (100 mu g/kg). Levosimendan increased (P < 0.05) the maximal rate of increase of left ventricular pressure and decreased myocardial infarct size from 24% +/- 2% (control experiments) to 11% +/- 2% of the left ventricular area at risk for infarction. Glyburide did not alter the hemodynamic effects of levosimendan but blocked levosimendan-induced reductions of infarct size. Subendocardial collateral blood flow was similar among groups. However, levosimendan increased subepicardial and midmyocardial collateral perfusion in the absence, but not in the presence, of glyburide. Levosimendan exerts cardioprotective effects via activation of K-ATP channels at a dose that simultaneously enhances myocardial contractility. Implications: Levosimendan may be advantageous in patients requiring inotropic support who are also at risk of myocardial ischemia. Activation of adenosine triphosphate-regulated potassium channels during infusion of levosimendan may produce cardioprotective effects while simultaneously enhancing ventricular contractile function.

AB Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASADH; EC 1.2.1.11) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of essential amino acids in prokaryotes and fungi, inhibition of ASADH leads to the development of novel antitubercular agents. In the present work, a combined structure and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) approaches were employed to identify potent inhibitors of mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)-ASADH. The structure-based pharmacophore hypothesis consists of three hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), two negatively ionizable, and one positively ionizable center, while ligand-based pharmacophore consists of additional one HBA and one hydrogen bond donor features. The validated pharmacophore models were used to screen the chemical databases (ZINC and NCI). The screened hits were subjected to ADME and toxicity filters, and subsequently to the molecular docking analysis. Best-docked 25 compounds carry the characteristics of highly electronegative functional groups (-COOH and -NO2) on both sides and exhibited the H-bonding interactions with highly conserved residues Arg99, Arg249, and His256. For further validation of docking results, MD simulation studies were carried out on two representative compounds NSC51108 and ZINC04203124. Both the compounds remain bound to the key active residues of Mtb-ASADH during the MD simulations. These identified hits can be further used for lead optimization and in the design more potent inhibitors against Mtb-ASADH.

AB A barrier to the use of hydrogen exchange-mass spectrometry (HX-MS) in many contexts, especially analytical characterization of various protein therapeutic candidates, is that differences in temperature, pH, ionic strength, buffering agent, or other additives can alter chemical exchange rates, making FIX data gathered under differing solution conditions difficult to compare. Here, we present data demonstrating that FIX chemical exchange rates can be substantially altered not only by the well-established variables of temperature and pH but also by additives including arginine, guanidine, methionine, and thiocyanate. To compensate for these additive effects, we have developed an empirical method to correct the hydrogen-exchange data for these differences. First, differences in chemical exchange rates are measured by use of an unstructured reporter peptide, YPI. An empirical chemical exchange correction factor, determined by use of the HX data from the reporter peptide, is then applied to the FIX measurements obtained from a protein of interest under different solution conditions. We demonstrate that the correction is experimentally sound through simulation and in a proof-of-concept experiment using unstructured peptides under slow-exchange conditions (pD 4.5 at ambient temperature). To illustrate its utility, we applied the correction to HX-MS excipient screening data collected for a pharmaceutically relevant IgG4 mAb being characterized to determine the effects of different formulations on backbone dynamics.

AB The effects of different additives on lignin repolymerisation in the autohydrolysis pretreatment of soft-wood and the consequences for enzymatic cellulose digestibility have been studied. The study comprised 35 substances including alcohols, amines, heterocyclic and other compounds. It has been shown that lignin repolymerisation does not only hinder hydrolysis by the deactivation of cellulases, but can also obstruct their access to cellulose. A new class of phenolic additives has been discovered that can block lignin repolymerisation and thus increase glucose yields in hydrolysis by more than 40%. Dimethylphloroglucinol was found to be even more effective than 2-naphthol, the most effective lignin repolymerisation blocker reported to date. The study reveals that effective additives have to be highly nucleophilic and must not act as a crossing agent for lignin fragments, which can dramatically worsen glucose yields. Phenolic compounds activated by several hydroxy groups with only a single reactive aromatic site are however very beneficial in enhancing pretreatment. The order of effectiveness of the tested compounds is consistent with the hypothesis that they compete with the aromatic rings present in lignin for lignin carbocations. These ions have been proposed earlier to be intermediates in the formation of repolymerised lignin structures. While compounds activated towards electrophilic substitution generally had a high impact, compounds that can stop radical repolymerisation had no effect. The gained insights open up the possibility to identify numerous further additives that can enhance autohydrolysis, steam and acidic pretreatments of lignocellulose.

ID AFFECTIVE-DISORDER; ANXIETY; STRESS
AB While the relationship of life events to depression onset has occupied researchers for almost a quarter of a century, few studies have attempted to account for either the temporal patterning of events relative to episode onset, or, the effect of multiple events in a study period. In this report, we attempt to address the issues of timing of events, multiple events (both positive and negative) and multiple aspects (both positivity and negativity) of single events on latency time to depression onset, while simultaneously accounting for possible decay in the effects of events over time. We use the proportional hazards approach to model the effects of life events and consider modelling the change in impact of events with the passage of time.
   After interviewing 142 recurrent unipolar patients using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule, we rated severity and positivity of life events reported during the 6-month period prior to onset. As we hypothesized, additional life events occurring after an initial provoking agent level event significantly alter the risk of illness onset. Additional severely threatening events decrease the time to onset, but positive events do not appear to delay onset. Interestingly, seemingly neutral events had a highly significant effect in shortening the time to onset. We note the many limitations imposed on the interpretation of these findings related to the selected group of subjects studied and encourage those who have more generalizable data to apply these methods of analysis.

AB Sulfonamides represent the oldest synthetic antibacterial agents; however, their central position in controlling bacterial diseases has been seriously damaged by the development of widespread resistance. Herein, we revisited sulfathiazole, a commercial member of antibacterial sulfa drugs, intending to overcome sulfonamide resistance and identify new drug candidates through molecular modifications. We synthesized twelve sulfonamides (SA1-SA12) by replacing the amino group on the phenyl ring with various substituents and introducing a thiophene ring on the core scaffold of sulfathiazole. The obtained compounds and additionally two commercial sulfonamides, sulfathiazole and sulfadiazine, were extensively screened for their antimicrobial activities. The results indicated that new sulfonamides, unlike traditional ones, were selectively effective against various Staphylococcus aureus strains. Introducing a bulky lipophilic substituent at the para position of the phenyl ring significantly increased the antibacterial activities of the compounds against Staphylococcus aureus. The compounds demonstrating favourable selectivity indices were further evaluated for their membrane potential perturbation and DNA interaction properties. The obtained data showed that these are not supporting mechanisms for the antibacterial activities of the modified sulfathiazole derivatives. In order to rationalize the activity of the three most active compounds, SA7, SA11 and SA12, against S. aureus ATCC 25923, their binding hypotheses within the catalytic site of Staphylococcus aureus dihydropteroate synthase, the validated target enzyme of sulfonamides, were generated via molecular docking and further dissected using molecular dynamics simulations and dynamic 3D pharmacophores (dynophores).

AB Ultrasound contrast agents inside a microvessel, when driven by ultrasound, oscillate and induce mechanical stresses on the vessel wall. These mechanical stresses can produce beneficial therapeutic effects but also induce vessel rupture if the stresses are too high. Therefore, it is important to use sufficiently low pressure amplitudes to avoid rupturing the vessels while still inducing the desired therapeutic effects. In this work, we developed a comprehensive three-dimensional model of a confined microbubble inside a vessel while considering the bubble shell properties, blood viscosity, vessel wall curvature and the mechanical properties of the vessel wall. Two bubble models with the assumption of a spherical symmetric bubble and a simple asymmetrical bubble were simulated. This work was validated with previous experimental results and enabled us to evaluate the microbubbles' behaviour and the resulting mechanical stresses induced on the vessel walls. In this study, the fluid shear and circumferential stresses were evaluated as indicators of the mechanical stresses. The effects of acoustical parameters, vessel viscoelasticity and rigidity, vessel/bubble size and off-centre bubbles on bubble behaviour and stresses on the vessel were investigated. The fluid shear and circumferential stresses acting on the vessel varied with time and location. As the frequency changed, the microbubble oscillated with the highest amplitude at its resonance frequency which was different from the resonance frequency of an unbound bubble. The bubble resonance frequency increased as the rigidity of a flexible vessel increased. The fluid shear and circumferential stresses peaked at frequencies above the bubble's resonance frequency. The more rigid the vessels were, the more damped the bubble oscillations. The synergistic effect of acoustic frequency and vessel elasticity had also been investigated since the circumferential stress showed either an increasing trend or a decreasing one versus the vessel rigidity at different acoustic frequencies. When the acoustic pressure was increased from 52 to 680 kPa, the maximum bubble radius increase by 2.5 fold, and the maximum shear and circumferential stress increased by 15.7 and 18.3 fold, respectively. The shear stress was largest when the acoustic frequency was higher (3.25 MHz) and the ratio of the vessel radius to the bubble radius was lower. The circumferential stress was largest when the bubble wall was closer to the vessel wall. An oscillating off-centre bubble forms a mushroom shape with the most damping on the points closest to the vessel wall.

AB Radiation dermatitis is a common side effect of radiotherapy. Radiation dermatitis has been investigated for decades, and many approaches have been proposed to limit its incidence and severity. The purpose of the present systematic review was to summarize the approaches and findings of studies testing various methods for management of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients. Medline, Cochrane, and Embase were searched for studies pertaining to radiation-induced skin toxicity in breast cancer patients. The search results were limited to randomized trials of external beam radiotherapy conducted in humans and reported in the English language. The primary outcome was the incidence or severity of radiation dermatitis. Descriptive statistical analyses were performed. A total of 96 studies were included in the present review. These evaluated the effect of different radiotherapy techniques, topical treatments, supplements, skin care regimens, and treatments on radiation dermatitis. Few topical agents and oral supplements demonstrated their effectiveness across the randomized trials; however, various radiotherapy techniques, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy, accelerated partial breast irradiation, simultaneous integrated boost, and prone positioning consistently demonstrated decreased rates of radiation dermatitis, despite the limited number of studies in which they were evaluated.

TI CONCEPTS FOR PRIVATIZING NATIONALIZED LAND AND FOR REGULATING
   COMPENSATION FOR EXPROPRIATIONS IN THE NEW FEDERAL STATES ANALYSIS AND
   ALTERNATIVES
SO LANDBAUFORSCHUNG VOLKENRODE
LA German
DT Article
AB The privatisation process of the nationalized land and the still expected bill to regulate the compensation for expropriations in East Germany are interdependent issues. As an introduction a short discription of the legal preconditions to resolve the problems associated with privatisation and compensation is given. The analysis is based on the concepts of Institutional Choice Theory, the New Political Economy and the concept of Policy-Analysis. The underlying process is identified as a widely politically directed institutional change. In addition, the participation of three policy-nets makes it more difficult to analyse the process: the traditional ''west-oriented'' net of agricultural policy, the net of financial policy similarly oriented towards West German interests and third the new net of agricultural policy and administration in the New Lander. Thus the hypothesis is put forward that the various political interest groups will use different policy-nets and specific methods to achieve their political goals. Obviously they will try to establish a privatisation regime maximizing their own opportunities to exert influence on the agents involved in the privatisation process. The paper is focussing on two episodes of institutional change, first the transition from the so called Gerster-Paper to the Bohl-Paper (Three-Phase-Model) and second the replacement of the Gattermann-Model (Certificate-Model) by the Bond-Model, created by the Federal Government. It is apparent from these examples that the West-German-oriented networks prefer methods we call ''Feinsteuerung'', what means exertion of influence in processes of information and negotiation within die networks of bureaucracies, parliamentary committees and interest groups, whereas die policy net in the New Lander obviously prefers instruments from the arsenal of the so called ''Grobsteuerung'', e. g. their influence relies on political pressure originating from party competition, the danger of vote losses and public protest. This result corresponds with the specific comparative advantages of the interest groups in the decision making process. Unlike the interests of the expropriated former property-owners the regional farmers' unions in die New Lander prefer to establish a ''dosed-shop'' concept favouring the existing farms and farmers to manage conflicting interests. The former, in the most cases people now living in West-Germany, want to open the distribution process for ''outsiders'' and therefore prefer market instruments for distribution of land. Simultanously they try to establish preferential treatments in their favour by making use of the west oriented policy nets. So up to now the privatisation process including compensation components is dominated by governmental-administrative action and therefore corresponds more to the interests of the now existing farmers and their associations in the New Lander.

AB Background: The antibiotic lock (AL) technique is used for sterilization of the intraluminal surface of catheters. This technique consists of filling a catheter lumen with an antibiotic solution and allowing it to dwell for a time sufficient to sterilize the device. Glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are commonly used agents for this purpose. But studies evaluating the different dosages of these antibiotics, their optimum concentrations, and duration in AL treatment are lacking.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of different doses of vancomycin/saline solution (VSS) and teicoplanin/saline solution (TSS) and to establish the optimal dosage and time needed to eliminate intraluminal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis colonization.
   Methods: This in vitro AL study was conducted at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Adnan Menderes University Medical Faculty, Aydin, Turkey. Catheters were divided into 2 groups-those colonized with slime-forming S epidermidis, and those colonized with nonslime-forming S epidermidis. In each group, catheters were locked with VSS or TSS at 1-, 3-, and 5-mg/mL doses. Catheters instilled with saline solution were used as the control group. After 12 hours of incubation, the catheters were drained and filled with human plasma. Instillation of human plasma or AL solution was alternated every 12 hours to simulate clinical conditions. Every other day, catheters locked with each antibiotic dose or saline were cultured to determine colony count. These procedures were maintained until the catheters were sterile.
   Results: The baseline counts of slime-forming and non-slime-forming S epidermidis adhered to 1-cm segment catheters were 39 x 10(6) and 32 x 10(6) colony forming units, respectively. The bacterial count was decreased significantly from baseline on the first day after the start of treatment (day 1) (P < 0.001). At the end of day 7, all catheters treated with antibiotics were sterile. The de-creases in bacterial count were statistically similar in catheters treated with all doses of VSS and TSS. Also, the decrease in intraluminal colonization was statistically similar in catheters colonized with slime-forming S epidermidis and non-slime-forming S epidermidis.
   Conclusion: In this in vitro, blinded AL study, the efficacy of vancomycin and teicoplanin lock solutions were similar and sterilized the catheters in 7 days, suggesting that the 2 antibiotics might be selected for shorter durations compared with those currently recommended for AL treatment in catheter-related infections due to methicillin-resistant staphylococci.

AB HIV-1 is the aetiological agent of AIDS. Present treatment of AIDS uses a combination therapy with reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors. Recently, the integrase (IN), the third enzyme of HIV-1 which is necessary for the integration process of proviral DNA into the host genome, has reached as a legitimate new drug target. Several families of inhibitors of the catalytic core domain of HIV-1 IN exhibiting submicromolar activities have now been identified. Our contribution in this field was related to the development of new polyhydroxylated styrylquinolines. The latter compounds have proved to be potent HIV-1 IN inhibitors, that block the replication of HIV-1 in cell culture, and are devoid of cytotoxicity. The crystal structure of the catalytically active core domain of a HIV-1 IN mutant has been determined. The active site region is identified by the position of two of the conserved carboxylate residues essential for catalysis, Asp(64) and Asp(116), which coordinate a Mg2+ ion, whereas the third catalytic residue, Glu(152) does not participate in metal binding. However, a recent molecular dynamics simulation of the HIV-1 IN catalytic domain provides support to the hypothesis that a second metal ion is likely to be carried into the HIV-1 IN active site by the DNA substrate. The structure of a complex of the HIV-1 IN core domain with the inhibitor 5-CITEP has been recently reported. The inhibitor binds centrally in the active site of the IN and makes a number of close contacts with the protein, particularly with Lys(156), Lys(159) and Gln(148), amino acids which were identified to be near the active site of the enzyme, through site-directed mutagenis and photo-crosslinking experiments. The exact mechanism by which HIV-1 IN inhibitors block the catalytic activity of the protein remains unknown. However, several putative pharmacophore components have been characterized. All these groups lie in a possible coordination to a divalent ion, supporting thus the hypothesis that the interaction causing the inhibition is mediated by one or two cations. Finally, among the HIV-1 IN inhibitors, three classes have proved to exhibit significant antiviral activities. Thus, it seems likely that the efficient use of HIV-1 IN as a target for rational design will become possible in the next future, possibly through the use of combination regimens including IN inhibitors.

AB Educational institutions are envisioned as principal agents for addressing the current sustainability challenge that society is facing. Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) is transformational and concerns learning content and outcomes, pedagogy and the learning environment in itself. ESD entails rethinking the learning environment (physical and virtual) in line with sustainable development, which implies classrooms' transformation towards learner engagement, formative assessments and active methodologies. This paper responds to this need through exploring the relationship between Smart Classrooms and four widely used ESD methodologies (project or problem-based learning, case study, simulation and cooperative inquiry), identifying how the dimensions and categories of the characteristics of Smart Classrooms can contribute and lead to the implementation of ESD methodologies in real teaching practice in an effective way. The method used in this study consisted of a literature review of both theoretical frameworks separately, ESD and Smart Classrooms, and a subsequent expert analysis to identify the interrelation between both. The Smart Classroom shows a high level of adequacy for using problem and project-based learning, case study and cooperative inquiry methods because of its characteristics in terms of technology developments, environmental conditions and processes. Simulation is the ESD methodology with the lowest level of adequacy in a Smart Classroom, because it is primarily held online rather than through face-to-face teaching. Smart Education facilitates the putting in practice of ESD processes as it enables the creation of intelligent, sustainable, resource-efficient, personalised and adaptive learning environments. Further empirical research is needed to explore the influence that the Smart Classroom has in enabling ESD processes and practices, and to identify students' and teachers' needs at different education levels. Additionally, teacher training programmes focused on the correct use of Smart Classrooms and on the digital competence of teachers are critical to its successful implementation.

AB We develop a simple agent-based financial market model in which speculators' market entry decisions are subject to herding behavior and market risk. In addition, speculators' orders depend on price trends, market misalignments and fundamental news. Using a mix of analytical and numerical tools, we show that a herding-induced market entry wave may amplify excess demand, triggering lasting volatility outbursts. Eventually, however, higher stock market risk reduces stock market participation and volatility decreases again. Simulations furthermore reveal that our approach is also able to produce bubbles and crashes, excess volatility, fat-tailed return distributions and serially uncorrelated price changes. Moreover, trading volume is persistent and correlated with volatility. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper we analyze a Boltzmann-type mean field game model for knowledge growth, which was proposed by Lucas et al. [J. Political Econ., 122 (2014), pp. 1-51]. We discuss the underlying mathematical model, which consists of a coupled system of a Boltzmann-type equation for the agent density and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the optimal strategy. We study the analytic features of each equation separately and show local in time existence and uniqueness for the fully coupled system. Furthermore we focus on the construction and existence of special solutions, which relate to exponential growth in time-so-called balanced growth path solutions. Finally, we illustrate the behavior of solutions for the full system and the balanced growth path equations with numerical simulations.

AB In this study, a population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model of biapenem in Chinese patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) was developed and optimal dosage regimens based on Monte Carlo simulation were proposed. A total of 297 plasma samples from 124 Chinese patients were assayed chromatographically in a prospective, single-centre, open-label study, and pharmacokinetic parameters were analysed using NONMEN. Creatinine clearance (CLCr) was found to be the most significant covariate affecting drug clearance. The final PPK model was: CL (L/h) = 9.89 +(CLCr - 66.56) x 0.049; V-c (L) = 13; Q (L/h) = 8.74; and V-p (L) = 4.09. Monte Carlo simulation indicated that for a target of >= 40% T->MIC (duration that the plasma level exceeds the causative pathogen's MIC), the biapenem pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) breakpoint was 4 mu g/mL for doses of 0.3 g every 6 h (3-h infusion) and 1.2 g (24-h continuous infusion). For a target of >= 80% T->MIC, the PK/PD breakpoint was 4 mu g/mL for a dose of 1.2 g (24-h continuous infusion). The probability of target attainment (PTA) could not achieve >90% at the usual biapenem dosage regimen (0.3 g every 12 h, 0.5-h infusion) when the MIC of the pathogenic bacteria was 4 mu g/mL, which most likely resulted in unsatisfactory clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with LRTIs. Higher doses and longer infusion time would be appropriate for empirical therapy. When the patient's symptoms indicated a strong suspicion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter baumannii infection, it may be more appropriate for combination therapy with other antibacterial agents.

AB In this work, we consider a simple theoretical model that enables us to take into account private human decisions that may interfere with public mosquito control. The model reflects the trade-off between perceived costs and observed efficacy. Our theoretical results emphasize that households may reduce their protective behavior in response to mechanical elimination techniques piloted by a public agent, leading to an increase in the total number of mosquitoes in the surrounding environment and generating a barrier for vector-borne diseases control. Our study is sufficiently generic to be applied to different arboviral diseases. It also shows that vector-control models and strategies have to take into account individual behaviors.

SO WORLD ECONOMY

ID ENVIRONMENTAL-REGULATION; TRADE; EMISSIONS
AB Subglobal climate policies induce changes in international competitiveness and favour a relocation of carbon-emitting activities to nonabating regions. In this paper, we evaluate the potential for CO2 abatement and the emissions leakage' effect in the copper industry, a prominent energy-intensive trade-exposed sector. We formulate a plant-level spatial equilibrium model for copper commodities in which parameters describing the behavioural response of agents are calibrated to a set of estimated price elasticities. We find producers and consumers to be price inelastic even in the long run, making the copper industry unresponsive to climate policies. Monte Carlo simulations with our model based on statistical uncertainty on elasticity estimates suggest that around 30per cent of emissions reductions in industrialised countries would be compensated by an increase of emissions in nonabating countries.

AB Evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game in structured populations on a weighted square lattice, on which the edge weight represents the relationship between agents and adaptively changes in time, has been proved to be an efficient way that can promote cooperation. In fact, such an adaptive link weight introduces a new time scale tau(a), not necessarily equal to the time scale of game strategy tau(epsilon). Inspired from aforementioned above, we investigate the effect of w = tau(epsilon)/tau(a) on the evolution of cooperative behavior. Through numerical simulation, we find cooperation can be promoted effectively with a larger value of w, which is related to the increase of average link weight in the structured population.

AB The morphological plasticity and adaptive behavior exhibited during diatom colony formation in Aulacoseira is explored through computer simulation to study how the interplay of mechanisms such as cytoskeletal-driven membrane protrusions, silica deposition, and environmental factors may contribute to the generation of two distinct spine morphologies on linkage and separation valves. A multiscale agent-based computational model was developed, which showed that a single cytoskeleton-driven, competitive growth mechanism could generate either of the two characteristic phenotypes, given only a single switch in the environment (as might be experienced by a change in light regime). Hypotheses are formulated from the model, and predictions made for potential follow-up experiments.

AB This paper considers an anisotropic swarm model with a simple attraction and repulsion function. It is shown that the members of a reciprocal swarm will aggregate and eventually form a cohesive cluster of finite size around the swarm center. Moreover, the swarm system is also completely stable, i.e., every solution converges to the set of equilibrium points of the system. These results are also valid for a class of non-reciprocal swarms under the detailed balance condition on coupling weights. For general non-reciprocal swarms, numerical simulations are worked out to demonstrate more complex oscillatory motions in the systems. The study provides further insight into the effect of the interaction pattern on the collective behavior of a swarm system. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding the pathogenic mechanisms in chronic Chagas disease, a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Latin America, is essential for the design of rational therapeutic strategies. In this paper we show that the development of Chagas disease is a consequence of a long-term and complex relationship between parasite persistence and maladapted homeostatic mechanisms in the host which leads to pathologic changes, We performed a retrospective study on 50 patients with chronic Chagas disease and 50 healthy control individuals. The specific immune response was detected by ELISA and IHA tests using autochthonous antigens. inflammatory process with the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and nitric oxide (NO). and antioxidant protection with glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels. We developed generalised linear modelling procedures to assess simultaneously which explanatory variables and/or their interactions better explained disease severity in patients. Our results show the existence of a strong relationship between anti-Trypanosoma cruzi levels and chronic Chagas disease (P < 0.0001). Taken together, the statistical data indicate both cumulative and complementary effects, where the increase in TNF-alpha (P = 0.004) and NO (P = 0.005) levels correlated with a reduction in glutathione peroxidase (P = 0.0001) and SOD (P = 0.01) levels drives the disease pathology in chronically infected patients. Our findings may have important implications for understanding host susceptibility to develop severe chronic infectious disease. In addition we show putative targets for the design of new therapeutic strategies to prevent disease progression, considering both specific treatment against the aetiological agent and modulation of the different immunopathological reactions in chronically infected individuals with chronic Chagas disease.

AB Roger Hughes proposed a macroscopic model for pedestrian dynamics, in which individuals seek to minimize their travel time but try to avoid regions of high density. One of the basic assumptions is that the overall density of the crowd is known to every agent. In this paper we present a modification of the Hughes model to include local effects, namely limited vision, and a conviction towards decision making. The modified velocity field enables smooth turning and temporary waiting behavior. We discuss the modeling in the micro- and macroscopic setting as well as the efficient numerical simulation of either description. Finally we illustrate the model with various numerical experiments and evaluate the behavior with respect to the evacuation time and the overall performance.

   treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY

ID COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS; CHEMOTHERAPY; HEALTH; TRIAL
AB Purpose: To determine the potential economic implications resulting from oral temozolomide (TEM) compared with intravenous (IV) dacarbazine (DTIC) for metastatic melanoma,
   Patients and Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness (CE) analysis using hazard ratios (HRs) from the phase III (Schering 195-018) trial comparing TEM 200 mg/m(2)/d orally for 5 days every 28 days with DTIC 250 mg/m2/d IV for 5 days every 21 days. Sensitivity analyses assessed a range of TEM's efficacy and costs, direct nonmedical costs, and the DTIC schedule,
   Results: The trial found an overall survival trend favoring TEM; median survival times of patients heated with DTIC and TEM were 6.4 and 7.7 months, respectively (HR = 1.18; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 0.92 to 1.52; intention to heat, P = .20), The mean increase in survival of TEM over DTIC was 1.1 months. The projected average cash per patient were greater with TEM than DTIC ($6,902 v $3,697, respectively). The incremental CE ratio using TEM was $36,990 per life-year or $101 per day of life gained. The CE ratio's 95% CT ranged from -$65,180 (DTIC is more effective) to $18,670 per year of life gained. The CE ratios decreased 50% if direct nonmedical casts were included and increased 50% if DTIC's efficacy was unchanged if given as a single daily dosage, Sixty percent of simulations found TEM with a CE threshold of less than $50,000 per life-year gained.
   Conclusion: Although the base-case efficacy of TEM compared with DTIC was not statistically significant, its associated incremental CE would be comparable with many interventions. TEM for metastatic melanoma illustrates the tension confronting providers choosing between similar agents that markedly differ in convenience and costs.

SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH

DT Article
DE Economics; Game theory; Sport (Football)
AB This article develops a dynamic game-theoretic model of optimizing strategic behaviour by football (soccer) teams. Teams choose between defensive and attacking formations and between a non-violent and a violent playing style, and can vary these choices continuously throughout each match. Starting from the end of the match and working backwards, the teams' optimal strategies conditional on the current state of the match are determined by solving a series of two-player non-cooperative subgames. Numerical simulations are used to explore the sensitivity of strategic behaviour to variations in the structural parameters. The analysis demonstrates that the strategic behaviour of football teams can be rationalized in accordance with game-theoretic principles of optimizing strategic behaviour by agents when payoffs are uncertain and interdependent.

AB Risk and the risk attitude of agents are two fundamental elements of decision making under risk and uncertainty. Recent developments in risk and risk preference analyses have raised questions on conventional approaches to estimating risk preferences. This study proposes an estimation procedure that employs a seminonparametric estimator to estimate the density function of risk without imposing distributional assumptions, as well as a numerical integration method to construct closed-form expressions of conditional moment conditions for efficient estimation. The method achieves a substantial efficiency improvement relative to the conventional GMM approach in Monte Carlo simulations. The proposed approach is general and applies to the estimation of behavioral choice models under risk, or models that require expectation operations and closed-form equations for estimation.

AB We use a basic set-up of two coupled exclusion processes to model a stylized situation in evacuation dynamics, in which evacuees have to choose between two escape routes. The coupling between the two processes occurs at one common point at which particles are injected; the process can be controlled by directing incoming individuals into either of the two escape routes. On the basis of a mean-field approach we determine the phase behaviour of the model, and analytically compute optimal control strategies, maximizing the total current through the system. Results are confirmed by numerical simulations. We also show that dynamic intervention, exploiting fluctuations about the mean-field stationary state, can lead to a further increase in total current.

AB This work presents a simulation of the response of packets of microbubbles in an ultrasonic pulseecho scan line. Rayleigh-Plesset equation has been used to predict the echo from numerically obtained radial dynamics of microbubbles. Varying the number of scattering microbubbles on the pulse wave form has been discussed. To improve microbubble-specific imaging at high frequencies, the subharmonic and second harmonic signals from individual microbubbles as well as microbubbles packets were simulated as a function of size and pressure. Two different modes of harmonic generation have been distinguished. The strength and bandwidth of the subharmonic component in the scattering spectrum of microbubbles is greater than that of the second harmonic. The pressure spectra provide quantitative and detailed information on the dynamic behaviour of ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles packet.

TI LOCAL SYMMETRY AND GLOBAL STRUCTURE IN ADAPTIVE VOTER MODELS
SO SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS
LA English
DT Article

   agent-based simulation
AB Adaptive voter models (AVMs) are simple mechanistic systems that model the emergence of mesoscopic structure from local networked processes driven by conflict and homophily. AVMs display rich behavior, including a phase transition from a fully fragmented regime of "echo-chambers" to a regime of long-time disagreement governed by low-dimensional quasi-stable manifolds. Many extant methods for approximating the behavior of AVMs are either restricted in scope, expensive in computation, or inaccurate in predicting important statistics. In this work, we develop a novel, second-order moment closure approximation method for binary-state rewire-to-random and rewireto-same model variants. We incorporate a small amount of noise via a random mutation term, which renders the system ergodic. Using ergodicity, we then approximate the voting process, which is non-Markovian in the second moments of the system, with a Markovian term near the phase transition. This approximation exploits an asymmetry between different classes of voting events. The resulting scheme enables us to predict the location of the phase transition and the active edge density in the regime of persistent disagreement, across the entire space of parameters and opinion densities. Numerically, our results are nearly exact for the rewire-to-random model and competitive with extant approaches for the rewire-to-same model. Moreover, our computations display constant scaling in the mean degree, enabling approximations for denser systems than previously possible. We conclude with suggestions for model refinements and extensions.

AB Inference on large-scale models is of great interest in modern science. Examples include deterministic simulators of fluid dynamics to recover the source of a pollutant, and stochastic agent-based simulators to infer features of consumer behaviour. When computational constraints prohibit model evaluation at all but a small ensemble of parameter settings, exact inference is infeasible. In such cases, emulation of the simulator enables the interrogation of a surrogate model at arbitrary parameter values. Combining emulators with observational data to estimate parameters and predict a real-world process is known as computer model calibration. The choice of the emulator model is a critical aspect of calibration. Existing approaches treat the mathematical model as implemented on computer as an unknown but deterministic response surface. In many cases the underlying mathematical model, or the simulator approximating the mathematical model, are not determinsitic and in fact have some uncertainty associated with their output. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian statistical calibration model for stochastic simulators. The approach is motivated by two applied problems: a deterministic mathematical model of intra-cellular signalling whose implementation on computer nonetheless has discretization uncertainty, and a stochastic model of river water temperature commonly used in hydrology. We show the proposed approach is able to map the uncertainties of such non-deterministic simulators through to the resulting inference while retaining computational feasibility. Supplementary computer code and datasets are provided online.

AB Commercial banks might profit from the adoption of methods widely used in network theory. A decision making process might become biased if one disregards network effects within the corporate client portfolio. This paper models the phenomenon of customer attrition by generating a weighted and directed network of corporate clients linked by financial transactions. During the numerical study of the agent-based toy model we demonstrate that multiple steady states may exist. The statistical properties of the distinct steady states show similarities. We show that most companies of the same community choose the same bank in the steady state. In contrast to the case for the steady state of the Barabasi-Albert network, market shares in this model equalize by network size. When modeling customer attrition in the network of 3 x 105 corporate clients, none of the companies followed the behavior of the initial switcher in three quarters of the simulations. The number of switchers exceeded 20 in 1% of the cases. In the worst-case scenario a total of 688 companies chose a competitor bank. Significant network effects have been discovered; high correlation prevailed between the degree of the initial switcher and the severity of the avalanche effect. This suggests that the position of the corporate client in the network might be much more important than the underlying properties ( industry, size, profitability, etc) of the company.

AB The green mussel Perna viridis LINNE can be kept in simulated seawater for more than 6 months in good condition. The mussel forms many threads by secreting an adhesive protein from the foot, and attaches with more than 50 byssal threads, which makes most mussels clump together. In order to investigate the preparation of the antifouling surfaces toward green mussels, the attachment of mussels was tested using glass surfaces modified with silane coupling agents, together with non-treated material surfaces such as glass and silicone. The correlation between the attachment percentage and the mean number of the secreted byssus was highly significant, indicating that the mussel selects a favorable surface prior to the secretion of byssus. The relationships between the mussel attachment and the surface chemical parameters (surface free energy (sfe) and its dispersion and polar components) were examined based on a working hypothesis, which we have previously reported. The result of statistical regression test indicated that a certain correlation was found between the dispersion component and the mussel attachment, while the polar component did not correlate to the mussel attachment. The present surface chemical approach provided an additional clue for the preparation of ecologically clean antifouling materials that takes into account the combination of the wettability of both the marine adhesive proteins (MAP) and the modified surfaces.

This paper combines evacuation demand analysis with a toxic gas dispersion process to create an underground space risk assessment model for toxic gas leaks. The emergency evacuation capacity of a subway transfer station in Guangzhou has been evaluated and optimized based on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and agent-based simulation. A strategy is proposed in which the subway ventilation system in the underground space is utilized to mitigate evacuation risks during gas leaks. The influence of the ventilation system on the gas diffusion process under different working conditions during simulations of toxic gas diffusion is also analyzed. A comparative analysis is conducted to discuss whether to adopt the ventilation system. Then, the effectiveness of the risk methods when the ventilation system is utilized in different working conditions is also verified. An empirical model of the impacts of the number of evacuees and individual risk perception levels on the evacuation risk has been obtained. Results indicate that the new risk assessment and risk mitigation methods are effective and can help guide the emergency evacuation and ventilation system design for underground buildings.

TI Fluconazole Monotherapy Is a Suboptimal Option for Initial Treatment of
   Cryptococcal Meningitis Because of Emergence of Resistance

AB Cryptococcal meningitis is a lethal disease with few therapeutic options. Induction therapy with fluconazole has been consistently demonstrated to be associated with suboptimal microbiological and clinical outcomes. Exposure to fluconazole causes dynamic changes in antifungal susceptibility, which are associated with the development of aneuploidy. The implications of this phenomenon for pharmacodynamics of fluconazole for cryptococcal meningitis are poorly understood. The pharmacodynamics of fluconazole were studied using a hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM) and a well-characterized murine model of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. The relationship between drug exposure and both antifungal killing and the emergence of resistance was quantified. The same relationships were further evaluated in a recently described group of patients with cryptococcal meningitis undergoing induction therapy with fluconazole at 800 to 1,200 mg/day. The pattern of emergence of fluconazole resistance followed an "inverted U." Resistance amplification was maximal and suppressed at ratios of the area under the concentration-time curve for the free, unbound fraction of the drug to the MIC (fAUC:MIC) of 34.5 to 138 and 305.6, respectively. Emergence of resistance was observed in vivo with an fAUC:MIC of 231.4. Aneuploidy with duplication of chromosome 1 was demonstrated to be the underlying mechanism in both experimental models. The pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic model accurately described the PK, antifungal killing, and emergence of resistance. Monte Carlo simulations from the clinical pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model showed that only 12.8% of simulated patients receiving fluconazole at 1,200 mg/day achieved sterilization of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after 2 weeks and that 83.4% had a persistent subpopulation that was resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole is primarily ineffective due to the emergence of resistance. Treatment with 1,200 mg/day leads to the killing of a susceptible subpopulation but is compromised by the emergence of resistance.
   IMPORTANCE Cryptococcal meningitis is a lethal disease with few treatment options. The incidence remains high and intricately linked with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In many parts of the world, fluconazole is the only agent that is available for the initial treatment of cryptococcal meningitis despite considerable evidence that it is associated with suboptimal microbiological and clinical outcomes. Fluconazole has a fungistatic mode of action: it predominantly inhibits growth rather than causing fungal killing. Our work shows that the pattern of fluconazole activity is caused by the emergence of resistance in Cryptococcus not detected by standard susceptibility tests, with chromosomal duplication/aneuploidy as the main mechanism. Resistance emergence is related to drug exposure and occurs with the use of clinically relevant regimens. Hence, fluconazole (and potentially other agents that target 14-alpha-demethylase) is compromised by an intrinsic property that limits its effectiveness. However, this resistance may be potentially overcome by dosage escalation or the use of combination therapy.

AB Objective. Simultaneous analysis of the protein composition of biological fluids is now possible. Such an approach can be used to identify biological markers of disease and to understand the pathophysiology of disorders that have eluded classification, diagnosis, and treatment. The purpose of this study was to analyze the differences in protein composition of the amniotic fluid of patients in preterm labor. Study design. Amniotic fluid was obtained by amniocentesis from three groups of women with preterm labor and intact membranes: (1) women without intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) who delivered at term, (2) women without IAI who delivered a preterm neonate, and (3) women with IAI. Intra-amniotic infection was defined as a positive amniotic fluid culture for microorganisms. Intra-amniotic inflammation was defined as an elevated amniotic fluid interleukin (IL)-6 (2.3ng/mL). Two-dimensional (2D) chromatography was used for analysis. The first dimension separated proteins by isoelectric point, while the second, by the degree of hydrophobicity. 2D protein maps were generated using different experimental conditions (reducing agents as well as protein concentration). The maps were used to discern subsets of isoelectric point/hydrophobicity containing differentially expressed proteins. Protein identification of differentially expressed fractions was conducted with mass spectrometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) as well as surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS)-based on-chip antibody capture immunoassays were also used for confirmation of a specific protein that was differentially expressed. Results. (1) Amniotic fluid protein composition can be analyzed using a combination of 2D liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for the identification of proteins differentially expressed in patients in preterm labor. (2) While total insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentration did not change, IGFBP-1 fragments at about 13.5kDa were present in patients with IAI. (3) Proteins that were over-expressed in group 1 included von Ebner gland protein precursor, IL-7 precursor, apolipoprotein A1, tropomyosin sk1 (TPMsk1) fragment, ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-3, and alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunin precursor (AMBP). (4) Proteins that were over-expressed in group 3 included fibrinopeptide B, transferrin, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class 1 chain-related A antigen fragment, transcription elongation factor A, sex-determining region Y (SRY) box 5 protein, Down syndrome critical region 2 protein (DSCR2), and human peptide 8 (HP8). (5) One protein, retinol-binding protein, was over-expressed in women who delivered preterm, regardless of the presence of IAI. Conclusions. A combination of techniques involving 2D chromatography, mass spectrometry, and immunoassays allows identification of proteins that are differentially regulated in the amniotic fluid of patients with preterm labor. Specifically, the amount of the IGFBP-1 fragments at approximately 13.5kDa was found to be increased in patients with IAI, while the amount of the intact form of IGFBP-1 was decreased.

AB The main challenge in the lead removal simulation is the behaviour of non-linearity relationships between the process parameters. The conventional modelling technique usually deals with this problem by a linear method. The substitute modelling technique is an artificial neural network (ANN) system, and it is selected to reflect the non-linearity in the interaction among the variables in the function. Herein, synthesized deep eutectic solvents were used as a functionalized agent with carbon nanotubes as adsorbents of Pb2+. Different parameters were used in the adsorption study including pH (2.7 to 7), adsorbent dosage (5 to 20 mg), contact time (3 to 900 min) and Pb2+ initial concentration (3 to 60 mg/l). The number of experimental trials to feed and train the system was 158 runs conveyed in laboratory scale. Two ANN types were designed in this work, the feed-forward back-propagation and layer recurrent; both methods are compared based on their predictive proficiency in terms of the mean square error (MSE), root mean square error, relative root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error and determination coefficient (R-2) based on the testing dataset. The ANN model of lead removal was subjected to accuracy determination and the results showed R-2 of 0.9956 with MSE of 1.66 x 10(-4). The maximum relative error is 14.93% for the feed-forward back-propagation neural network model.

AB We present a cellular automaton-based model for threshold behaviors in vertebrate digit patterning and polydactyly formation. The rules of the model follow classical reactor-diffusion algorithms. Yet it is not physical diffusion that is taken as the required natural agent but the propagation of cellular states, which can be represented by the same differential equations. The bistable cellular states in the model correspond to mesenchymal limb bud cells that can be either "on" or "off" for the cartilage differentiation pathway. Simulation runs demonstrate that reaction rate and cell number have the most decisive influence on the number of digit-like cell activation patterns. Threshold-based effects can generate supernumerary activation stripes via de novo condensation, stabilized bifurcation, and free floaters. All three behaviors are consistent with processes in natural polydactyly formation. It is argued that these effects are rooted in cell-based behaviors, not in gene regulation or globally diffusing morphogens. Our model suggests that the origin of discrete character states, such as individual digits, is a consequence of an additive cell state variable with a normal distribution that is transformed by a growth function with Turing behaviors into discontinuous phenotypic units. We discuss the application of this type of autopod patterning to the mutational, developmental, experimental, and evolutionary occurrences of polydactyly. The model provides a refinement of the previous Hemingway model for digit novelty and supports Turing type pattern formation in the vertebrate limb. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Mass transfer in rapidly photopoIymerized hydrogel networks of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) was investigated to characterize these materials for potential biosensor applications. The rapid polymerization from a concentrated polymer precursor solution results in a tightly cross-linked hydrogel network that potentially contains microgels, all conditions that can hinder analyte mass transfer. We examined the mass transfer characteristics of microspheres fabricated from diacrylated PEG (MW 575), dimethacrylated PEG (MW 1000), or tetra-acrylated PEG (MW 18,500) mixed with trimethylolpropane triacrylate, a triacrylated cross-linking agent, whose concentration ranged up to 20% (v/v). Swelling behavior was dynamically characterized starting from a dehydrated state using a CCD-camera integrated with an inverted microscope. Hydrogel swelling was extremely rapid with gel front diffusivities on the order of 10(-6) cm(2)/s. Estimated hydrogel mesh sizes ranged from 8.6 to 13.7 (A) over dot for spheres fabricated using PEG with molecular weights between 575 and 1000, to 103 (A) over dot for spheres fabricated using PEG with a molecular weight of 18,500. Dynamic uptake of tetramethylrhodamine was followed using a fluorescence microscope to estimate small analyte diffusivities into the hydrogel networks. Tetramethylrhodamine diffusivities were on the order of 10(-7)10(-9) cm(2)/s. Experimental diffusivities were used to simulate mass transfer into the gel and thus the potential response time of biosensors based on these systems. (C) 2001 EIsevier Science Ltd.

AB Industrial application of metallic materials is hindered by several shortcomings, such as proneness to corrosion, erosion under abrasive loads, damage due to poor cold resistance, or weak resistance to thermal shock stresses, etc. In this study, using the aluminum-magnesium alloy as an example of widely spread metallic materials, we show that a combination of functional nanoengineering and nanosecond laser texturing with the appropriate treatment regimes can be successfully used to transform a metal into a superhydrophobic material with exceptional mechanical and chemical properties. It is demonstrated that laser chemical processing of the surface may be simultaneously used to impart multimodal roughness and to modify the composition and physicochemical properties of a thick surface layer of the substrate itself. Such integration of topographical and physicochemical modification leads to specific surface nanostructures such as nanocavities filled with hydrophobic agent and hard oxynitride nanoinclusions. The combination of superhydrophobic state, nano-and micro features of the hierarchical surface, and the appropriate composition of the surface textured layer allowed us to provide the surface with the outstanding level of resistance of superhydrophobic coatings to external chemical and mechanical impacts. In particular, experimental data presented in this study indicate high resistance of the fabricated coatings to pitting corrosion, superheated water vapor, sand abrasive wear, and rapid temperature cycling from liquid nitrogen to room temperatures, without notable degradation of superhydrophobic performance.

AB We previously demonstrated in mice that the activation of prelimbic medial prefrontal cortex (PL) with the sodium channel activator veratrine induces anxiety-like behaviors via NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission. Riluzole directly affects the glutamatergic system and has recently been suggested to have an anxiolytic-like effect in both experimental animals and patients with anxiety disorders.
   We investigated the effects of co-perfusion of riluzole on veratrine-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice.
   Extracellular glutamate levels were measured in 7-week-old male C57BL6 mice by using an in vivo microdialysis-HPLC/ECD system, and behaviors were assessed simultaneously in an open field (OF) test. Basal levels of glutamate were measured by collecting samples every 10 min for 60 min. The medium containing drugs was perfused for 30 min, and the OF test was performed during the last 10 min of drug perfusion. After the drug treatments, the drug-containing medium was switched to perfusion of control medium lacking drugs, and then samples were collected for another 90 min.
   Riluzole co-perfusion attenuated veratrine-induced increase in extracellular glutamate levels in the PL and completely diminished veratrine-induced anxiety-like behaviors. Interestingly, riluzole perfusion alone in the PL did not affect the basal levels of glutamate and anxiety-like behaviors.
   Our results suggest that compounds like riluzole that inhibit glutamatergic function in the PL are possible candidates for novel anxiolytics.

AB In this study, the production and optimization of an aluminum matrix composite prepared by powder metallurgy, Equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) and a subsequent heat treatment is investigated. A gas atomized powder (composition approximately similar to the commercial AA2017 alloy) was high energy ball milled with 5 vol.-% SiC particles (0.2 to 2 mu m), hot iso-statically pressed and extruded to square bars. Optical, scanning-and transmission electron microscopy are performed to characterize the corresponding microstructural evolution. The mechanical properties are determined by quasi-static tensile testing and hardness measurements. The experimental results show that the extruded condition exhibits a relatively homogeneous particle distribution with a good interface quality. However, the subsequent solid-solution heat treatment results in a significant increase of porosity due to remnant stearic acid (milling agent for the production of the composite powder) which was only partly removed during degassing. This leads to a significant degradation of the mechanical properties. This study also indicates that ECAP-processing of aluminum matrix composites with particle sizes below 1 mu m can in principle lead to significant increases in strength by altering the relevant defect structures. The heat treatment temperature considered here (170 degrees C) results in a softening due to simultaneous recovery and over-aging. But the first results presented here may well point out directions for further studies on microstructural optimization of particle reinforced aluminum alloys by ECAP.

AB A new method combining axisymmetric drop shape analysis (ADSA) and a captive bubble (CB) is proposed to study the effect of surfactant on interfacial gas transfer. In this method, gas transfer from a static CB to the surrounding quiescent liquid is continuously recorded for a short period (i.e., 5 min). By photographical analysis, ADSA-CB is capable of yielding detailed information pertinent to the surface tension and geometry of the CB, e.g., bubble area, volume, curvature at the apex, and the contact radius and height of the bubble. A steady-state mass transfer model is established to evaluate the mass transfer coefficient on the basis of the output of ADSA-CB. In this way, we are able to develop a working prototype capable of simultaneously measuring dynamic surface tension and interfacial gas transfer. Other advantages of this method are that it allows for the study of very low surface tensions (< 5 mJ/m(2)) and does not require equilibrium of gas transfer. Consequently, reproducible experimental results can be obtained in a relatively short time. As a demonstration, this method was used to study the effect of lung surfactant on oxygen transfer. It was found that the adsorbed lung surfactant film shows a retardation effect on oxygen transfer, similar to the behavior of a pure DPPC film. However, this retardation effect at low surface tensions is less than that of a pure DPPC film.

AB A new denuder-filter sampling technique has been used to investigate the gas/particle partitioning behaviour of the carbonyl products from the photooxidation of isoprene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene. A series of experiments was performed in two atmospheric simulation chambers at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature in the presence of NOx and at a relative humidity of approximately 50%. The denuder and filter were both coated with the derivatizing agent O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)-hydroxylamine (PFBHA) to enable the efficient collection of gas- and particle-phase carbonyls respectively. The tubes and filters were extracted and carbonyls identified as their oxime derivatives by GC-MS. The carbonyl products identified in the experiments accounted for around 5% and 10% of the mass of secondary organic aerosol formed from the photooxidation of isoprene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene respectively.
   Experimental gas/particle partitioning coefficients were determined for a wide range of carbonyl products formed from the photooxidation of isoprene and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene and compared with the theoretical values based on standard absorptive partitioning theory. Photooxidation products with a single carbonyl moiety were not observed in the particle phase, but dicarbonyls, and in particular, glyoxal and methylglyoxal, exhibited gas/particle partitioning coefficients several orders of magnitude higher than expected theoretically. These findings support the importance of heterogeneous and particle-phase chemical reactions for SOA formation and growth during the atmospheric degradation of anthropogenic and biogenic hydrocarbons.

AB This study was performed to re-evaluate the exothermic behavior of crude oil + clay minerals by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique from the view of thermal analysis. It is observed that KekeYa crude oil shows much greater amount of heat generation at low temperature oxidation (LTO) stage than high temperature oxidation (HTO) stage, which may be due to the high content light components of crude oil. Besides, all clay minerals exhibited a good catalytic effect on oil oxidation, especially in HTO stage. In this paper, it revealed that illite shows the highest catalytic ability for crude oil oxidation which is slightly different from the conclusion of smectite as the best catalyzer in our previous study performed by thermogravimetry/derivative thermogravimetry (TG/DTG) techniques. However, kaolinite was not the best catalytic agent for crude oil oxidation concluded in the two studies. Some new recognition was achieved by comparing the results with previous study. The kinetic computations based on a single heating rate may be not accurate and reliable, which should be responsible for the difference of clay catalytic ability. The calculated kinetics parameters of different models do not show significant variation which can provide important guidance for better understanding the catalytic effect of different clays on crude oil oxidation as well as reservoir simulation studies. Hence, we can unitize this difference for reasonably adjusting oxidation kinetics parameters obtained by different kinetic models to match experimental results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this work, we report an unexpected but significant improvement of the redox behavior of conducting polyaniline (PAN) films by trapping intrinsically nonconducting poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) in the matrix of the polymer acting as stiffening and/or cross-linking agents. Film structural stiffening of PAN/PVA inclusion was studied in relation to film compositional dynamics. PAN and PAN/PVA composite films were potentiodynamically deposited using high-frequency electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance under electrochemical potentiodynamic control. From the simultaneously obtained measurements of nanogravimetric and cyclic voltammetric data, it has been found that the presence of PVA in the deposition solution increased the rate of PAN film growth as a function of PVA concentration. Characterization of the resultant composite films in monomer-free acidic electrolyte solutions showed significantly enhanced redox behavior of PAN/PVA composite films (with different PVA contents) compared to pure PAN by a factor of similar to 2-4. For the study of structure-composition relationships of composite polymer films, fluxes of instantaneous mobile species dynamics (ion/solvent) as a function of film redox conversion and potential cycling were correlated with film structural stiffening and the observed unusual redox enhancement of PAN/PVA composite films. Using various experimental timescales, we were able to resolve bound (associated with ion transfer) and free solvent compositional dynamics (associated with thermodynamic activity balance).

AB A rapidly increasing number of Phase I dose-finding studies, those based on the standard 3+3 design in particular, are being prolonged with the inclusion of dose expansion cohorts (DEC) to better characterize the toxicity profiles of experimental agents and to study disease-specific cohorts. These trials consist of two phases: the usual dose escalation phase that aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and the dose expansion phase that accrues additional patients, often with different eligibility criteria, and where additional information is collected. Currently, not all protocols specify whether and how the MTD will be updated in the light of new data accumulated from the DEC. Here, we propose methods that allow monitoring of safety in the DEC by reevaluating the MTD in light of additional information. Our working assumption is that, regardless of the design being used for dose escalation, during the DEC we are experimenting in the neighborhood of a target dose with an acceptable rate of toxicity. We refine our initial estimate of the MTD by continuing experimentation in the immediate vicinity of the initial estimate of the MTD. The auxiliary information provided by such an evaluation will include toxicity, pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and other endpoints. We consider approaches specifically focused on the aims of DEC that examine efficacy alone or simultaneously with safety. Simulations provide further insight into the behavior of the proposed tests. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB Small oligomers of the amyloid beta protein (A beta) have been implicated as the neurotoxic agent leading to Alzheimer's disease, and in particular mutations in the hydrophobic core region comprising amino acids L17 to A21 have a large influence on the propensity for aggregate formation. It has been shown that the F19P alloform of Ab forms small aggregates, but does not proceed to form large fibrils and plaques. In order to understand the origin of this behavior, the gas phase conformations for the different charge states of the wild-type 12-28 fragment of the amyloid beta and its F19P alloform were studied by a combination of action-FRET, ion-mobility spectrometry (IMS) and molecular dynamics simulations. Comparison of the experimental and theoretical action-FRET efficiencies and collision cross sections allowed the determination of the lowest energy conformational family for each alloform and charge state. For both alloforms, it was found that there is a change from globular to helical structure between the 3+ and 4+ charge states. Additional protonation to give 5+ and 6+ charge states caused unfolding of this helical motif, with the wild alloform showing beta-turn like motifs and the F19P alloform random coil motifs. The presence of the helical to beta-turn structural transition in the wild, but not the F19P, alloform may help to elucidate the origin of the large difference in aggregation behavior of the two alloforms.

AB Hydrodynamic characteristics in a wind-box and bubbling fluidized-bed (BFB) gasifier zone of a dual fluidized-bed (DFB) were investigated by a two-phase three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The gas and solid phases were treated by an Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model, coupled with the realizable k-epsilon turbulence model and the kinetic theory of granular flow (KTGF) describing the random motion of solid particles. Pressure drops obtained from the cold-rig CFD simulation were validated with experimental data which were measured in a pilot-scale BFB using air as a fluidization agent and sand as heat carrier particles at an operating temperature of 800 degrees C Hydrodynamics of the fluidized-bed with a uniform gas distributor (Ideal case) and a nozzle-type gas distributor (Real case) were evaluated in terms of the pressure drop, solid volume fraction (SVF), uniformity index (UI), and solid stack volume (SSV) for three inlet air flow rates (low, medium and high). Similar behaviors were shown for both the two cases in pressure drop along the gasifier height. However, significant differences were observed in SVF, UI, and SSV. A threshold changing the slope of SSV to the air flow rate was found at a fluidization index (u/u(mf)) of 2.9. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The rockburst and spalling problems encountered in the Jinping Underground Laboratory are to be investigated using 3-D physical model testing. New similarity relationships for the brittleness, brittle-ductile transition and ductility characteristics of deep hard rock are first established based on the characteristics of the deep rock mass, thereby providing guidance for the development of analog materials with new characteristics that are appropriate for investigating deep rock engineering disasters via large-scale 3-D physical model tests. Achieving similarity simultaneously among the multiple physical-mechanical properties of deep hard rock constitutes the major challenge of research on analog materials. Consequently, a new method for designing analog materials by controlling the aggregate characteristics is proposed. The test results indicate that the aggregates of the analog materials can be controlled to achieve properties that are similar to those of the original rock. The newly developed analog material exhibits basic mechanical parameters and properties that are similar to those of Jinping marble, including high strength, high brittleness, and high unit weight in addition to brittle-ductile transition and ductility characteristics and deformation and failure modes. The new analog material successfully simulates the major physical-mechanical properties of Jinping marble and overcomes the limitations of preexisting methods, which develop analog materials via cementing agents, in which the achievement of similarity simultaneously among multiple properties is impossible.

AB We isolated two polypeptides on HPLC from the acetonic precipitate of the urine of normal subjects and of patients with untreated AML, APL and AMML. Before separation the quantity of the total urinary factor from leukemic patients was 50+/-10 mg/24h and from normal subjects was 10+/-5 mg. We tested the total polypeptidic extract and the two main fractions obtained on liquid cultures of the peripheral CFU of normal and leukemic subjects (AML, APL, CML and CMmL). Colony growth, cell morphology changes and the main cellular markers were examined at the beginning and at the 5th and 10th days of incubation in RPMI 1640 medium. Testing conditions were basal and as determined by the addition of the polypeptidic fractions, both alone and in association with trans-retinoic acid (t-RA) or thioproline (T). Simultaneously and under the same experimental conditions, we tested the activity of G- and GMCSF and IL3. The results obtained prove the colony stimulating activity of the two fractions and of crude extract; they also prove the ability of such agents to modify the behavior in vitro of peripheral CFU. The urinary extracts are also able to stimulate a moderate differentiation of the elements and an increase both in fibroblasts and in adhesion molecules. We conclude that the dosage of growth factors in urine may be usefull as important marker in several hemopoietic pathological conditions or as a possible source of growth factors.

AB The enantiomeric separation of methadone in the presence of multiple isomer mixtures of sulfated -cyclodextrin (S--CD) was studied experimentally with CZE and theoretically using computer simulation. Experiments were performed over many years with several lots of S--CD from the same manufacturer with a specified degree of substitution of 7-11. Large differences in the migration patterns were observed between certain lots and it was concluded that the extent of labelling in lots released after a transition time was higher than originally specified. The migration pattern was observed to be associated with (i) the ionic strength increase resulting from using S--CDs with a higher charge state and (ii) differences in buffer composition. Apparent binding constants between methadone and the S--CD and complex mobilities were determined for different lots of S--CD at varying ionic strength using phosphate and 3-morpholino-2-hydroxypropanesulfonic acid buffers. The obtained values were used as input for simulations. For a given ionic strength, agreement between predicted and experimentally observed behavior was obtained for different buffers. R-methadone has a stronger interaction with S--CD than S-methadone. For any given configuration there is a distinct S--CD concentration range which results in the cationic migration of S-methadone while the migration direction of R-methadone is reversed. This configuration was demonstrated to be applicable for micropreparative CZE separations.

ID BACKSCATTER COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS; SPECTRUM ANALYSIS; RANDOM-MEDIA;
   TISSUE; ATTENUATION; SITES
AB Although quantitative ultrasound imaging based on backscattering coefficients has proven potential for tissue characterization, the scattering models used in most studies assume distributions of identical scatterers. However, actual tissues may exhibit multiple levels of spatial scales. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to analyze the effects of scatterer size distributions when using a fluid-sphere model for estimating values of effective scatterer diameter (ESD) through both simulations and experiments. For simulations, ESD estimates were obtained at several analysis frequencies between 1 and 40 MHz from populations of scatterers with diameters ranging between 25 and 100 mu m, 25 and 50 mu m, 50 and 100 mu m, and 50 and 75 mu m. For sufficiently high analysis frequencies, the ESD estimates obtained through simulations were approximately inversely proportional to frequency and mostly independent of the underlying scatterer size distribution. Asymptotic expressions for the expected ESD estimates at low- and high-frequency limits were derived. Experiments were conducted using two gelatin phantoms with contrast agent spheres ranging in diameter from 30 to 140 mu m and 70 to 140 mu m, and 5-, 7.5-, 10-, and 13-MHz focused transducers. Not only was the asymptotic behavior of ESD versus frequency estimates observed experimentally, but also the experimental ESD estimates using the 10- and 13-MHz transducers were lower than the smallest scatterers present in the second phantom. These results may have a direct impact on how scatterer size estimates corresponding to specimens with different sub-resolution spatial scales should be interpreted.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) adopting both batteries and supercapacitors have attracted a significant amount of attention in research communities due to their unique power-sharing capabilities. A hybrid energy storage system (HESS) can effectively reduce power stress that would, otherwise, be applied to batteries alone, and whose weight and size is still a common concern when competing against conventional internal-combustion-engine-powered cars. In this paper, a high-level algorithm is developed to adaptively split the load between two sources for an EV adopting HESS under real-life load fluctuations. A converter-supercapacitor pack (SP) coupled HESS upon which such an algorithm is deployed on, is proposed to divert excess power into the SP via a smart power converter, which is located in between in order to regulate both behaviors. A power-split strategy is designed to track real-time load profiles and determine one important variable: the cutoff frequency. As a consequence, relatively higher frequency portion of the load power gets channeled to the SP, and the remaining less-varying power demand is sent to the BP based on the fundamental energy-balancing equation. A simplified HESS model is developed in MATLAB, and the real-time power-split algorithm is coded using Labview and verified on a test rig. Both simulation and experimental results prove its effectiveness in coping with even the harshest driving scenarios in real life.

AB Identification of a consumer's intent has a vital impact on commodity recommendation, selection of hot drainage commodity, website layout, and link settings. Most of the present studies on user intent are considered static. Specific intent is accompanied by a specific environment. Thus, intent is static when the environment does not change. However, the uncertainty of user access and purchase in e-commerce activities indicates that user intent can assume multiple forms and has multiple developmental stages. Therefore, this study draws support from the core ideas of an ant colony algorithm. Ants represent users, and pheromones represent user intent. User intents of browsing, collection, cart shopping, and purchasing behavior are obtained from ant responses to pheromones. Pheromone is expressed as the inner product of the objective attribute of commodity and user perception ability, because user intent is the matching result of objective attributes of commodity and subjective feelings of users, and its value is the concentration of user intent pheromone. Thus, the dynamics and uncertainty of user intention development can be presented by the ant colony algorithm. In this study, data were obtained from a NetLogo simulation experiment. We used neural networks to identify and verify user intentions of browsing, collection, cart shopping, and purchasing. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of intention prediction increased from 48% to 67%, and a level of the 11-20% accuracy improvement shows good, realistic predictions.

AB To investigate the consequences of macromolecular crowding on the behavior of a globular protein, we performed a combined experimental and computational study on the 148-residue single-domain alpha/beta protein, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans apoflavodoxin. In vitro thermal unfolding experiments, as well as assessment of native and denatured structures, were probed by using far-UV CD in the presence of various amounts of Ficoll 70, an inert spherical crowding agent. Ficoll 70 has a concentration-dependent effect on the thermal stability of apoflavodoxin (Delta T-m of 20 degrees C at 400 mg/ml; PH 7). As judged by CD, addition of Ficoll 70 causes an increase in the amount of secondary structure in the native-state ensemble (PH 7, 20 degrees C) but only minor effects on the denatured state. Theoretical calculations, based on an off-lattice model and hard-sphere particles, are in good agreement with the in vitro data. The simulations demonstrate that, in the presence of 25% volume occupancy of spheres, native flavodoxin is thermally stabilized, and the free energy landscape shifts to favor more compact structures in both native and denatured states. The difference contact map reveals that the native-state compaction originates in stronger interactions between the helices and the central beta-sheet, as well as by less fraying in the terminal helices. This study demonstrates that macromolecular crowding has structural effects on the folded ensemble of polypeptides.

AB Melamine-formaldehyde-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (MF-DTPA) resin was prepared as a new adsorbent for removing heavy metals from wastewater effluents. The resin was synthesised by anchoring the chelating agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) to melamine via amide covalent bond during melamine-formaldehyde condensation reaction in an acidic aqueous medium. The effects of reaction parameters (temperature, acidity, and water content) on resin characteristics (water regain, rigidity, DTPA functionality, and porosity) were monitored to specify the best synthesis conditions. The resin was chemically characterized using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), elemental analysis (EA), thermal programmed decomposition-mass spectrometry TPD-MS), solid-state C-13 NMR and N-15 NMR, and was morphologically characterized using N-2 gas adsorption/desorption (BET analysis) and field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The water regain factor was also calculated to determine hydrophilic character of the resin. The simultaneous adsorption performance of MF-DTPA resin towards selected heavy metals, Co(II), Cd(II), Zn(II), and Cu(II), was discussed. Quantitative analysis for adsorption was conducted using atomic absorption to investigate the kinetics, adsorption isotherm and thermodynamics of the removal process considering pH, initial concentration, temperature, and contact time as controlling parameters. The mechanism of adsorption was suggested based on experimental results. This work shows the potential application of the MF-DTPA resin for removing heavy metals from wastewaters.

AB Here in, we presented a facile one-step method for the synthesis of Graphene oxide-silver (GO-Ag) nanocomposite and its applications as a sorbent for the elimination of some toxic pollutants from aqueous medium, as an efficient catalyst in the individual as well as simultaneous reduction reactions of multiple compounds, and as an antibacterial agent for the destruction of some harmful microorganisms existent in wastewater. GO was prepared using a modified Hummers method and Ag nanoparticles were integrated on GO sheets by chemical reduction of Ag+ ions on the surfaces of GO sheets. The composition and morphology of the nanocomposite was extensively characterized with elemental dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The GO-Ag nanocomposite demonstrated remarkable adsorption capacities and recyclability for malachite green (MG) and ethyl violet (EV) dyes. Various experimental parameters affecting adsorptive behavior of nanocomposite like temperature, pH, time of contact between dye and adsorbent, and adsorbent dose were evaluated thoroughly. Experimental data was simulated with different adsorption isotherms and kinetic models to evaluate adsorption behavior of both dyes and results confirmed the adsorption of both the dyes to be followed by pseudo 2nd order kinetic model and Langmuir adsorption model. Moreover, adsorbent was regenerated in suitable media for both dyes without any loss in removal efficiency. The catalytic performance for the 2-nitroaniline (2-NA) reduction was investigated in detail. Most importantly, the prepared nanocomposite was found to have potential to adsorb multiple pollutants all together as well as to catalyze the simultaneous reduction of a mixture of dyes (MG, MO, and EV) and 2-NA. An additional advantage of the GO-Ag nanocomposite was its antibacterial activity acquired to the presence of Ag nanoparticles. Two bacterial strains (Gram-negative bacterium, E. coli and the Gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus) were used to test antibacterial activity of composite and the results confirmed the remarkable performance of the nanocomposite in destroying harmful pathogens.

AB Activation of the immune system in insects has been shown to be costly in the laboratory setting, but experimental studies in the field are lacking. The costs of immunity in the wild may be different to those in the laboratory because animals in the wild are simultaneously subjected to a suite of selective agents. We have measured the costs of immune system activation in a wild population of the territorial damselfly Calopteryx splendens. Immune-challenged males were found to be less likely to be territorial and had lower overall survival rates than control or sham-manipulated males. Because territorial males have a higher mating success than nonterritorial males, this result suggests that immune-challenged males are also likely to suffer reduced mating success. However, the activation of the immune system as such did not increase predation risk; this occurred due to a combination of the former with a reduced territory-holding potential. As such, immune-challenged males not holding a territory were most susceptible to predation by birds. The size of the wing spots, a known sexually selected male trait, predicted territorial behaviour in control and sham-manipulated males, but not in immune-challenged males. Our data show that immune system activation can have several costs acting in unison and that ubiquitous ecological interactions, such as predation, may affect trade-offs between immunity and other life history traits.

AB We have determined the equilibrium surface tension for aqueous solutions of three alkanolamines composed of 32.5 mass% N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 12.5 mass% diethanolamine (DEA) with the addition of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mass% of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), at 303.15, 308.15, 313.15, 318.15, 323.15, 328.15, 333.15, 338.15, and 343.15 K. We have also determined experimentally the foaming properties for the same aqueous solutions of three alkanolamines as in the surface tension study, at 303.15, 313.15, 323.15, 333.15, and 343.15 K. In order to elucidate the effect of the concentration of AMP on the two studied properties we have also determined experimentally the foamability of the aqueous system of two alkanolamines composed of 32.5 mass% MDEA + 12.5 mass% DEA, at 303.15, 313.15, 323.15, 333.15, and 343.15 K, and for the two binary systems composed of DEA + water and MDEA + water, at concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mass% of the alkanolamine, at 313.15, 323.15, 333.15, and 343.15 K. In the temperature range studied, the experimental surface tension values of the aqueous blends of three alkanolamines decrease linearly both as the AMP concentration increases and as the temperature increases. The surface tension results for the aqueous solutions of blends of three alkanolamines were correlated simultaneously as a function of temperature and AMP concentration. The foamability results for the quaternary systems reveal that the high surface activity of AMP allows it to act favorably as antifoaming agent in the concentration range of 4-10 mass%, at 303.15, 313.15, and 323.15 K. The experimental behaviour of the different studied systems show that the high surface activity of AMP leads to low surface tension, large surface adsorption, large limiting elasticity, and very low foamability for aqueous systems with one, two or three alkanolamines in which it is present as a component.

AB Toxicokinetic modeling is a useful tool to describe or predict the behavior of a chemical agent in the human or animal organism. A general model based on four compartments was developed in a previous study to quantify the effect of human variability on a wide range of biological exposure indicators.
   The aim of this study was to adapt this existing general toxicokinetic model to three organic solvents-methyl ethyl ketone, 1-methoxy-2-propanol, and 1,1,1,-trichloroethane-and to take into account sex differences. In a previous human volunteer study we assessed the impact of sex on different biomarkers of exposure corresponding to the three organic solvents mentioned above. Results from that study suggested that not only physiological differences between men and women but also differences due to sex hormones levels could influence the toxicokinetics of the solvents. In fact the use of hormonal contraceptive had an effect on the urinary levels of several biomarkers, suggesting that exogenous sex hormones could influence CYP2E1 enzyme activity. These experimental data were used to calibrate the toxicokinetic models developed in this study.
   Our results showed that it was possible to use an existing general toxicokinetic model for other compounds. In fact, most of the simulation results showed good agreement with the experimental data obtained for the studied solvents, with a percentage of model predictions that lies within the 95% confidence interval varying from 44.4 to 90%. Results pointed out that for same exposure conditions, men and women can show important differences in urinary levels of biological indicators of exposure. Moreover, when running the models by simulating industrial working conditions, these differences could be even more pronounced.
   A general and simple toxicokinetic model, adapted for three well-known organic solvents, allowed us to show that metabolic parameters can have an important impact on the urinary levels of the corresponding biomarkers. These observations give evidence of an interindividual variability, an aspect that should have its place in the approaches for setting limits of occupational exposure.

AB Use of PhPyCNO-/X- "blends" (PhPyCNOH = phenyl 2-pyridyl ketoxime; X- = OH-, alkanoato, ClO4-) in copper chemistry yielded trinuclear clusters that have been characterized as inverse-9-metallacrown-3 compounds and accommodate one or two guest ligands. The magnetic behavior showed a large antiferromagnetic interaction and a discrepancy between the low-temperature magnetic behavior observed experimentally and that predicted from a magnetic model. The discrepancy between the Brillouin curve and the experimental result provides clear evidence of the influence of the antisymmetric interaction. Introducing the antisymmetric terms derived from the fit of the susceptibility data into the magnetization formula caused the simulated curve to become nearly superimposable on the experimental one. The EPR data indicated that the compound [Cu-3(PhPyCNO)(3) (mu(3)-OH)(2,4,5-T)(2)] (1), where 2,4,5-T is 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetate, has isosceles or lower magnetic symmetry (delta not equal 0), that antisymmetric exchange is important (G not equal 0), and that Delta E > hv. The structures of the complexes 1 and [Cu-3(PhPyCNO)(3)(mu(3)-OH)(H2O)(ClO4)(2)] (2) were determined using single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Theoretical calculations based on density functional theory were performed using the full crystal structures of 1, 2, [Cu-3(PhPyCNO)(3)(OH)(CH3OH)(2)(ClO4)(2)] (3), and [Cu-3(PhPyCNO)(3) (mu-OMe)(Cl)(ClO4)] (4). The geometries of the model compounds [Cu-3(kappa N-3,N,O-HNCHCHNO)(3)(mu(3)-OH)(mu(2)-HCOO)(HCOO)] (5), [Cu-3(kappa N-3,N,O-HNCHCHNO)(3)(mu(2)-HCOO)(HCOO)](+) (6), [Cu-3(kappa N-3,N,O-HNCHCHNO)(3)(mu(3)-O)](+) (7), and [Cu-3(kappa N-3,N,O-HNCHCHNO)(3)](3+) (8) were optimized at the same level of theory for both the doublet and quartet states, and vibrational analysis indicated that the resulting equilibrium geometries corresponded to minima on the potential energy surfaces. Both e(g) and t(2g) magnetic orbitals seem to contribute to the magnetic exchange coupling. The latter contribution, although less important, might be due to overlap of the t(2g) orbitals with the p-type orbitals of the central triply bridging oxide ligand, thereby affecting its displacement from the Cu-3 plane and contributing to the antiferromagnetic coupling. The crucial role of the triply bridging oxide (mu(3)-O) ligand on the antiferromagnetic exchange coupling between the three Cu(II) magnetic centers is further evidenced by the excellent linear correlation of the coupling constant J with the distance of the mu(3)-O ligand from the centroid of the Cu-3 triangle.

AB The presence and concentration of pollutants in groundwater are influenced by geophysical processes and the behavior of economic agents. The purpose of this paper is to assess the importance of spatial variability in physical parameters in the design of efficient pollution regulations. Alternative tax policies are evaluated in terms of effects on farm profit utilizing a spatially distributed, dynamic simulation model which links economic behavior with the geophysical processes that determine groundwater quality. The empirical focus is the control of groundwater nitrates arising from irrigated agriculture in Malheur County, Oregon. Results indicate that a detailed accounting of spatial variance in physical parameters had little effect on selection of a cost-minimizing tax policy to control groundwater nitrate concentration. This result implies that relatively simple tax schemes and models to evaluate these tax schemes may be adequate in some settings. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB In order to operate a blast furnace properly, the future prediction of process variables by a transient model based on kinetics is useful. In general, such a kinematic blast furnace model includes uncertain factors regarding reaction rates and heat transfer. However, any guideline of adjusting such factors to reproduce actual transition of process variables has not been fully discussed in the literature. In this research, we developed a transient two-dimensional (2D) model for online use, and then discussed an adjustment method to reproduce the behavior of process variables when the reducing agent ratio (RAR) is changed from the viewpoint of mass and heat balance with the Rist diagram. It was found that appropriate consideration of the chemical reserve zone and the heat balance of the furnace was effective to fit the developed model to the actual data.

ID EVOLUTIONARY GAME
AB Evolutionary dynamics in finite populations is known to fixate eventually in the absence of mutation. We here show that a similar phenomenon can be found in stochastic game dynamical batch learning, and investigate fixation in learning processes in a simple 2 x 2 game, for two-player games with cyclic interaction, and in the context of the best-shot network game. The analogues of finite populations in evolution are here finite batches of observations between strategy updates. We study when and how such fixation can occur, and present results on the average time-to-fixation from numerical simulations. Simple cases are also amenable to analytical approaches and we provide estimates of the behaviour of so-called escape times as a function of the batch size. The differences and similarities with escape and fixation in evolutionary dynamics are discussed.

AB This study proposed an improved dragonfly algorithm (DA). This algorithm is a recently proposed metaheuristic optimizer inspired by swarming behaviors of dragonflies, which has reasonably achieved satisfactory results in dealing with engineering, education, and other fields. However, the original method will show some shortcomings in convergence speed or falling into local optimum. Given these shortcomings, this paper proposes an improved optimizer to balance the relationship between exploitation and exploration and mitigate any deficiency. First, by implementing the idea of the quantum rotation gate, the swarm of agents can be shifted to a position more conducive to the optimal value. Then, Gaussian mutation is adopted to improve the swarm's ability to mutate and realize its diversity, which enables the primary method to have a strong local search capability. The proposed method was compared against six other common meta-heuristics and five state-of-the-art algorithms on a comprehensive set of nineteen functions selected from twenty-three classic benchmark problems and thirty IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) CEC (Congress on Evolutionary Computation) 2014 benchmark tasks. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, the non-parametric statistical Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests were performed to validate the significance of the proposed method against other counterparts. The results of experimental simulations demonstrate that two introduced strategies can significantly improve the exploitative and exploratory tendencies of the original algorithm. Furthermore, the convergence speed of the conventional approach has been improved to a large extent. Additionally, quantumbehaved and Gaussian mutational dragonfly algorithm (QGDA) is utilized as a searching core in a wrapper feature selection technique, and it is compared with other advanced feature selection methods. The results show that QGDA achieves substantial superiority in feature selection through optimum fitness and minimum error rate. Also, the results of QGDA on the three classical engineering design problems have demonstrated that the proposed method can effectively solve these constraints problems. It is encouraging that the proposed method can be used as a useful, auxiliary tool for solving complex optimization problems.

AB Serotonergic modulation of the sensory neurons that mediate the gill-and tail-withdrawal reflexes of Aplysia is a useful model system for studies of neuronal plasticity that contributes to learning and memory. The effects of serotonin (5-HT) are mediated, in part, via two protein kinases (protein kinase A, PKA, and protein kinase C, PKC), which in turn, modulate at least four membrane currents, including a S ("serotonin-sensitive") K+ current (I-K,(S)), a steeply voltage-dependent K+ current (IK-V), a slow component of the Ca2+ activated K+ current (I-K,I-Ca-S), and a L-type Ca2+ current (ICa-L). The present study investigated how the modulation of these currents altered the spike duration and excitability of sensory neurons and examined the relative contributions of PKA- and PKC-mediated effects to the actions of 5-HT. A Hodgkin-Huxley type model was developed that described the ionic conductances in the somata of sensory neurons. The descriptions of these currents and their modulation were based largely on voltage-clamp data from sensory neurons. Simulations were preformed with the program SNNAP (Simulator for Neural Networks and Action Potentials). The model was sufficient to replicate empirical data that describes the membrane currents, action potential waveform and excitability as well as their modulation by application of 5-HT, increased levels of adenosine cyclic monophosphate or application of active phorbol esters. In the model, modulation of IK-V, by PKC played a dominate role in 5-HT-induced spike broadening, whereas the concurrent modulation of I-K,I-S and I-K,I-Ca-S by PKA primarily accounted for 5-HT-induced increases in excitability. Finally, simulations indicated that a PKC-induced increase in excitability resulted from decreases of I-K,I-S and I-K,I-Ca-S which was likely the indirect result of cross-talk between the PKC and PKA systems. The results provide several predictions that warrant additional experimental investigation and illustrate the importance of considering indirect as well as direct effects of modulatory agents on the modulation of membrane currents.

AB Cockroach shelter-seeking strategy may initially look like an undirected random search, but we show that they are attracted to darkened shelters. They arrive at a shelter in about half the time control cockroaches take to reach the same location with no shelter present. We were able to identify six statistically significant trends from the behavior of 134 cockroaches in 1-min naive walking trials with four different shelter configurations. By combining these trends into a model, we built a stochastic algorithm that significantly biases a simulated agent toward a target location. We call this model RAMBLER (Randomized Algorithm Mimicking Biased Lone Exploration in Roaches). RAMBLER could be adapted for a mobile robot equipped with an onboard camera and antenna-like contact sensors.

AB Background: The genome of living organisms is constantly exposed to several damaging agents that induce different types of DNA lesions, leading to cellular malfunctioning and onset of many diseases. To maintain genome stability, cells developed various repair and tolerance systems to counteract the effects of DNA damage. Here we focus on Post Replication Repair (PRR), the pathway involved in the bypass of DNA lesions induced by sunlight exposure and UV radiation. PRR acts through two different mechanisms, activated by mono-and poly-ubiquitylation of the DNA sliding clamp, called Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA).
   Results: We developed a novel protocol to measure the time-course ratios between mono-, di- and tri-ubiquitylated PCNA isoforms on a single western blot, which were used as the wet readout for PRR events in wild type and mutant S. cerevisiae cells exposed to acute UV radiation doses. Stochastic simulations of PCNA ubiquitylation dynamics, performed by exploiting a novel mechanistic model of PRR, well fitted the experimental data at low UV doses, but evidenced divergent behaviors at high UV doses, thus driving the design of further experiments to verify new hypothesis on the functioning of PRR. The model predicted the existence of a UV dose threshold for the proper functioning of the PRR model, and highlighted an overlapping effect of Nucleotide Excision Repair (the pathway effectively responsible to clean the genome from UV lesions) on the dynamics of PCNA ubiquitylation in different phases of the cell cycle. In addition, we showed that ubiquitin concentration can affect the rate of PCNA ubiquitylation in PRR, offering a possible explanation to the DNA damage sensitivity of yeast strains lacking deubiquitylating enzymes.
   Conclusions: We exploited an in vivo and in silico combinational approach to analyze for the first time in a Systems Biology context the events of PCNA ubiquitylation occurring in PRR in budding yeast cells. Our findings highlighted an intricate functional crosstalk between PRR and other events controlling genome stability, and evidenced that PRR is more complicated and still far less characterized than previously thought.

AB Recent effort in organizational psychology and organizational behavior (OPOB) research has placed increasing emphasis on understanding dynamic phenomena and processes. This calls for more and better use of dynamic modeling in OPOB research than before. The goals of this review are to provide an overview of the general forms of dynamic modeling in OPOB research, discuss three longitudinal data analytic techniques for conducting dynamic modeling with empirical data [i.e., time-series-based modeling, latent-change-scores-based modeling, and functional data analysis (FDA)], and introduce various dynamic modeling approaches for building theories about dynamic phenomena and processes (i.e., agent-based modeling, system dynamics modeling, and hybrid modeling). This review also highlights several OPOB research areas to which dynamic modeling has been applied and discusses future research directions for better utilizing dynamic modeling in those areas.

AB Estimating risk preferences is tricky because controlling for confounding factors is difficult. Omitting or imperfectly controlling for these factors can attribute too much observable behaviour to risk aversion and bias estimated preferences. Agents often modify risky decisions in response to dynamic wealth or asset thresholds, where such thresholds exist. Ignoring this dynamic risk response introduces an attribution bias in static estimates of risk aversion. We demonstrate this pitfall using a simple model and a Monte Carlo simulation to explore the implications of this problem for empirical estimation. While an approach that jointly estimates risk preferences and wealth dynamics may remedy the problem by extracting dynamic risk responses from observed behaviour, it is likely to be challenging to implement in broader empirical settings for reasons we discuss.

AB Based on a very simple coarse-grained colloidal model, here we implement an effective hard-sphere theory and numerical simulation to capture the general features of the association equilibria for globular proteins in crowded environment. We measure the activity coefficient, i.e., the deviation from ideal behavior of protein solution, and the crowding factor, i.e., the contribution of crowders to the association equilibria, for proteins in macromolecular crowding. The results show that the association balance in macro molecular crowding depends sensitively on the magnitude of protein-crowder attraction and the relative size of reactant to crowding agent. Since our coarse-grained model is irrelevant to the microscopic details of the molecules, it can be applied to the control of the association equilibria of many globular proteins such as bovine serum albumin, crystallin and lysozyme.

ID MODEL-REDUCTION; EVOLUTION; EQUATION
AB Control of nonlinear large-scale dynamical networks, e.g., collective behavior of agents interacting via a scale-free connection topology, is a central problem in many scientific and engineering fields. For the linear version of this problem, the so-called controllability Gramian has played an important role to quantify how effectively the dynamical states are reachable by a suitable driving input. In this paper, we first extend the notion of the controllability Gramian to nonlinear dynamics in terms of the Gibbs distribution. Next, we show that, when the networks are open to environmental noise, the newly defined Gramian is equal to the covariance matrix associated with randomly excited, but uncontrolled, dynamical state trajectories. This fact theoretically justifies a simple Monte Carlo simulation that can extract effectively controllable subdynamics in nonlinear complex networks. In addition, the result provides a novel insight into the relationship between controllability and statistical mechanics.

AB It is well observed that some infectious diseases show a feature of periodicity; that is, the diseasemay prevail during a certain season and vanish afterwards. In the effort of understanding this specific phenomenon, in this paper, we propose a spreading model with a time-variant infectivity function considering both the features of periodicity and agent variability. We apply the modified model to a scale-free network frame with tunable power-law coefficient to find out the characteristics of periodic spreading dynamics. Our work consists of both theoretical derivation and a series of corresponding numerical simulations in order to find out the influence of the parameters of both network topology and the modified model on spreading dynamics in the underlined networks. The experiments prove the success of our model in producing a periodic behavior of spreading, and the results agree well with theoretical calculations.

AB This study examines the effects of two main characteristics of online shopping environments - search tool and information load - on the descriptive characteristics of consideration sets: size, dynamism, variety and preference dispersion. A controlled experiment using a simulated online store was conducted to test the hypotheses, manipulating the two factors, search tool (yes, no) and information load (high, low). The main task consisted of shopping for and purchasing a product in an online store. Results show that both information load and search tools transform the way in which consumers form their consideration sets, resulting in smaller, more stable, and more homogenous sets, integrated by more equally preferred alternatives. Interaction effects show that search tools enhance their effectiveness in high information load settings. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the emergence and prevalence of cooperation among selfish agents is a long-standing puzzle in the scientific community, various mechanisms and models have been proposed to account for the cooperative behaviors. In this work, we present a modified strategy update dynamics in which the environmental information is added into the standard Fermi rule. Extensive numerical simulations have demonstrated that cooperation can be strongly promoted under our novel update dynamics. Our results also indicate that referring the environmental information during the strategy update is helpful for fostering the cooperative clusters and avoiding to be exploited by the defectors. Our results provide further insights into competition and cooperation, and contribute to explain the collective cooperation in many real systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The analytical flow simulation of fresh concrete is a recent challenge to researchers. Due to its heterogeneity, the concrete mix shows neither a perfectly viscous nor perfectly particulate behavior. However, the particulate behavior of fresh concrete flow like arching and blocking in pipes and in complex boundary conditions, is very common. This is further magnified due to high pressure in the case of shotcreting. For the first time in shotcrete research, authors propose the application of the Distinct Element Method [1] (DEM) to predict particle behavior and amount of rebound loss, and to assess the quality of the shotcrete analytically. Also, the effect of an accelerating agent, the way its effect is modeled, effects of gradual change in shooting pressure, the resulting rebound is shown. The void of the attached concrete is also compared with that of normal cast concrete in an analytical way.

AB Dispersal can play an important role in the population dynamics of forest insects, but the role of long-distance immigration and emigration remains unclear due to the difficulty of quantifying dispersal distance and direction. We designed an agent-based spruce budworm flight behavior model that, when interfaced with temperature, wind speed, and precipitation output from a high-resolution atmospheric model, produces detailed flight trajectories and deposition patterns over large landscapes. Rules and relationships describing budworm adult (moth) lift-off, ascent, horizontal flight, and descent were parameterized using a detailed empirical study of budworm dispersal behavior and corresponding meteorological conditions during a 1970s outbreak in New Brunswick, Canada. Simulated moth landings were assumed to be dependent in part on the availability of suitable host tree species. We applied the model to a 6.4 million ha landscape at the border between northern Minnesota (USA) and Ontario (Canada) during an eight-day flight window in late June 2007. Specimens collected during and after this flight window indicated moths emerging from an inland source of outbreak populations dispersed over 150 km to trap sites near the north shore of Lake Superior, where localized cooling was predicted to have delayed emergence of locally-produced budworm moths. Simulations suggested immigration of moths to lakeshore sites from the outbreak source was plausible on three of eight dates within the flight window, but the relatively narrow deposition footprints implied immigration occurred on different dates across lakeshore sites. Apart from wind speed and direction, precipitation and low temperatures limited dispersal to substantially shorter distances for a few dates within the simulated flight window. Key uncertainties limiting our understanding of atmospheric transport of spruce budworm include behavioral responses to vertical heterogeneity in the air temperature profile, the precipitation threshold required for the forced descent of moths from the air column, and search mechanisms affecting host and/or mate location during long-distance flight.

AB This study investigates routing algorithms for automated highway systems (AHS). In AHS, the central system manages decisions regarding routing for all vehicles and the distribution of traffic volume. We define an automated highway routing problem, of which the objective is to minimize the average travel time of vehicles through the target highway network. We propose four routing approaches considering (1) distance, (2) current traffic conditions, (3) predicted travel time, and (4) probabilistic route selection with predicted travel time. In the third and fourth approaches, the predicted travel time is obtained from an empirical speed-density relationship. AnyLogic, an agent-based simulation software, is used to simulate the behavior of individual cars. Four approaches are tested on a sample highway network and we found that the routing approach considering the predicted travel time difference exhibits the best performance.

AB We study the resonant behavior of Turing. pattern suppression in a model of the chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid reaction with periodic illumination. The results of simulations based on integration of partial differential equations display resonance at the frequency of autonomous oscillations in the corresponding well stirred system. The resonance in Turing pattern suppression is sharper at lower complexing agent concentration and is affected by the waveform of the periodic driving force. Square wave ton-off) periodic forcing is more effective in suppressing Turing patterns than sinusoidal forcing. We compare the dynamics of periodically forced Turing patterns with the dynamics of periodically forced nonhomogeneous states in a system of two identical coupled cells. Bifurcation analysis based on numerical continuation of the latter system gives good predictions for the boundaries of the major resonance regions of the periodically forced patterns.

   PERMEABILITY
AB A novel model able to quantitatively describe intracellular ice formation (IIF) as a function of temperature in a cell population characterized by a size distribution is proposed for the case when a permeant cryoprotectant agent (CPA) is present. As such, the model represents the ideal extension of the one recently proposed by the authors for interpreting the behavior of a size-distributed population of cells during cryopreservation without CPA. To resemble the experimental procedure actually adopted, the former model is coherently modified for the simulation of the initial equilibration stage (i.e., a one-step CPA permeation kinetics into cells initially under isotonic conditions to be suspended in a water/salt/CPA solution at ambient temperature) and of the subsequent cooling stage at constant rate down to -60 degrees C. Specifically, the size distribution dynamics of a cell population in response to water osmosis, CPA permeation, and IIF is simulated by means of a suitable population balance approach. Water and CPA intracellular transport equations based on the classical Kedem and Katchalsky formalism are coupled to the quantitative description of nucleation and diffusion-limited growth of ice crystals in the framework of a one-dimensional population balance equation. The driving forces of all the physico-chemical phenomena involved are evaluated by taking into account the relevant ternary phase diagram, whereas the viscosity of the cytoplasm solution is properly accounted as a function of the salt and CPA concentrations. After a reasoned choice of the values of model parameters, the behavior of isolated rat hepatocytes suspended in a water/sodium-chloride/glycerol solution is simulated and analyzed at different, practicable (i.e., low) constant cooling rates and CPA equilibration concentrations. It is confirmed that differently sized cells in a single population exhibit different IIF temperatures under the same operative conditions even in the presence of CPA. Correspondingly, the probability of IIF results to be a function of the initial size distribution of the cell population. Depending on the specific operative conditions adopted, the size distribution and the osmotic properties of the cell lineage at hand, IIF at -60 degrees C may be lethal for a fraction of the cell population (i.e., larger size classes), or it may not reach a dangerous level for the intermediate size class cells, while it will not even take place for the smaller ones. Finally, even if no comparison with experimental data is provided, an original and physically sound explanation for several, well-known experimental evidences, which appeared in a number of articles available in the literature of cell cryopreservation with CPA, is comprehensively given.

AB Hypotheses involving mediation are common in the behavioral sciences. Mediation exists when a predictor affects a dependent variable indirectly through at least one intervening variable, or mediator. Methods to assess mediation involving multiple simultaneous mediators have received little attention in the methodological literature despite a clear need. We provide an overview of simple and multiple mediation and explore three approaches that can be used to investigate indirect processes, as well as methods for contrasting two or more mediators within a single model. We present an illustrative example, assessing and contrasting potential mediators of the relationship between the helpfulness of socialization agents and job satisfaction. We also provide SAS and SPSS macros, as well as Mplus and LISREL syntax, to facilitate the use of these methods in applications.

AB We introduce a simple agent-based model which allows us to analyze three stylized facts: a fat-tailed size distribution of companies, a 'tent-shaped' growth rate distribution, the scaling relation of the growth rate variance with firm size, and the causality between them. This is achieved under the simple hypothesis that firms compete for a scarce quantity (either aggregate demand or workforce) which is allocated probabilistically. The model allows us to relate size and growth rate distributions. We compare the results of our model to simulations with other scaling relationships, and to similar models and relate it to existing theory. Effects arising from binning data are discussed.

AB We consider a distributed average consensus algorithm over a network in which communication links fail with independent probability. In such stochastic networks, convergence is defined in terms of the variance of deviation from average. We first show how the problem can be recast as a linear system with multiplicative random inputs which model link failures. We then use our formulation to derive recursion equations for the second order statistics of the deviation from average in networks with and without additive noise. We give expressions for the convergence behavior in the asymptotic limits of small failure probability and large networks. We also present simulation-free methods for computing the second order statistics in each network model and use these methods to study the behavior of various network examples as a function of link failure probability.

AB In this paper the wayfinding criterion always to 'proceed in the direction of the target', which is the core of the least-angle strategy, is examined. Although human route-selection behavior is much more complex than this, results of empirical studies presented in the literature suggest that preference for most direct direction plays an important role in human route choice within street networks. The least-angle strategy can be applied once the navigator knows the direction of the destination, and is therefore an appropriate temporary heuristic for situations where the navigator lacks more detailed information about the environment. To assess the effectiveness of the least-angle strategy in urban environments, an agent simulation has been performed on the urban street networks of two cities for three different modes of transportation-pedestrian, bicycle, and car. The results of the simulation are analyzed.

ID RISK; INSURANCE; INDIA; PERFORMANCE; CONSUMPTION; CONTRACTS; WEATHER
AB In this paper, we examine empirically whether risk pooling is more advantageous among altruistic compared to selfish agents in a framework where individuals cannot make binding commitments. In particular, we incorporate altuism into a model of risk sharing under imperfect commitment and use simulation methods to establish tests of the roles of both altruism and commitment problems in determining the extent of insurance and the intertemporal movements in interhousehold transfers. The tests are carried out using three panel data sets from two countries of rural South Asia that provide detailed information on transfers and enable the measurement of income shocks. The estimates provide strong support for the notion that imperfect commitment substantially constrains informal transfer arrangements, whether kin-based or not, but also provide evidence that altruism plays an important role in ameliorating commitment constraints and thus in increasing the gains from income pooling.

AB Operant learning is learning based on reinforcement of behaviours. We propose a new hypothesis for operant learning at the single neuron level based on spontaneous fluctuations of synaptic strength caused by receptor dynamics. These fluctuations allow the neural system to explore a space of outputs. If the receptor dynamics are altered by a reinforcement signal the neural system settles to better states, i.e., to match the environmental dynamics that determine reward. Simulations show that this mechanism can support operant learning in a feed-forward neural circuit, a recurrent neural circuit, and a spiking neural circuit controlling an agent learning in a dynamic reward and punishment situation. We discuss how the new principle relates to existing learning rules and observed phenomena of short and long-term potentiation. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   At 300 K two trans and one cis conformer were found to be dynamically stable. Two puckered forms of the oxoprolyl ring in rapid equilibrium have been detected. The equilibrium conformations appear rather rigid and poor in H-bonds.
   At 400 K both trans and cis conformers are thermally mixed. At high temperatures large fluctuations of the peptide bond between the oxo-prolyl and thyazolidin rings are observed. Nevertheless in the short time scale trans cis interconversion does not occur.
   Suggestions on the nature of the structure activity relationship are made.

AB In this work, a novel sensor based on printed circuit board (PCB) microstrip rectangular patch antenna is proposed to detect different ratios of ethanol alcohol in wines and isopropyl alcohol in disinfectants. The proposed sensor was designed by finite integration technique (FIT) based high-frequency electromagnetic solver (CST) and was fabricated by Proto Mat E33 machine. To implement the numerical investigations, dielectric properties of the samples were first measured by a dielectric probe kit then uploaded into the simulation program. Results showed a linear shifting in the resonant frequency of the sensor when the dielectric constant of the samples were changed due to different concentrations of ethanol alcohol and isopropyl alcohol. A good agreement was observed between the calculated and measured results, emphasizing the usability of dielectric behavior as an input sensing agent. It was concluded that the proposed sensor is viable for multipurpose chemical sensing applications.

AB To better solve the passenger assignment problem, which is a subproblem of the transit network optimization problem, we build an artificial urban transit system (AUTS) and adopt a day-to-day learning mechanism to describe passengers' route and departure-time-choice behaviors. With the support of AUTS to handle the lower level assignment problem, we are able to solve the upper level transit network design problem. Compared with other bilevel models, our approach better accommodates passengers' dynamic learning behavior and their heterogeneity. Based on AUTS, we solve the frequency optimization problem and compare the results with an analytical method. We also perform some numerical experiments on AUTS and discover some interesting issues on the capacity of public transportation system and passengers' heterogeneity.

AB This paper introduces Polyphorm, an interactive visualization and model fitting tool that provides a novel approach for investigating cosmological datasets. Through a fast computational simulation method inspired by the behavior of Physarum polycephalum, an unicellular slime mold organism that efficiently forages for nutrients, astrophysicists are able to extrapolate from sparse datasets, such as galaxy maps archived in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and then use these extrapolations to inform analyses of a wide range of other data, such as spectroscopic observations captured by the Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers can interactively update the simulation by adjusting model parameters, and then investigate the resulting visual output to form hypotheses about the data. We describe details of Polyphorm's simulation model and its interaction and visualization modalities, and we evaluate Polyphorm through three scientific use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB Although risk assessments for pesticides involve quantifying exposure routes for animals, little empirical evidence exists on how individuals use areas where pesticides were used. Further, the European Food Safety Authority guidelines for the risk assessment of birds and mammals currently only include direct dietary uptake from exposed plants as important pathway for pesticides, arguing that dermal exposure is generally negligible. Here, we use the European hare (Lepus europaeus) as a model of a farmland specialist to investigate if (1) hares adjust habitat use in response to pesticide spraying, using GPS data, and (2) calculate the pesticide exposure and uptake over different pathways, i.e. foraging uptake versus overspray and subsequent oral grooming, using an agent-based modelling approach. Apart from avoidance of sprayed fields on the spraying day by inactive hares, which was likely caused by the mechanical disturbance rather than the pesticide itself, we found no evidence that hares reduced the use of pesticide-sprayed fields compared to control observations where no pesticides were applied. Our simulation showed that both the proportion of exposed individuals and the pesticide uptake were related to the pathway of exposure (foraging versus overspray/oral grooming), and depended on the age class and the vegetation type. We found that pesticide uptake via overspray/oral grooming might be 7-fold higher compared to foraging and might thus be an important pathway of pesticide exposure in hares. Our findings emphasize that policy makers, specifically the European Food Safety Authority, should incorporate alternative pathways of pesticide exposure for birds and mammals, such as overspray and oral grooming, when conducting environmental risk assessments and take variation in vegetation structure and age-related animal behavior into account, because these factors might affect pesticide exposure. Interactions between pesticide application and vegetation structure may both increase or decrease exposure but can be predicted using a simulation approach. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB One of the most commonly occurring neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD), encompasses the loss of cognitive and memory potential, impaired learning, dementia and behavioral defects, and has been prevalent since the 1900s. The accelerating occurrence of AD is expected to reach 65.7 million by 2030. The disease results in neural atrophy and disrupted inter-neuronal connections. Amongst multiple AD pathogenesis hypotheses, the amyloid beta (A beta) cascade is the most relevant and accepted form of the hypothesis, which suggests that A beta monomers are formed as a result of the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), followed by the conversion of these monomers to toxic oligomers, which in turn develop beta-sheets, fibrils and plaques. The review targets the events in the amyloid hypothesis and elaborates suitable therapeutic agents that function by hindering the steps of plaque formation and lowering A beta levels in the brain. The authors discuss treatment possibilities, including the inhibition of beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated enzymatic cleavage of APP, the immune response generating active immunotherapy and passive immunotherapeutic approaches targeting monoclonal antibodies towards A beta aggregates, the removal of amyloid aggregates by the activation of enzymatic pathways or the regulation of A beta circulation, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-mediated curbed accumulation and the neurotoxic potential of A beta aggregates, bapineuzumab-mediated vascular permeability alterations, statin-mediated A beta peptide degradation, the potential role of ibuprofen and the significance of natural drugs and dyes in hindering the amyloid cascade events. Thus, the authors aim to highlight the treatment perspective, targeting the amyloid hypothesis, while simultaneously emphasizing the need to conduct further investigations, in order to provide an opportunity to neurologists to develop novel and reliable treatment therapies for the retardation of AD progression.

DE PMIPv6; load balancing; heterogeneous networks; MIH; queuing delay;
   signaling cost
AB Mobile IP (MIP) requires mobile nodes (MNs) to register with the home agents (HAs) whenever the MNs change their point of attachment (PoA: access point (AP) or base station (BS)) in different subnets. Thus, such registrations cause excessive signaling overhead and long service delay. To solve this problem, proxy mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) has been proposed by the IETF NETLMM working group. In PMIPv6, a new entity called mobile access gateway (MAG) performs the mobility-related signaling with the local mobility anchor (LMA) on behalf of the MN and establishes a tunnel with the LMA. However, a number of MNs must be associated with an MAG, which means that the MAG can be easily overloaded. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a load balancing mechanism among the MAGs in the PMIPv6 network. The PMIPv6 handover signaling procedure is extended to support the proposed load balancing mechanism. We also discuss using IEEE 802.21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) protocol for load balancing to determine the load status at the candidate PoAs, in addition to the load status at the candidate MAGs. To evaluate the performance, we analyze the average waiting time in the queue at the MAG. Through simulations and numerical analysis, we show that the proposed load balancing mechanism can produce less queueing delay at the MAG and a higher data transmission rate at the PoA than when a load balancing operation is not performed in the PMIPv6 network.

AB A popular distinction in the human and animal learning literature is between deliberate (or willed) and habitual (or automatic) modes of control. Extensive evidence indicates that, after sufficient learning, living organisms develop behavioural habits that permit them saving computational resources. Furthermore, humans and other animals are able to transfer control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa), trading off efficiently flexibility and parsimony - an ability that is currently unparalleled by artificial control systems. Here, we discuss a computational implementation of habit formation, and the transfer of control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa) within Active Inference: a computational framework that merges aspects of cybernetic theory and of Bayesian inference. To model habit formation, we endow an Active Inference agent with a mechanism to "cache" (or memorize) policy probabilities from previous trials, and reuse them to skip - in part or in full - the inferential steps of deliberative processing. We exploit the fact that the relative quality of policies, conditioned upon hidden states, is constant over trials; provided that contingencies and prior preferences do not change. This means the only quantity that can change policy selection is the prior distribution over the initial state - where this prior is based upon the posterior beliefs from previous trials. Thus, an agent that caches the quality (or the probability) of policies can safely reuse cached values to save on cognitive and computational resources unless contingencies change. Our simulations illustrate the computational benefits, but also the limits, of three caching schemes under Active Inference. They suggest that key aspects of habitual behaviour - such as perseveration - can be explained in terms of caching policy probabilities. Furthermore, they suggest that there may be many kinds (or stages) of habitual behaviour, each associated with a different caching scheme; for example, caching associated or not associated with contextual estimation. These schemes are more or less impervious to contextual and contingency changes. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Plural distribution systems are often found in industrial markets.  Although transaction cost analysis has been successfully applied to understanding decisions about distribution systems, these plural forms have been virtually ignored in extant empirical work.  Critics suggest that extant transaction cost models are inadequate to study these systems.  We contend that transaction cost reasoning can be readily applied to understanding these systems, and undertake an analysis of a common plural form, namely, the simultaneous use of an independent rep system with a company-operated, ''house account'' system.  Familiar transaction cost problems like lock-in (the safeguarding problem), and difficulties in evaluating an independent rep's performance (the behavioral uncertainty problem) are posited to lead firms to deploying house accounts to augment an independent rep system.  Using data from a survey of independent agents, we provide preliminary evidence for these predictions.  We discuss the implications of our findings for theory and practice.

AB During Atrial Fibrillation (AF) more than 90% of the left atrial thrombi responsible for thromboembolic events originate in the left atrial appendage (LAA), a complex small sac protruding from the left atrium (LA). Current available treatments to prevent thromboembolic events are oral anticoagulation, surgical LAA exclusion, or percutaneous LAA occlusion. However, the mechanism behind thrombus formation in the LAA is poorly understood. The aim of this work is to analyse the hemodynamic behaviour in four typical LAA morphologies - "Chicken wing", "Cactus", "Windsock" and "Cauliflower" - to identify potential relationships between the different shapes and the risk of thrombotic events. Computerised tomography (CT) images from four patients with no LA pathology were segmented to derive the 3D anatomical shape of LAA and LA. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) analyses based on the patient-specific anatomies were carried out imposing both healthy and AF flow conditions. Velocity and shear strain rate (SSR) were analysed for all cases. Residence time in the different LAA regions was estimated with a virtual contrast agent washing out. CFD results indicate that both velocity and SSR decrease along the LAA, from the ostium to the tip, at each instant in the cardiac cycle, thus making the LAA tip more prone to fluid stagnation, and therefore to thrombus formation. Velocity and SSR also decrease from normal to AF conditions. After four cardiac cycles, the lowest washout of contrast agent was observed for the Cauliflower morphology (3.27% of residual contrast in AF), and the highest for the Windsock (0.56% of residual contrast in AF). This suggests that the former is expected to be associated with a higher risk of thrombosis, in agreement with clinical reports in the literature. The presented computational models highlight the major role played by the LAA morphology on the hemodynamics, both in normal and AF conditions, revealing the potential support that numerical analyses can provide in the stratification of patients under risk of thrombus formation, towards personalised patient care.

AB What is known and objective Hyperuricemia (HUA) and gout are considerable public health problems because of their increasing incidence and interactions with other diseases. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of urate-lowering therapies (ULTs) for patients.
   Methods A systematic literature review was conducted, and a network meta-analysis was performed on the included studies using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method and a Bayesian statistical framework. We calculated surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values and performed clustered ranking to combine the efficacy and safety results.
   Results Twenty-two randomized controlled studies were identified for the efficacy analysis, and 20 studies were identified for the safety analysis. Compared with the placebo, the ULTs were efficient and safe. Febuxostat 120 mg/d and allopurinol 200 mg/d had the highest SUCRA scores for efficacy and safety, respectively. Clustered ranking results showed that febuxostat 120 mg/d was the best in terms of efficacy and safety, topiroxostat 120/160 mg/d was similar to febuxostat 80 mg/d in terms of efficacy but safer, and allopurinol was not inferior to topiroxostat.
   What is new and conclusion Febuxostat had the best efficacy and safety results among the tested agents, and topiroxostat and allopurinol appeared to have fewer adverse events.

AB Mesoporous aluminas offer a wide variety of applications, including catalysis, gas sensing, optics, photovoltaics, and ion exchange. However, the pores are commonly unordered and show a wide pore size distribution, creating a need for porous aluminas with well defined, tailored pore systems. Here we report the synthesis and detailed structural studies of mesoporous alumina as thin films and as powders. The synthesis was based on evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA) of triblock copolymers Pluronic P-123 and Pluronic F-127 as structure directing agents. Structural studies of the thin films were done by grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) supported by numerical simulations, and X-ray reflectivity. From the quantitative GISAXS studies of the as-cast films, the unit cell dimensions, space groups and also certain details of the regular micellar shape could be retrieved, indicating that the micelles were deformed by compression along the sample normal. As-cast thin films prepared from F-127 were found to give 110-oriented body-centered cubic micellar structures, while films prepared from P-123 had hexagonally packed tubular micelles. Mesoporous powder materials with narrow pore size distribution and high surface area, as characterized by N-2 physisorption, were synthesized using the same strategy. The atomic-scale phase transformation of the powder from amorphous to crystalline takes place above 800 degrees C, as shown by in situ X-ray diffraction. Both the thin films and the powders were tailored to give mesoporous alumina with a pore size of about 5 nm.

AB Slow degradation of organic matter in acidic Sphagnum peat bogs suggests a limited activity of organotrophic microorganisms. Monitoring of the Sphagnum debris decomposition in a laboratory simulation experiment showed that this process was accompanied by a shift in the water color to brownish due to accumulation of humic substances and by the development of a specific bacterial community with a density of 2.4 x 10(7) cells ml(-1). About half of these organisms are metabolically active and detectable with rRNA-specific oligonucleotide probes. Molecular identification of the components of this microbial community showed the numerical dominance of bacteria affiliated with the phyla Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Planctomycetes. The population sizes of the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, which are believed to be the main agents of bacterially-mediated decomposition in eutrophic wetlands, were low. The numbers of planctomycetes increased at the final stage of Sphagnum decomposition. The representative isolates of the Alphaproteobacteria were able to utilize galacturonic acid, the only low-molecular-weight organic compound detected in the water samples; the representatives of the Planctomycetes were able to decompose some heteropolysaccharides, which points to the possible functional role of these groups of microorganisms in the community under study. Thus, the composition of the bacterial community responsible for Sphagnum decomposition in acidic and low-mineral oligotrophic conditions seems to be fundamentally different from that of the bacterial community which decomposes plant debris in eutrophic ecosystems at neutral pH.

AB Investigating the role of intrinsic cell heterogeneity emerging from variations in cell-cycle parameters and apoptosis is a crucial step toward better informing drug administration. Antimitotic agents, widely used in chemotherapy, target exclusively proliferative cells and commonly induce a prolonged mitotic arrest followed by cell death via apoptosis. In this paper, we developed a physiologically motivated mathematical framework for describing cancer cell growth dynamics that incorporates the intrinsic heterogeneity in the time individual cells spend in the cell-cycle and apoptosis process. More precisely, our model comprises two age-structured partial differential equations for the proliferative and apoptotic cell compartments and one ordinary differential equation for the quiescent compartment. To reflect the intrinsic cell heterogeneity that governs the growth dynamics, proliferative and apoptotic cells are structured in age, i.e., the amount of time remaining to be spent in each respective compartment. In our model, we considered an antimitotic drug whose effect on the cellular dynamics is to induce mitotic arrest, extending the average cell-cycle length. The prolonged mitotic arrest induced by the drug can trigger apoptosis if the time a cell will spend in the cell cycle is greater than the mitotic arrest threshold. We studied the drugs effect on the long-term cancer cell growth dynamics using different durations of prolonged mitotic arrest induced by the drug. Our numerical simulations suggest that at confluence and in the absence of the drug, quiescence is the long-term asymptotic behavior emerging from the cancer cell growth dynamics. This pattern is maintained in the presence of small increases in the average cell-cycle length. However, intermediate increases in cell-cycle length markedly decrease the total number of cells and can drive the cancer population to extinction. Intriguingly, a large switch-on/switch-off increase in the average cell-cycle length maintains an active cell population in the long term, with oscillating numbers of proliferative cells and a relatively constant quiescent cell number.

AB The author describes a refiguration of medical thought that originates from nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory. The coupling of computer science and these new theoretical bases coming from complex systems mathematics allows the creation of "intelligent" agents capable of adapting themselves dynamically to problems of high complexity: the artificial neural networks (ANNs).
   ANNs are able to reproduce the dynamic interaction of multiple factors simultaneously, allowing the study of complexity; they can also draw conclusions on an individual basis and not as average trends. These tools can allow a more efficient technology transfer from the science of medicine to the real world, overcoming many obstacles responsible for the present translational failure. They also contribute to a new holistic vision of the human subject person, contrasting the statistical reductionism that tends to squeeze or even delete the single subject, sacrificing him to his group of belongingness. A remarkable contribution to this individual approach comes from fuzzy logic, according to which there are no sharp limits between opposite things, such as wealth and disease. This approach allows one to partially escape from the probability theory trap in situations where it is fundamental to express a judgement based on a single case and favor a novel humanism directed to the management of the patient as an individual subject person.

AB The organocatalytic controlled/living ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of (3-cyanopropyl)pentamethylcyclotrisiloxane (CNPD2) using water or a silanol as the initiator, 1,3-trimethylene-2-methylguanidine (TMMG) as the catalyst, and organochlorosilanes as the end-capping agents produced linear polysiloxanes with a controlled number-average molecular weight (M-n), narrow molecular-weight dispersity (D-M), the desired terminal structures, and good distribution of the 3-cyanopropyl side-chains. CNPD2 was obtained from the reaction of 1,3-dihydroxy-1,1,3,3-tetramethyldisiloxane with diacetoxy(3-cyanopropyl)methylsilane. The composition and monomeric sequence of the resulting side-chain-functionalized polysiloxanes were conveniently controlled by using either polymerization of CNPD2 or copolymerization of CNPD2 and another cyclotrisiloxanes and by varying the initial feed ratio of the two monomers and the monomer addition timing, i.e., using either premix or two-stage methods in the copolymerizations. An analysis of the monomeric sequences using Si-29{H-1} NMR measurements revealed that the polymerizations proceeded almost completely in the statistical propagation mode. Plausible monomeric sequences and chain-length distributions of the resulting side-chain-functionalized polysiloxanes were visualized using two simulation methods. The solubility and thermal properties of the resulting polysiloxanes with cyanopropyl group side chains were investigated. Importantly, the poly[dimethylsiloxane-co-3-cyanopropyl(methyl)siloxane] (p(DMS-co-CNPMS)) segments behave independently in the copolymer synthesized from hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane and CNPD2 using the two-stage method.

AB Background: With improved childhood cancer cure rate, long term sequelae are becoming an important factor of quality of life. Signs of cardiovascular disease are frequently found in long term survivors of cancer. Cardiac damage may be related to irradiation and chemotherapy.
   We have evaluated simultaneous influence of a series of independent variables on the late cardiac damage in childhood cancer survivors in Slovenia and identified groups at the highest risk.
   Methods: 211 long-term survivors of different childhood cancers, at least five years after treatment were included in the study. The evaluation included history, physical examination, electrocardiograpy, exercise testing and echocardiograpy. For analysis of risk factors, beside univariate analysis, multivariate classification tree analysis statistical method was used.
   Results and Conclusion: Patients treated latest, from 1989-98 are at highest risk for any injury to the heart (73%). Among those treated earlier are at the highest risk those with Hodgkin's disease treated with irradiation above 30 Gy and those treated for sarcoma. Among specific forms of injury, patients treated with radiation to the heart area are at highest risk of injury to the valves. Patients treated with large doses of anthracyclines or concomitantly with anthracyclines and alkylating agents are at highest risk of systolic function defect and enlarged heart chambers. Those treated with anthracyclines are at highest risk of diastolic function defect. The time period of the patient's treatment is emerged as an important risk factor for injury of the heart.

AB The unresponsiveness of metastatic melanoma to conventional chemotherapeutic and biological agents is largely due to the development of resistance to apoptosis. Pyrimethamine belongs to the group of antifolate drugs, and in addition to antiprotozoan effects, it exerts a strong proapoptotic activity, which we recently characterized in human T lymphocytes. However, no data regarding pyrimethamine anticancer activity are available thus far. To this end, we examined the in vitro effects of pyrimethamine on apoptosis, cell cycle distribution, and cell proliferation of human metastatic melanoma cell lines. The in vivo antitumor potential of pyrimethamine was evaluated in a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse xenotransplantation model. Our data indicate that pyrimethamine, when used at a clinically relevant concentration, induced apoptosis in metastatic melanoma cells via the activation of the cathepsin B and the caspase cascade (i.e., caspase-8 and caspase-9) and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization. This occurred independently from CD95/Fas engagement. Moreover, pyrimethamine induced a marked inhibition of cell growth and an S-phase cell cycle arrest. Results obtained in SCID mice, injected s.c. with metastatic melanoma cells and treated with pyrimethamine, indicated a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth. In conclusion, our results suggest that pyrimethamine-induced apoptosis may be considered as a multifaceted process, in which different inducers or regulators of apoptosis are simultaneously implicated, thus permitting death defects of melanoma cells to be bypassed or overcome. On these bases, we hypothesize that pyrimethamine could represent an interesting candidate for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

AB The study concerns the reuse of pyroclastic products generated by volcano Etna eruptions for the production of lightweight insulating mortar. Fourteen mixtures, grouped into three families, with three types of natural binder were designed. The first family (CEM) contains Portland cement and calcium hydroxide, the second Natural Hydraulic Lime (NHL), the third (POZZ) combines pozzolanic sand and calcium hydroxide, to form a cementitious compound. The effect of the presence of an Air Entraining Agent (AEA), added in three different ratio with respect to the dry mixture (0.02%, 0.05% 0.1%) to increase the porosity, was investigated. In the mixtures containing the 0.1% of AEA, a breathable resin in the ratio 0.1% of the binder was added, to compensate for the degradation of the mechanical strength due to the AEA. On the basis of the mechanical and physical properties of the composites (flexural and compressive strength, density, porosity, water absorption) and of the thermal conductivity, always within the range of 0.154-0.266 W/mK, the mixtures suitable for lightweight and thermal mortar are identified. The correlation between density and porosity and between thermal conductivity and pososity is discussed. A numerical simulation, based on a numerical homogenization technique at the mesoscale, is used to show how the thermal properties of the constituents of the mixture influence the equivalent thermal conductivity of the composite.

AB Mammalian cells are constantly exposed to a wide variety of genotoxic agents from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Genetic variability in DNA repair may contribute to human cancer risk. In this population-based case-control study in China, we tested the hypothesis that a C to T variant (Thr241Met) of DNA repair gene XRCC3 (X-ray repair cross-complementing group 3) is associated with risk of developing gastric cancer. We genotyped for this variant using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (PCR-RFLP) in 188 histologically confirmed gastric cancer patients and 166 frequency-matched cancer-free controls. The XRCC3 genotype and allele frequencies were not significantly different between cases and controls (P = 0.99 for genotype; P = 0.76 for allele). The XRCC3 24 1 Met allele frequency (4.8%) was significantly lower in healthy Chinese controls than previously reported healthy US Caucasian controls (38.9%). Compared with the XRCC3 241Thr/Thr genotype, the variant XRCC3241Thr/Met and Met/Met genotypes were not associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio (ORa), 1.06; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-2.16). These findings suggest that polymorphisms of XRCC3 Thr241Met may not play a role in the etiology of gastric cancer. Further studies with a larger number of subjects and simultaneous measurement of different polymorphisms in DNA repair genes in the same pathway are needed to confirm these findings.

AB Effects of plant-host type, either wheat, Triticum aestivum L., or oat, Avena sativa L., and the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, on numerical and spatial distributions of Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia Kurdyumov, populations were investigated. Untreated adult aphids or aphids inoculated with conidial suspensions of the pathogen were released onto the center seedlings of an 81-seedling grid in a cage. After 17 d, the numbers of live adults, live nymphs, and sporulating cadavers were recorded for each plant, along with plant height and dry weight. Aphid populations were consistently lower on oat than on wheat, and lower in B, bassiana treatments. Spatial statistics (geostatistics) were used to compare patterns of aphid distribution on plants. On wheat without the pathogen present, adult aphid populations were highest in approximately concentric rings near the outermost plants in grids. Addition of B, bassiana to the system reduced the amount of variation caused by spatial orientation, thereby changing the spatial distribution of aphid populations. On oat, aphid populations generally were highest near the center of the grid, but addition of the pathogen changed the spatial structure of the aphid population. Results suggest that aphid movement behavior, which is intimately linked to host-plant quality, is an important determinant of epizootic proliferation. Elucidation of these relationships may eventually lead to a synergistic use of microbial control agents and host-plant resistance in pest management strategies.

AB The effect of the combination of a new anticonvulsant drug HEPP and carbamazepine (CBZ) on the pharmacokinetics of HEPP and CBZ was investigated using rabbits as an animal model. The study was performed in 18 male New Zealand white rabbits which were randomly divided into three groups, according to a balanced incomplete block design of three treatments and two periods. Plasma concentrations for HEPP and CBZ were assayed using HPLC methods. The results showed that the pharmacokinetic parameters C-max AUC and t(1/2) were not statistically different when HEPP was administered alone and with CBZ, (AUC(0-alpha), 82.86 +/- 19.40 vs 83.24 +/- 12.56 mug h ml(-1); t(1/2beta) 3.40 +/- 0.29 vs 3.36 +/- 0.45 h; C, 18.93 +/- 2.99 vs 19.79 +/- 2.68 mug ml-1 and T-max 1.27 +/- 0.16 vs 1.22 +/- 0.11 h for HEPP alone and HEPP plus CBZ respectively. Evaluation of the pharmacokinetic parameters of CBZ showed, AUC(0-inf) 61.5 +/- 21.7 vs 67.4 +/- 23.8 mug h ml(-1); t(1/2) 4.60 +/- 1.54 vs 4.41 +/- 1.35 h; C-max 8.45 +/- 3.83 vs 8.70 +/- 2.59 mug ml when the drug was administered alone and CBZ plus HEPP, respectively. Our data indicate that there is no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either HEPP or CBZ, when they are administered simultaneously. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Objective: To compare response rates among patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) treated with either moclobemide, an antidepressant thought to simultaneously enhance both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
   Methods: Using a random-effects model, we combined 12 trials involving 1207 outpatients with MDD.
   Results: Patients treated with moclobemide were as likely to experience clinical response as those treated with SSRIs (risk ratio 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.26; P = 0.314). Simply pooling response rates for the 2 agents resulted in a 62.1% response rate for moclobemide and a 57.5% response rate for the SSRIs. A metaregression did not reveal a statistically significant relation between the mean moclobemide dosage for each study and the risk ratio for response rates. Further, we found no difference between the 2 treatments in overall discontinuation rates, discontinuation rates due to adverse events, or discontinuation rates due to lack of efficacy. Also, rates of fatigue or somnolence and of insomnia were similar between the 2 treatment groups. However, SSRI treatment was associated with higher rates of nausea, headaches, and treatment-emergent anxiety than was treatment with moclobemide.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that moclobemide and the SSRIs do differ with respect to their side effect profiles but not in their overall efficacy in the treatment of MDD.

AB Fire-prone landscapes present many challenges for both managers and policy makers in developing adaptive behaviors and institutions. We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.

AB The effect of herbivory on plant performance is the subject of a large number of ecological studies, and plant responses to herbivory range from reduced reproduction to overcompensation. Because plant defenses, stored resources, and allocation demands change throughout a plant's lifetime, it can be hypothesized the effects of herbivory also vary with development. The present work extends previous analyses to incorporate hundreds of studies in a new meta-analysis addressing this topic. Herbivores had an overall negative effect on plant growth and reproduction, and, in contrast to a previous meta-analysis, this work shows the timing of herbivory is relevant. Differences in the effects of herbivory between life stages existed for woody plant reproduction and perennial herb growth. In addition, tree and shrub growth was reduced by herbivore damage at early ontogenetic stages, and perennial herb reproduction was limited by adult stage herbivory. These results partially support the continuum of an ontogenetic response model. Finally, consideration of this synthesis in conjunction with other work led to the conclusion that different plant groups optimize their defense investments in unique ways. Slow-growing plants may strongly chemically defend young tissues, supporting the plant-age hypothesis, because early herbivory is detrimental to growth. Faster-growing herbs may invest more in antiherbivore defense when they are older, supporting the growth-differentiation balance hypothesis, because later herbivory limits their reproduction.

AB Linear, quadratic, and artificial neural network (ANN)based metamodels were developed for predicting the extent of anthrax spore inactivation by chlorine dioxide in a ventilated three-dimensional space over time from computational fluid dynamics model (CFD) simulation data. Dimensionless groups were developed to define the design space of the problem scenario. The Hammersley sequence sampling (HSS) method was used to determine the sampling points for the numerical experiments within the design space. A CFD model, comprised of multiple submodels, was applied to conduct the numerical experiments. Large eddy simulation (LES) with the Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model was applied to compute the airflow. Anthrax spores were modeled as a dispersed solid phase using the Lagrangian treatment. The disinfectant transport was calculated by solving a mass transport equation. Kinetic decay constants were included for spontaneous decay of the disinfectant and for the reaction of the disinfectant with the surfaces of the three-dimensional space. To enhance the mixing of the disinfectant with the room air, a momentum source was included in the simulation. An inactivation rate equation accounted for the reaction between the spores and the disinfectant. The ANN-based metamodels were most successful in predicting the number of viable bioaerosols remaining in an arbitrary enclosed space. Sensitivity analysis showed that the mass fraction of the disinfectant, inactivation rate constant, and contact time had the most influence on the inactivation of the spores.

AB Extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases involved in physiological and pathological processes, through the cleavage of extracellular matrix. MMPs are capable of degrading essentially all matrix components, which is crucial for malignant tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. The vertebrates MMP family includes at least 26 enzymes (23 have been known in humans) with only MMP-1, 2, and 7 experimentally validated as targets for antitumoral drug design. However, inhibition of MMP-1 has been hypothesized to be the cause of the clinically observed musculoskeletal syndrome when broad spectrum inhibitors are used. On the other hand, MMP-9 is a tricky enzyme, since its inhibition might be useful in treating patients with early-stage cancers, but MMP-9 is an anti-target in patients with advanced disease. So, MMP-9 inhibition should also be prevented. Therefore, selective MMP-2 inhibition arises as a pursued profile for MMP binders. Among them, hydroxamates have been extensively studied as small molecule drug candidates characterized by an effective zinc-binding group plus additional side chains responsible for the selectivity. This article pays particular attention to MMP-2 selectivity on hydroxamate-type inhibitors, especially against MMP-9, and their chemical structure, SAR, general synthetic methods, and molecular modelling studies are here reviewed in order to inspire further design of new effective anticancer agents.

AB Objectives:
   This study evaluated colour stability, surface roughness and flexural strength of microwave-polymerised acrylic resin after overnight immersion in sodium hypochlorite, simulating 180 days use.
   Materials and methods:
   Forty disc-shaped (15 mm x 4 mm) and 40 rectangular specimens (65 mm x 10 mm x 3 mm) were prepared from microwave-polymerised acrylic resin. The specimens were immersed in 0.5, 1% sodium hypochlorite, Clorox/Calgon and distilled water. Colour measurements (Delta E) were determined by a portable colorimeter. A surface analyser was used to measure roughness (mu m). The flexural strength (MPa) was measured using a three-point bending test in a universal testing machine. Data were evaluated by one-way anova, followed by Student-Newman-Keuls test (alpha = 0.05).
   Results:
   Statistical analysis found significantly higher colour changes (SNK, p < 0.001) for the 1% sodium hypochlorite, but mean Delta E value quantified by National Bureau of Standards was classified as slight. When comparing the surface roughness, no statistical significance was found among the solutions (anova, p = 0.637). The 1% sodium hypochlorite presented significantly lower flexural strength compared with the control group (SNK, p = 0.034).
   Conclusion:
   It was concluded that immersion in 1% sodium hypochlorite solutions for 8 h does influence the colour stability and flexural strength of microwave-polymerised acrylic resin, during the simulated period of 180 days.

DE Dual-energy CT; non-linear blending; solitary pulmonary nodule
AB Objective
   To investigate the feasibility and to optimize the parameters of nonlinear blending technique in dual-energy CT on solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN).
   Methods
   The simulated enhanced SPN were used the mixture of nonionic iodinated contrast agent (Iopromide 370mgI/100 ml) and normal saline and then randomly placed inside an anthropomorphic chest phantom. The phantom was examined on SOMATOM definition flash with dual mode (80/140 kV) and single energy mode (120 kV) (the same CTDIvol). Nonlinear blending images and linear blending images with a weighting factor of 0.3 were generated and the image qualities were analyzed.
   Results
   For different simulated density SPN, when 0 HU was chosen as the Blending Center (BC) and 0 to 30 HU were chosen as the Blending width (BW), the nonlinear blending images yielded a higher contrast-to-noise (CNR). There were significant differences in the image noise and signal-to-noise (SNR) of different simulated density SPN at non-linear blending images, linear blending images and 120 kV images (p < .05); But the differences of CNR between the three groups were not statistically significant (p > .05). The SNR of different simulated density SPN at non-linear blending images was significantly increased compared with it at linear blending images and 120 kV images (p < .05); And the image noise at non-linear blending was lower than it at linear blending images (p < .05).
   Conclusion
   Nonlinear blending technique in dual-energy CT can increase the SNR of enhanced SPN, and it is helpful in diagnosis of SPN.

AB Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of potato stem rot, is prevalent and poorly managed on potatoes in the Columbia Basin of Washington. Because of the ubiquitous nature of the fungus and high crop diversity within the Columbia Basin, understanding the population structure and the potential for outcrossing of the pathogen would be helpful in developing disease management strategies. The Population structure of S. sclerotiorum in the Columbia Basin from potato was examined using microsatellite markers and mycelial compatibility. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that 92% of the variability among 167 isolates was found within subpopulations, with limited, yet statistically significant impact of the collection date, but not the year or location of collection. Linkage disequilibrium and index of association analyses noted a potential for outcrossing in two locations, which was substantiated by the discovery of recombinant ascospores in three field-generated apothecia from the 12 apothecia examined. Microsatellite haplotypes were not correlated with mycelial compatibility groups. This high haplotypic diversity did not seem to impact pathologically important phenotypes. Greenhouse inoculations of potato plants exhibited no significant differences in aggressiveness on potato sterns. Moreover, in vitro studies of response to fungicides and temperature stimuli yielded no significant differences among studied isolates. These findings illustrate the potential for outcrossing in warm temperate regions of North America, where a diversity of crops are planted simultaneously and in neighboring fields. This study also indicates that the unsatisfactory management of potato stein rot is likely not directly attributable to genetic factors, but to gaps in agricultural practices.

AB Cyano(2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl)acetic acid derivatives were synthesized and tested as a novel class of aldose reductase (ALR2) inhibitors. Each compound was evaluated as a diastereomeric mixture, due to tautomeric equilibria in solution. The parent compound 39 exhibited a good inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.85 muM, similar to that of the well-known ARI sorbinil (IC50 0.50 muM). The concurrent introduction of a halogen and a lipophilic group in the 5- and in the 1-positions, respectively, of the indole nucleus of 39, gave compound 55, cyano[5-fluoro-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydroindol-3-yl] acetic acid, which displayed the highest activity (IC50 0.075 muM, very close to that of tolrestat IC50 0.046 muM), with a good selectivity toward ALR2 compared with aldehyde reductase (ALR1) (16.4-fold), and no appreciable inhibitory properties against sorbitol dehydrogenase (SD), or glutathione reductase (GR). The isopropyl ester 59, a prodrug of 55, was found to be almost as effective as tolrestat in preventing cataract development in severely galactosemic rats when administered as an eye drop solution. Docking simulation of 55 into a three-dimensional model of human ALR2 made it possible to formulate the hypothesis that the 2-hydroxy tautomer was the active species binding into the catalytic site of the enzyme. This was fully consistent with the structure-activity relationships within this series of cyanooxoindolylacetic acid derivatives.

AB We present a guidance by repulsion model based on a driver-evader interaction where the driver, assumed to be faster than the evader, follows the evader but cannot be arbitrarily close to it, and the evader tries to move away from the driver beyond a short distance. The key ingredient allowing the driver to guide the evader is that the driver is able to display a circumvention maneuver around the evader, in such a way that the trajectory of the evader is modified in the direction of the repulsion that the driver exerts on the evader. The evader can thus be driven towards any given target or along a sufficiently smooth path by controlling a single discrete parameter acting on driver's behavior. The control parameter serves both to activate/deactivate the circumvention mode and to select the clockwise/counterclockwise direction of the circumvention maneuver. Assuming that the circumvention mode is more expensive than the pursuit mode, and that the activation of the circumvention mode has a high cost, we formulate an optimal control problem for the optimal strategy to drive the evader to a given target. By means of numerical shooting methods, we find the optimal open-loop control which reduces the number of activations of the circumvention mode to one and which minimizes the time spent in the active mode. Our numerical simulations show that the system is highly sensitive to small variations of the control function, and that the cost function has a nonlinear regime which contributes to the complexity of the behavior of the system, so that a general open-loop control would not be of practical interest. We then propose a feedback control law that corrects from deviations while preventing from an excessive use of the circumvention mode, finding numerically that the feedback law significantly reduces the cost obtained with the open-loop control.

Coord. 4, 1 (2008), arXiv:0801.2980; G. Zaklan, F. W. S. Lima and F. Westerhoff, Physica A 387, 5857 (2008)], near the critical temperature of the Ising model presenting a well-defined phase transition; but on normal and modified Apollonian networks (ANs), [J. S. Andrade, Jr., H. J. Herrmann, R. F. S. Andrade, and L. R. da Silva, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 018702 (2005); R. F. S. Andrade, J. S. Andrade Jr. and H. J. Herrmann, Phys. Rev. E 79, 036105 (2009)] studied the equilibrium Ising model. They showed the equilibrium Ising model not to present on ANs a phase transition of the type for the 2D Ising model. Here, using agent-based Monte Carlo simulations, we study the Zaklan model with the well-known majority-vote model (MVM) with noise and apply it to tax evasion on ANs, to show that differently from the Ising model the MVM on ANs presents a well-defined phase transition. To control the tax evasion in the economics model proposed by Zaklan et al., MVM is applied in the neighborhood of the critical noise q(c) to the Zaklan model. Here we show that the Zaklan model is robust because this can also be studied, besides using equilibrium dynamics of Ising model, through the nonequilibrium MVM and on various topologies giving the same behavior regardless of dynamic or topology used here.

AB Decision-makers have been shown to rely on probabilistic models for perception and action. However, these models can be incorrect or partially wrong in which case the decision-maker has to cope with model uncertainty. Model uncertainty has recently also been shown to be an important determinant of sensorimotor behaviour in humans that can lead to risk-sensitive deviations from Bayes optimal behaviour towards worst-case or best-case outcomes. Here, we investigate the effect of model uncertainty on cooperation in sensorimotor interactions similar to the stag-hunt game, where players develop models about the other player and decide between a pay-off-dominant cooperative solution and a risk-dominant, non-cooperative solution. In simulations, we show that players who allow for optimistic deviations from their opponent model are much more likely to converge to cooperative outcomes. We also implemented this agent model in a virtual reality environment, and let human subjects play against a virtual player. In this game, subjects' pay-offs were experienced as forces opposing their movements. During the experiment, we manipulated the risk sensitivity of the computer player and observed human responses. We found not only that humans adaptively changed their level of cooperation depending on the risk sensitivity of the computer player but also that their initial play exhibited characteristic risk-sensitive biases. Our results suggest that model uncertainty is an important determinant of cooperation in two-player sensorimotor interactions.

AB In an attempt to investigate and reproduce the fluctuation dynamics of price changes in financial markets, a novel complex random interacting financial price model is developed by combining voter interacting system with compound Poisson process. In this model, the dissemination of investors' investment attitudes can simulate normal and frequent small price fluctuations of financial markets, while the random drastic jumps can capture undue and rare large price fluctuations as results of sudden economic events and political events in the markets. In order to verify the rationality of the model, some statistical characteristics of the model returns including fat-tail, power-law scaling, complexity and multifractal are compared with real returns by probability density functions, composite distance fuzzy entropy (C-FuzzyEn), matching energy and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis. The C-FuzzyEn is a new entropy-based approach, based on fuzzy entropy and complexity-invariant, to measure the complexity behaviors of return series. The effectiveness analysis of C-FuzzyEn indicates that it has a higher estimation accuracy and stronger robustness than fuzzy entropy. The empirical results show that the price model is able to reproduce some important statistical properties of financial markets to a certain extent, and the complexity of returns for the proposed model increases when infection intensity or jump intensity increases.

AB Motivation: Colocalization of structures in biomedical images can lead to insights into biological behaviors. One class of colocalization problems is examining an annular structure (disk-shaped such as a cell, vesicle or molecule) interacting with a network structure (vascular, neuronal, cytoskeletal, organellar). Examining colocalization events across conditions is often complicated by changes in density of both structure types, confounding traditional statistical approaches since colocalization cannot be normalized to the density of both structure types simultaneously. We have developed a technique to measure colocalization independent of structure density and applied it to characterizing intercellular colocation with blood vessel networks. This technique could be used to analyze colocalization of any annular structure with an arbitrarily shaped network structure.
   Results: We present the circular colocalization affinity with network structures test (CIRCOAST), a novel statistical hypothesis test to probe for enriched network colocalization in 2D z-projected multichannel images by using agent-based Monte Carlo modeling and image processing to generate the pseudo-null distribution of random cell placement unique to each image. This hypothesis test was validated by confirming that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exhibit enriched colocalization with endothelial cells forming arborized networks in culture and then applied to show that locally delivered ASCs have enriched colocalization with murine retinal microvasculature in a model of diabetic retinopathy. We demonstrate that the CIRCOAST test provides superior power and type I error rates in characterizing intercellular colocalization compared to generic approaches that are confounded by changes in cell or vessel density.

AB Context. Thermal instability is one of the dynamical agents for turbulence in the diffuse interstellar medium, where both turbulence and thermal instability interact in a highly non-linear manner.
   Aims. We study basic properties of turbulence in thermally bistable gas for variable simulation parameters. The resulting cold gas fractions can be applied as parameterisation in simulations on galactic scales.
   Methods. Turbulent flow is induced on large scales by means of compressive stochastic forcing in a periodic box. The compressible Euler equations with constant UV heating and a parameterised cooling function are solved on uniform grids. We investigate several values of the mean density of the gas and different magnitudes of the forcing. For comparison with other numerical studies, solenoidal forcing is applied as well.
   Results. After a transient phase, we observe that a state of statistically stationary turbulence is approached. Compressive forcing generally produces a two-phase medium, with a decreasing fraction of cold gas for increasing forcing strength. This behaviour can be explained on the basis of turbulent mixing. We also find power-law tails of probability density functions of the gas density in high-resolution runs. Solenoidal forcing, on the other hand, appears to prevent the evolution into a two-phase-medium for certain parameter regions.
   Conclusions. The dynamics of thermally bistable turbulence show a substantial sensitivity to the initial state and the forcing properties.

TI Bayesian designs of phase II oncology trials to select maximum effective
   dose assuming monotonic dose-response relationship

AB Background: For many molecularly targeted agents, the probability of response may be assumed to either increase or increase and then plateau in the tested dose range. Therefore, identifying the maximum effective dose, defined as the lowest dose that achieves a pre-specified target response and beyond which improvement in the response is unlikely, becomes increasingly important. Recently, a class of Bayesian designs for single-arm phase II clinical trials based on hypothesis tests and nonlocal alternative prior densities has been proposed and shown to outperform common Bayesian designs based on posterior credible intervals and common frequentist designs. We extend this and related approaches to the design of phase II oncology trials, with the goal of identifying the maximum effective dose among a small number of pre-specified doses.
   Methods: We propose two new Bayesian designs with continuous monitoring of response rates across doses to identify the maximum effective dose, assuming monotonicity of the response rate across doses. The first design is based on Bayesian hypothesis tests. To determine whether each dose level achieves a pre-specified target response rate and whether the response rates between doses are equal, multiple statistical hypotheses are defined using nonlocal alternative prior densities. The second design is based on Bayesian model averaging and also uses nonlocal alternative priors. We conduct simulation studies to evaluate the operating characteristics of the proposed designs, and compare them with three alternative designs.
   Results: In terms of the likelihood of drawing a correct conclusion using similar between-design average sample sizes, the performance of our proposed design based on Bayesian hypothesis tests and nonlocal alternative priors is more robust than that of the other designs. Specifically, the proposed Bayesian hypothesis test-based design has the largest probability of being the best design among all designs under comparison and the smallest probability of being an inadequate design, under sensible definitions of the best design and an inadequate design, respectively.
   Conclusions: The use of Bayesian hypothesis tests and nonlocal alternative priors under ordering constraints between dose groups results in a robust performance of the design, which is thus superior to other common designs.

AB In a 2x2 crossover trial for establishing average bioequivalence (ABE) of a generic agent and a currently marketed drug, the recommended approach to hypothesis testing is the two one-sided test (TOST) procedure, which depends, among other things, on the estimated within-subject variability. The power of this procedure, and therefore the sample size required to achieve a minimum power, depends on having a good estimate of this variability. When there is uncertainty, it is advisable to plan the design in two stages, with an interim sample size reestimation after the first stage, using an interim estimate of the within-subject variability. One method and 3 variations of doing this were proposed by Potvin et al. Using simulation, the operating characteristics, including the empirical type I error rate, of the 4 variations (called Methods A, B, C, and D) were assessed by Potvin et al and Methods B and C were recommended. However, none of these 4 variations formally controls the type I error rate of falsely claiming ABE, even though the amount of inflation produced by Method C was considered acceptable. A major disadvantage of assessing type I error rate inflation using simulation is that unless all possible scenarios for the intended design and analysis are investigated, it is impossible to be sure that the type I error rate is controlled. Here, we propose an alternative, principled method of sample size reestimation that is guaranteed to control the type I error rate at any given significance level. This method uses a new version of the inverse-normal combination of p-values test, in conjunction with standard group sequential techniques, that is more robust to large deviations in initial assumptions regarding the variability of the pharmacokinetic endpoints. The sample size reestimation step is based on significance levels and power requirements that are conditional on the first-stage results. This necessitates a discussion and exploitation of the peculiar properties of the power curve of the TOST testing procedure. We illustrate our approach with an example based on a real ABE study and compare the operating characteristics of our proposed method with those of Method B of Povin et al.

AB Synthesis, structure elucidation and anticancer activities of novel fused 1,2,4-triazine aryl derivatives containing the ethoxycarbonyl (6-10) and carbohydrazide formations (11-15) are presented. Molecular structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, EI-MS spectra and elemental analyses. Antitumour activities in vitro for heterobicyclic hydrazides of the type 11-14 were evaluated by BrdU method for human LS180, SiHa and T47D carcinoma cells. Amongst them, hydrazide 14 has exhibited remarkable inhibitory effect against SiHa and LS 180 tumour cells, and simultaneously was found to be non-toxic towards the human normal cell line -HSF cells. Furthermore, the pulse field gel electrophoresis experiment was performed for characterizing DNA-cleaving activity of heterobicycle 14. The DNA fragments of 2500, 2000 and 500 kilobase pairs (kbp) were commonly detected in the cancer cell lines (SiHa, LS180 and T47D) treated with compound 14. DNA fragmentation pattern, since three types of fragments induced by the tested hydrazide of the type 14 were detected, suggesting a way of interaction with DNA. It is worth pointing out, that DNA strand breaks were also produced in human breast cancer (T47D) cells, a cell line where the induction of DNA fragmentation is very difficult. Moreover, the statistically significant apoptotic activity in T47D human breast cancer cells for the tested heterobicycle 14 was proved using the annexin V-binding assay. The antiproliferative properties in vitro for compounds 6-14 were evaluated by MTT method for human leukaemic Jurkat cells. Significant viability decreases in Jurkat cells treated with different concentrations of compounds 10 and 11 were observed, suggesting that these derivatives have antiproliferative activities. Their acute toxicifies were established. For these compounds the influence on the central nervous system of mice in behavioural tests was examined. Molecular structure for free base of the intermediate 4 was confirmed by H-1-H-1 COSY, HMBC and HMQC correlations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Aim and Objective: Vinca domain of tubulin protein is the potential target for different microtubule targeting drugs (MTD). However, its binding mechanism and structure-activity-relationship (SAR) is not well understood in terms of ligand-receptor interactions and structure functionality requirements. This limits the exploitation of vinca domain for developing novel clinical leads. Herein, as a progressive step towards the exploration of this target, we rendered the in-silico insight through the development of a robust pharmacophore model followed by the QSAR, Molecular Docking and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Furthermore, the study was undertaken to identify potent inhibitors that can inhibit vinca domain of tubulin.
   Materials and Methods: Utilizing the well-defined tubulin polymerization inhibition activities, common pharmacophore hypotheses were constructed and scored for their rankings. The hypotheses were validated by 3D-Atom based QSAR and tested for various statistically relevant metrices. Thereafter, virtual screening was performed with ZINC natural product database and the screened hits were evaluated for structure-based studies via molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations.
   Results: The predictive 3D-QSAR based pharmacophore model consists of two hydrogen bond acceptors (A), two hydrogen bond donors (D) and one hydrophobic (H) group. Significance of the model was reflected from the statistical parameters viz. r(2) = 0.98, q(2) = 0.72, F = 562.9, RMSE = 0.11 and Pearson-R = 0.87. Further, the docking scores of the retrieved hits deciphered that the ligands were adequately bound in the pocket. Moreover, RMSD fluctuations of protein (1.0 to 1.75A) and ligand (0.3 to 2.3 A) in molecular dynamics simulations insinuate towards the conformational and interactions stability of the complexes.
   Conclusion: The quantitative pharmacophore model was developed from range of natural product scaffolds in order to incorporate all the complimentary features accountable for inhibition. The obtained hits were found to occupy similar binding region and superimpose well over the reference ligand. Therefore, it can be concluded that hierarchical combination of methods exploited in this study can steer the identification of novel scaffolds. Moreover, the rendered hit molecules could serve as potential inhibitory leads for the development of improved inhibitors targeting Vinca domain.

AB Objectives: Recently, a new generation of simplified one-bottle dentin bonding systems, sensitive to variations in the degree of substrate moisture, was introduced. This in vitro project compared the dentin bond strengths and interfacial ultra-morphology formed by three one-bottle bonding systems [OptiBond SOLO (ethanol-based), Prime&Bond 2.1 (acetone-based), and Single Bond (ethanol- and water-based)]. The null hypothesis tested was that re-wetting a dried dentin surface with a HEMA aqueous solution would not result in bond strengths, and resin impregnation into demineralized dentin, comparable to those obtained for moist dentin.
   Methods: Dentin specimens were assigned to the following three etched surface conditions: moist dentin-control group; dentin dried for 5 s; and dentin dried for 5 s and re-moistened with a commercial 35% HEMA aqueous solution. Mean shear bond strengths were calculated and analyzed with one- and two-way ANOVA. Dentin discs treated with the same combination of surface condition/adhesive were processed and observed under both transmission and scanning electron microscopes.
   Results: For moist dentin. the morphology of the resin-dentin interfaces showed penetration of the dentin adhesives to the depth of the transition between demineralized and unaffected dentin. Drying dentin for 5 s resulted in a significant decrease in mean bond strengths and an incompletely infiltrated collagen structure with areas of unveiled collagen fibers, regardless of the solvent. Re-wetting dentin with the aqueous HEMA solution re-established the level of bond strengths obtained to moist dentin and resulted in a raise of the fiber network with simultaneous increase in interfibrillar space dimensions.
   Significance: The results suggest that the use of an aqueous HEMA solution might compensate for the dryness induced on dentin surfaces by using air blasts from an air syringe, after rinsing off the etchant. As the behavior of the material that contained water was also affected by surface dryness, the percentage of water included in the composition of current ethanol- and water-based adhesives, such as Single Bond, may not be enough to compensate for the collapse of the collagen filigree upon drying.

AB We have previously reported that endothelium-dependent, nitric oxide (NO)-mediated vasorelaxation is impaired in diabetic mesenteric arteries. We hypothesized that vasoconstrictor responses should therefore be enhanced. The purpose of this study was to determine whether diabetic mesenteric arteries exhibit in creased vasoconstrictor responses, and to investigate if these changes are receptor and/or NO mediated. Thirty age-matched male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control (C) and diabetic (D, streptozotocin: 60 mg/kg) groups and studied after 4 weeks, Terminal branches of ileal mesenteric arteries (300 +/- 9 mu m) were isolated, pressurized, and superfused with modified Krebs solution. Changes in vessel internal diameter were measured and dose-response curves (DRC) for each vasoactive agent were determined. Each vessel was initially constricted with 40 mM of KCl to determine maximal vasoconstriction. Phenylephrine (Phe, 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and UK14304 (10(-9)-10(-5) M) were used to determine alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-receptor responses, respectively. Similar studies were performed in the presence of N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10(-4) M), a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase. Maximal response (Max), area under the curve (AUG), and vessel sensitivity (ED50) for each DRC were calculated. Comparisons among groups were made using analysis of variance and Student's t test with Bonferroni correction. There were no differences in vasoconstrictor responses induced by KCI (C: 82 +/- 2% vs D: 80 +/- 1%). alpha(1)-vasoconstrictor responses to Phe were enhanced in diabetes with significantly higher Max (96 +/- 2% vs 83 +/- 3%), and AUC (1.92 +/- 0.09 vs 1.56 +/- 0.08), but no difference in ED50. The addition of L-NAME enhanced only Phe-induced vasoconstrictor response significantly in control rats, Thus, differences in Phe-induced vasoconstrictor responses between C and D were abolished in the presence of L-NAME. alpha(2)-vasodilator responses induced by UK14304 were similar between C and D and unaffected by L-NAME. alpha(1)-, but not alpha(2)- vasoconstrictor responses are enhanced in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. These enhanced responses can be duplicated by treatment of control vessels with L-NAME. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Background. The current study examines the use of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression in simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation. In addition, analyses of the rates of conversion from one immunosuppressive agent to another, and its subsequent consequences with respect to outcomes were determined. Quality of graft function, infections, and effect on preexisting essential hypertension are also described.
   Methods. Immunosuppression consisted of quadruple therapy with antithymocyte globulin induction, tacrolimus, MMF, and prednisone. Patient and graft survival and rejection rates in 50 consecutive SPK recipients, followed for a minimum of 3 months and a mean of 14 months (range: 3-34 months), are described.
   Results. Thirty-nine of 50 (78%) patients tolerated the MMF/tacrolimus combination long-term (mean duration of follow-up: 14+/-7 months). Nine of 50 patients (18%) were converted to Neoral(R), and 4 patients were converted to azathioprine as a substitute for MMF. The 2-year actuarial patient, kidney, and pancreas survival rates were 97.7%, 93.3%, and 90.0%, respectively. At 6 months after transplant, the overall incidence of acute rejection was 16%. There was a statistically significant (P less than or equal to 0.04, Cox-Mantel test) difference in the rate of rejection associated with conversion to Neoral(R). The incidence of rejection 6 months after transplant in the group maintained on MMF/tacrolimus was 10.2% vs. 44.4% in the group converted to Neoral(R) (P less than or equal to 0.04, Cox-Mantel test). Overall, the 1-year actuarial cumulative incidence of tissue-invasive cytomegalovirus disease was 6.6%. There were no cases of fungal infections or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders. One patient developed Kaposi's sarcoma 10 months after transplant. With respect to hypertensive disease, 60% (12/20) of the patients who required pharmacologic control of blood pressure before transplant were off all antihypertensive medications at 1 year after transplant. An additional 20% (4/20) of patients had a reduction in the number of medications required to control blood pressure at 1 year after transplant.
   Conclusions. We conclude that the combination of MMF and tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression for SPK transplantation results in excellent patient and graft survival rates, a very low rate of acute rejection, and low rates of infection and malignancy.

TI A phase II double-blind randomized study of the simultaneous

   granulocyte colony-stimulating factor following paclitaxel and
   carboplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian
   cancer
SO GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY

AB Purpose. Recombinant human interleukin-6 (rhuIL-6) is a glycosylated cytokine with hematopoietic stimulatory effects. In particular, preclinical studies suggest the agent can stimulate thrombopoiesis, even in conjunction with chemotherapy. We attempted to determine whether higher dose chemotherapy for ovarian cancer was possible given the pharmacologic use of this important growth factor.
   Methods. We conducted a randomized, double-blind phase II study of IL-6 plus granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) versus placebo plus G-CSF in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen. Patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, stages Ic to IV, were eligible. All patients were previously untreated with chemotherapy and had Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 60. rhuIL-B (Escherichia coli, SDZ ILS 969) 1.0 mu g/kg or placebo was given subcutaneously on days 2-8 every cycle together with G-CSF 5.0 mu g/kg subcutaneously days 2-15, following administration of paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) as a 3-h infusion and carboplatin given to a desired AUC of 7.5 on day 1 every 21 days.
   Results. Fifty patients were entered in this study, although the study was temporarily suspended by the FDA in midstudy over manufacturing concerns. Therefore, 37 patients were evaluable for efficacy of growth factor; 19 patients received placebo plus G-CSF and 18 rhIL-6 plus G-CSF, There was no difference in prognostic variables between these two groups. Platelet nadirs were lower in the first cycle for the placebo group (P = 0.004, Wilcoxon sum-rank test) but not in other cycles. There was no statistically significant difference in cycle treatment delays, carboplatin dose delivered, number of patients with grade 4 thrombocytopenia, or platelet transfusion. Nonetheless, the trend of the data favored IL-6 in all cases.
   Conclusions. This study demonstrated a minimal effect (statistically significant in the first cycle only) on thrombopoiesis in women undergoing paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy of ovarian cancer. No clinically significant effect on actual chemotherapy delivery was demonstrated, however, Future studies, if warranted, to ameliorate thrombocytopenia should be carried out with regimens producing even greater thrombocytopenia than the current regimen in the control arm.

AB Amorphous carbon nitride (a-CNx) thin films were used for the first time as electrode materials in the elaboration of biofuel cell cathodes as a consequence of i) the natural presence of amine type functional groups and ii) the ease to generate carboxylic acid groups on their surface with the help of an anodic treatment. Their rich surface chemistry was exploited to investigate the influence of the orientation of immobilised laccase on their bioelectrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in a direct electron transfer configuration. Among four different immobilisation strategies leading to a statistical control of the orientation and tested in this work, spontaneous adsorption of natural laccase on pristine a-CNx provided the smallest current density value (3.5 mu A cm(-2)) whereas covalent grafting of oxidised laccase on anodically treated a-CNx via imine and amide bond formation using a coupling agent led to a much higher but still low 44.6 mu A cm-(2) current density. This substantial improvement of the current density value measured for ORR confirms that the orientation of immobilised laccase exerts a measurable influence on its bioelectrocatalytic activity towards ORR.
   In parallel, the surface coverage rate of enzymes showing such activity was estimated as a function of the immobilisation method by using four different techniques (current density, activity towards ABTS, XPS and AFM). It was found that only a small fraction (7.1% to the most) of the electrode surface is covered with active enzymes, whatever the immobilisation method, whereas an enzyme population corresponding (almost) to a full enzyme monolayer was actually immobilised. This observation is crucial because it strongly suggests that the development of innovative immobilisation strategies allowing an increase of the active enzyme fraction through a simultaneous optimisation of the bioelectrocatalytic activity of the enzyme and of its electronic communication with the electrode offers much more promising perspectives than the control of the orientation of the immobilised enzyme population on its own.

   STATISTICS; THERAPY; AGENTS; GAB2; CHEMOTHERAPY
AB Background: Angiogenesis is generally involved during the cancer development and hematogenous metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are considered to have an important role in tumor-associated angiogenesis. However, the effects of simultaneously targeting on VEGF and EGFR on the growth and angiogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
   Methods: Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the VEGF and EGFR expression in different CRC tissue specimens, and the correlation between VEGF/EGFR expression with the clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and transwell assays were used to assess the cellular proliferation and invasion of CRC cells after treated with anti-VEGF antibody and/or anti-EGFR antibody in vitro, respectively. Moreover, in vivo tumor formation was performed on nude mice model, and the tumor microvessel density (MVD) was determined by anti-CD34 staining in different groups. Finally, we evaluated the impact of anti-VEGF antibody and/or anti-EGFR antibody on the activation of downstream signaling effectors using western blot.
   Results: VEGF and EGFR were upregulated in CRC tissues, and their expression levels were correlated with hepatic metastasis. Blockage on VEGF or EGFR alone could inhibit the cellular proliferation and metastasis while their combination could reach a good synergism in vitro. In addition, in vivo xenograft mice model demonstrated that the tumor formation and angiogenesis were strongly suppressed by combination treatment of anti-VEGF and anti-EGFR antibodies. Besides, the combination treatment significantly reduced the activation of AKT and ERK1/2, but barely affected the activation of c-Myc, NF-kappa B/p65 and I kappa B alpha in CRC cells tumors. Interestingly, anti-VEGF antibody or anti-EGFR antibody alone could attenuate the phosphorylation of STAT3 as compared with negative control group, whereas the combined application not further suppressed but at least partially restored the activation of STAT3 in vivo.
   Conclusions: Simultaneous targeting on VEGF and EGFR does show significant inhibition on CRC tumor growth and angiogenesis in mice model, and these effects are mainly attributed to suppression of the AKT and ERK signaling pathways.

AB Objective., To determine the effects of an anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody on the clearance of a bacteremic Escherichia coli challenge in the presence or absence of antimicrobial agents.
   Design: Prospective randomized animal study.
   Setting. University-affiliated research laboratory.
   Subjects. New Zealand White rabbits weighing 1.5-2.5 kg.
   Interventions.- Animals were pretreated with either an antilapine CD14 monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G(2a), 5 mg/kg intravenously) or an isotype control monoclonal antibody. The animals then were challenged with 1 X 10(6) E. coli O18:K1 in the presence or absence of ceftazidime (50 mg/kg intravenously). There were four groups of six animals randomized to receive either anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody without ceftazidime, isotype control monoclonal antibody without ceftazidime, anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody with ceftazidime, or isotype control antibody with ceftazidime.
   Measurements and Main Results. Serial measurement of quantitative bacteremia and endotoxemia was performed over 24 hrs after the administration of the bacterial challenge. Animals also underwent necropsy with quantitative bacterial cultures from multiple organ tissue samples. The anti-lapine CD14 monoclonal antibody significantly impaired the bloodstream clearance of E coli (p < .01) and increased quantitative counts of E coli in tissue culture samples when compared with isotype control antibody in the absence of simultaneous administration of ceftazidime. No differences in quantitative bacteremia, endotoxemia, or organ tissue counts were found after anti-CD14 antibody and control antibody-treated animals in the presence of ceftazidime treatment.
   Conclusions: Anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody has the capacity to interfere with the innate immune response and systemic microbial clearance in experimental animals with E colibacteremia. The concomitant administration of effective antimicrobial therapy eliminated differences in the rate of microbial clearance between the control antibody and the CD14 monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that care should be taken in clinical trials with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies to ensure that adequate antimicrobial therapy is administered in the presence of systemic bacterial infection.

AB Background: Local relapse and peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC) for pT4 colon cancer is estimated in 15,6% and 36,7% for 12 months and 36 months from surgical resection respectively, achieving a 5 years overall survival of 6%. There are promising results using prophylactic HIPEC in this group of patients, and it is estimated that up to 26% of all T4 colon cancer could benefit from this treatment with a minimal morbidity. Adjuvant HIPEC is effective to avoid the possibility of peritoneal seeding after surgical resection. Taking into account these results and the cumulative experience in HIPEC use, we will lead a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant treatment with HIPEC vs. standard treatment in patients with colon cancer at high risk of peritoneal recurrence (pT4).
   Methods/Design: The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant HIPEC in preventing the development of PC in patients with colon cancer with a high risk of peritoneal recurrence (cT4). This study will be carried out in 15 Spanish HIPEC centres. Eligible for inclusion are patients who underwent curative resection for cT4NxM0 stage colon cancer. After resection of the primary tumour, 200 patients will be randomized to adjuvant HIPEC followed by routine adjuvant systemic chemotherapy in the experimental arm, or to systemic chemotherapy only in the control arm. Adjuvant HIPEC will be performed simultaneously after the primary resection. Mitomycin C will be used as chemotherapeutic agent, for 60 min at 42-43 degrees C. Primary endpoint is loco-regional control (LC) in months and the rate of loco-regional control (%LC) at 12 months and 36 months after resection.
   Discussion: We assumed that adjuvant HIPEC will reduce the expected absolute risk of peritoneal recurrence from 36% to 18% at 36 months for T4 colon-rectal carcinoma.

AB A restricted-randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted to examine whether immunomodulating dose of levamisole (LMS) can stimulate certain antiviral immune markers by measuring the concentrations of interferon- (IFN-), nitric oxide (NOx), and total immunoglobulin G (IgG); prevents the gut injury; and reduces fecal consistency and dehydration scores in rotavirus type A (RVA)-positive piglet diarrhea. The trial was executed between November 2015 and May 2016 in an institute owned experimental swine production farm. The naturally RVA-exposed diarrheic piglets were used in the study. The piglets born between November 2015 and May 2016, age group of 0 to 2weeks and confirmed for RVA-positive diarrhea, were randomized to receive supportive treatment (ST) or ST along with levamisole (LMS + ST) at immunomodulating dose. Simultaneously, six piglets were randomly selected from healthy population and kept as placebo control. The primary outcome was reduction of fecal consistency and dehydration scores (1) over the trial period. The secondary outcome was reduction of concentration of gut injury marker and stimulation of immunomodulatory function. The LMS + ST treatment progressively improved the total leukocyte, neutrophil count, IgG concentration (p<0.05), and reduced the intestinal fatty acid-binding protein 2 (IFABP-2) concentration in RV-positive diarrheic piglets than ST only. Although NOx and IFN- concentrations were enhanced initially on day 3, however, the values reduced significantly on day 5 in response to LMS + ST compared to ST. Interestingly, the scores of fecal consistency and dehydration of RVA-positive diarrheic piglets were dropped much earlier (on day 3) in response to LMS + ST than ST alone. The results indicate that LMS along with supportive treatment non-specifically modulated innate immunity and restored intestinal gut health, and thus, LMS may represent an additional therapeutic agent for management of RVA-inflicted piglet diarrhea.

TI KMUP-1 attenuates isoprenaline-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats

   INHIBITION
AB Background and purpose:
   To determine whether KMUP-1, a novel xanthine-based derivative, attenuates isoprenaline (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats, and if so, whether the anti-hypertrophic effect is mediated by the nitric oxide (NO) pathway.
   Experimental approach:
   In vivo, cardiac hypertrophy was induced by injection of ISO (5 mg center dot kg-1 center dot day-1, s.c.) for 10 days in Wistar rats. In the treatment group, KMUP-1 was administered 1 h before ISO. After 10 days, effects of KMUP-1 on survival, cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, the NO/guanosine 3'5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)/protein kinase G (PKG) and hypertrophy signalling pathways [calcineurin A and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2] were examined. To investigate the role of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the effects of KMUP-1, a NOS inhibitor, N omega-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA) was co-administered with KMUP-1. In vitro, anti-hypertrophic effects of KMUP-1 were studied in ISO-induced hypertrophic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.
   Key results:
   In vivo, KMUP-1 pretreatment attenuated the cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and improved the survival of ISO-treated rats. Plasma NOx (nitrite and nitrate) and cardiac endothelial NOS, cGMP and PKG were all increased by KMUP-1. The activation of hypertrophic signalling by calcineurin A and ERK1/2 in ISO-treated rats was also attenuated by KMUP-1. All these effects of KMUP-1 were inhibited by simultaneous administration of L-NNA. Similarly, in vitro, KMUP-1 attenuated hypertrophic responses and signalling induced by ISO in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes.
   Conclusions and implications:
   KMUP-1 attenuates the cardiac hypertrophy in rats induced by administration of ISO. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by NOS activation. This novel agent, which targets the NO/cGMP pathway, has a potential role in the prevention of cardiac hypertrophy.

TI IL-1 beta promotes disc degeneration and inflammation through direct
   injection of intervertebral disc in a rat lumbar disc herniation model

ID DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; RADICULAR PAIN; CELLS; ERK
AB BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Lumbar intervertebral disc herniation (LDH) is a common disease that causes low back pain, radiating leg pain, and sensory impairment. Preclinical studies rely heavily upon standardized animal models of human diseases to predict clinical treatment efficacy and to identify and investigate potential adverse events in human subjects. The current method for making the LDH model involves harvesting the nucleus pulposus (NP) from autologous coccygeal discs and applying to the lumbar nerve roots just proximal to the corresponding dorsal root ganglion. However, this surgical method generates a model that exhibits very different characteristics of disc herniation than that observed in human.
   PURPOSE: To produce a rat LDH model that better resembles disc herniation in humans and a standardized and uniform LDH model using Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta).
   STUDY DESIGN: Experimental rat LDH model.
   METHODS: We exposed the L5-6 disc dorsolaterally on the right side through hemi-laminectomy without nerve compression. Herniation was initiated by puncturing the exposed disc with a 30-gauge needle at a depth of 4 mm. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) was injected simultaneously to heighten the pathological processes of disc degeneration, including inflammatory responses, matrix destruction, and herniation of the NP. We performed histological staining to assess morphological changes, immunohistochemistry to analyze inflammation- and pain-related expression within and around the puncture site of the L5-6 disc, and real-time polymerase chain reaction to examine expression of markers for degenerative processes. In addition, we performed locomotor tests on the rats.
   RESULTS: We found that the IL-1 beta groups showed that the border between the annulus fibrosis and nucleus pulposus was severely interrupted compared to that of the control (puncture only) group. And, the injection of IL-1 beta leads to accelerated disc degeneration and inflammation in a more consistent manner in LDH model. Functional deficit was consistently induced by puncturing and injection of IL-1 beta in the exposed disc.
   CONCLUSIONS: The method proposed here can be used as an index to control the severity of disc degeneration and inflammation through the injected IL-1 beta concentration concurrent with surgically induced herniation.
   CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Our proposed model may facilitate research in drug development to evaluate the efficacy of potential therapeutic agents for disc herniation and neuropathic pain and may also be used for nonclinical studies to more accurately assess the effectiveness of various treatment strategies according to the severity of disc degeneration.

AB The objective of this study is to investigate whether the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway is involved in the neurotransmission of paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVN) activation-induced penile erection in the rat. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with pentobarbital were used. The femoral artery was cannulated to measure systemic and mean arterial pressure (SAP and MAP), and heart rate (HR). A 26-gauge needle was inserted into corpus cavernosum to measure the intracavernous pressure (ICP) simultaneously with SAP, MAP and HR on a polygraph. Four groups of study were arranged: (1) stereotaxically delivery of L-arginine (500 nmol/500 nl) into PVN; (2) administration of a mixture (1 mul) containing N-G-Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 500 nmol and L-arginine 500 nmol into PVN; (3) microinjection of saline 500 nl into PVN as a vehicle control; and (4) intracavernous injection of L-arginine (100 nmol/50 mul). The ICP, SAP, MAP and HR were monitored for at least 2 h after each administration of the experimental agents. Upon administration of L-arginine into PVN, there was a significant increase of ICP from resting 9.6+/-2.5 mmHg to peaked at 64.4+/-9.8 mmHg after a latency of 3016.0+/-1749.7 s and with a duration of 27.6+/-15.8 min. There was no change of resting ICP after administration of the mixture of L-NAME and L-arginine into PVN. Application of saline to PVN and intracavernous injection of L-arginine failed to increase ICP. Based on elicitation of penile erection upon administration of L-arginine into PVN, and elimination of this L-arginine induced penile erection by co-administration of L-NAME with L-arginine, the results of this study suggest that L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway may be involved in the neurotransmission of PVN activation-induced penile erection in the rat.

AB The Guatemalan potato moth Tecia solanivora (Povolny) recently invaded part of South America, colonizing zones where Phthorimaea operculella (Zeller), another potato moth species belonging to the same group, was previously established. T. solanivora is now the major insect pest of potato in this area encompassing Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. P. operculella granulovirus (PhopGV) (Betabaculovirus) is a bio-control agent to be considered for the simultaneous management of these two potato pests, instead of classical chemical insecticides. In a previous work, five PhopGV isolates were isolated in Colombia from T. solanivora and were tested against larvae of the same species showing variable efficacies. Infections with mixtures of different genotypes of Baculoviruses had been carried out in a wide range of species and several showed interesting results. In the present study, the effect of sequential passages of PhopGV in P. operculella and T. solanivora larvae was analyzed through biological assays. Three different mixtures containing a Peruvian PhopGV isolate (Peru) adapted to P. operculella and a Colombian PhopGV isolate (VG003) adapted to T. solanivora were tested. A preliminary analysis of the correlation between the genotypic marker egt gene and the level of pathogenicity after a variable number of replication cycles was made. Mixtures of virus isolates showed a higher efficacy in both hosts compared to individual PhopGV isolates. This higher pathogenicity was maintained through passages. In P. operculella the mixtures were between 2.8 and 23.6-fold (from 7.15 OB/mm(2) to 0.10 OB/mm(2)) more pathogenic than isolate Peru applied alone. In T. solanivora they were between 2.3 and 4.9-fold (from 12.29 OB/mm(2) to 1.25 OB/mm(2)) more pathogenic than isolate VG003 alone. Viral biopesticide containing a mixture of selected genotypes active against each hosts seemed suitable for the development of a biopesticide aimed to simultaneously control P. operculella and T. solanivora.

AB Novel tetrahydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-a]isoquinolin-3-yl)-3-arylprop-2-en-1-one derivatives were synthesized and their structures were confirmed by different spectral tools. Cytotoxicity test revealed that some compounds exhibited strong to moderate effect, while others showed weak action against different cancer cell lines (MCF7, A549, HCT116, and Hepg2). Breast carcinoma revealed higher sensitivity toward all derivatives especially compounds Sand 8 which offered the lowest IC50 values (50.05, and 27.15 mu g/ml) respectively, relative to the positive control 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (IC50 = 178 mu g/ml). In addition, the two compounds exhibited less toxic effect toward normal melanocytes (HFB4). Several theoretical and experimental studies were done to reveal the molecular mechanisms that control breast carcinoma metastasis using the two promising novels 5 and 8. Docking simulation studies against the two proteins EGFR and DHFR demonstrate that compound 8 showed higher binding affinity toward the two proteins more than compound 5, suggesting that trimethoxy groups may be responsible for this higher activity through the formation of five hydrogen bonding with the active domain (4r3r) and other four interactions with the active domain (1dls). Real time PCR assay illustrates that the two compounds up regulated BAX, p53, caspase-3 genes and down regulated BCL2, MMP1, CDK4 ones. In addition, it was noted that compound 8 was more effective in gene regulation and apoptotic induction than compound 5. Also, flow cytometer analysis demonstrates that both compounds Sand 8 induced cell growth arrest at G1 phase and thus, inhibit C1/S transition and cell cycle progression. In addition, both compounds stimulate apoptotic death of breast cells significantly to reach 8.72%, and 17.28% respectively, compared to their control (0.55%). Apoptotic induction of breast cells was enhanced effectively through activation of caspase-3 by compound 8 using Elisa assay. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB In the past decade the use of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI to investigate the effect of diseases and pharmacological agents on brain activity has increased greatly. BOLD fMRI does not measure neural activity directly, but relies on a cascade of physiological events linking neural activity to the generation of MRI signal. However, most of the disease and pharmacological studies performed so far have interpreted changes in BOLD fMRI as "brain activation," ignoring the potential confounds that can arise through drug- or disease-induced modulation of events downstream of the neural activity. This issue is especially serious in diseases (like multiple sclerosis, brain tumours and stroke) and drugs (like anaesthetics or those with a vascular action) that are known to influence these physiological events. Here we provide evidence that, to extract meaningful information on brain activity in patient and pharmacological BOLD fMRI studies, it is important to identify, characterise and possibly correct these influences that potentially confound the results. We suggest a series of experimental measures to improve the interpretability of BOLD fMRI studies. We have ranked these according to their potential information and current practical feasibility.
   First-line, necessary improvements consist of (1) the inclusion of one or more control tasks, and (2) the recording of physiological parameters during scanning and subsequent correction of possible between-group differences. Second-line, highly recommended important aim to make the results of a patient or drug BOLD study more interpretable and include the assessment of (1) baseline brain perfusion, (2) vascular reactivity, (3) the inclusion of stimulus-related perfusion fMRI and (4) the recording of electrophysiological responses to the stimulus of interest. Finally, third-line, desirable improvements consist of the inclusion of (1) simultaneous EEG-fMRI (2) cerebral blood volume and (3) rate of metabolic oxygen consumption measurements and, when relevant, (4) animal studies investigating signalling between neural cells and blood vessels.

AB Integrating anticancer drugs and diagnostic agents in a polymer nanosystem is an emerging and promising strategy for improving cancer treatment. However, the development of multifunctional nano articles (NPs) for an "all-in-one" platform characterized by specific targeting, therapeutic efficiency, and imaging feedback remains an unmet clinical need. In this study, pH-responsive mixed-lanthanide-based multifunctional NPs were fabricated based on simple metal ligand interactions for simultaneous cancer cell imaging and drug delivery. We investigated two new systems of alginate-polydopamine complexed with either terbium/europium or dysprosium/erbium oxide NPs (Tb/Eu@AlgPDA or Dy/Er@AlgPDA NPs). Tb/Eu@AlgPDA NPs were then functionalized with the tumor-targeting ligand folic acid (FA) and loaded with the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) to form FA-Tb/Eu@AlgPDA-DOX NPs. Using such systems, the mussel-inspired property of PDA was introduced to improve tumor targetability and penetration, in addition to active targeting (via FA-folate receptor interactions). Determining the photoluminescence efficiency showed that the Tb/Eu@AlgPDA system was superior to the Dy/Er@AlgPDA system, presenting intense and sharp emission peaks on the fluorescence spectra. In addition, compared to Dy/Er@A1gPDA NPs (82.4%), Tb/Eu@AlgPDA NPs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity with >93.3% HeLa cell viability found in MTT assays at NP concentrations of up to 0.50 mg/mL and high biocompatibility when incubated with zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae. The FA-Tb/Eu@AlgPDA-DOX system exhibited a pH-responsive and sustained drug-release pattern. In a spheroid model of HeLa cells, the FA-Tb/Eu@AlgPDA-DOX system showed a better penetration efficiency and spheroid growth-inhibitory effect than free DOX. After incubation with zebrafish embryos, the FA-Tb/Eu@AlgPDA-DOX system also showed improved antitumor efficacies versus the other experimental groups in HeLa tumor cell xenografted zebrafish. Therefore, our results suggested that FA-Tb/Eu@AlgPDA-DOX NPs are promising multifunctional nanocarriers with therapeutic capacity for tumor targeting and penetration.

AB Macrophage-secreted prostaglandins of the E series inhibit numerous immunologic events, including IgM secretion by B lymphocytes. In this study, we investigated whether PGE also regulates the activation of normal quiescent murine B cells and subsequent isotype differentiation to IgE and IgG1 production. PGE2 and PGE1 were found to inhibit cellular enlargement induced by IL-4 or bacterial LPS, IL-4 and LPS, or anti-mu and IL-4 by approximately 75%, and completely inhibit enlargement in response to anti-mu antibody. PGE2 also suppresses activation-induced class II MHC up-regulation by 35% and expression of the low affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRII/CD23, by 30%. Interestingly, PGE completely inhibits a fraction of cells from these activation events, while other cells fully respond to activation stimuli, even in the presence of high PGE2 concentrations. Therefore, a PGE-resistant subset of B lymphocytes may exist. A closely related PG, PGF2alpha, had no immunoregulatory effect in these systems. Because PGE induces production of cAMP in B cells, we determined whether other agents that increase cAMP could inhibit B cell activation. Cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP mimicked the ability of PGE2 to inhibit B cell enlargement, and class II MHC and FcepsilonRII induction, suggesting that PGE2 signaling occurs via cAMP. In addition, cholera toxin and dibutyryl cAMP inhibited B cell activation much more potently (90-100% inhibition) than PGE, indicating that whereas all B cells are cAMP-sensitive only some are PGE-sensitive. Although PGE inhibits activation-associated events, we previously reported that PGE enhances IL-4 and LPS-induced differentiation to IgE and IgG1 synthesis. To investigate the relationship between the cells that are activation-inhibited and those that are differentiation-enhanced by PGE, we sorted B cell subsets by FACS and determined their relative abilities to produce IgM, IgG1, and IgE in response to IL-4 and LPS in the presence of PGE. The population of lymphocytes that was unaffected by PGE in terms of class II hyperexpression was also unaffected by PGE for Ig synthesis, again indicating a PGE-resistant subpopulation of B cells. Furthermore, the PGE activation-inhibited subset of B cells was responsive to PGE enhancement of IL-4-induced class switching, reducing IgM synthesis and inducing a sevenfold increase in IgE and IgG1 synthesis compared with other sort groups. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the B lymphocytes that are PGE activation-inhibited are the same cells that are PGE differentiation-enhanced. Thus, PGE2 and cAMP may simultaneously inhibit activation and yet act as differentiative agents, promoting lymphokine-induced B cell isotype switching.

AB Invasive species management can be a victim of its own success when decades of effective control cause memories of past harm to fade and raise questions of whether programs should continue. Economic analysis can be used to assess the efficiency of investing in invasive species control by comparing ecosystem service benefits to program costs, but only if appropriate data exist. We used a case study of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes (Mart.) Solms), a nuisance floating aquatic plant, in Louisiana to demonstrate how comprehensive record-keeping supports economic analysis. Using long-term data sets, we developed empirical and spatio-temporal simulation models of intermediate complexity to project invasive species growth for control and no-control scenarios. For Louisiana, we estimated that peak plant cover would be 76% higher without the substantial growth rate suppression (84% reduction) that appeared due primarily to biological control agents. Our economic analysis revealed that combined biological and herbicide control programs, monitored over an unusually long time period (1975-2013), generated a benefit-cost ratio of about 34: 1 derived from the relatively modest costs of $ 124 million ($ 2013) compared to the $4.2 billion ($ 2013) in benefits to anglers, waterfowl hunters, boating-dependent businesses, and water treatment facilities over the 38-year analysis period. This work adds to the literature by: (1) providing evidence of the effectiveness of water hyacinth biological control; (2) demonstrating use of parsimonious spatio-temporal models to estimate benefits of invasive species control; and (3) incorporating activity substitution into economic benefit transfer to avoid overstating benefits. Our study suggests that robust and cost-effective economic analysis is enabled by good record keeping and generalizable models that can demonstrate management effectiveness and promote social efficiency of invasive species control.

AB Recent studies have indicated that COVID-19 is an airborne disease, which has driven conservative social distancing and widescale usage of face coverings. Airborne virus transmission occurs through droplets formed during respiratory events (breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing) associated with the airflow through a network of nasal and buccal passages. The airflow interacts with saliva/mucus films where droplets are formed and dispersed, creating a route to transmit SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a series of numerical simulations to investigate droplet dispersion from a sneeze while varying a series of human physiological factors that can be associated with illness, anatomy, stress condition, and sex of an individual. The model measures the transmission risk utilizing an approximated upper respiratory tract geometry for the following variations: (1) the effect of saliva properties and (2) the effect of geometric features within the buccal/nasal passages. These effects relate to natural human physiological responses to illness, stress, and sex of the host as well as features relating to poor dental health. The results find that the resulting exposure levels are highly dependent on the fluid dynamics that can vary depending on several human factors. For example, a sneeze without flow in the nasal passage (consistent with congestion) yields a 300% rise in the droplet content at 1.83 m (approximate to 6 ft) and an increase over 60% on the spray distance 5 s after the sneeze. Alternatively, when the viscosity of the saliva is increased (consistent with the human response to illness), the number of droplets is both fewer and larger, which leads to an estimated 47% reduction in the transmission risk. These findings yield novel insight into variability in the exposure distance and indicate how physiological factors affect transmissibility rates. Such factors may partly relate to how the immune system of a human has evolved to prevent transmission or be an underlying factor driving superspreading events in the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB Models that simulate land-use patterns often use either inductive, data-driven approaches or deductive, theory-based methods to describe the relative strength of the social, economic and biophysical forces that drive the various sectors in the land system. An integrated framework is proposed here that incorporates both approaches based on a unified assessment for local land suitability following a monetary, utility-based logic. The framework is illustrated with a hedonic pricing analysis of urban land values and a net present value assessment for agricultural production system in combination with statistics-based assessments of land suitability for other sectors.
   The results show that limited difference exists between the most commonly applied inductive approaches that use either multinomial or binomial logistic regression specifications of suitability. Land-use simulations following the binomial regression based suitability values that were rescaled to bid prices (reflecting relative competitiveness) perform better for all individual land-use types. Performance improves even further when a land value based description of urban bid prices is added to this approach. Interestingly enough the better fitting description of suitability for urban areas also improves the ability of the model to simulate correct locations for business estates and greenhouses.
   The simulation alternatives that consider the net present values for agricultural types of land use show the relevance of this approach for understanding the spatial distribution of these types of land use. The combined use of urban land values and net present values for agricultural land use in defining land suitability performs best in our validation exercise. The proposed methodology can also be used to incorporate information from other research frameworks that describe the utility of land for different types of use. (C) 2014 The Authors.

SO TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE Rock mass weathering; Support deterioration; Long-term stability; Tunnel
   lining
AB One distinctive feature of tunnels is the direct interaction between the primary support and the surrounding rocks. For this reason, loads applied to tunnels may vary significantly over time due to changes in rock mass behavior and environmental actions. In this paper, a methodology is proposed for predicting long-term stability of tunnels that accounts for weathering of rock and deterioration of primary support. Chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks around tunnels results in degradation of rock mass shear strength (cohesion and friction angle) and Young's modulus with time. Two semi-empirical logarithmic equations for modelling of the diminution of rock mass characteristics are presented. Tunnel support systems may also deteriorate and lose their load bearing capacity over time when exposed to aggressive agents. Therefore, main mechanisms of deterioration in common support systems i.e. rock bolts, steel sets and shotcrete are investigated and equations for quantifying damages to their mechanical properties with time are derived. The suggested procedure has been fully illustrated through numerical simulation of a freeway tunnel in Iran (Torshan tunnel) using finite difference method. The tunnel behavior has been evaluated using long-term ground reaction curves (GRC), ground-support interaction diagrams and lining factor of safety FS. Results show that there is a marked increase in the overall ground pressure and rising of internal forces acting on the final lining with time, especially bending moments at the tunnel sidewalls.

SO ECOLOGICAL MODELLING

DE Personality-dependent dispersal; Sociability; Personality type;
   Metapopulation; Dispersal
AB Metapopulation structure emerges from the dispersal of individuals among spatially distinct patches across a low-quality matrix. While dispersing agents are typically modeled as functionally identical with limited, linear and non-directional dispersal, field studies argue for the incorporation of intraspecific trait variation, such as behavioral, into the modeling of dispersal. Individual personality is of growing interest as a trait that affects dispersal metrics yet remains understudied at large, field-relevant spatial scales. Here, we used an individual-based model to investigate the influence of sociability, a personality-type known to be linked to density-dependent dispersal decisions, on a metapopulation at the individual, local and regional scales. As personality dependent dispersal is temporally dependent, we also examined how emergent properties of the metapopulation varied across two dispersal scenarios: long and short dispersal windows. Overall, our results support the growing evidence that individual personalities can significantly structure metapopulations in both space and time, through negative relationships between sociability and dispersal distance and positive relationships between sociability and patch density. However, we also demonstrate the effects of personality are limited by environmental factors. At the larger spatial scales of our model, patch density as a function of distance from source, and proportion of the landscape occupied were more strongly influenced by the dispersal window than by the personality. Using these results, we derive hypotheses to be examined in future empirical research. As the climate continues to shift, and dispersal models are updated to reflect ever changing conditions, these results suggest individual personality types and the personality type by environment interaction should be considered to accurately reflect dispersal and manage valuable metasystems.

AB The overlapping fields of adaptive behavior and artificial life are often described as novel approaches to biology. They focus attention on bottom-up explanations and how lifelike phenomena can result from relatively simple systems interacting dynamically with their environments. They are also characterized by the use of synthetic methodologies, that is, building artificial systems as a means of exploring these ideas. Two differing approaches can be distinguished: building models of specific animal systems and assessing them within complete behavior-environment loops; and exploring the behavior of invented artificial animals, often called animats, under similar conditions. An obvious question about the latter approach is, how can we learn about real biology from simulation of non-existent animals? In this article I will argue, first, that animat research, to the extent that it is relevant to biology, should also be considered as model building. Animat simulations do, implicitly, represent hypotheses about, and should be evaluated by comparison to, animals. Casting this research in terms of invented agents serves only to limit the ability to draw useful conclusions from it by deflecting or deferring any serious comparisons of the model mechanisms and results with real biological systems. Claims that animat models are meant to be existence proofs, idealizations, or represent general problems in biology do not make these models qualitatively different from more conventional models of specific animals, nor undermine the ultimate requirement to justify this work by making concrete comparisons with empirical data. It is thus suggested that we will learn more by choosing real, and not made-up, targets for our models.

ID AGENT-BASED MODELS; STOCK; POLICIES
AB A major concern about the use of simulation models regards their relationship with the empirical data. The identification of a suitable indicator quantifying the distance between the model and the data would help and guide model selection and output validation. This paper proposes the use of a new criterion, called GSL-div and developed in Lamperti (Econ Stat, 2017. https://doi-org.ez54.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1016/j.ecosta. 2017. 01.006), to assess the degree of similarity between the dynamics observed in the data and those generated by the numerical simulation of models. As an illustrative application, this approach is used to distinguish between different versions of the well known asset pricing model with heterogeneous beliefs proposed in Brock and Hommes (J Econ Dyn Control 22(8-9): 1235-1274, 1998. https://doi-org.ez54.periodicos.capes.gov.br/10.1016/S0165-1889(98)00011-6). Once the discrimination ability of the GSL-div is proved, model's dynamics are directly compared with actual data coming from two major stock market indexes (EuroSTOXX 50 for Europe and CSI 300 for China). Results show that the model, once calibrated, is fairly able to track the evolution of both the two indexes, even though a better fit is reported for the Chinese stock market. However, I also find that many different combinations of traders' behavioural rules are compatible with the same observed dynamics. Within this heterogeneity, an emerging common trait is found: to be empirically valid, the model has to account for a strong trend following component, which might either come from a unique trend type that heavily extrapolates information from past observations or the combinations of different types with milder, or even opposite, attitudes towards the trend.

AB The high variability of wild (lowbush) blueberry plants in spatial and genetic structure, in combination with bee foraging behavior varying between species, and the complexity of these factors interacting over time and space, are major obstacles to understanding of pollination dynamics subject to environmental change. The bottom-up modeling paradigm provides an ideal approach to bridging the gap between known mechanisms of individual organisms and unknown spatial temporal dynamics of pollination at the field scale. By linking empirical data to stochastically-based ecological process modeling, we present a spatially-explicit agent-based simulation model that enables exploration of how various factors, including plant spatial arrangements, outcrossing and self-pollination, bee species compositions and weather conditions, in isolation and combination, affect pollination efficiency throughout a blueberry bloom season. The firmly validated open-source model is a useful tool for hypothesis testing and theory development for wild blueberry pollination researches. Sensitivity analysis suggested that fruit set and resulting measures of productivity such as fruit mass and viable seeds per fruit were sensitive to parameterization of blueberry genotype or clone size and the amount of blueberry plant cover in a field. Fruit set due to pollen compatibility was sensitive to ovule number per flower and foraging bee density. Simulation experiments allowed us to compare bee pollination efficiencies at the bee taxon population level (honey bees, bumble bees, and native solitary bees), the effect of foraging distance from bee nest or colony site on fruit set, and test whether the mechanism of gametophytic self-incompatibility (pre- vs. post-zygotic decision making by the plant) in wild blueberry pollination at the field level matters in estimating yield.

AB Currently, two broad types of approach for predicting the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases can be distinguished: i) empirical-statistical (correlative) approaches that use statistical models of relationships between vector and/or pathogen presence and environmental factors; and ii) process-based (mechanistic) approaches that seek to simulate detailed biological or epidemiological processes that explicitly describe system behavior. Both have advantages and disadvantages, but it is generally acknowledged that both approaches have value in assessing the response of species in general to climate change. Here, we combine a previously developed dynamic, agent-based model of the temperature-sensitive stages of the Schistosoma mansoni and intermediate host snail lifecycles, with a statistical model of snail habitat suitability for eastern Africa. Baseline model output compared to empirical prevalence data suggest that the combined model performs better than a temperature-driven model alone, and highlights the importance of including snail habitat suitability when modeling schistosomiasis risk. There was general agreement among models in predicting changes in risk, with 24-36% of the eastern Africa region predicted to experience an increase in risk of up-to 20% as a result of increasing temperatures over the next 50 years. Vice versa the models predicted a general decrease in risk in 30-37% of the study area. The snail habitat suitability models also suggest that anthropogenically altered habitat play a vital role for the current distribution of the intermediate snail host, and hence we stress the importance of accounting for land use changes in models of future changes in schistosomiasis risk.

AB Nanofluids, particularly water-based nanofluids, have been extensively studied as liquid-solid phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage (TES). In this study, nanofluids with aqueous ethylene glycol (EG) solution as the base fluid are proposed as a novel PCM for cold thermal energy storage. Nanofluids were prepared by dispersing 0.1-0.4 wt% TiO2 nanoparticles into 12, 22, and 34 vol.% EG solutions. The dispersion stability of the nanofluids was evaluated by Turbiscan Lab. The liquid-solid phase change characteristics of the nanofluids were also investigated. Phase change temperature (PCT), nucleation temperature, and half freezing time (HFT) were investigated in freezing experiments. Subcooling degree and HFT reduction were then calculated. Latent heat of solidification was measured using differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal conductivity was determined using the hot disk thermal constant analyzer. Experimental results show that the nanoparticles decreased the PCT of 34 vol.% EG solution but minimally influenced the PCT of 12 and 22 vol.% EG solutions. For all nanofluids, the nanoparticles decreased the subcooling degree, HFT, and latent heat but increased the thermal conductivity of the EG solutions. The mechanism of the improvement of the phase change characteristics and decrease in latent heat by the nanoparticles was discussed. The nanoparticles simultaneously served as nucleating agent that induced crystal nucleation and as impurities that disturbed the growth of water crystals in EG solution-based nanofluids.

AB Clobazam, a 1,5-benzodiazepin-2,4-dione, is a chiral molecule because its ground state conformation features a nonplanar seven-membered ring lacking reflection symmetry elements. The two conformational enantiomers of clobazam interconvert at room temperature by a simple ring-flipping process. Variable temperature HPLC on the Pirkle type (R)-N-(3,5-dinitronenzoyl)phenylglycine and (R, R)-Whelk-O1 chiral stationary phases (CSPs) allowed us to separate for the first time the conformational enantiomers of clobazam and to observe peak coalescence-decoalescence phenomena due to concomitant separation and interconversion processes occurring on the same time scale. Clobazam showed temperature dependent dynamic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) profiles with interconversion plateaus on the two CSPs indicative of on-column enantiomer interconversion. (enantiomerization) in the column temperature range between T-col = 10 degrees C and T-col = 30 degrees C, whereas on-column interconversion was absent at temperature close to or lower than T-col = 5 degrees C. Computer simulation of exchange-deformed HPLC profiles using a program based on the stochastic model yielded the apparent rate constants for the on-column enantiomerization and the corresponding free energy activation barriers. At T-col = 20 degrees C the averaged enantiomerization barriers, Delta G(double dagger), for clobazam were found in the range 21.08-21.53 kcal mol(-1) on the two CSPs. The experimental dynamic chromatograms and the corresponding interconversion barriers reported in this article are consistent with the literature data measured by DNMR at higher temperatures and in different solvents.

AB Experimental studies of the Central Nervous System (CNS) at multiple organization levels aim at understanding how information is represented and processed by the brain's neurobiological substrate. The information processed within different neural subsystems is neurocomputed using distributed and dynamic patterns of neural activity. These emerging patterns can be hardly understood by merely taking into account individual cell activities. Studying how these patterns are elicited in the CNS under specific behavioral tasks has become a groundbreaking research topic in system neuroscience. This methodology of synthetic behavioral experimentation is also motivated by the concept of embodied neuroscience, according to which the primary goal of the CNS is to solve/facilitate the body environment interaction.
   With the aim to bridge the gap between system neuroscience and biological control, this paper presents how the CNS neural structures can be connected/integrated within a body agent; in particular, an efficient neural simulator based on EDLUT (Ros et al., 2006) has been integrated within a simulated robotic environment to facilitate the implementation of object manipulating closed loop experiments (action perception loop). This kind of experiment allows the study of the neural abstraction process of dynamic models that occurs within our neural structures when manipulating objects.
   The neural simulator, communication interfaces, and a robot platform have been efficiently integrated enabling real time simulations. The cerebellum is thought to play a crucial role in human-body interaction with a primary function related to motor control which makes it the perfect candidate to start building an embodied nervous system as illustrated in the simulations performed in this work.

AB Breast cancer is a public health problem and has the highest incidence and mortality in the female population worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer is essential for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Some methods for detecting breast tumors include ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, tomosynthesis, and mammography, which are recommended as screening techniques. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, such as discomfort to the patient during examination, possible reactions to the contrast agent, radiation emission, operator dependence for the analysis of results, difficulty of detection in dense tissues, lack of access for people with disabilities or low mobility, high cost, and radioactive waste production. The main objective of this work is to apply the electromechanical impedance method to the detection of inclusions so that it can be used as an alternative to existing techniques for the detection of breast tumors. The application of the electromechanical impedance method using piezoelectric transducers, acting simultaneously as sensors and actuators, coupled to the analyzed structure allows the monitoring of mass, rigidity, and/or damping variations, and consequent detection of inclusions. The detection of inclusions is possible owing to damage metrics, which are statistical parameters capable of numerically representing the difference between two measurements before and after damage. In this work, silicone samples and phantom breast models were analyzed. In addition, it was observed that external heating imposed on the models and the presence of heat generation in the inclusions aided detection. This work presents important contributions in the analysis of structural behavior, expanding the applications of damage detection techniques to hyperplastic materials.

AB Low reducing agent operation of large blast furnace has attracted a special attention from the background of the global warming. Because the coke ratio is reduced in this operation, causing a huge local ventilation resistance that causes operational problems, it has become increasingly necessary to understand the operation of blast furnace based on non-empirical phenomena. Among the most promising numerical approaches is a combination of the discrete element method (DEM) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In this study, particle-based model was newly developed, which considers heat transfer, mass transfer and chemical reactions in the shaft part of blast furnace. It became possible to analyze the three-dimensional discontinuous phenomena among particle with gas flow.
   Because this model was developed to expand the spatial scale more than conventional analysis, the discontinuous factors made it possible to simulate by the behavior of discrete particles. The particle arrangement and the packed bed structure were evaluated for studying the flow structure, temperature and composition distribution. Remarkable change in the heat and mass transfer characteristic appeared in the interface between coke and ore layer, and near the wall. The ore and coke particle mixture system, which was expected to improve reducing rate due to the dense packing, is relatively-ineffective. Rather, a low permeability resistance improved reducing rate, it means convection effect was larger. Degree of freedom of particle arrangement is high, and its large influence on temperature and reaction distribution, it was able to show the usefulness of this model.

AB The sequential and competitive adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and beta-lactoglobulin at silanized silica surfaces were investigated using protein radiolabeling and in situ ellipsometry. Simultaneous adsorption of C-14-labeled BSA and beta-lactoglobulin revealed an initial dominance of the surface by beta-lactoglobulin, with subsequent replacement by BSA. In sequential adsorption experiments, where the surface was contacted with C-14-labeled BSA followed by contact with protein-free buffer and addition of beta-lactoglobulin, most of the adsorbed BSA was not removed. The effect of adding alpha-lactalbumin, beta-casein and beta-lactoglobulin to adsorbed BSA, and the effect of adding alpha-lactalbumin, beta-casein and BSA to adsorbed beta-lactoglobulin, were investigated using in situ ellipsometry. beta-Casein was the most effective eluting agent, while alpha-lactalbumin was the least effective. The abilities of alpha-lactalbumin and beta-casein to exchange with adsorbed BSA and beta-lactoglobulin were evaluated with reference to a simple kinetic model for protein adsorption and exchange. The model is based on a mechanism allowing for reversible adsorption followed by either a surface-induced conformational change yielding an irreversibly adsorbed form, or exchange with a dissimilar protein from the solution. Differences in exchange behavior were generally found to be explainable with reference to the rate constant for surface-induced conversion of the adsorbed protein as opposed to that describing exchange of adsorbed protein with a dissimilar protein. This suggests that under these experimental conditions exchange was mediated by a protein-surface interaction, i.e. a displacement mechanism, where protein-protein associations were of minor significance.

AB A new adsorbent was synthesized from sawdust, a forest residue, in which methanol was used as a solvent and triethylamine as a modification agent under the following optimum conditions: 25 A degrees C of reaction temperature, 1 : 8.75 of the ratio of sawdust to triethylamine (g:mL) and 1 hour of reaction time. The adsorption capacity of this adsorbent for malachite green was improved by 632.98% in contrast to that of the unmodified sawdust under the same adsorption conditions. Factors affecting the adsorption behavior of this adsorbent for malachite green, such as pH value, adsorption time, temperature and initial dye concentration, were evaluated through experiments in a batch system. The results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity can be achieved at 5.08 of pH value and adsorption equilibrium can be reached in 6 hours. It was also found that the higher the temperature, the higher the adsorptive capacity would be. The Freundlich isotherm model provides a better description for the adsorption equilibrium when compared with the Langmuir equation in the conditions of the present study. Additionally, to examine the controlling mechanisms of the process, kinetic equations of the mass transfer and chemical reaction, the pseudo-first order model, the pseudo-second order model and the intraparticle diffusion model were used to correlate the experimental data respectively. The adsorption process of malachite green on sawdust tended to be controlled simultaneously by film mass transfer and intra-particle diffusion and it accompanied chemical reactions. It showed that the sawdust modified with triethylamine had good performance for cationic dye and can be used as a biomass adsorbent to treat dyes-containing wastewater with high quality.

AB Finite element method (FEM) has been extensively used for evaluating interfacial status inside biomaterials. This study using FEM was designed to evaluate the thermal stress behavior of a filler-matrix interface. The results were then compared to those of a previous study obtained by a laser thermoacoustic technique (LTAT). The experimental systems (75/25 Bis-GMA/TEGDMA resin reinforced with 0, 25, 50, and 75 wt% 8-mu m silanized/unsilanized BaSiO6) as used in the previous study were modeled in this study. The established finite element models were based on coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) Mismatch Phenomenon. The mechanical properties of the silane coupling agent, such as elastic modulus and thermal expansion coefficient used in the silanized model, were assumed to have optimal heat flux transfer. A third (imaginary) material was proposed to block the transfer of thermal stress between the filler and matrix in the unsilanized model. The thermal load simulation was based on steady-state thermal analysis. The results showed that: (1) The strain energy and interfacial shearing stress calculated from FEM validate the results from the previous LTAT study. (2) Comparing the stress distribution of silanized and unsilanized FEM models, the acoustic signals in LTAT study are mainly derived from debonding of the filler-matrix interface of silanized specimens, and from the matrix area of unsilanized specimens. Based on results to date. we conclude that the finite element method may be a powerful tool for exploring thermoacoustic mechanisms of dental composites. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Aggregation of amyloid-beta (A beta) peptides is a significant event that underpins Alzheimer's disease (AD). A beta aggregates, especially the low-molecular weight oligomers, are the primary toxic agents in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, there is increasing interest in understanding their formation and behaviour. In this paper, we use our previously established results on heterotypic interactions between A beta and fatty acids (FAs) to investigate off-pathway aggregation under the control of FA concentrations to develop a mathematical framework that captures the mechanism. Our framework to define and simulate the competing on- and off-pathways of A beta aggregation is based on the principles of game theory. Together with detailed simulations and biophysical experiments, our models describe the dynamics involved in the mechanisms of A beta aggregation in the presence of FAs to adopt multiple pathways. Specifically, our reduced-order computations indicate that the emergence of off- or on-pathway aggregates are tightly controlled by a narrow set of rate constants, and one could alter such parameters to populate a particular oligomeric species. These models agree with the detailed simulations and experimental data on using FA as a heterotypic partner to modulate the temporal parameters. Predicting spatio-temporal landscape along competing pathways for a given heterotypic partner such as lipids is a first step towards simulating scenarios in which the generation of specific 'conformer strains' of A beta could be predicted. This approach could be significant in deciphering the mechanisms of amyloid aggregation and strain generation, which are ubiquitously observed in many neurodegenerative diseases.

AB A rapid, simple and sensitive thin-layer chromatography (TLC) spectrodensitometric method was developed for the simultaneous determination of colchicine and probenecid in their binary mixtures. The two drugs were quantitatively separated using silica gel 60 F-254 as stationary phase and toluene-ethyl acetate-methanol-ammonia (30:20:20:0.1, v/v/v/v) as mobile phase with UV detection at 248 nm for both drugs and at 354 nm for colchicine alone. Both drugs were efficiently separated with R-f values of 0.33 +/- 0.03 and 0.60 +/- 0.03 for probenecid and colchicine, respectively. The linearity was found to be 16-320 and 120-2400 (ng/band) with quantitation limits of 17.59 and 225.82 ng/band for colchicine and probenecid, respectively, at 248 nm. At 354 nm, the linearity range of colchicine was found 16-240 ng/band with a quantitation limit of 54.03 ng/band. The experimental determination ranges were greatly extended with lower quantitation limits (15.60 and 116.13 ng/band for colchicine and probenecid, respectively at 248 nm, and 13.20 for colchicine at 354 nm) and correlation coefficients were improved when polynomial regression analysis was used. The quadratic model was found to be the best fit for all responses. The method has been validated according to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines providing good correlation coefficients (0.9997-0.9999) for both drugs, and it has been successfully applied in the determination of both drugs in their commercial dosage form without interference from excipients.

AB Liposomal formulation of curcumin is an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of various cancers. Despite extensive studies on the biological effects of this formulation in cancer treatment, much remains unknown about curcumin-liposome interactions. Understanding how different lipid bilayers respond to curcumin molecule may help us to design more effective liposomal curcumin. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulation method to investigate the behavior of curcumin in two lipid bilayers commonly used in preparation of liposomal curcumin, namely dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG). First, the free energy barriers for translocation of one curcumin molecule from water to the lipid bilayer were determined by using the potential of mean force (PMF). The computed free energy profile exhibits a global minimum at the solvent-headgroup interface (LH region) for both lipid membranes. We also evaluated the free energy difference between the equilibrium position of curcumin in the lipid bilayer and bulk water as the excess chemical potential. Our results show that curcumin has the higher affinity in DMPG compared to DPPC lipid bilayer (-8.39 vs. -1.69 k(B)T) and this is related to more hydrogen bond possibility for curcumin in DMPG lipid membrane. Next, using an unconstrained molecular dynamic simulation with curcumin initially positioned at the center of lipid bilayer, we studied various properties of each lipid bilayer system in the presence of curcumin molecule that was in full agreement with PMF and experimental data. The results of these simulation studies suggest that membrane composition could have a large effect on interaction of curcumin-lipid bilayer.

AB This article develops a heterogeneous agents-based model to examine the emergent dynamic properties of share market price formation over time, with a view on financial market stability under alternative accounting regimes. In the model, individual heterogeneous investors interact with each other and with institutional devices which are an accounting system (related to the business firm) and a price system (related to the Share Exchange). These interactions provide mechanisms for transmission through which firm-specific (accounting signal) and market-driven (aggregate price) factors can act. A baseline simulation analysis assesses the financial market stability under three alternative accounting designs, namely two kinds of historical cost accounting regime and one kind of fair-value (mark-to-market) accounting regime. The former prove to better stabilize the financial system in terms of market volatility and exuberance in perfectly balanced conditions between speculative and fundamentalist beliefs and intentions. An evolutionary analysis is then developed by varying the relative degree of speculative attitudes between the two sides of the market. Historical cost accounting regimes further prove to make the financial system more resilient to speculative waves occurring at inter-individual level. Baseline findings are further corroborated through experimental analysis in twelve artificial financial systems. This mathematical institutional economic analysis has general implications for both designing accounting systems aimed at enhancing financial market stability and preventing procyclicality, and the study of accounting information process in the formation of share market prices over time.

AB Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is omnipresent in :chemical analysis. However, chirality of a molecule can only be detected indirectly by NMR, e.g., by monitoring its interaction with another chiral object. In the present study, we investigate the spectroscopic behavior of chiral molecules placed into a chiral solvent. In this case, the solvent solute interaction is much weaker, but the application range of such NMR. analysis is wider than for,a specific chemical shift agent. Two alcohols and an amine were used as model systems, and differences in NMR chemical shifts dependent on the solute solvent chirality combination were experimentally detected. Combined quantum mechanic/molecular mechanic (QM/MM) computations were applied to reveal the underlying solute solvent interactions. NMR. shielding was calculated using the density functional theory (DFT). While the experimental observations could not be reproduced quantitatively, the modeling provided a qualitative agreement and detailed insight into the essence of solvent solute chiral interactions. The potentials of mean force (PMF) obtained using molecular dynamics (MD) and:. the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) indicate that the chiral interaction brings about differences in conformer ratios, which are to a large extent responsible for the NMR Shifts. The MD results also predicted slight changes in the solvent Structure, including the radial distribution function (RDF), to depend on the solvent/solute chirality combination. Apart from the conformer distribution, an effective average solvent electrostatic field was tested as another major factor contributing to the chiral NMR effect. The possibility to,simulate spectral effects of chiral solvents from the first-principles opens up the way to NMR spectroscopic determination of the absolute configuration for a larger scale of compounds, including those not forming specific complexes.

AB In this study, we developed a multifunctional chromatographic medium by using iminodisuccinic acid (IDS) as ligand, gamma-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (gamma-GLDP) as spacer arm and silica as matrix. The medium was characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FT-IR). Binding capacity of IDS on chromatographic medium was determined by potentiometric titration. The effect of mass ratios (w/w) between silica and IDS on the medium synthesis was discussed. The optimal ratio of matrix, spacer arm and ligand was 1.5 g: 2.0 mL: 4.6 g. Based on different chromatographic modes, protein mixtures of bovine serum albumin, ribonuclease and lysozyme were successfully separated with IDS-Silica column and IDS-Cu(II)-Silica column, respectively. To examine metal chelating behavior of IDS-Silica stationary phase, optimal geometries and related parameters of complexes formed by IDS with Fe3+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Co2+ and Ca2+ were achieved by quantum computing. The stabilities of the complexes were predicted according to the results of theoretical calculation. Sorption capacities of IDS-Silica stationary phase for metal ions were determined by using offline frontal chromatography (FC) combined with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). A good agreement was found between simulating results and experimental observations. The order of chelating strength of IDS-Silica medium for metal ions was Fe3+ > Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Zn2+ > Co2+ > Ca2+. Compared with IDA-Silica, Asp-Silica and Glu-Silica stationary phases, IDS-Silica displayed a stronger chelating property for metal ion. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We report in this article an approach for manipulating the size of magnetic nanoparticle clusters (MNCs) via electrostatic-mediated assembly technique using an electrolyte as a clustering agent. The clusters were surface-tethered with poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) through electrostatic compensation to enhance their colloidal stability. Dynamic light scattering was employed to trace the evolution of cluster size. Simultaneously, electrophoretic mobility and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses were conducted to investigate the possible schemes involved in both cluster formation and PSS grafting. Results showed that the average hydrodynamic cluster size of the PSS/MNCs and their corresponding size distributions were successfully shifted by means of manipulating the suspension pH, the ionic nature of the electrolyte, and the electrolyte concentration. More specifically, the electrokinetic behavior of the particles upon interaction with the electrolyte plays a profound role in the formation of the PSS/MNCs. Nonetheless, the solubility of the polymer in electrolyte solution and the purification of the particles from residual ions should not be omitted in determining the effectiveness of this clustering approach. The PSS adlayer makes the resultant entities highly water-dispersible and provides electrosteric stabilization to shield the PSS/MNCs from aggregation. In this study, the experimental observations were analyzed and discussed on the basis of existing fundamental colloidal theories. The strategy of cluster size manipulation proposed here is simple and convenient to implement. Furthermore, manipulating the size of the MNCs also facilitates the tuning of magnetophoresis kinetics on exposure to low magnetic field gradient, which makes this nano-entity useful for engineering applications, specifically in separation processes.

AB Due to the depletion of high-grade manganese ore, much attention has turned to recover manganese from low-grade ores; however, these are usually associated with high-iron content. Moreover, the conventional process of extracting Mn from iron-rich low grade manganese oxide ore focused on recovery of Mn, while ignoring the leaching characteristics of Fe. Hence, simultaneous investigations on leaching behavior and separation efficiency of both manganese and iron were carried out for attaining high recovery of manganese with low iron content from the high-iron low-grade pyrolusite ore using simulated flue gas as the reductant. The effects of leaching parameters, flue gas components and initial particle size on the leaching efficiency of Mn and Fe were studied, and the results indicated that higher separation efficiency of Mn from iron was achieved at lower SO2 concentration, O-2 concentration and suitable pulp density. The experimental validation revealed that 93.12% Mn and only 2.57% Fe were extracted under the optimal operating conditions: SO2 percentage of 5%, O-2 percentage of 1%, reaction temperature of 35 degrees C, solid-to-liquid ratio of 250 g/L, and more than 120 min. Kinetic modelling has indicated that the Mn leaching rate is controlled by the rate of diffusion of SO2/O-2 from the gas phase to the liquid phase, and the rate of diffusion of product or reactants to the ore surface through an inert product layer is the rate-limiting step for Fe dissolution.

AB The main objectives of this work were to construct and characterize polypropylene and adamantane (PP/ADM) nanocomposites experimentally and to identify their mechanical properties using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Samples with different contents of ADMs (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 weight percent (wt%)) were prepared using melt mixing method. It was observed that ADM nanofillers had significant effects on mechanical properties (Young's modulus) of PP nanocomposites. Furthermore an appropriate simulation model was developed to find mechanisms of dispersion and aggregation of the ADMs and to predict bulk properties of the nanocomposite. While former researches claimed that homogeneous filler dispersion exists only at the intermediate level of interfacial interaction between polymer and nanoparticle, according to results of current study entropy has substantial influence on dispersion process. In other words, entropy which controls the interfacial parameters such as how ADMs attach to the polymer chains (either by chain end or middle of the backbone), is a determining agent in dispersion and aggregation mechanism. Consequently chains entropy plays a significant role in enhancement of the nanocomposites Young's modulus. The trend of modulus alterations demonstrated that the entrance of ADMs at the chains contact point reinforced the polymer matrix and hence increased the modulus intensively. On the other hand, relative dispersion of ADMs and their small aggregates enhanced the modulus. However, ADMs aggregation caused by attaching to the joined ends, made a dramatic decline in Young's modulus. (C) 2015 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB Although the influence of many impurities on the reduction process of iron oxide has been intensively studied, the magnitude of such impurities and their mutual interactions on the total degree of reduction are still not clear. In the current study, a 2(3) factorial design was used to investigate the magnitude of manganese oxide, silicon oxide and temperature on the reduction process of iron oxide using CO gas as a reducing agent. A regression model was used to deduce a mathematical formulation to predict the influence of manganese oxide (up to 6.0 wt-%) and silicon dioxide (up to 7.5 wt-%) on the degree of reduction of simulated iron ore sinter in the temperature range 1000-1100 degrees C. The results showed that temperature has the highest positive effect, while the interaction combination of SiO2 and MnO2 showed the highest negative effect on the degree of reduction. Silicon dioxide exhibited a higher individual negative effect on the degree of reduction than manganese oxide. The mutual interaction combination of SiO2 or MnO2 with temperature has small positive effect on the degree of reduction, while the interaction combination of the all parameters (SiO2, MnO2 and temperature) exhibited a small negative effect. The results of the models were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data of reduction of simulated iron ore sinter and natural iron ore containing different percentages of manganese and silicon oxides. The program Matlab was used to carry out the required calculations.

AB In this work, a novel type of polyester urethane urea (PEUU) foam is introduced. The foam was produced by reactive foaming using a mixture of poly(1,10-decamethylene adipate) diol and poly(1,4-butylene adipate) diol, 4,4 '-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, 1,4-butanediol, diethanolamine and water as blowing agent. As determined by differential scanning calorimetry, the melting of the ester-based phases occurred at temperatures in between 25 degrees C and 61 degrees C, while the crystallization transition spread from 48 degrees C to 20 degrees C. The mechanical properties of the foam were simulated with the hyperplastic models Neo-Hookean and Ogden, whereby the latter showed a better agreement with the experimental data as evidenced by a Pearson correlation coefficient R-2 above 0.99. Once thermomechanically treated, the foam exhibited a maximum actuation of 13.7% in heating-cooling cycles under a constant external load. In turn, thermal cycling under load-free conditions resulted in an actuation of more than 10%. Good thermal insulation properties were demonstrated by thermal conductivities of 0.039 W center dot(m center dot K)(-1) in the pristine state and 0.052 W center dot(m center dot K)(-1) in a state after compression by 50%, respectively. Finally, three demonstrators were developed, which closed an aperture or opened it again simply by changing the temperature. The self-sufficient material behavior is particularly promising in the construction industry, where programmable air slots offer the prospect of a dynamic insulation system for an adaptive building envelope.

AB North Sea tight chalk oil reservoirs are well-known for their submicron pore throat sizes and heterogeneous porosity pattern that includes fractures and microfractures. The host rock of these reservoirs is extremely sensitive and can easily react with the injected fluid, which in turn adversely affects the permeability and thus injectivity. The combined effect of these parameters makes oil production in chalk reservoirs extremely difficult. A novel solvent-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method that can address these issues is investigated for the first time in the chalk reservoirs. We thouroughly investigate the oil recovery potential and dominant oil recovery mechanisms by dimethyl ether (DME)-brine injection under conditions pertinent to the North Sea tight chalk oil reservoirs. A series of systematically designed high-pressure and high-temperature flooding experiments were carried out using reservoir core and crude oil. The experimental results revealed the strong oil recovery potential of tertiary DME-brine injection with two different DME contents. Furthermore, both secondary and tertiary DME-brine injection scenarios significantly improved the oil recovery with the better performance in the secondary scenario. The results show that the dominant oil recovery mechanism is rapid and strong oil swelling is caused by the preferential partitioning of DME into the oil phase. During DME-brine injection, no indications of rock mineral dissolution and adverse effects on rock permeability were observed. This is one of the advantages of this method over CO2, CO2-water alternating gas (WAG), and alkaline injections in which the EOR agent causes calcite dissolution, wormhole formation, and scaling issues in fragile chalk reservoirs.

AB Electrospray ionization (ESI) allows the production of intact gas-phase ions from proteins in solution. Nondenaturing solvent conditions usually culminate in low ESI charge states. However, many mass spectrometric applications benefit from protein ions that are more highly charged. One way to boost protein charge is the addition of supercharging agents (SCAs) such as sulfolane or m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (m-NBA) to the aqueous solution. The supercharging mechanism remains controversial. We use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to examine how SCAs affect the behavior of ESI nanodroplets. Simulations were conducted on myoglobin in water, water/sulfolane, and water/m-NBA.Na+ ions served as surrogate charge carriers instead of H+. We focus on conditions where the protein initially adopts its native conformation. MD-generated charge states show remarkable agreement with experimental data. Droplet shrinkage is accompanied by Na+ ejection, consistent with the ion evaporation model (IEM). The droplets segregate into an outer SCA shell and an aqueous core. This core harbors protein and Na+. Unfavorable SCA solvation restricts Na+ access to the droplet surface, thereby impeding IEM ejection. Rapid water loss causes SCA enrichment, ultimately forcing all remaining Na+ to bind the protein. IEM ejection is no longer feasible after this point, such that the protein becomes supercharged by Na+ trapping. SCA-free droplets produce lower charge states because the aqueous environment ensures a higher IEM efficiency. For all scenarios examined here, proteins are released via solvent evaporation to dryness, as envisioned by the charged residue model. Our data provide the first atomistic view of the supercharging mechanism.

AB Dysfunction in cholinergic modulation has been linked to a variety of cognitive disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The important role of this neurotransmitter has been explored in a variety of experiments, yet many questions remain unanswered about the contribution of cholinergic modulation to healthy hippocampal function. To address this question, we have developed a model of CA1 pyramidal neuron that takes into consideration muscarinic receptor activation in response to changes in extracellular concentration of acetylcholine and its effects on cellular excitability and downstream intracellular calcium dynamics. This model incorporates a variety of molecular agents to accurately simulate several processes heretofore ignored in computational modeling of CA1 pyramidal neurons. These processes include the inhibition of ionic channels by phospholipid depletion along with the release of calcium from intracellular stores (i.e., the endoplasmic reticulum). This paper describes the model and the methods used to calibrate its behavior to match experimental results. The result of this work is a compartmental model with calibrated mechanisms for simulating the intracellular calcium dynamics of CA1 pyramidal cells with a focus on those related to release from calcium stores in the endoplasmic reticulum. From this model we also make various predictions for how the inhibitory and excitatory responses to cholinergic modulation vary with agonist concentration. This model expands the capabilities of CA1 pyramidal cell models through the explicit modeling of molecular interactions involved in healthy cognitive function and disease. Through this expanded model we come closer to simulating these diseases and gaining the knowledge required to develop novel treatments.

AB Background and Purpose The bronchodilator tiotropium binds not only to its main binding site on the M-3 muscarinic receptor but also to an allosteric site. Here, we have investigated the functional relevance of this allosteric binding and the potential contribution of this behaviour to interactions with long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists, as combination therapy with anticholinergic agents and beta-adrenoceptor agonists improves lung function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Experimental Approach ACh, tiotropium, and atropine binding to M-3 receptors were modelled using molecular dynamics simulations. Contractions of bovine and human tracheal smooth muscle strips were studied. Key Results Molecular dynamics simulation revealed extracellular vestibule binding of tiotropium, and not atropine, to M-3 receptors as a secondary low affinity binding site, preventing ACh entry into the orthosteric binding pocket. This resulted in a low (allosteric binding) and high (orthosteric binding) functional affinity of tiotropium in protecting against methacholine-induced contractions of airway smooth muscle, which was not observed for atropine and glycopyrrolate. Moreover, antagonism by tiotropium was insurmountable in nature. This behaviour facilitated functional interactions of tiotropium with the beta-agonist olodaterol, which synergistically enhanced bronchoprotective effects of tiotropium. This was not seen for glycopyrrolate and olodaterol or indacaterol but was mimicked by the interaction of tiotropium and forskolin, indicating no direct beta-adrenoceptor-M-3 receptor crosstalk in this effect. Conclusions and Implications We propose that tiotropium has two binding sites at the M-3 receptor that prevent ACh action, which, together with slow dissociation kinetics, may contribute to insurmountable antagonism and enhanced functional interactions with beta-adrenoceptor agonists.

AB We previously reported the results of an experimental paradigm in which tetrodotoxin (TTX) was chronically infused by miniosmotic pump into the rat suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) (Schwartz et al., 1987).  Although TTX reversibly blocked photic entrainment and overt expression of the circadian drinking rhythm, the circadian pacemaker in the SCN continued to oscillate unperturbed by the toxin, and we concluded that Na+-dependent action potentials are not a part of the SCN pacemaker's internal timekeeping mechanism.  In the research reported in the present paper, we used our paradigm to chronically infuse other agents, in order to evaluate the validity of this interpretation further.
   (1) Infusion of 50% procaine into the SCN of blinded rats resulted in a disorganized circadian drinking rhythm during the infusion, after which behavioral rhythmicity returned without apparent phase shift.  In intact rats, procaine reduced the phase-resetting action of a reversed light-dark cycle imposed during the infusion.  Thus, the effects of voltage-dependent Na+ channel blockade by a local anesthetic resemble those produced by TTX.
   (2) Infusion of high (20 mM) K+ or 100-mu-M veratridine into the SCN of blinded rats resulted in an apparent phase advance of the circadian drinking rhythm by over 4 hr.  The phase-shifting effect of veratridine was blocked by simultaneous infusion of 1-mu-M TTX.  Thus, membrane depolarization or direct activation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels can affect the pacemaker's oscillation.  Our infusion paradigm can detect alterations of rhythm phase, and the lack of phase shift after TTX or procaine infusion is not an artifact of an insensitive method.

AB Polycarboxylate superplasticizer (PCE) and aliphatic superplasticizer (AS) are widely used water-reducing agent in concrete. In actual practice, the addition of AS has been developed as a common way to alleviate the bleeding and segregation of concrete plasticized by PCE, while the main reason for this phenomenon is not clear. In this research, the effect of AS on dispersion of PCE was investigated. Adsorption behavior of AS and PCE and conformation of these polymers in liquid phase were analyzed with total organic carbon (TOC), conductivity, and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Finally, the experimental results were verified by molecular dynamics simulation, and the dispersion model was proposed to better understand the mechanism behind. The results showed that the effects of AS on the rheological performance of cement paste containing PCE was closely related to the added dosage, and it was observed that three stages were divided according to the dosage of AS. The main reason was due to competitive adsorption between AS and PCE. In addition, PCE molecules, which existed in the liquid phase due to competitive adsorption, would be crosslinked through calcium ions in pore solution, leading to the increase in plastic viscosity of cement paste despite with the decreased yield stress. These results explained why the addition of AS in PCE system could enhance the resistance to bleeding and segregation. These results would offer usefully experience for the application of multiple superplasticizer systems in practical engineering. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Contrast Agent Response to Chirp Reversal: Simulations, Optical
   Observations, and Acoustical Verification
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ULTRASONICS FERROELECTRICS AND FREQUENCY CONTROL
LA English
DT Article
ID ULTRASOUND; EXCITATION; SYSTEM
AB Active response of a microbubble is characterized by its resonance behavior where the microbubble might oscillate after the excitation waveform has been turned off. We investigate in this paper all excitation approach based on this resonance phenomenon using chirps. The technique, called chirp reversal, consists in transmitting a first excitation signal, the up-sweep chirp (UPF) of increasing frequency with time, and a second excitation signal, the down-sweep (DNF) that is a replica of the first signal, but time reversed with a sweep of decreasing frequency with time. Simulations using a modified Rayleigh-Plesset equation were carried out to determine bubble response to chirp reversal. In addition, optical observations and acoustical measurements were carried out to corroborate the theoretical findings. Results of simulations show differences between bubbles' oscillations in response to up-sweep and down-sweep chirps mainly for transmitted center frequencies above the bubble's resonance frequency. Bubbles that are at resonance or far away from resonance engender identical responses. From the optical data, the larger bubbles showed different dynamics when up-sweep or down-sweep chirps were transmitted. Smaller bubbles (< 2 mu m diameter) appear to be less sensitive to frequency sweep at 1.7 MHz center frequency. However, driven at a higher center frequency, smaller bubbles tend to be more sensitive. These results were confirmed through the acoustical measurements.
   We concluded that simulations and experimental data show that significant differences might be observed between bubbles' responses to UPF and DNF chirps. We demonstrate in this study that, for an optimal use of chirp reversal, the transmit frequency should be higher than the resonance frequency of the contrast microbubbles.

AB The structure and reactivity of electrosprayed protein ions is governed by their net charge. Native proteins in non-denaturing aqueous solutions produce low charge states. More highly charged ions are formed when electrospraying proteins that are unfolded and/or exposed to organic supercharging agents. Numerous studies have explored the electrospray process under these various conditions. One phenomenon that has received surprisingly little attention is the charge enhancement caused by multivalent metal ions such as La3+ when electrospraying proteins out of non-denaturing solutions. Here, we conducted mass spectrometry and ion mobility spectrometry experiments, in combination with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, to uncover the mechanistic basis of this charge enhancement. MD simulations of aqueous ESI droplets reproduced the experimental observation that La3+ boosts protein charge states relative to monovalent metals (e.g., Na+). The simulations showed that gaseous proteins were released by solvent evaporation to dryness, consistent with the charged residue model. Metal ion ejection kept the shrinking droplets close to the Rayleigh limit until similar to 99% of the solvent had left. For droplets charged with Na+, metal adduction during the final stage of solvent evaporation produced low protein charge states. Droplets containing La3+ showed a very different behavior. The trivalent nature of La3+ favored adduction to the protein at a very early stage, when most of the solvent had not evaporated yet. This irreversible binding via multidentate contacts suppressed La3+ ejection from the vanishing droplets, such that the resulting gaseous proteins carried significantly more charge. Our results illustrate that MD simulations are suitable for uncovering intricate aspects of electrospray mechanisms, paving the way toward an atomistic understanding of mass spectrometry based analytical workflows.

TI Slagging Behavior of wood ash under entrained-flow gasification
   conditions
SO ENERGY & FUELS
LA English
DT Article
ID VISCOSITY; SLAGS
AB The overall objective of the work described in this paper was to determine the behavior of wood ash under entrained-flow gasification conditions. Experimental work in atmospheric and pressurized entrained-flow gasification simulators, combined with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations, has shown that wood ash is not prone to form a molten slag at typical operating conditions of (pressurized, dry-feed, oxygen-blown) entrained-flow gasifiers, in spite of the presence of a relatively high amount of low-melting alkaline elements. This appears mostly due to the formation of mainly high-temperature-melting compounds (e.g., CaO) and only a small fraction of Ca silicates, which are characterized by a lower melting temperature. Phosphor and silicon may contribute to creating a higher melt amount, whereas low-melting alkali metal compounds are mostly partitioned into the vapor phase. Experiments, as well as modeling work performed for three types of wood, have shown consistent results. Addition of a fluxing agent is a promising option to improve the slagging behavior of wood-based systems by reducing the melting point of the slag. Moreover, thermodynamic calculations have shown that slag recycle may represent a feasible option in order to obtain sufficient slag coverage of the refractory wall despite the low ash content of woody fuels (typically I order of magnitude lower than in coal). In the present work, the determination of slag viscosity, a parameter critical for continuous operation of a slagging gasifier, has been addressed as well. The results of modeling work, showing the inapplicability of predictive formulas developed in the past for coal slags to wood-based slags, underline that further work is required to allow for a quantitative assessment of the slag viscosity as a function of slag composition and temperature.

AB A facile and fast aqueous phase-based strategy to synthesize silver-polyaniline-polyvinylpyrrolidone (Ag-PANI-PVP) nanocomposites, via chemical oxidative polymerization method is presented. In the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), which has an accelerating effect on the oxidation of aniline with silver nitrate, Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) were in situ generated in aqueous solution during simultaneous formation of polyaniline (PANI), without any additional reducing agent or complicated treatment. We have demonstrated synthesis of three stabile Ag-PANI-PVP nanocomposites with different content, size, and morphology of Ag nanoparticles by varying the experimental parameters, such as pH and PVP concentration. As a result, this led to different Ag nanostructures (spherical and polyhedral NPs), and, consequently, different morphology of formed nanocomposites (granular and nanosheets). The physicochemical properties of nanocomposites were examined by using different analytical techniques (UV-Vis, TEM, FESEM, FT-IR, XRD, and Raman). It is found that optical properties, electrical conductivity and the content of Ag in the composites vary depending on the synthetic conditions. The electrocatalytic behavior of Ag-PANI-PVP nanocomposites was examined towards the oxygen reduction reaction in acidic and alkaline media. All tested nanocomposites showed high electrocatalytic activity, while the most active catalyst is the one with the highest electrical conductivity (approximate to 0.6 S cm(-1)) and the lowest Ag content (3.4 wt%), synthesized in the solution without added acid. The simplicity of synthesis and good electrocatalytic efficiency of prepared nanocomposites combined with large-scale availability make them attractive as Pt-free electrocatalysts.

AB The battle against cancer has intensified in the last decade. New experimental techniques and theoretical models have been been proposed to understand the behavior, growth, and evolution of different types of brain tumors. Unfortunately, for glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM), except for methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT) promoter that has some benefit in the local control of tumors using alkylating agents such as temozolomide, to date personalized treatments do not exist. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of different aspects intertwined in the mathematical growth modeling applied to high-grade gliomas. We briefly cover the following fundamental aspects related to the conventional imaging in GBM: defining the tumor regions in GBM, segmentation of the tumor regions using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) of the brain, response assessment using the neuro-oncology response criteria versus the Macdonald criteria, availability of software for the segmentation of MRI of the brain, mathematical modeling applied to tumor growth, principles of mathematical modeling, factors involved in tumor growth models, mathematical modeling based on imaging data, most common equations used in high-grade glioma growth modeling, integration of mathematical growth models in computer simulators, tumor growth modeling as a part of brain's complex system, and challenges in mathematical growth modeling. We conclude by saying that it is the combination of biomedical imaging and mathematical modeling that allows the assembling of clinically relevant models of tumor growth and treatment response; the most appropriate model will depend on the premise and findings of each experiment.

AB In this paper, the concept of a multiscale modeling approach is highlighted with which physical phenomena at different scales can be studied. The work reports a multiscale approach to describe the dynamics of a chain of bubbles rising in non-Newtonian fluids. By means of the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation, a deep understanding of the complex flow pattern around a single bubble is gained at microscale. The interactions and coalescences between bubbles rising in non-Newtonian fluids are experimentally investigated by the PIV measurements, birefringence and rheological characterization for both an isolated bubble and a chain of bubbles formed from a submerged orifice. Two aspects are identified as central to interactions and coalescence: the stress creation by the passage of bubbles and their relaxation due to the fluid's memory. This competition between the creation and relaxation of stresses displays non-linear complex dynamics. Along with the detailed knowledge around a single bubble, these fundamental mechanisms governing bubbles' collective behavior in a train of bubbles at mesoscale lead to a cognitive modeling based on behavioral rules. By simulating bubbles as adaptive agents with the surround fluid via residual stresses, model predictions for consecutive coalescence between a great number of bubbles compare very satisfactorily with the experimental investigation at macroscale.
   Obviously this new approach captures important quantitative and qualitative features of the collective behaviors of bubbles at macroscale level which are predicted by the mesoscopic cognitive modeling approach of the interactions rules which are deduced from the understanding of the microscopic mechanism of the flow around a single bubble.

AB In many arid and semi-arid regions agriculture is the main user of GW, causing problems with the quantity and quality of water, but there are few institutional policies and regulations governing sustainable GW exploitation. The authors suggest an integrated methodology for enabling local GW management, capable of combining the need for GW protection with socio-economic and behavioural determinants of GW use. In the proposed tool, integration is reinforced by the inclusion of multiple stakeholders, and the use of Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) to simulate and explore these stakeholders' attitude to GW exploitation and their responses to the introduction of new protection policies. BBNs and hydrological system properties are integrated in a GIS-based decision support system - GeSAP - which can elaborate and analyse scenarios concerning the pressure on GW due to exploitation for irrigation, and the effectiveness of protection policies, taking into account the level of consensus. In addition, the GIS interface makes it possible to spatialize the information and to investigate model results.
   The paper presents the results of an experimental application of the GeSAP tool to support GW planning and management in the Apulia Region (Southern Italy). To evaluate the actual usability of the GeSAP tool, case study applications were performed involving the main experts in GW protection and the regional decision-makers. Results showed that GeSAP can simulate farmers' behaviour concerning the selection of water sources for irrigation, allowing evaluation of the effectiveness of a wide range of strategies which impact water demand and consumption.

AB Climate change-related increases in temperature will influence the interactions between organisms, including the infection dynamics of parasites in ecosystems. The distribution and transmission of parasites are expected to increase with warmer temperature, but to what extent this will affect closely related parasite taxa living in sympatry is currently impossible to predict, due to our extremely limited understanding of the interspecific variation in transmission potential among parasite species in changing ecosystems. Here, we analyse the transmission patterns of four trematode species from the New Zealand mudsnail Potamopyrgus antipodarum with different life cycles and transmission strategies under two temperature scenarios, simulating current and future warmer temperatures. In a comparative experimental study, we investigated the effects of temperature on the productivity, movement and survival of the parasites' transmission stages (cercariae) to quantify the net effect of temperature on their overall transmission potential. Our results show that increases in temperature positively affect cercarial transmission dynamics, yet these impacts varied considerably between the cercariae of different trematode species, depending on their host-searching behaviour. These different species-specific transmission abilities as well as the varying individual patterns of productivity, activity and longevity are likely to have far-reaching implications for disease dynamics in changing ecosystems, since increases in temperature can shift parasite community structure. Due to the parasites' capacity to regulate the functioning of whole ecological communities and their potential impact as disease agents, understanding these species-specific parasite transmission traits remains a fundamental requirement to predict parasite dynamics under changing environmental conditions.

AB To explore solutions for water plugging and reinforcement problems of water-rich and broken rock mass in underground engineering, it is necessary to study the performance of cement-based grout and its reinforcement effect. In this study, Portland cement-based grouts with high amounts (70%) of granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS) (30%) and Class C fly ash (FA) (40%) were prepared. The superplasticizer (SP) and anti-washout agent (AWA) were formulated to improve flowability and stability of single slurries. A new self-developed experimental device was designed for the grouting simulation. The fresh-state properties of cementitious single slurry i.e., flowability, mini-slump, stability, effective W/S and initial/final setting time; flexural and compressive strengths of grout stone bodies were studied. Meanwhile, the grouting reinforcement effect; mechanical performance of reinforcement sample i.e., unconfined compressive strength (UCS), failure mode, process and key parameters were evaluated. The results show that the performance and grouting effects of cement-based grouts with high amounts of GBFS and FA were generally acceptable. The addition of SP + AWA enhanced the stability and was beneficial to the grouting effectiveness especially at higher (0.8-1.2) water-solid (W/S) ratios. The diffusion or setting time of this type grout should be shortened appropriately in practice. The rupture interface and tensile fracture of grout were two main failure modes of reinforcement samples. The variations of key parameters corresponding to different failure modes were analyzed.

AB The kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation contains three neuroactive metabolites: the neuroinhibitory agent kynurenic acid (KYNA) and, in a competing branch, the free radical generator 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and the excitotoxin quinolinic acid (QUIN). These three "kynurenines" derive from a common precursor, L-kynurenine, and are recognized for their role in brain physiology and pathophysiology. Inhibition of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for 3-HK formation, shifts KID metabolism in the mature brain toward enhanced KYNA formation. We now tested the cerebral effects of kynurenine 3-hydroxylase inhibition in immature rodents. Rat pups treated with the kynurenine 3-hydroxylase inhibitor UPF 648 (30 mg/kg, i.p.) 10 min after birth showed substantial increases in cerebral and liver kynurenine and KYNA levels up to 24 hr later, whereas 3-HK and QUIN levels were simultaneously decreased. Administered to pregnant rats or mice on the last day of gestation, UPF 648 (50 mg/kg, i.p.) produced qualitatively similar changes (i.e., large increases in kynurenine and KYNA and reductions in 3-HK and QUIN) in the brain and liver of the offspring. Rat pups delivered by UPF 648-treated mothers and immediately exposed to neonatal asphyxia showed further enhanced brain KYNA levels. These studies demonstrate that acute kynurenine 3-hydroxylase inhibition effectively shifts cerebral KP metabolism in neonatal rodents toward increased KYNA formation. Selective inhibitors of this enzyme may therefore provide neuroprotection in newborns and will also be useful for the experimental evaluation of the long-term effects of perinatal KP impairment.

AB HIV-1 integrase is a unique promising component of the viral replication cycle, catalyzing the integration of reverse transcribed viral cDNA into the host cell genome. Generally, IN activity requires both viral as well as a cellular co-factor in the processing replication cycle. Among them, the human lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75) represented as promising cellular co-factor which supports the viral replication by tethering IN to the chromatin. Due to its major importance in the early steps of HIV replication, the interaction between IN and LEDGF/p75 has become a pleasing target for anti-HIV drug discovery. The present study involves the finding of novel inhibitor based on the information of dimeric CCD of IN in complex with known inhibitor, which were carried out by applying a structure-based virtual screening concept with molecular docking. Additionally, Free binding energy, ADME properties, PAINS analysis, Density Functional Theory, and Enrichment Calculations were performed on selected compounds for getting a best lead molecule. On the basis of these analyses, the current study proposes top 3 compounds: Enamine-Z742267384, Maybridge-HTS02400, and Specs-AE-848/37125099 with acceptable pharmacological properties and enhanced binding affinity to inhibit the interaction between IN and LEDGF/p75. Furthermore, Simulation studies were carried out on these molecules to expose their dynamics behavior and stability. We expect that the findings obtained here could be future therapeutic agents and may provide an outline for the experimental studies to stimulate the innovative strategy for research community.

AB Pluronics have emerged as a potential agent for solubilizing a variety of lipophilic bioactive molecules, but how these solubilizates affect the morphology of Pluronic micelles still remains poorly understood. In this work, the morphological transition of Pluronic P123 micelles induced by three gallate homologs with different alkyl chain length, namely methyl gallate (MG), propyl gallate (PG) and octyl gallate (OG) has been comprehensively investigated by combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM), H-1 NMR and atom-scale molecular dynamic simulations. It is found that addition of the three gallate significantly increases the micellar sizes and polydispersities. Cryo-TEM measurements reveal that spherical P123 micelles form micellar clusters in the presence of PG and short rod micelles with OG, while MG do not change the micellar morphology. Qualitative interactions between various gallate and P123 micelle are determined by NMR experiments. It is demonstrated that the different locations of various gallate in the micelles are governed by the balance of hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding, which consequently leads to the varying micellar morphologies. The experimental results are further confirmed by dynamic molecular stimulation. We also show that the intensity of Pluronic-gallate interaction increases with the hydrophobicity of the gallate, indicating that hydrophobic interaction is more important on the morphological transition. Finally, the mechanism of morphological transition induced by various gallate are discussed and proposed, where the nature of formation of micellar cluster induced by PG is particularly emphasized.

SO PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS

DT Article
ID NANOMETRIC ALUMINUM; COMBUSTION
AB Iodine oxide is a highly reactive solid oxidizer and with its abundant generation of iodine gas during reaction, this oxidizer also shows great potential as a biocidal agent. A problem with using I2O5 in an energetic mixture is its highly variable reactive behavior. This study isolates the variable reactivity associated with I2O5 as a function of its chemical reaction in various environments. Specifically, aluminum fuel and iodine oxide powder are combined using a carrier fluid to aid intermixing. The carrier fluid is shown to significantly affect the oxidation state of iodine oxide, thereby affecting the reactivity of the mixture. Four carrier fluids were investigated ranging in polarity and water miscibility in increasing order from hexane < acetone < isopropanol < water as well as untreated, dry-mixed reactants. Oxidation state and reactivity were examined with experimental techniques including X-ray photoelectric spectroscopy (XPS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Results are compared with thermal equilibrium simulations. Flame speeds increased with polarity of the fluid used to intermix the powder and ranged from 180 to 1202 m s(-1). The I2O5 processed in the polar fluids formed hydrated states of iodine oxide: HIO3 and HI3O8; and, the nonpolar and dry-mixed samples formed: I2O4 and I4O9. During combustion, the hydrated iodine oxides rapidly dehydrated from HIO3 to HI3O8 and from HI3O8 to I2O5. Both steps release 25% of their mass as vapor during combustion. Increased gas generation enhances convective energy transport and accounts for the increase in reactivity seen in the mixtures processed in polar fluids. These results explain the chemical mechanisms underlying the variable reactivity of I2O5 that are a function of the oxide's highly reactive nature with its surrounding environment. These results will significantly impact the selection of carrier fluid in the synthesis approach for iodine containing reactive mixtures.

AB Soluble guanylate cyclase is a heterodimer receptor that functions in several signal transduction pathways. Conversion of guanosine 5-triphosphate to 3,5-cyclic monophosphate second messenger at the catalytic domain is regulated by the changes at heme nitric oxide/oxygen domain of the -subunit. To better understand conformational changes at heme site that may impact on activities of catalytic domain, three soluble guanylate cyclase homolog proteins with heme at Fe-His state were investigated, and their dynamic behaviors were monitored in both unliganded (apo) and complex with heme. As a result of dynamic conformational changes, Lys110, Asp45, Arg135, and Glu41 were found interacting with the site gate, which may interfere with transportation of small molecules in and out of the heme site. An alternative binding site adjacent to that of heme was identified. Binding affinity of several nitric oxide-independent activators and heme-dependent stimulators was examined, and their binding modes in the heme site and in the alternative binding site in the human soluble guanylate cyclase enzyme were computationally simulated. The calculated binding energies were used as criteria to filter results of virtual high-throughput screenings based on FlexX liganddocking algorithm and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties on databases of available drugs. The identified drugs from virtual high-throughput screening have been suggested for experimental investigations, based on which they may either be directly repurposed or require structural modifications for better physico-chemical and pharmacological properties.

AB The development and assessment or a prediction method for gel retardation and sequence dependent curvature of DNA based on dinucleotide step parameters are described. The method is formulated using the Babcock-Olson equations for base pair step geometry ii) and employs Monte Carte simulated annealing for parameter optimization against experimental data. The refined base pair step parameters define a structural construct which, when the width of observed parameter distributions is taken into account, is consistent with the results of DNA oligonucleotide crystal structures. The predictive power of the method is demonstrated and rested via comparisons with DNA bending data on sets of sequences not included in the training set, including A-tracts with and without periodic helix phasing, phased A(4)T(4) and T(4)A(4) motifs, a sequence with a phased GGGCCC motif, some "unconventional" helix phasing sequences, and three short fragments of kinetoplast DNA from Crithidia fasiculata that exhibit significantly different behavior on non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The nature of the structural construct produced by the methodology is discussed with respect to static and dynamic models of structure and representations of bending and bendability. An independent theoretical account of sequence dependent chemical footprinting results is provided. Detailed analysis of sequences with A-tract induced axis bending forms the basis for a critical discussion of the applicability of wedge models, junction models and non A-tract, general sequence models for understanding the origin of DNA curvature at the molecular level.

AB Many antibiotics regarded as emerging contaminants have been frequently detected in soils and groundwater; however, their transport behaviors in soils remain largely unknown. This study examined the transport of two antibiotics, sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and ciprofloxacin (CIP), in saturated porous media. Laboratory columns packed with quartz sand was used to test the effects of solution pH and ionic strength (IS) on their retention and transport. The results showed that these two antibiotics behaved differently in the saturated sand columns. In general, SMZ manifested a much higher mobility than CIP for all experimental conditions tested. Almost all SMZ transported through the columns within one pore volume in deionized water (i.e., pH = 5.6, IS = 0), but no CIP was detected in the effluents under the same condition after extended column flushing. Perturbations in solution pH (5.6 and 9.5) and IS (0 and 0.1 M) showed no effect on SMZ transport in the saturated columns. When pH increased to 9.5, however, similar to 93% of CIP was eluted from the sand columns. Increase of IS from 0 to 0.1 M also slightly changed the distribution of adsorbed CIP within the sand column at pH 5.6, but still no CIP was detected in the effluents. A mathematical model based on advection-dispersion equation coupled with equilibrium and kinetic reactions successfully simulated the transport of the antibiotics in water-saturated porous media with R-2 = 0.99.

ID PERFORMANCE; INTERFACE; DESIGN; LEVEL
AB Background: As human spaceflight missions extend in duration and distance from Earth, a self-sufficient crew will bear far greater onboard responsibility and authority for mission success. This will increase the need for automated fault management (FM). Human factors issues in the use of such systems include maintenance of cognitive skill, situational awareness (SA), trust in automation, and workload. This study examined the human performance consequences of operator use of intelligent FM support in interaction with an autonomous, space-related, atmospheric control system. Methods: An expert system representing a model-based reasoning agent supported operators at a low level of automation (LOA) by a computerized fault finding guide, at a medium LOA by an automated diagnosis and recovery advisory, and at a high LOA by automated diagnosis and recovery implementation, subject to operator approval or veto. Ten percent of the experimental trials involved complete failure of FM support. Results: Benefits of automation were reflected in more accurate diagnoses, shorter fault identification time, and reduced subjective operator workload. Unexpectedly, fault identification times deteriorated more at the medium than at the high LOA during automation failure. Analyses of information sampling behavior showed that offloading operators from recovery implementation during reliable automation enabled operators at high LOA to engage in fault assessment activities. Conclusions. The potential threat to SA imposed by high-level automation, in which decision advisories are automatically generated, need not inevitably be counteracted by choosing a lower LOA. Instead, freeing operator cognitive resources by automatic implementation of recovery plans at a higher LOA can promote better fault comprehension, so long as the automation interface is designed, to support efficient information sampling.

TI Theory and full-scale simulation testing of the mechanical properties of

SO ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES

DE Lateral pressure coefficient (LPC); Fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor;
   Full-size anchorage; Theoretical model; True triaxial simulation
AB The mechanical behavior of the lateral pressure coefficient (LPC) of the axial stress of the anchor rod is an important factor in roadway bolt support, especially in deep mining, where the variation of the LPC is larger. In this paper, an innovative mechanical model of bolt pulling is proposed in which the influence of the LPC is considered. When the LPC is changed, the variation of the axial force along the anchor rod body is expressed by the interface normal stress of the anchoring system. In addition, a full-scale test model with a 1:1 similarity ratio was developed in the laboratory and the influence of the LPC on the deformation and stress of the anchor rod under vertical and horizontal pressure was studied by using a 2.5-m fiber Bragg grating (FBG) force-measuring anchor rod. The results demonstrate that the axial force of the bolt shows the same increasing trend under various LPC values. The theoretical solution of the bolt axial force variation value accords with the experimental data. The theoretical calculation method can effectively predict the variation distribution of the bolt axial force under various LPC changes. Increasing the LPC of the surrounding rock can effectively reduce the axial force and the deformation of the bolt under the same pulling force. The support effect of the bolt can be improved by increasing the pressure of the anchor hole and increasing the interface friction coefficient between the anchoring agent and the surrounding rock during the construction of the bolt support.

AB Objective: We investigated passenger's trust and preferences using subjective, qualitative, and psychophysiological measures while being driven either by human or automation in a field study and a driving simulator experiment. Background: The passenger's perspective has largely been neglected in autonomous driving research, although the change of roles from an active driver to a passive passenger is incontrovertible. Investigations of passenger's appraisals on self-driving vehicles often seem convoluted with active manual driving experiences instead of comparisons with being driven by humans. Method: We conducted an exploratory field study using an autonomous research vehicle (N = 11) and a follow-up experimental driving simulation (N = 24). Participants were driven on the same course by a human and an autonomous agent sitting on a passenger seat. Skin conductance, trust, and qualitative characteristics of the perceived driving situation were assessed. In addition, the effect of driving style (defensive vs. sporty) was evaluated in the simulator. Results: Both investigations revealed a close relation between subjective trust ratings and skin conductance, with increased trust and by trend reduced arousal for human compared with automation in control. Even though driving behavior was equivalent in the simulator when being driven by human and automation, passengers most preferred and trusted the human-defensive driver. Conclusion: Individual preferences for driving style and human or autonomous vehicle control influence trust and subjective driving characterizations. Application: The findings are applicable in human-automation research, reminding to not neglect subjective attributions and psychophysiological reactions as a result of ascribed control duties in relation to specific execution characteristics.

AB We studied the formation of trail patterns by Argentine ants exploring an empty arena. Using a novel imaging and analysis technique we estimated pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and at different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and changes in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response to local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by these concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over time, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant determining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990). However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations that we have established in our experiments when directional noise around the preferred direction of movement of the ants is assumed.

AB Many everyday tasks require the ability of two or more individuals to coordinate their actions with others to increase efficiency. Such an increase in efficiency can often be observed even after only very few trials. Previous work suggests that such behavioral adaptation can be explained within a probabilistic framework that integrates sensory input and prior experience. Even though higher cognitive abilities such as intention recognition have been described as probabilistic estimation depending on an internal model of the other agent, it is not clear whether much simpler daily interaction is consistent with a probabilistic framework. Here, we investigate whether the mechanisms underlying efficient coordination during manual interactions can be understood as probabilistic optimization. For this purpose we studied in several experiments a simple manual handover task concentrating on the action of the receiver. We found that the duration until the receiver reacts to the handover decreases over trials, but strongly depends on the position of the handover. We then replaced the human deliverer by different types of robots to further investigate the influence of the delivering movement on the reaction of the receiver. Durations were found to depend on movement kinematics and the robot's joint configuration. Modeling the task was based on the assumption that the receiver's decision to act is based on the accumulated evidence for a specific handover position. The evidence for this handover position is collected from observing the hand movement of the deliverer over time and, if appropriate, by integrating this sensory likelihood with prior expectation that is updated over trials. The close match of model simulations and experimental results shows that the efficiency of handover coordination can be explained by an adaptive probabilistic fusion of a-priori expectation and online estimation.

AB The ballistic impact response of thermoplastic-based composite armors made from Kevlar (R) fabric and polypropylene (PP) matrix has been investigated against ballistic test standard NU-STD 0106.01 Type IIIA. Kevlar (R) fabrics of different architectures, namely 2D plain woven, 3D orthogonal and 3D angle interlock fabrics, were produced and used as reinforcements to fabricate composite armor panels, using compression molding technology. Interfacial property between PP and Kevlar (R) was improved by adding a coupling agent called maleic anhydride grafted PP. Reduced density was observed in Kevlar (R) thermoplastic based composites as compared to that of the thermoset-based laminates. Ballistic impact tests were imparted with 9 mm full metal jacket (FMJ) on armor panels having different fabric architecture. Ballistic test results revealed that 2D armor was 2.4-7% more susceptible to damage than 3D armors. Hydrocode simulations were carried out using ANSYS AUTODYN v. 14.0 to obtain an estimate for the ballistic limit velocity and simulate failure modes. Post-impact damage patterns obtained from the simulations were compared with the experimental results to assess the performance of the simulations. Good correlation between the hydrocode simulations and experiments was found, both in terms of failure modes and damage patterns. 3D composite armors were able to confront the 9 mm FMJ projectile; however, the 2D plain woven armors failed.

AB A convenient synthesis under ultrasound (US) irradiation of 4-thiazolidinone, thiazole, dihydrothiazole, and thiazine hybrid compounds containing quinoline and indole nucleus is described. All the title compounds were characterized by NMR and HRMS. The synthetic protocol affords highly selective conversions, short reaction times, simple work-up procedures, and good yields compared with conventional methods. All the synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro cytotoxic activity against glioblastoma (SF-295), leukemia (HL-60), and prostate cancer (PC-3) cell lines. Three compounds (4c-e) presented moderate to high activity against all cancer cell lines evaluated. Compound 4c stood out with its promising cytotoxicity activity against the HL-60 cell line with an IC50 value of 2.41 mu M and an SI of 10.5. The electrochemical behavior of 4c was studied using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) on a glassy carbon electrode modified with dsDNA and with ssDNA in the solution. As a result, the pre-concentration of the compound on the dsDNA biosensor surface and modification of the oxidation currents of guanosine and adenosine bases in ssDNA experiments demonstrated an interaction between 4c and DNA. The affinity of 4c was evaluated against ctDNA by exploring spectroscopic techniques, showing that this compound acts preferentially as a groove binder. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations proposed that 4c interacts via groove binding and intercalation, corroborating the experimental results. The dominating interactions were conventional hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. Finally, our findings suggest the 4c derivative to be a potential anticancer prototype against HL-60.

AB The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and deaths caused by it all over the world have imposed great concern on the scientific community to develop potential drugs to combat Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). In this regard, lichen metabolites may offer a vast reservoir for the discovery of antiviral drug candidates. Therefore, to find novel compounds against COVID-19, we created a library of 412 lichen compounds and subjected to virtual screening against the SARS-CoV-2 Main protease (Mpro). All the ligands were virtually screened, and 27 compounds were found to have high affinity with Mpro. These compounds were assessed for drug-likeness analysis where two compounds were found to fit well for redocking studies. Molecular docking, drug-likeness, X-Score, and toxicity analysis resulting in two lichen compounds, Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid with Mpro-inhibiting activity. These compounds were finally subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to compare the dynamics behavior and stability of the Mpro after ligand binding. The binding energy was calculated by MM-PBSA method to determine the intermolecular protein-ligand interactions. Our results showed that two compounds; Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid had the binding free energy of - 42.42 kJ mol/1 and - 57.85 kJ mol/1 respectively as compared to reference X77 (- 91.78 kJ mol/1). We concluded that Calycin and Rhizocarpic acid show considerable structural and pharmacological properties and they can be used as hit compounds to develop potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2. These lichen compounds may be a suitable candidate for further experimental analysis.

TI An Efficient Fraud Identification Method Combining Manifold Learning and

ID FRAMEWORK
AB With the development of mobile Internet, various mobile applications have become increasingly popular. Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients' medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims. However, because of the complex granularity of medical data, existing fraud detection approaches tend to be less effective in terms of monitoring the healthcare services process. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with these problems. By means of the proposed SSIsomap activity clustering method, SimLOF outlier detection method, and the Dempster-Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method, our approach is able to detect unusual categories and frequencies of behaviors simultaneously. Our approach is applied to a real-world data set containing more than 40 million medical insurance claim activities from over 40 000 users. Compared with two state-of-the-art approaches, the extensive experimental results show that our approach is significantly more effective and efficient. Our approach agent which provides decision support for the approval sender during the medical insurance claim approval process is undergoing trial in mobile healthcare services.

AB Activation, inactivation, and desensitization are key features of ion channel behavior. We endeavor to understand these processes at the level of the single molecules and extrapolate from such microscopic models the behavior of ion channels in contexts of cellular physiology and therapeutics. In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, such as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), it is also important to consider the nature of the dynamic changes in the chemical stimulus required for activation. The amplitude and time course of the agonist pulse provided to nAChR at a fast synapse will be vastly different from those of the ACh stimulus presented to presynaptic receptors in the brain and neither of these physiological processes will resemble the stimuli presented by nicotine self-administration or with systemic delivery of a therapeutic agent. Likewise, specific experimental protocols will provide unique stimulus profiles, which will impact the relationship between the macroscopic data and the underlying molecular processes. In this work, ion channel simulations intended to model heteromeric neuronal nAChR are conducted under varying conditions of agonist presentation, and the impact of a key microscopic process, desensitization, is studied on the macroscopic responses. With instantaneous jumps in agonist concentrations, the microscopic desensitization rate impacts essentially all aspects of the macroscopic responses, rise rates, decay rates, and both peak and steady-state currents. In contrast, with an agonist pulse like that used in Xenopus oocyte experiments, microscopic desensitization rates have a profound impact on peak current amplitude and very little effect on the kinetics of the macroscopic responses.

AB Identifying the unknown chemical weapons is an important work for maintaining social security, and it can guide the chemical weapons destruction. Prompt gamma-ray neutron activation analysis (PGNAA) technology has the advantages of being non-destructive and rapid. In this research, the device was designed for identifying the chemical weapons based on PGNAA technology, and logic-tree-based discrimination method was employed to conduct qualitative analysis on samples. Firstly, with the high purity germanium (HPGe) detector and Cf-252 neutron source as the core instruments, the structures of device were optimized using the Monte Carlo MCNP code, including neutron source moderator, the thickness of the shielding body, and the relative position of the detector. To maximize the characteristic gamma ray generated by sample activation, it is necessary to increase the thermal neutron flux in the sample. In this research, polyethylene is used as moderator to increase the scattering of neutrons before the sample, so that more neutrons are thermalized. The simulation results showed that the thermal neutron flux in the sample reaches a high level when the polyethylene has a thickness of 6 cm and a width of 12 cm. In order to reduce the interference of the surrounding material activation noise, lead is selected as the shielding structure. And the simulation showed that it can meet the shielding requirement when the lead shielding thickness reaches 5 cm. At the same time, the distance between the detector and the sample also affects the detection of gamma rays. The final simulation determines that the distance between the detector and the sample is 28 cm, and the characteristic signal count is the highest. According to the optimization results, the experimental device was set up. And the simulated samples of chemical weapon were prepared according to the actual elements by using the analytical pure reagent, and the gamma spectrum was obtained by measuring the five samples. In the process of analyzing the characteristic peaks in the spectrum, the elements were analyzed based on the characteristic peaks of the elements. The elements with well statistic were analyzed by using gauss and polynomial fitting (such as H, Cl, S). The high-energy Compton platform at the characteristic peak was deducted to obtain the full peak information. For the element characteristic peak with poor statistic (such as 10.829 MeV of the N element), the energy interval summation method was used to sum the counts between the full peaks and the single escape energy peaks, so we can get the information of the elements in the sample. Finally, the logic-tree-based discrimination method was used for sample identification. The analysis results showed that the information of H, Cl, S, N and other elements in the simulated samples of chemical weapons can be obtained by using the spectrum fitting method. And the type of simulated samples of chemical weapon can be identified by combining logic-tree-based discrimination method.

AB Lutein is a bioactive found in dark leafy vegetables that may be used as a nutraceutical agent in foodstuff and an inhibitor of key enzymes of the human body such as those involved in the cholinergic system. However, its high hydrophobicity leads to low bioavailability and must be overcome if lutein is to be added in foods. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of nanoencapsulated lutein in the activity of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme. The in vitro study was carried out using water in order to evaluate the impact of encapsulation on the hydrophilicity of lutein. In vitro assays showed that lutein, both free and nanoencapsulated, presented a mixedtype inhibition behavior, and encapsulated lutein was able to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity even in an aqueous medium. Inhibition was also showed by the in silico docking results which show that lutein interacted with the pocket region of the enzyme.

AB This paper presents a complete set of coupled equations that govern the bubble transport in three-dimensional gravity-driven flow. The model accounts for bubble growth or shrinkage due to pressure and temperature changes as well as for multiple gas diffusion in and out of the bubbles but neglects bubble coalescence, break-up, and nucleation. The model applies to glass melting furnaces but it could be extended to other two-phase flow applications such as metal and polymer processing, passive cooling systems, and two-phase flow around naval surface ships. Governing equations are given for the key variables which are, in the present case, (1) the refining agent concentration, (2) the gas species dissolved in the liquid phase, and (3) the bubble radius, gas molar fraction, and density function. The method of solution based on the backward method of characteristics is briefly discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Epithelial cell monolayers show remarkable displacement and velocity correlations over distances of ten or more cell sizes that are reminiscent of supercooled liquids and active nematics. We show that many observed features can be described within the framework of dense active matter, and argue that persistent uncoordinated cell motility coupled to the collective elastic modes of the cell sheet is sufficient to produce swirl-like correlations. We obtain this result using both continuum active linear elasticity and a normal modes formalism, and validate analytical predictions with numerical simulations of two agent-based cell models, soft elastic particles and the self-propelled Voronoi model together with in-vitro experiments of confluent corneal epithelial cell sheets. Simulations and normal mode analysis perfectly match when tissue-level reorganisation occurs on times longer than the persistence time of cell motility. Our analytical model quantitatively matches measured velocity correlation functions over more than a decade with a single fitting parameter.

AB We study a Cucker-Smale-type system with time delay in which agents interact with each other through normalized communication weights. We construct a Lyapunov functional for the system and provide sufficient conditions for asymptotic flocking, i.e., convergence to a common velocity vector. We also carry out a rigorous limit passage to the mean-field limit of the particle system as the number of particles tends to infinity. For the resulting Vlasov-type equation we prove the existence, stability and large-time behavior of measure-valued solutions. This is, to our best knowledge, the first such result for a Vlasov-type equation with time delay. We also present numerical simulations of the discrete system with few particles that provide further insights into the flocking and oscillatory behaviors of the particle velocities depending on the size of the time delay.

AB Nanoparticles are used in a wide variety of fields due to their many advantages in different industries, but knowledge about the genotoxic potential of nanoparticles is rather limited. It is known that genetic changes such as mutation, recombination, and DNA damage that occur in organisms are related to many diseases. Therefore, it is very important to determine such effects of nanomaterials. Ascorbic acid (AA), one of the water-soluble antioxidant micronutrients, can be found in many vegetables and fruits and acts as a cancer preventive agent by protecting cells against oxidative damage. In this study, the genotoxic effects of cobalt nano particles (CoNP, 50nm) and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and the antigenotoxic effect of AA against them were examined by means of both the Somatic Mutation and Combination Test (SMART) and the Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis Test (COMET) on Drosophila melanogaster. The SMART method is a fast, reliable, and economical in vivo test method based on the loss of heterozygosity genetic changes (point mutation, deletion, non-separation, and recombination) occurring in the wing imaginal disc cells. The alkaline COMET assay is a sensitive and fast technique for the detection of single-strand DNA breaks. In this study, both preliminary and concurrent applications were performed in the SMART method. It is seen that the damage induced by CoCl2 and CoNPs in the pretreated group is higher than in the simultaneous application. On the other hand, simultaneous applications were made in the COMET study, and it was observed that AA decreased the genotoxicity with statistical significance.

AB A spectrophotometric method for the simultaneous determination of Al(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) using Alizarin Red S as a chelating agent was developed. The parameters controlling the behavior of the system were investigated and optimum conditions were selected. The presence of non-linearities was checked using Mallows augmented partial residual plots. To take into account these non-linearities, a principal component analysis-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (PC-ANFISs) method was used for the analysis of ternary mixtures of Al(III), Co(II) and Ni(II) over the range of 0.05-0.90, 0.05-4.05 and 0.05-0.95 mu g mL(-1), respectively. Absorbance data were collected between 370 and 700 nm. The method was applied to accurately and simultaneously determines the content of metal ions in several synthetic mixtures.

AB This paper reports on methods and implementations related to structured feedback of process data to increase the availability of reliable process knowledge in small batch manufacturing environments. The presented approach aims at acquiring process data in computerised numerical controls (CNCs) and simulation environments depending on the respective machining situation in actual machining or derived from simulated machine behaviour to increase data availability, identify systematic effects and improve machine tool models. Based on a characterisation of process data sources and architectures of commercial CNCs, a uniform approach to extend the process chain for CNC manufacturing is presented. It relies on the development of CNC-integrated algorithms, communication interfaces and a STEP-NC-based information model. Approaches to utilise the developed infrastructure for machine tool selection and process parameterisation in small batch manufacturing processes are illustrated. The system is implemented for two different CNCs, one with open NC kernel and another with a comprehensive high-level PLC interface.

ID MULTIGRID MODEL; FORCE MODEL; DYNAMICS; EVACUATION
AB In most existing pedestrian dynamic models, agents are modeled as sliding or jumping objects. As a kind of bipedal creature, however, this assumption makes it difficult to include some important human walking characteristics in the models, such as the periodicity of stepping, the adjustment of step frequency and step length, and the change of personal space within the same step cycle. To take these characteristics into consideration, a "biped model" is developed to simulate pedestrian locomotion by physical step rather than by time step. The model consists of two components: the stepping simulator and the adjustment of velocity for each step. Simulation results show that the velocity-density relations are consistent with the empirical data. Stable stop-and -go waves are simulated with a critical density. Furthermore, with the considering of biped movement, the lock-step phenomenon is reproduced. The model provides new possibilities to study crowd behavior while considering personal bipedal mechanics.

AB Many scholars have devoted to study how to improve the level of cooperation and amount of mechanisms have been presented. However, what makes cooperation sustainable? Village Opera is a kind of public cultural activities in southern China and has been on until now. It is a good example that cooperation can maintain a long time and the pattern of Village Opera is similar to public goods game(PGG). So we investigate Village Opera by PGG. To better understand the process of evolution in Village Opera, we introduce three types of agents into our spatial PGG. Through numerical simulations, we find We find that reputation can promote cooperation and reputation is influenced by habitual preference(beta). Moreover, the key is that demand or tradition can maintain the cooperation level when reputation is disappear in Village Opera. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DT Article
DE robotics; emotions; reinforcement learning
AB The adaptive value of emotions in nature indicates that they might also be useful in artificial creatures. Experiments were carried out to investigate this hypothesis in a simulated learning robot. For this purpose, a non-symbolic emotion model was developed that takes the form of a recurrent artificial neural network where emotions both depend on and influence the perception of the state of the world. This emotion model was integrated in a reinforcement-learning architecture with three different roles: influencing perception, providing reinforcement value, and determining when to reevaluate decisions. Experiments to test and compare this emotion-dependent architecture with a more conventional architecture were done in the context of a solitary learning robot performing a survival task. This research led to the conclusion that artificial emotions are a useful construct to have in the domain of behavior-based autonomous agents with multiple goals and faced with an unstructured environment, because they provide a unifying way to tackle different issues of control, analogous to natural systems' emotions.

TI Consensus reaching in swarms ruled by a hybrid metric-topological

ID SHAPE; BEHAVIOR; FISH
AB Recent empirical observations of three-dimensional bird flocks and human crowds have challenged the long-prevailing assumption that a metric interaction distance rules swarming behaviors. In some cases, individual agents are found to be engaged in local information exchanges with a fixed number of neighbors, i.e. a topological interaction. However, complex system dynamics based on pure metric or pure topological distances both face physical inconsistencies in low and high density situations. Here, we propose a hybrid metric-topological interaction distance overcoming these issues and enabling a real-life implementation in artificial robotic swarms. We use network-and graph-theoretic approaches combined with a dynamical model of locally interacting self-propelled particles to study the consensus reaching process for a swarm ruled by this hybrid interaction distance. Specifically, we establish exactly the probability of reaching consensus in the absence of noise. In addition, simulations of swarms of self-propelled particles are carried out to assess the influence of the hybrid distance and noise.

AB The paper represents an initial effort to shed light on the determinants of the implied volatility smile in financial (derivative) markets. It fully details the implications of the institutionalization of the Black-Scholes model in an uncertain world populated by individuals who are bounded by the amount of calculation or accounting which is technically possible. Combining model simulations, empirical analysis, and mathematical derivations, the paper proposes that the determinants of the volatility smile might be related to the behavior of traders. In pricing options, they use the widely accepted Black-Scholes formula with a measure of stock volatility that they derive from their subjective beliefs. Moreover, heterogeneity of traders' beliefs and the way traders update their expectations have nontrivial effects, both on equilibrium prices and on the emergence of the implied volatility smile.

AB To blend and process different high molar mass polymers into multiphase materials, predicting/controlling their morphology and rheological behavior is paramount. Herein, a segmental repulsive potential within the dissipative particle dynamics framework is applied between the polymer bonds in a multiphase scenario to mimic entanglements and address shear flow and relaxation behaviors of blends presenting reptational polymer chain diffusion. More realistic and viscoelastic polymer rheological behavior is recovered and morphological changes upon relaxation can be traced to the relaxation of normal stress. This structure-property relationship applies to both the flow-induced blend microstructure that becomes kinetically trapped by Janus/homogeneous nanorods and blends without any stabilizing agents. By computationally bridging the interfacial microstructure with the rheological behavior of long polymer chains, very sophisticated multiphase nanomaterials could be designed cost-effectively in the future from a mesoscale perspective.

AB In recent years, bead foaming technology has been of great interest to researchers because it represents a breakthrough in the production of low density plastic foamed components that have a complex geometrical structure. This helps to expand the market for plastic foams by broadening their applications. Despite earlier, valuable studies on the characterization and manufacture of bead foams, there has been little investigation of the critical parameters in the foamed bead manufacturing process. To provide an insight into the mechanism behind bead foaming technology, a lab-scale autoclave system for foamed bead manufacturing is developed and the critical processing parameters were studied. Foamed beads were obtained under various processing conditions with this lab-scale system while using carbon dioxide as the blowing agent. The cellular morphology and melting/crystallization behaviours of the beads are examined and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background Topotecan is a chemotherapeutic agent that is active against many pediatric tumors. Although its effect is related to systemic exposure, the interpatient variability in systemic clearance makes it challenging to achieve desired topotecan targets. This study aims to evaluate the success of the pharmacokinetically (PK) guided dosing process, which was used to achieve a target topotecan area under the concentration-time curve (AUC). Methods Patients received an empiric topotecan dosage on the first day; the topotecan lactone AUC was determined, and based upon these values the topotecan dosage was adjusted. The success rates of both the empiric and PK-guided strategies were calculated. Patient-specific covariates were collected to explain variability observed in the empiric and PK-guided results. A simulation study was performed to assess the differences in cumulative topotecan dosage and systemic exposure between a PK-guided and standard dosing approach. Results Data were collected from nine clinical trials open from 1996 to 2016 (n = 232 patients). The empiric dosing success rate was 35.5%, while the PK-guided rate was 64.4%. A difference in mean serum creatinine was observed between successful empiric studies and those above the AUC target. Compared to a standard dosing approach, the PK-guided group had a higher average cumulative dosage and systemic exposure. Conclusion The low empiric dosing success rate indicates that additional studies are needed to refine the initial topotecan dosage. The role of renal function, measured as serum creatinine, remains to be elucidated. However, the PK-guided targeting success rate highlighted the need to account for variable topotecan systemic clearance.

AB We consider an extension of a binary decision model in which nodes make decisions based on influence-biased averages of their neighbors' states, similar to Ising spin glasses with on-site random fields. In the limit where these influences become very heavy-tailed, the behavior of the model dramatically changes. On complete graphs, or graphs where nodes with large influence have large degree, this model is characterized by a new 'phase' with an unpredictable number of macroscopic shocks, with no associated critical phenomena. On random graphs where the degree of the most influential nodes is small compared to population size, a predictable 'glassy' phase without phase transitions emerges. Analytic results about both of these new phases are obtainable in limiting cases. We use numerical simulations to explore the model for more general scenarios. The phases associated with very influential decision makers are easily distinguishable experimentally from a homogeneous influence phase in many circumstances, in the context of our simple model.

AB In this work we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations to benchmark empirical potentials for the interaction between nickel and sp(2) bonded carbon nanoparticles. These potentials are then used in order to investigate how Ni decorated or coated carbon nanotubes (CNT) affect the mechanical properties of Al/CNT composites. In particular we look at the pull-out behaviour of pristine as well as Ni-decorated and Ni-coated CNT from an Al matrix. Our result shows that Ni coating may produce an extended interface ("interphase") where a significant amount of energy is dissipated during CNT pull-out, leading to a high pull-out force. We also demonstrate that surface decorated CNT may act as efficient nano-crystallization agents and thus provide a novel strengthening mechanism not previously discussed in the literature. We discuss our results in view of promising approaches for engineering CNT-metal interfaces such as to achieve high strength metal-CNT composites.

AB This article briefly reviews recent advances in nano-scale and micro-scale assessments of primary cell wall structure, mechanical behaviors and expansive growth. Cellulose microfibrils have hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces which may selectively bind different matrix polysaccharides and adjacent microfibrils. These distinctive binding interactions may guide partially aligned cellulose microfibrils in primary cell walls to form a planar, load-bearing network within each lamella of polylamellate walls. Consideration of expansive growth of cross-lamellate walls leads to a surprising inference: side-by-side sliding of microfibrils may be a key rate-limiting physical step, potentially targeted by specific wall loosening agents. Atomic force microscopy shows different patterns of microfibril movement during force-driven extension versus enzymatic loosening. Consequently, simulations of cell growth as elastic deformation of isotropic cell walls may need to be augmented to incorporate the distinctive behavior of growing cell walls.

AB The effect of time, composition and structure-directing agents on the synthesis of silicalite-1 and octadecasil zeolite millimeter-sized crystals has been studied. Crystals up to about 3 mm size range were obtained and special attention was paid to their aspect ratio, thermal behavior, monocrystallinity and textural properties by means of electronic and optical microscopy, powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry and Ar adsorption. For the silicalite-1 crystals obtained after 34 days of hydrothermal synthesis, more than one thousand specimens from two repeated batches were measured along a, b and c axes. Reproducibility was thus assessed simultaneously with a statistical analysis to obtain cumulative and differential distributions of crystal dimensions. Single-crystal XRD evidenced a high degree of monocrystallinity, while thermal analyses suggested that crystals with sizes above 125 mu m have serious difficulties in activation, giving rise to high external specific surface area values upon Ar adsorption.

AB How to understand the dynamical consensus patterns in network systems is of particular significance in both theories and applications. In this paper, we are interested in investigating the influences of distributed processing delay on the consensus patterns in a network model. As new observations, we show that the desired network model undergoes both weak consensus and periodic consensus behaviors when the parameters reach a threshold value and the connectedness of the network system may be absent. In results, some criterions of weak consensus and periodic consensus with exponential convergent rate are established by the standard functional differential equations analysis. An analytic formula is given to calculate the asymptotic periodic consensus in terms of model parameters and the initial time interval. Also, we post the threshold values for some typical distributions included uniform distribution and Gamma distribution. Finally, we give the numerical simulation and analyse the influences of different delays on the consensus.

TI Formation of vocabularies in a decentralized graph-based approach to
   human language
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
AB Zipf's law establishes a scaling behavior for word frequencies in large text corpora. The appearance of Zipfian properties in vocabularies (viewed as an intermediate phase between referentially useless one-word systems and one-to-one word-meaning vocabularies) has been previously explained as an optimization problem for the interests of speakers and hearers. Remarkably, humanlike vocabularies can be viewed also as bipartite graphs. Thus, the aim here is double: within a bipartite-graph approach to human vocabularies, to propose a decentralized language game model for the formation of Zipfian properties. To do this, we define a language game in which a population of artificial agents is involved in idealized linguistic interactions. Numerical simulations show the appearance of a drastic transition from an initially disordered state towards three kinds of vocabularies. Our results open ways to study Zipfian properties in language, reconciling models seeing communication as a global minima of information entropic energies and models focused on self-organization.

AB Magnetohydrodynamic flow of Sisko liquid over a stretching surface is addressed. Stretching property of sheet is the main agent for fluid flow. Heat transfer is modelled by convective condition. Homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions are also attended. Ordinary differential systems are acquired by using proper transformations. The resulting non-linear system is solved via ND solve shooting technique. Graphs are interpreted to examine the behavior of sundry embedded parameters on temperature and concentration profiles. Also surface drag forces and heat transfer rate are inspected for the impact of numerous pertinent variables. It is revealed that increasing magnetic parameter diminishes the temperature profile. Further for higher values of homogeneous reaction parameter the surface concentration reduces. In addition the verification of present results is achieved by developing comparison with already existing work. The results are found in an excellent agreement.

AB The Vicsek model is a prototype for the emergence of collective motion. In free space, it is characterized by a swarm of particles all moving in the same direction. Since this dynamic does not include attraction among particles, the swarm, while aligning in velocity space, has no spatial coherence. Adding specular reflection at the boundaries generates global spatial coherence of the swarms while maintaining its velocity alignment. We investigate numerically how the geometry of the domain influences the Vicsek model using three type of geometry: a channel, a disk and a rectangle. Varying the parameters of the Vicsek model (e.g. noise levels and influence horizons), we discuss the mechanisms that generate spatial coherence and show how they create new dynamical solutions of the swarming motions in these geometries. Several observables are introduced to characterize the simulated patterns (e.g. mass profile, center of mass, connectivity of the swarm). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Based on a cognitive notion of neo-additive capacities reflecting likelihood insensitivity with respect to survival chances, we construct a Choquet Bayesian learning model over the life-cycle that generates a motivational notion of neo-additive survival beliefs expressing ambiguity attitudes. We embed these neo-additive survival beliefs as decision weights in a Choquet expected utility life-cycle consumption model and calibrate it with data on subjective survival beliefs from the Health and Retirement Study. Our quantitative analysis shows that agents with calibrated neo-additive survival beliefs (i) save less than originally planned, (ii) exhibit undersaving at younger ages, and (iii) hold larger amounts of assets in old age than their rational expectations counterparts who correctly assess their survival chances. Our neo-additive life-cycle model can therefore simultaneously accommodate three important empirical findings on household saving behavior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We apply tools from topological data analysis to two mathematical models inspired by biological aggregations such as bird flocks, fish schools, and insect swarms. Our data consists of numerical simulation output from the models of Vicsek and D'Orsogna. These models are dynamical systems describing the movement of agents who interact via alignment, attraction, and/or repulsion. Each simulation time frame is a point cloud in position-velocity space. We analyze the topological structure of these point clouds, interpreting the persistent homology by calculating the first few Betti numbers. These Betti numbers count connected components, topological circles, and trapped volumes present in the data. To interpret our results, we introduce a visualization that displays Betti numbers over simulation time and topological persistence scale. We compare our topological results to order parameters typically used to quantify the global behavior of aggregations, such as polarization and angular momentum. The topological calculations reveal events and structure not captured by the order parameters.

AB The aim of the paper is to understand the price dynamics generated by the interaction of traders relying on heterogeneous expectations in an asset pricing model. In the present work we propose a financial market populated by three types of agents - fundamentalists, chartists and imitators. The latter submit buying/selling orders according to different trading rules using a 2D Piecewise Linear (PWL) discontinuous map. Our contribution to the existing financial literature is twofold. First, we perform an analytical study of the model involving a 2D PWL discontinuous map, where mainly numerical results are provided by researchers, besides few exceptions. In particular, we investigate the bifurcations showed by the model and the large variety of dynamical behavior produced. Finally, we provide numerical simulations in order to highlight the interaction between traders with heterogeneous expectations that can lead to intricate bull and bear price dynamics.

AB Consumer choice behavior is crucial to supporting cleaner production and plays an essential role in low-carbon development and environmental policy-making. Therefore, combining system dynamics with an agent-based model (SD-AB), the present study explores influencing factors on both providers' and consumers' sides. Using empirical data from selected firms and a questionnaire survey of residents in China, the simulation results revealed that consumers' low-carbon awareness and income have little effect on their willingness to pay for low-carbon products. In contrast, some factors have an obvious effect on consumers' willingness to pay for low-carbon products, including the delivery speed of low-carbon products, consumers' patience and degree of satisfaction. Thus, companies that provide low-carbon products should be more focused on customer expectations and should ensure timely and efficient delivery to consumers.

AB Programming robots and other autonomous systems to interact with the world in real time is bringing into sharp focus general questions about representation, inference and understanding. These artificial agents use digital computation to interpret the data gleaned from sensors and produce decisions and actions to guide their future behaviour. In a physical system, however, finite computational resources unavoidably impose the need to approximate and make selective use of the information available to reach prompt deductions. Recent research has led to widespread adoption of the methodology of Bayesian inference, which provides the absolute framework to understand this process fully via modelling as informed, fully acknowledged approximation. The performance of modern systems has improved greatly on the heuristic methods of the early days of artificial intelligence. We discuss the general problem of real-time inference and computation, and draw on examples from recent research in computer vision and robotics: specifically visual tracking and simultaneous localization and mapping.

AB Cleft lip and palate (CLP) repair is typically performed in a staged fashion, which requires multiple instances of anesthetic exposure during a critical period of infant neurodevelopment. One solution to this concern includes the implementation of a single-stage CLP repair performed between 6 and 12 months of age. This study aimed to compare total anesthetic exposure between single-stage and staged CLP repairs. A retrospective review of unilateral CLP repairs between 2013 and 2018 conducted at a single institution was performed. Patients underwent either traditional, staged lip and palate repair, or single-stage complete cleft repair, where palate, lip, alveolus, and nasal repair was performed simultaneously. Primary endpoints included: total surgical time and total anesthetic exposure. Secondary endpoints included: excess anesthesia time, recovery room time, length of stay, and type of anesthetic administered. Two hundred twenty-five (n = 225) unilateral CLP repairs were conducted at the Loma Linda University. Detailed anesthetic data for eighty-six (n = 86) single-stage and twenty-eight (n = 28) staged operations were available. There was a statistically significant decrease in anesthetic exposure in single-stage versus staged repairs (316 minutes versus 345 minutes, P = 0.017), despite similar procedure times (260 minutes versus 246 minutes, P = 0.224). This resulted in near double excess anesthetic exposure time in the staged group (98 minutes versus 56 minutes, P < 0.001), primarily occurring during induction. This analysis suggests that single-stage CLP repair can reduce wasted time under general anesthesia and potentially reduce harmful neuronal toxicity in the developmental period in this at-risk population.

AB BackgroundScoliosis repair is a major orthopaedic surgery associated with severe post-operative pain. Ketamine and magnesium have an established efficacy as morphine-sparing agents. Our purpose was to evaluate the morphine-sparing effect of both magnesium and ketamine given simultaneously compared with ketamine alone during scoliosis surgery.
   MethodsFifty patients scheduled for posterior instrumentation were randomised in a prospective double-blind study. The Gr (K+Mg) received, after induction, an intravenous (IV) bolus of ketamine 0.2mg/kg and magnesium 50mg/kg, followed by continuous infusion of ketamine (0.15mg/kg/h) and magnesium (8mg/kg/h) until extubation. The Gr (K) received the same dose of ketamine associated with bolus and continuous infusion of normal saline. All patients received multimodal analgesia associated with IV morphine administered via patient-controlled analgesia pump. Morphine consumption, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores and occurrence of side effects were followed until 48h post-operatively. Sleep quality and patient satisfaction were also followed. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
   ResultsThe average cumulative morphine consumption was significantly lower in the Gr (K+Mg) compared with the Gr (K) at post-operative hours 4, 8, 12, 18, 30, 36 and 48. The relative difference in the post-operative morphine consumption was 29.5%: Gr (K+Mg) 51.53mg vs. Gr (K) 73.16mg. VAS scores were not statistically different between the two groups. However, qualities of sleep and satisfaction scores on the first night were significantly better in the Gr (K+Mg) (P=0.027 and P=0.016, respectively).
   ConclusionKetamine and magnesium association reduces the post-operative morphine consumption after scoliosis surgery. It seems to provide a better sleep quality and improves patient satisfaction.

AB We report the results of dynamical simulations, covering Gyr timescales, of fictitious Scattered Disk Objects as a follow-up to an earlier study. Our dynamical model is similar in that it does not include external agents like passing stars or the Galactic tide. Only the four giant planets are explicitly treated as perturbers. We analyze the random-walk behavior of the inverse semi-major axis by means of a simplified circular restricted 3-body problem as an approximate analogue. Our results concerning the role of resonant effects and the transfer efficiency into the orbital energy domain of the inner Oort Cloud are in broad agreement with the earlier papers, and we confirm the important role of external objects (with perihelia beyond Neptune's orbit) in feeding the Oort Cloud. We estimate the efficiency of this transfer to be even somewhat higher than previously found.

AB Background Anaesthesiologists work in a high stress, high consequence environment in which missed steps in preparation may lead to medical errors and potential patient harm. The preanaesthetic induction period has been identified as a time in which medical errors can occur. The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation has developed a Pre-Anesthetic Induction Patient Safety (PIPS) checklist. We conducted this study to test the effectiveness of this checklist, when embedded in our institutional Anesthesia Information Management System (AIMS), on resident performance in a simulated environment.
   Methods Using a randomised, controlled, observer-blinded design, we compared performance of anaesthesiology residents in a simulated operating room under production pressure using a checklist in completing a thorough pre-anaesthetic induction evaluation and setup with that of residents with no checklist. The checklist was embedded in the simulated operating room's electronic medical record.
   Results Data for 38 anaesthesiology residents shows a statistically significant difference in performance in pre-anaesthetic setup and evaluation as scored by blinded raters (maximum score 22 points), with the checklist group performing better by 7.8 points (p<0.01). The effects of gender and year of residency on total score were not significant. Simulation duration (time to anaesthetic agent administration) was increased significantly by the use of the checklist.
   Conclusion Required use of a pre-induction checklist improves anaesthesiology resident performance in a simulated environment. The PIPS checklist as an integrated part of a departmental AIMS warrant further investigation as a quality measure.

AB This article presents the development, simulation and validation of the uncertainty cost functions for a commercial building with climate-dependent controllable loads, located in Florida, USA. For its development, statistical data on the energy consumption of the building in 2016 were used, along with the deployment of kernel density estimator to characterize its probabilistic behavior. For validation of the uncertainty cost functions, the Monte-Carlo simulation method was used to make comparisons between the analytical results and the results obtained by the method. The cost functions found differential errors of less than 1%, compared to the Monte-Carlo simulation method. With this, there is an analytical approach to the uncertainty costs of the building that can be used in the development of optimal energy dispatches, as well as a complementary method for the probabilistic characterization of the stochastic behavior of agents in the electricity sector.

AB This paper introduces an active inference formulation of planning and navigation. It illustrates how the exploitation-exploration dilemma is dissolved by acting to minimise uncertainty (i.e. expected surprise or free energy). We use simulations of a maze problem to illustrate how agents can solve quite complicated problems using context sensitive prior preferences to form subgoals. Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour-driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world-contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location. An interesting phenomenon that emerged from the simulations was a putative distinction between 'place cells'-that fire when a subgoal is reached-and 'path cells'-that fire until a subgoal is reached.

AB Time discretization is a key modeling aspect of dynamic computer simulations. In current pedestrian motion models based on discrete events, e.g. cellular automata and the Optimal Steps Model, fixed-order sequential updates and shuffle updates are prevalent. We propose to use event-driven updates that process events in the order they occur, and thus better match natural movement. In addition, we present a parallel update with collision detection and resolution for situations where computational speed is crucial. Two simulation studies serve to demonstrate the practical impact of the choice of update scheme. Not only do density-speed relations differ, but there is a statistically significant effect on evacuation times. Fixed-order sequential and random shuffle updates with a short update period come close to event-driven updates. The parallel update scheme overestimates evacuation times. All schemes can be employed for arbitrary simulation models with discrete events, such as car traffic or animal behavior.

AB Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease caused by a group of the human enteroviruses (HEV), including coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71). In recent years, another HEV-A serotype, CA6 or CA10, has emerged to be one of the major etiologic agents that can induce HFMD worldwide. The objective of this study is to develop specific, sensitive, and rapid methods to help diagnose HEV and CA16 specifically by using simultaneous amplification testing (SAT) based on isothermal amplification of RNA and real-time detection of fluorescence technique, which were named as SAT-HEV and SAT-CA16, respectively (SAT-HEV/SAT-CA16). The specificity and sensitivity of SAT were tested here. SAT-HEV/SAT-CA16 could measure viral titers that were at least 10-fold lower than those measured by real-time PCR. Non-false cross-reactive amplification indicated that SAT-HEV/SAT-CM16 were highly specific with the addition of internal control (IC) RNA (5000 copies/reaction). A total of 198 clinical specimens were assayed by SAT comparing with real-time PCR. The statistically robust assessment of SAT-HEV and HEV-specific real-time PCR plus sequencing reached 99.0% (196/198), with a kappa value of 0.97, and 99.5% (197/198) and a kappa value of 0.99 for CA16, respectively. Additionally, IC prevented false-negative readings and assured the SAT-HEV/SAT-CA16 method's accuracy. Overall, SAT-HEV/SAT-CA16 method may serve as a platform for the simple and rapid detection of HEV/CA16 in time of HFMD outbreak. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Platelets contribute to antimicrobial host defense against infective endocarditis (IE) by releasing platelet microbicidal proteins (PMPs). We investigated the influence of thrombin-stimulated human platelets on the evolution of simulated IE in the presence and absence of vancomycin or nafcillin. Staphylococcus aureus strains differing in intrinsic susceptibility to PMPs or antibiotics were studied: ISP479C (thrombin-induced PMP-1 [tPMP-1] susceptible; nafcillin and vancomycin susceptible), ISP479R (tPMP-1 resistant; nafcillin and vancomycin susceptible), and GISA-NJ (tPMP-1 intermediate-susceptible; vancomycin intermediate-susceptible). Platelets were introduced and thrombin activated within the in vitro IE model 30 min prior to inoculation with S. aureus. At 0 to 24 h postinoculation, bacterial densities in chamber fluid and simulated endocardial vegetations (SEVs) were quantified and compared among groups. Activated platelets alone, or in combination with antibiotics, inhibited the proliferation of ISP479C in chamber fluid or SEVs over the initial 4-h period (P < 0.05 versus controls). Moreover, nafcillin-containing regimens exerted inhibitory effects beyond 4 h against ISP479C in both model phases. By comparison, activated platelets inhibited GISA-NJ proliferation in SEVs but not in chamber fluid. The combination of platelets plus nafcillin or vancomycin significantly inhibited proliferation of the GISA-NJ strain in SEVs compared to the effect of platelets or antibiotics alone (P < 0.05). In contrast, platelets did not significantly alter the antistaphylococcal efficacies of nafcillin or vancomycin against ISP479R. These data support our hypothesis that a beneficial antimicrobial effect may result from the interaction among platelets, PMPs, and anti-infective agents against antibiotic-susceptible or -resistant staphylococci that exhibit a tPMP-1-susceptible or -intermediate-susceptible phenotype.

AB The frequencies of chromosome aberrations, SCEs and micronuclei (cytokinesis-block method) in blood lymphocytes were compared among six nonsmoking female pharmacists before and after 1 year of working with cytostatic drugs. All possible precautions were taken to avoid exposure to cytostatics, including proper protective clothing and a monitored, negative-pressured working environment with vertical laminar flow cabinet. As referents, an age-matched group of six nonsmoking female hospital workers not dealing with cytostatics was simultaneously sampled twice with the same time interval. The pharmacists showed a marginally higher mean frequency of SCEs/cell (6.3; P = 0.049) after the working period than 1 year earlier (5.8). On the other hand, the referents, with no obvious exposure, had a higher mean number of cells with chromatid-type aberrations, gaps excluded, in the second sampling (2.0%; P=0.048) than in the first one (0.5%). In addition, a slight (P=0.055) trend towards a higher frequency of micronucleated binucleate cells was observed in the second sampling for both the exposed and control subjects. As such findings suggest technical variation in the cytogenetic parameters, the small difference observed in SCEs for the pharmacists between the two samplings was probably not related to the cytostatics exposure. No statistically significant differences were observed for any of the cytogenetic parameters in comparisons between the pharmacists and the referents. The findings suggest that caution should be exercised in comparing results obtained from two different samplings in prospective cytogenetic studies.

ID ASPIRATION
AB A dichotomy exists in the literature concerning the efficacy of sclerosing agent tetracycline hydrochloride for treatment of thyroid cysts. However, the studies vary in patient selection and none employed a statistical method for simultaneous analysis of multiple factors that might affect the outcome of therapy. We, therefore, studied the efficacy of percutaneous instillation of tetracycline for eradication of recurrent thyroid cysts, using a multivariate analysis. Thirty-seven patients with recurrent, cytologically benign thyroid cysts (not cured after 3 aspirations) were studied. Twenty-three patients were given tetracycline instillations [100 mg/ml, range (R): 1-4 ml]. The remainder underwent only repeated needle aspiration. They were followed for 33+/-12 (SD) months, R: 12-58 months. Cure was achieved in 21 out, of 23 cases after tetracycline instillation within 2+/-1.7 months (R: 1-6 months) and in 12 out of 14 cases after aspiration alone within 9.9+/-11.3 months (R: 1-43 months, 4-10 aspirations). Multivariate survival analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model demonstrated significantly shorter time interval before cure in the group with tetracycline instillation (p=0.001). The volume, color or duration of cysts and levothyroxine (L-T4) treatment did not appear to influence, the outcome of therapy. After initial cure by tetracycline instillation, 5 cases had relapse. Three were later cured by reinstillation of tetracycline or by repeated aspirations (R: 1-3 times). Complications of tetracycline instillation included brief episode of neck pain and development of a foreign body granuloma in a single patient. In conclusion, tetracycline instillation is a quick and effective procedure for treating recurrent thyroid cysts. The duration, characteristics of cysts and L-T4 administration do not influence the outcome of therapy.

AB The influence of the thermophysical variable properties on the buoyancy-driven flows of liquid sodium and gallium established in a cylindrical cavity is numerically investigated, for the entire range of Rayleigh number corresponding to practical applications. Axisymmetric turbulent simulations (initially steady) are obtained, considering appropriate boundary and reference conditions for simulating the emergency cooling of a nuclear reactor. The results obtained for different heating intensities are analyzed and compared. In the case of sodium, the expected decay in the heat transfer coefficients is less relevant than that previously obtained for airflows. In turn, strong differences in the gallium thermal behavior are encountered. In fact, a trend opposite to that of sodium is detected for wide ranges of Rayleigh number and heating parameter. Additional transient simulations are carried out to complete a comparative assessment of the performance of both liquid sodium and gallium as cooling agents.

AB Programmed cell death (PCD) occurs in both unicellular and multicellular organisms. While PCD plays a key role in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms, explaining why single-celled organisms would evolve to actively commit suicide has been far more challenging. Here, we explore the potential for PCD to act as an accessory to microbial bet-hedging strategies that utilize stochastic phenotype switching. We consider organisms that face unpredictable and recurring disasters, in which fitness depends on effective phenotypic diversification. We show that when reproductive opportunities are limited by carrying capacity, PCD drives population turnover, providing increased opportunities for phenotypic diversification through stochastic phenotype switching. The main cost of PCD, providing resources for growth to a PCD(-) competitor, is ameliorated by genetic assortment in spatially structured populations. Using agent-based simulations, we explore how basic demographic factors, namely bottlenecks and local dispersal, can generate sufficient spatial structure to favor the evolution of high PCD rates.

DE Fire extinguishing; Fire suppression; Halon; Lumped parameter approach
AB Purpose - This paper aims to determine the halon concentration time-evolution inside an aircraft cargo compartment to design fire extinguishing systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - A fire suppression system is numerically simulated using the lumped parameter approach.
   Findings - The halon volumetric concentration, halon and air mass fluxes and the cargo compartment pressure are numerically calculated. It also determines the time to halon concentration to achieve the fire suppressant value ( high pressure bottle) as well as its inerting volumetric concentration (low pressure bottle).
   Research limitations/implications - In the lumped parameter approach, the dependent variables of interest are a function of time alone, and its spatial distribution is neglected.
   Practical implications - This study predicts the fire extinguishing agent behavior aiming to satisfy cargo compartment certification requirements.
   Originality/value - This paper uses a simplified methodology, but it represents a very useful tool during the preliminary stages of the aircraft fire suppression systems design.

AB Background. Anti-CD3 immunotoxin (IT), a T-cell-depleting agent, prolongs survival of renal allografts in a rhesus monkey model without the need for longterm immunosuppression. In this study we sought to further prolong allograft survival by giving short-term conventional immunosuppression. simultaneous with IT administration.
   Methods. MHC class II mismatched, juvenile rhesus monkeys were paired as donor and recipient for renal transplantation. Recipients received two to three daily doses of IT starting on the day of transplantation. Additional immunosuppression was given for no more than 60 days. Graft function was monitored by serum creatinine and renal biopsies. Flow cytometry was used to monitor T-cell recovery.
   Results. Graft survival time (GST) in animals receiving IT was prolonged compared with controls with 50% of IT-treated monkeys surviving > 100 days. Animals treated with IT plus mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and steroids had significantly enhanced GST (mean GST, 305 days) compared with those treated with IT alone (mean GST, 94 days). In contrast, addition of cyclosporine or 40-O-[2-Hydroxyethyl]rapamycin did not significantly increase graft survival time. A comparison among animals from all treatment groups with short (< 100 days) and long (> 100 days) GST demonstrated that those with the shorter GST had a higher blood T-cell count 2 weeks after transplantation. Full recovery of CD4(+) T cells required longer than 6 months.
   Conclusions. A combination with MMF and steroids given for 4 days after renal allograft transplantation significantly increases GST in IT-treated monkeys. We hypothesize that MMF and steroids suppress the initial T-cell activation mediated by IT.

AB The effect of the multidrug resistance-reversing agent, SDZ PSC 833, on blood and brain pharmacokinetics of a P-glycoprotein substrate, colchicine, was investigated using simultaneous blood and brain microdialysis in freely moving rats. The use of microdialysis for pharmacokinetic studies was validated by comparing the blood concentrations of colchicine obtained by microdialysis with those obtained by direct blood sampling. The rats received either SDZ PSC 833 (2.3 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by 16.7 mu g/min/kg i.v. infusion during all the experiment) and colchicine (1 mg/kg i.v. bolus followed by 12.5 mu g/min/kg i.v. infusion during 2 hours) or colchicine alone (the same dosage with SDZ PSC 833 vehicle). The SDZ PSC 833 treatment resulted in important modifications of colchicine blood pharmacokinetics: the unbound colchicine blood concentration at steady-state was enhanced from 149.6 +/- 9.9 to 333.5 +/- 81.7 ng/ml indicating a two-fold decrease in colchicine clearance. Moreover the coadministration of SDZ PSC 833 increased the brain penetration of colchicine by a factor of 10, at least. This enhancement could not be exactly assessed because the brain dialysate concentrations of control group were below the limit of detection. Nevertheless, the large increase of colchicine brain penetration is consistent with the hypothesis that SDZ PSC 833 is able to inhibit the P-glycoprotein pump present at the blood-brain barrier.

AB This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the literature on laboratory studies assessing bonding performance to dentin of conventional and self-adhesive resin cements, in cementing indirect restorations. This review was reported according to the PRISMA Statement. Of a total of 518 studies, 36 were screened full text and reviewed according to exclusion criteria. Nineteen papers were included in the systematic review and meta-analyses, according to the following inclusion criteria: studies that evaluated the bond strength to dentin of indirect restorations cemented with dual conventional or self-adhesive resin cements and those that presented bond strength data in MPa as an outcome. Statistical analyses were conducted using Rev-Man 5.1. Comparisons were performed with random effects models at 5% significance level. A global analysis comparing conventional and self-adhesive cements and three subgroup analyses comparing immediate and long-term results were performed. Global analysis showed a difference between groups, with conventional resin cements presenting higher bond strength results than self-adhesive resin cements, in immediate and long-term time periods (both p=0.03). Immediate and longterm bond strength results were different for self-adhesive cements, favoring immediate bond strength (p=0.03), but immediate and long-term bond strength results for conventional resin cements were not different (p =0.06). Medium or high risk of bias was found in all studies. Conventional multistep resin cements showed superior overall adhesive performance compared with simplified self-adhesive resin cements when used to cement indirect restorations to dentin.

AB Limited therapeutic options exist for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) bacteremia; the most commonly used are daptomycin and linezolid. We attempted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the comparative efficacy of those two agents. Studies comparing daptomycin to linezolid treatment for VRE bacteremia, published until August 2012, were identified from the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ISI Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. All comparative studies on patients older than 18 years of age that provided mortality data were considered eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. The primary outcome of the meta-analysis was 30-day all-cause mortality. Ten retrospective studies including 967 patients were identified. Patients treated with daptomycin had significantly higher 30-day all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08 to 2.40) and infection-related mortality (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 1.42 to 9.20) rates than patients treated with linezolid. When data from all 10 studies were combined, overall mortality was also significantly increased among patients treated with daptomycin (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.89). These findings were confirmed when odds ratios adjusted for potential confounders were pooled. Relapse rates among patients treated with daptomycin were also higher (OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 0.94 to 6.72), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Adverse event rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Notwithstanding the absence of randomized prospective data, available evidence suggests that mortality rates may be higher with daptomycin than with linezolid among patients treated for VRE bacteremia.

AB Seeds of many plant species are dispersed by seed-caching rodents that place groups of seeds in superficially buried scatterhoard caches. A case in point is Indian ricegrass (Achnatherum hymenoides), an important forage plant on arid western rangelands for which seedling recruitment comes largely from scatterhoards made by desert heteromyid rodents. A "diversionary seeding" strategy has been attempted for enhancing Indian ricegrass seedling recruitment by deploying commercially available seeds on the soil surface to divert rodents from recovering scatterhoards of Indian ricegrass seeds. The probability of such a passive restoration approach succeeding is likely affected by the relative desirability to rodents of Indian ricegrass seeds versus diversionary seeds. We conducted laboratory experiments to test preferences of Merriam's kangaroo rat (Dipodomys merriami), a primary dispersal agent of Indian ricegrass seeds, for Indian ricegrass seeds versus seeds of 5 diversionary seed candidates. Indian ricegrass seeds were consistently preferred over only 1 of the 5 alternate seeds in pairwise trials. In multiseed trials that presented all seed types (i.e., Indian ricegrass and the 5 alternates) simultaneously, ranking patterns of individual kangaroo rats varied significantly and Indian ricegrass was not preferred by any of the animals tested. Because individual kangaroo rats differed in seed preferences and all animals consumed certain seed types in greater amounts than they consumed Indian ricegrass, we suggest that using a mixture of different seed types in diversionary seedings is superior to deploying a single type of diversionary seeds. Understanding how population-level niche breadth is affected by dietary variation at the individual level can thus have important management implications.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of neutral sodium fluoride (NNaF) gel and acidulated phosphate fluoride (APF) gel on the surface roughness of colored compomer (Twinky Star), conventional compomer (Compoglass F) and resin-modified glassionomer cement (RMGIC) (Photac-Fil). Material and Methods: A total of 45 standardized disc-shaped specimens were prepared for each material. After 24 h, finishing and polishing of specimens were done with aluminum oxide disc. Surface treatments with topical fluoride agents or distilled water (control) were performed four times, and interspersed with 8 pH cycles, simulating high cariogenic challenges. After the treatment, the surface roughness (Ra) was determined using a profilometer. In each group, specimens with Ra closest to the mean were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) at x1,000 and x3,500 magnifications. Two-way ANOVA was used to evaluate Ra measurements, and the differences in Ra values between subgroups for each material and each topical applications were compared by Tukey's highly significant difference pairwise comparisons. Results: No statistically significant difference in Ra between the Twinky Star and Compoglass F was found. However, Photac Fil showed significantly higher Ra than these materials after all surface treatments. There was a general trend of Ra increase from controls to NNaF and APF gels for all materials. SEM observations revealed that the surface micromorphology of Twinky-Star did not differ significantly from that of Compoglass F. Conclusion: Both the compomers and the RMGIC showed significantly higher surface roughness when subjected to APF gel application.

AB Models describing the behavior of organic chemicals in landfills can be useful to predict their fate and transport and also to generate input data for estimates of exposure and risk. The landfill coupled-reactor (LFCR) model developed in this work simulates a landfill as a series of fully mixed reactors, each representing a daily volume of waste. The LFCR model is a numerical model allowing time-variable input parameters such as gas generation, and cover type and thickness. The model was applied to three volatile organic chemicals (acetone, toluene, benzene) as well as naphthalene and the chemical warfare agent Sarin under three landfill conditions (conventional, arid, bioreactor). Sarin was rapidly hydrolyzed, whereas naphthalene was largely associated with the landfill solid phase in all scenarios. Although similar biodegradation rates were used for acetone and toluene, toluene was more persistent in the landfill due to its hydrophobicity. The cover soil moisture content had a significant impact on gaseous diffusive losses.

AB Objectives
   Identifying prescribing strategies that improve the efficiency of PrEP should increase its impact at the population level. This study identifies PrEP allocation criteria that most effectively reduce 10-year HIV incidence by 25%, in accordance with the US National HIV/AIDS Strategy's goal for the proportionate reduction in new diagnoses.
   Methods
   We used a discrete-time stochastic agent-based model to simulate several PrEP engagement strategies. The model represented MSM aged 15-74 in Rhode Island and was calibrated to statewide prevalence from 2009-2014. We simulated HIV transmission in the absence of PrEP and compared the following PrEP engagement scenarios: 1) allocation to the current patient population; 2) random allocation; 3) allocation to MSM with greater than 5 sexual partners in one year; 4) allocation to MSM with greater than 10 sexual partners in one year.
   For each scenario and coverage level we estimated the number and proportion of infections averted and the person-years on PrEP per averted infection.
   Results
   In 2014, HIV prevalence before PrEP implementation was between 4% and 5%. In the No PrEP scenario 826 new infections (95% simulation limits [SL]: 711, 955) occurred over 10 years, with an incidence rate of 3.51 per 1000 person-years (95% SL: 3.00, 4.08). Prevalence rose to 7.4% (95% SL: 6.7, 8.1). None of the PrEP scenarios reduced new HIV infections by 25% while covering less than 15% of the HIV-uninfected population. At 15% coverage, allocating PrEP to the current patient population, MSM with greater than 5 sexual partners in a year, and MSM with greater than 10 partners reduced new infections by at least 25%, requiring 161 (95% SL: 115, 289), 150 (95% SL: 107, 252), and 128 (95% SL: 100, 184) person-years on PrEP per averted infection, respectively.
   Conclusions
   Engaging MSM with high numbers of sexual partners would improve the population-level impact and efficiency of PrEP in settings where PrEP coverage remains low. However, the sustained population-level PrEP coverage needed to reduce new infections by 25% is substantially higher than current levels of PrEP uptake.

AB Drug-induced resistance, or tolerance, is an emerging yet poorly understood failure of anticancer therapy. The interplay between drug-tolerant cancer cells and innate immunity within the tumor, the consequence on tumor growth, and therapeutic strategies to address these challenges remain undescribed. Here, we elucidate the role of taxane-induced resistance on natural killer (NK) cell tumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the design of spatiotemporally controlled nanomedicines, which boost therapeutic efficacy and invigorate "disabled" NK cells. Drug tolerance limited NK cell immune surveillance via drug-induced depletion of the NK-activating ligand receptor axis, NK group 2 member D, and MHC class I poly-peptide-related sequence A, B. Systems biology supported by empirical evidence revealed the heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) simultaneously controls immune surveillance and persistence of drug-treated tumor cells. On the basis of this evidence, we engineered a "chimeric" nanotherapeutic tool comprising taxanes and a cholesterol-tethered Hsp90 inhibitor, radicicol, which targets the tumor, reduces tolerance, and optimally reprimes NK cells via prolonged induction of NK-activating ligand receptors via temporal control of drug release in vitro and in vivo. A human ex vivo TNBC model confirmed the importance of NK cells in drug-induced death under pressure of clinically approved agents. These findings highlight a convergence between drug-induced resistance, the tumor immune contexture, and engineered approaches that consider the tumor and microenvironment to improve the success of combinatorial therapy.
   Significance: This study uncovers a molecular mechanism linking drug-induced resistance and tumor immunity and provides novel engineered solutions that target these mechanisms in the tumor and improve immunity, thus mitigating off-target effects.

AB It has been proposed that acyl adenylate is first formed during activation of the carboxy group into the acyl CoA thioester, an intermediate in the formation of amino acid conjugates. Acyl CoA synthetases may be responsible for this acyl adenylate formation. Recently, we hypothesized the preferential formation of cholic acid adenylate, a major bile acid, preceding production of the corresponding CoA thioester in incubations with rat liver microsomal fractions. To verify this biosynthetic mechanism, monitoring of the incubation mixture of acyl adenylate together with both substrate and acyl CoA thioester is needed. We have developed a detection method for the simultaneous detection of these cholic acid derivatives utilizing liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The CoA thioester of cholic acid forms a chelation complex with the divalent cations remaining on the silica gel packed into the analytical column. Both the addition of a chelating agent, such as EDTA, to the mobile phase and an adjustment of the mobile phase pH to a weak alkaline effectively removed such chelate formation, producing a sharp CoA thioester peak. For a simultaneous mass spectrometric analysis of cholic acid, the corresponding adenylate and CoA thioester, the combined use of a 300 Angstrom particle diameter ODS column and 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 9.0)/2-propanol/acetonitrile as the mobile phase have been proved to be preferable. To avoid any degradation of the chemically unstable adenylate produced in the incubation, we employed a direct injection of the sample onto a preconcentration column. The obtained results indicated a high sensitivity of this method.

AB Severely ill patients in intensive care units (ICU) are frequently at risk of developing fungal infections. Itraconazole (ITCZ), a triazole antifungal agent, is used for the treatment of aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptoccosis. The present retrospective pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) analysis was designed to find any factors affecting clinical outcome of ITCZ treatment, and was performed to evaluate the appropriateness of the current dosage regimen in ICU patients. All of the patients admitted to Aichi Medical University Hospital ICU in 2008 who were treated with ITCZ injections for fungal infections were included in the study. After outcomes had been classified as cure or failure, a PK-PD analysis was performed. In addition, the probability of PD target attainment was assessed using a Monte Carlo simulation. Ten patients were enrolled in the study. Satisfactory outcomes were obtained in 4 of the 10 patients. No significant differences in the area under the 24-h curve (AUC(0-24)), peak concentrations and trough concentrations were observed between the two groups. However, it was observed that the higher the AUC(0-24), the better the outcome. Moreover, our results showed that additional dosage is needed to attain a sufficiently high AUC(0-24)/MIC in about 20% of patients. Our retrospective study is the first to show that it is important to consider the host's condition when ITCZ is administered, especially in ICU patients.

AB Objectives: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the push-out strength of core-buildup resin used for fiber-post cementation and to test the effects of different post and dentin pretreatment for different regions of the root.
   Methods: After endodontic treatment 216 human teeth received a glass-fiber post. The teeth were divided into test groups to simulate the effects of: (1) cementation material (specifically core-build-up resin or conventional luting cement), (II) pretreatment of the root dentin (none, dual-curing bonding, light-curing bonding), (III) pretreatment of the post (none, hydrofluoric acid, tribochemical pretreatment), and (IV) different regions of the root. After thermal cycling all post-cemented roots were sectioned and each specimen was loaded in a universal testing machine until failure occurred. Statistical analysis was performed by use of a mixed-effects regression model.
   Results: The cementation material (p <= 0.001), the pretreatment of the post (p <= 0.001), and the bonding of the root dentin (p: 0.001) had a significant effect on mean push-out strength. Statistical analysis also revealed a significant effect of root region (p <= 0.001)values were lower for the apical region than for the coronal third of the root.
   Conclusions: Enhanced retention can be achieved by use of a core-build-up resin for fiber-post cementation. Tribochemical pretreatment of the post and use of a dual-curing bonding system also increased mean push-out strength. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Satellite instruments show a cooling of global stratospheric temperatures over the whole data record (1979-2014). This cooling is not linear and includes two descending steps in the early 1980s and mid-1990s. The 1979-1995 period is characterized by increasing concentrations of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and by the two major volcanic eruptions of El Chichon (1982) and Mount Pinatubo (1991). The 1995-present period is characterized by decreasing ODS concentrations and by the absence of major volcanic eruptions. Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations increase over the whole time period. In order to isolate the roles of different forcing agents in the global stratospheric temperature changes, we performed a set of simulations using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model with prescribed sea surface temperatures. We find that in our model simulations the cooling of the stratosphere from 1979 to present is mostly driven by changes in GHG concentrations in the middle and upper stratosphere and by GHG and ODS changes in the lower stratosphere. While the cooling trend caused by increasing GHGs is roughly constant over the satellite era, changing ODS concentrations cause a significant stratospheric cooling only up to the mid-1990s, when they start to decrease because of the implementation of the Montreal Protocol. Sporadic volcanic events and the solar cycle have a distinct signature in the time series of stratospheric temperature anomalies but do not play a statistically significant role in the long-term trends from 1979 to 2014. Several factors combine to produce the step-like behavior in the stratospheric temperatures: in the lower stratosphere, the flattening starting in the mid-1990s is due to the decrease in ozone-depleting substances; Mount Pinatubo and the solar cycle cause the abrupt steps through the aerosol-associated warming and the volcanically induced ozone depletion. In the middle and upper stratosphere, changes in solar irradiance are largely responsible for the step-like behavior of global temperature anomalies, together with volcanically induced ozone depletion and water vapor increases in the post-Pinatubo years.

AB We test whether a measure based on the directed transfer function (DTF) calculated from short segments of electroencephalography (EEG) time-series can be used to monitor the state of the patients also during sevoflurane anesthesia as it can for patients undergoing propofol anesthesia. We collected and analyzed 25-channel EEG from 7 patients (3 females, ages 41-56 years) undergoing surgical anesthesia with sevoflurane, and quantified the sensor space directed connectivity for every 1-s epoch using DTF. The resulting connectivity parameters were compared to corresponding parameters from our previous study (n = 8, patients anesthetized with propofol and remifentanil, but otherwise using a similar protocol). Statistical comparisons between and within studies were done using permutation statistics, a data driven algorithm based on the DTF-parameters was employed to classify the epochs as coming from awake or anesthetized state. According to results of the permutation tests, DTF-parameter topographies were significantly different between the awake and anesthesia state at the group level. However, the topographies were not significantly different when comparing results computed from sevoflurane and propofol data, neither in the awake nor in anesthetized state. Optimizing the algorithm for simultaneously having high sensitivity and specificity in classification yielded an accuracy of 95.1% (SE = 0.96%), with sensitivity of 98.4% (SE = 0.80%) and specificity of 94.8% (SE = 0.10%). These findings indicate that the DTF changes in a similar manner when humans undergo general anesthesia caused by two distinct anesthetic agents with different molecular mechanisms of action.

AB Purpose The aims of this longitudinal model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) were to indirectly compare the time courses of survival probabilities and to identify corresponding potential significant covariates across approved drugs in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Methods A systematic literature review for monotherapy studies in patients with CRPC was conducted up to August 8, 2018. The time courses of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were fitted with parametric survival models. Covariate analyses were performed to determine the impact of treatment drugs, dosing regimens, and patient characteristics on the survival probabilities. Simulations were carried out to quantify the magnitude of covariate effects. Results A total of 146 studies including clinical trials and real-world data on longitudinal survival probabilities in 20,712 patients with CRPC were included in our meta-database. The time courses of PFS and OS probabilities were best described by the log-logistic model. There was no significant difference in median OS and PFS between docetaxel, cabazitaxel, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide. There was no significant dose-response relationship in PFS or OS for docetaxel at 50 to 120 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks (Q3W) and cabazitaxel at 20 to 25 mg/m(2) Q3W. Model-based simulations indicated that PFS probability was associated with chemotherapy, Gleason score, and baseline prostate-specific antigen (BLPSA), while OS probability was associated with chemotherapy, Gleason score, visceral metastasis, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and BLPSA. Conclusion Our modeling and simulation framework can be applied to support indirect comparison, dose selection, and go/no-go decision-making for new agents targeting CRPC.

AB A new generation of ligands designed to interact with the alpha-helix/beta-strand discordant region of the amyloid-beta peptide (A beta) and to counteract its oligomerization is presented. These ligands are designed to interact with and stabilize the A beta central helix (residues 13-26) in an alpha-helical conformation with increased interaction by combining properties of several first-generation ligands. The new peptide-like ligands aim at extended hydrophobic and polar contacts across the central part of the A beta, that is, "clamping" the target. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the stability of the A beta central helix in the presence of a set of second-generation ligands were performed and revealed further stabilization of the A beta alpha-helical conformation, with larger number of polar and nonpolar contacts between ligand and A beta, compared to first-generation ligands. The synthesis of selected novel A beta-targeting ligands was performed in solution via an active ester coupling approach or on solid-phase using an Fmoc chemistry protocol. This included incorporation of aliphatic hydrocarbon moieties, a branched triamino acid with an aliphatic hydrocarbon tail, and an amino acid with a 4'-N,N-dimethylamino-1,8-naphthalimido group in the side chain. The ability of the ligands to reduce A beta(1-42) neurotoxicity was evaluated by gamma oscillation experiments in hippocampal slice preparations. The "clamping" second generation ligands were found to be effective antineurotoxicity agents and strongly prevented the degradation of gamma oscillations by physiological concentration of monomeric A beta(1-42) at a stoichiometric ratio.

AB The current study measured the bond strength of a self-etch system to dentin with and without agitation and with varying drying times of primer in vital dentin. The null hypotheses tested were that primer agitation and primer drying time did not affect the dentin shear bond strength. Sixty human maxillary and mandibular premolars scheduled to be extracted for orthodontic reasons were selected. The adhesive/resin combination used was Clearfil SE (Kuraray, Osaka, Japan)/TPH Spectrum (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany). The occlusal surfaces of the teeth were flattened using straight fissure diamond abrasive points ISO-012. Samples were divided into six groups of 10 teeth each. Primer was applied following the manufacturer's instructions with and without agitation followed by air-drying time of 0 (without air drying), five and 10 seconds. Clearfil SE Bond was applied and cured for 10 seconds. TPH Spectrum composite, shade A2 (Dentsply DeTrey), was placed over cured adhesive and was cured for 40 seconds. The teeth were restored to their original anatomy. The teeth were extracted after one week and the samples were kept in distilled water until testing at room temperature. The samples were tested in shear at a 1 mm/minute crosshead speed using an LR100 Universal Testing Machine. The data was analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests (p<0.05). Varying the drying time of the primer from zero (0) to 10 seconds did not significantly affect the bond strength values in vivo. At five seconds drying time, agitation significantly improved the shear bond strength to dentin. Agitation showed no effect when primer was not dried or it was dried for 10 seconds.

AB Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles have been synthesized using chain length of (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane for cancer therapy. First, we have developed a layer by layer functionalized with grafting 2,4-toluene diisocyanate as a bi-functional covalent linker onto a nano-Fe(3)O(4)support. Then, they were characterized by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray powder diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and VSM techniques. Finally, all nanoparticles with positive or negative surface charges were tested against K562 (myelogenous leukemia cancer) cell lines to demonstrate their therapeutic efficacy by MTT assay test. We found that the higher toxicity of Fe3O4@SiO2@APTS similar to Schiff base-Cu(II) (IC50: 1000 mu g/mL) is due to their strongerin situdegradation, with larger intracellular release of iron ions, as compared to surface passivated NPs. For first time, the molecular dynamic simulations of all compounds were carried out afterwards optimizing using MM+, Semi-empirical (AM1) and Ab-initio (STO-3G), Forcite Gemo Opt, Forcite Dynamics, Forcite Energy and CASTEP in Materials studio 2017. The energy (eV), space group, lattice parameters (angstrom), unit cell parameters (angstrom), and electron density of the predicted structures were taken from the CASTEP module of Materials Studio. The docking methods were used to predict the DNA binding affinity, ribonucleotide reductase, and topoisomerase II.

ID STATISTICAL PHYSICS
AB Spin dynamics on networks allows us to understand how a global consensus emerges out of individual opinions. Here, we are interested in the effect of heterogeneity in the initial geographic distribution of a competing opinion on the competitiveness of its own opinion. Accordingly, in this work, we studied the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the majority rule dynamics using a three-state spin model, in which one state is neutral. Monte Carlo simulations were performed on square lattices divided into square blocks (cells). Accordingly, one competing opinion was distributed uniformly among cells, whereas the spatial distribution of the rival opinion was varied from the uniform to heterogeneous, with the median-to-mean ratio in the range from 1 to 0. When the size of discussion group is odd, the uncommitted agents disappear completely after T-tr = 3.30 +/- 0.05 update cycles, and then the system evolves in a two-state regime with complementary spatial distributions of two competing opinions. Even so, the initial heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of one of the competing opinions causes a decrease of this opinion competitiveness. That is, the opinion with initially heterogeneous spatial distribution has less probability to win, than the opinion with the initially uniform spatial distribution, even when the initial concentrations of both opinions are equal. We found that although the time to consensus T-C >> T-tr, the opinion's recession rate is determined during the first 3.3 update cycles. On the other hand, we found that the initial heterogeneity of the opinion spatial distribution assists the formation of quasi-stable regions, in which this opinion is dominant. The results of Monte Carlo simulations are discussed with regard to the electoral competition of political parties.

ID TRANSPLANT WAITING-LIST; RENAL-TRANSPLANTATION; EQUITY; MODEL
AB The National Kidney Transplant Program with cadaveric donors is based on centralized and unique waitlist, serum bank, and allocation criteria, approved by Instituto Nacional de Donacion y Trasplante (INDT) in agreement with clinical teams. The median donor rates over last 3 years is 20 per million population and the median number of waitlist candidates is 450. The increased number of waiting list patients and the rapid aging of our populations demanded strategies for donor acceptance, candidate assignment, and analysis of more efficient and equitable allocation models.
   The objectives of the new national allocation system were to improve posttransplant patient and graft survivals, allow equal access to transplantation, and reduce waitlist times. The objective of this study was to analyze variables in our current allocation system and to create a mathematical/simulation model to evaluate a new allocation system. We compared candidates and transplanted patients for gender, age, ABO blood group, human leukocyte agents (HLA), percentage of reactive antibodies (PRA), and waiting list and dialysis times. Only 2 factors showed differences: highly sensitized and patients >65 years old (Bernoulli test).
   An agreement between INDT and Engineering Faculty yielded a major field of study. During 2008 the data analysis and model building began. The waiting list data of the last decade of donors and transplants were processed to develop a virtual model. We used inputs of candidates and donors, with outputs and structure of the simulation system to evaluate the proposed changes. Currently, the INDT and the Mathematics and Statistics Institute are working to develop a simulation model, that is able to analyze our new national allocation system.

AB Phosphodiesterases 4 enzyme is an attractive target for the design of anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator agents. In the present study pharmacophore and atom based 3D-QSAR studies were carried out for pyrozolo[1,5-a] pyridine/4,4-dimethylpyrazolone analogues. A five point pharmacophore model was developed using 52 molecules having pIC(50) values ranging from 9.959 to 3.939. The best predictive pharmacophoric hypothesis AHHRR.3 was characterized by survival score (2.944), cross validated (r(2)=0.8147), regression coefficient (R-2=0.9545) and Fisher ratio (F = 173) with 4 component PLS factor. Results explained that one hydrogen bond acceptor, two aromatic rings and two hydrophobic groups are crucial for the PDE4 inhibition. The docking studies of all selected inhibitors in the active site of PDE4 showed crucial hydrogen bond interactions with Asp392, Asn395 Tyr233, and Gln443 residues. The pharmacophoric features R15 and R16 exhibited pi-pi stacking with His234, Phe414, and Phe446 residues. The generated model was further validated by carrying out the decoy test. The binding free energies of these inhibitors in the catalytic domain of 1XMU were calculated by the molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area VSGB 2.0 method. The results of molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the extra precision docking-predicted priority for binding sites, the accuracy of docking, and the reliability of active conformations. Pyrozolo[1,5-a] pyridine/4,4-dimethylpyrazolone analogues in this study showed lower binding affinity toward PDE3A in comparison to PDE4. Outcomes of the present study provide insight in designing novel molecules with better PDE4 inhibitory activity.

AB Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most important infectious diseases. Population pharmacokinetic (pop-PK) models are widely used to individualize dosing regimens of several antibiotics, but their application in anti-TB drug studies is scant. The aim of this study was to provide an insight regarding the status of pop-PK for these drugs and to compare results obtained through both parametric and nonparametric approaches to design precise dosage regimens. Methods: First, a systematic approach was implemented, searching in PubMed and Google Scholar. Articles that did not include human patients, that lacked an explicit structural model, that analyzed drugs inactive against M. tuberculosis, or were without full-text access, were excluded. Second, the PK parameters were summarized and categorized as parametric versus nonparametric results. Third, a Monte Carlo simulation was performed in Pmetrics using the results of both groups, and an error term was built to describe the imprecision of each PK modeling approach. Results: Thirty-three articles reporting at least 1 pop-PK model of 19 anti-TB drug were found; 46 different models including PK parameter estimates and their relevant covariates were also reported. Only 9 models were based on nonparametric approaches. Rifampin was the drug most studied, but only using parametric approaches. The simulations showed that nonparametric approaches improve the error term compared with parametric approaches. Conclusions: More and better models, ideally using nonparametric approaches linked with clear pharmacodynamic goals, are required to optimize anti-TB drug dosing, as recommended in the WHO End TB strategy.

AB In vaccine studies, a specific diagnosis of a suspected case by culture or serology of the infectious agent is expensive and difficult. Implementing validation sets in the study is less expensive and is easier to carry out. In studies using validation sets, the non-specific or auxiliary outcome is measured on each participant while the specific outcome is measured only for a small proportion of the participants. Vaccine efficacy, defined as one minus some measure of relative risk, could be severely attenuated if based only on the auxiliary outcome. Applying missing data analysis techniques could thus correct the bias while maintaining statistical efficiency. However, when the sample size in the validation sets is small and the vaccine is highly efficacious, all specific outcomes are likely to be negative in the validation set in the vaccinated group. Two commonly used missing data analysis methods, the mean score method and multiple imputation, depend on the ad hoc continuity correction when none of the specific outcomes are positive and the normality or log-normality assumption of relative risk, which may not hold when the relative risk is highly skewed, to estimate the confidence interval. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian method to estimate vaccine efficacy and its highest probability density (HPD) credible set using Monte Carlo (MC) methods when using auxiliary outcome data and a small validation sample. Comparing the performance of these approaches using data from a field study of influenza vaccine and simulations, we recommend to use the Bayesian method in this situation.

ID COOPERATION; RESONANCE; EVOLUTION
AB Inspired by the fact that people make mistakes in a transient, fluctuating or chaotic environment, we establish a spatial prisoner's dilemma model where an agent commits action errors proportionally varying with the increasing/decreasing rate of the global cooperation fraction. A series of numerical simulations reveal that the cooperation level is enhanced in games in which the stag hunt (SH)-type dilemma is dominant; however, it is slightly diminished in games in which the chicken-type dilemma is dominant, compared with the standard network reciprocity model. Intensive analysis reveals that the noise created by the action error contribute to the spatial expansion of a cooperators' cluster, because a dilemma that is less chicken-type and more SH-type makes it disadvantageous for defectors to neighbor cooperators. Our finding, that errors in behavior in a chaotic environment contribute to the evolution of cooperation, might aim to explain the problem of how network reciprocity works.

AB Background With the accelerated development of next-generation sequencing (NGS), identified variants, and targeted therapies, clinicians who confront the complicated and multifarious genetic information may not effectively incorporate NGS-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis into routine patient care. Consequently, standardized ctDNA testing reports are of vital importance. In an effort to guarantee high-quality reporting performance, we conducted an investigation of the current detection and reporting practices for NGS-based ctDNA analysis. Materials and Methods A set of simulated ctDNA samples with known variants at known allelic frequencies and a corresponding case scenario were distributed to 66 genetic testing laboratories for ctDNA analysis. Written reports were collected to evaluate the detection accuracy, reporting integrity, and information sufficiency using 21 predefined criteria. Results Current reporting practices for NGS-based ctDNA analysis were found to be far from satisfactory, especially regarding testing interpretation and methodological details. Only 42.4% of laboratories reported the results in complete concordance with the expected results. Moreover, 74.2% of reports only listed aberrations with direct and well-known treatment consequences for the tumor type in question. Genetic aberrations for which experimental agents and/or drug access programs are available may thus be overlooked. Furthermore, methodological details for the interpretation of results were missing from the majority of reports (87.9%). Conclusion This proof-of-principle study suggests that the capacity for accurate identification of variants, rational interpretation of genotypes, comprehensive recommendation of potential medications, and detailed description of methodologies need to be further improved before ctDNA analysis can be formally implemented in the clinic. Implications for Practice Accurate, comprehensive, and standardized clinical sequencing reports can help to translate complex genetic information into patient-centered clinical decisions, thereby shepherding precision oncology into daily practice. However, standards, guidelines, and quality requirements for clinical reports of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis are currently absent. By using a set of simulated clinical ctDNA samples and a corresponding case scenario, current practices were evaluated to identify deficiencies in clinical sequencing reports of ctDNA analysis. The recommendations provided here may serve as a roadmap for the improved implementation of NGS-based ctDNA analysis in the clinic.

AB 1. World-wide declines in pollinators, including bumblebees, are attributed to a multitude of stressors such as habitat loss, resource availability, emerging viruses and parasites, exposure to pesticides, and climate change, operating at various spatial and temporal scales. Disentangling individual and interacting effects of these stressors, and understanding their impact at the individual, colony and population level are a challenge for systems ecology. Empirical testing of all combinations and contexts is not feasible. A mechanistic multilevel systems model (individual-colony-population-community) is required to explore resilience mechanisms of populations and communities under stress.
   2. We present a model which can simulate the growth, behaviour and survival of six UK bumblebee species living in any mapped landscape. Bumble-BEEHAVE simulates, in an agent-based approach, the colony development of bumblebees in a realistic landscape to study how multiple stressors affect bee numbers and population dynamics. We provide extensive documentation, including sensitivity analysis and validation, based on data from literature. The model is freely available, has flexible settings and includes a user manual to ensure it can be used by-researchers, farmers, policy-makers, NGOs or other interested parties.
   3. Model outcomes compare well with empirical data for individual foraging behaviour, colony growth and reproduction, and estimated nest densities.
   4. Simulating the impact of reproductive depression caused by pesticide exposure shows that the complex feedback mechanisms captured in this model predict higher colony resilience to stress than suggested by a previous, simpler model.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The Bumble-BEEHAVE model represents a significant step towards predicting bumblebee population dynamics in a spatially explicit way. It enables researchers to understand the individual and interacting effects of the multiple stressors affecting bumblebee survival and the feedback mechanisms that may buffer a colony against environmental stress, or indeed lead to spiralling colony collapse. The model can be used to aid the design of field experiments, for risk assessments, to inform conservation and farming decisions and for assigning bespoke management recommendations at a landscape scale.

AB Objectives. To introduce a form of mathematical modeling, agent-based modeling (ABM), and demonstrate its potential uses in the evaluation of the dynamics of the innate immune response (IIR) and the development of possible treatments for systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)/multiple organ failure (MOF).
   Rationale: The IIR can be categorized as a complex system that responds to interventions in a nonintuitive fashion, leading to difficulty in translating basic science knowledge into effective treatments for SIRS/MOF. It is proposed that ABM is particularly well suited to examining the complex interactions of the IIR and its disordered states of SIRS/MOF.
   Study Design: Computer simulation and mathematical modeling.
   Data Source: Review articles on components and mechanisms involved in the IIR. Published results from phase III anticytokine/mediator trials. Published results from smaller clinical trials and animal studies.
   Main Results: An abstract ABM of the IIR was created. The model reproduces the general behavior of the IIR with respect to outcome and cause of system "death." Patterns of levels of individual cytokines matched patterns of measured cytokines reported in the existing literature. Clinical trials of anticytokine therapy were simulated and produced outcomes qualitatively similar to those reported in the literature. A series of hypothetical treatment regimes (variation of dose and length of treatment [anti-tumor necrosis factor and anti-interleukin-1], anti-CD-18, and multiple-drug regimes [combination of anti-tumor necrosis factor, anti-interleukin-1, and anti-CD-18]) were formulated and implemented in the ABM. None of the simulated therapies showed a statistically significant improvement in system mortality.
   Conclusions: Presented herein is an abstracted ABM of the IIR. This model is intended primarily as an introduction to and demonstration of this technique. However, even this relatively simple model demonstrates counterintuitive system responses and the difficulty of effectively manipulating a complex system like the IIR. ABM may provide a synthetic, analytical platform to integrate basic science data on the IIR, thus eventually aiding in formulating and testing future mediator-directed therapies for SIRS/MOF before clinical trials, and it may provide insights into directions of future research.

TI Hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics inhibit TNF-dependent VCAM1 induction in
   the 5A32 endothelial cell line via a hypoxia inducible factor dependent
   mechanism
SO JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL SCIENCE

AB Background: We previously reported that iron chelators inhibit TNF alpha-mediated induction of VCAM-1 in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. We hypothesized that iron chelators mediate inhibition of VCAM-1 via inhibition of iron-dependent enzymes such as those involved with oxygen sensing and that similar inhibition may be observed with agents which simulate hypoxia.
   Objective: We proposed to examine whether non-metal binding hypoxia mimetics inhibit TNF alpha-mediated VCAM-1 induction and define the mechanisms by which they mediate their effects on VCAM-1 expression.
   Methods: These studies were undertaken in vitro using immortalized dermal endothelial cells, Western blot analysis, ELISA, immunofluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCR, and chromatin immunoprecipitation.
   Results: Hypoxia and the non-iron binding hypoxia mimetic dimethyl oxallyl glycine (DMOG) inhibited TNF alpha-mediated induction of VCAM-1. DMOG inhibition of VCAM-1 was dose-dependent, targeted VCAM-1 gene transcription independent of NF-kappa B nuclear translocation, and blocked TNF alpha-mediated chromatin modifications of relevant elements of the VCAM-1 promoter. Combined gene silencing of both HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha using siRNA led to a partial rescue of VCAM expression in hypoxia mimetic-treated cells.
   Conclusion: Iron chelators, non-metal binding hypoxia mimetics, and hypoxia all inhibit TNF alpha-mediated VCAM-1 expression. Inhibition is mediated independent of nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, appears to target TNF alpha-mediated chromatin modifications, and is at least partially dependent upon HIF expression. The absence of complete VCAM-1 expression rescue with HIF silencing implies an important regulatory role for an Fe(II)/alpha-ketoglutarate dioxygenase distinct from the prolyl and asparagyl hydroxylases that control HIF function. Identification of this dioxygenase may provide a valuable target for modulating inflammation in human tissues.

AB Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is used extensively to assess markers for prognosis and sensitivity to novel anticancer agents, as well as in the routine clinical assessment of cancers. Yet, although it is well known that tumors are highly heterogeneous, the resulting sampling error in the measurement of histological markers is often ignored, particularly in basic scientific studies. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that the optimization of tissue sampling to compensate for heterogeneity improves the correlation between histological measurements of the intrinsic hypoxia marker carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) and global tumor oxygenation status. The study was based on a group of 24 patients with invasive cervical carcinoma from whom multiple biopsies were obtained at the time of direct pO(2) assessment within the tumor, done as part of a research study. Measurements were made by image analysis of multiple deep sections cut through these biopsies, labeled for CAIX using both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical techniques, and included tissue microarray (TMA) simulations. Variance and correlation analysis showed that the size of the tissue sample (biopsy or TMA core) was the major factor affecting accuracy of measurement in the sample. Sampling of multiple biopsies/cores also improved the global tumor assessment, provided that these were sufficiently separated in space. Optimization of sampling resulted in an improved correlation of CAIX staining with tumor pO2 measurements, consistent with the hypothesis. However, CAIX was inferior to pO2 measurements as a tool for patient stratification. Improved analytical methods to account for intratumoral heterogeneity are needed to provide reliable measurements of molecular markers.

AB Background: The most dominant feature of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is fibrosis, which is caused by overproduction of collagen by fibroblasts. 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) has exhibited disease-modifying activity in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune encephalomyelitis and inhibitory effect in cell proliferation and collagen synthesis. Therefore, we hypothesized that 2-ME may exhibit antifibrotic effect in SSc.
   Objective: To investigate the antifibrotic effect of 2-ME in SSc.
   Methods: We established a bleomycin-induced SSc mice model by injection with bleomycin daily for 21 days. 2-ME (100 mg/kg/d) was simultaneously administered for 14 days. On the end of Week1 (W1), W2, W3 and W4, skins and lungs were collected for histological examination and analysis of hydroxyproline content and mRNA level of alpha 1 (I) procollagen (COL1A1) and COL1A2. In skin fibroblasts derived from SSc patients and healthy subjects treated with 2-ME (1, 5, or 25 mu M), we examined cell proliferation, expression of a-smooth muscle actin (SMA) and mRNA level of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1, matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-1 and tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP)-1.
   Results: We found reduced dermal thickness and lung fibrosis and decreased hydroxyproline content and mRNA level of COL1A1 and COL1A2 in skin and lung in SSc mice treated with 2-ME. In cell study, we observed a dose- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation of SSc fibroblasts by 2-ME. We also detected reduced alpha-SMA expression, decreased mRNA level of COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1 and TIMP-1, and increased mRNA level of MMP-1 in SSc fibroblasts treated with 2-ME.
   Conclusion: 2-ME could suppress SSc tissue fibrosis, which may be attributable to its inhibitory effect on the excessive proliferation, differentiation and production of collagen in fibroblasts. 2-ME is rising as a prospective agent for control of fibrosis in SSc.

AB BACKGROUND: Targeting a single pathway in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PC) is unlikely to affect its natural history. We tested the hypothesis that simulataneous targeting of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor receptor-1 (IGF-1R) pathways would significantly improve progression-free survival (PFS) by abrogating reciprocal signaling that promote drug resistance METHODS: This was a phase Ib/II study testing cixutumumab, combined with erlotinib and gemcitabine (G) in patients with untreated metastatic PC. The control arm was erlotinib plus G. The primary end point was PFS. Eligibility included performance status 0/1 and normal fasting blood glucose. Polymorphisms in genes involved in G metabolism and in the EGFR pathway were also studied RESULTS: The phase I results (n=10) established the safety of cixutumumab 6 mg/kg/week intravenously, erlotinib 100 mg/day orally, and G 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In the RP2 portion (116 eligible patients; median age, 63), the median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 3.6 and 7.0 months, respectively, on the cixutumumab arm, and 3.6 and 6.7 months, respecively, on the control arm. Major grades 3 and 4 toxicities with cixutumumab and control were elevation of transaminases, 12% and 6%, respectively; fatigue, 16% and 12%, respectively; gastrointestinal, 35% and 28%, respectively; neutropenia, 21% and 10%, respectively; and thrombocytopenia, 16% and 7%, respecively. Grade 3/4 hyperglycemia was seen in 16% of patients on cixutumumab. Grade 3 or 4 skin toxicity was similar in both arms of the study (< 5%). No significant differences in PFS by genotype were seen for any of the polymorphisms. CONCLUSIONS: Adding the IGF-1R inhibitor cixutumumab to erlotinib and G did not lead to longer PFS or OS in metastatic PC. (C) 2014 American Cancer Society.

AB Background: Evidence of changing in biting and resting behaviour of the main malaria vectors has been mounting up in recent years as a result of selective pressure by the widespread and long-term use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and indoor residual spraying. The impact of resistance behaviour on malaria intervention efficacy has important implications for the epidemiology and malaria control programmes. In this context, a theoretical framework is presented to understand the mechanisms determining the evolution of feeding behaviour under the pressure of use of ITNs.
   Methods: An agent-based stochastic model simulates the impact of insecticide-treated bed nets on mosquito fitness by reducing the biting rates, as well as increasing mortality rates. The model also incorporates a heritability function that provides the necessary genetic plasticity upon which natural selection would act to maximize the fitness under the pressure of the control strategy.
   Results: The asymptotic equilibrium distribution of mosquito population versus biting time is shown for several daily uses of ITNs, and the expected disruptive selection on this mosquito trait is observed in the simulations. The relative fitness of strains that bite at much earlier time with respect to the wild strains, when a threshold of about 50% of ITNs coverage highlights the hypothesis of a behaviour selection. A sensitivity analysis has shown that the top three parameters that play a dominant role on the mosquito fitness are the proportion of individuals using bed nets and its effectiveness, the impact of bed nets on mosquito oviposition, and the mosquito genetic plasticity related to changing in biting time.
   Conclusion: By taking the evolutionary aspect into account, the model was able to show that the long-term use of ITNs, although representing an undisputed success in reducing malaria incidence and mortality in many affected areas, is not free of undesirable side effects. From the evolutionary point of view of the parasite virulence, it should be expected that plasmodium parasites would be under pressure to reduce their virulence. This speculative hypothesis can eventually be demonstrated in the medium to long-term use of ITNs.

AB Trichothecene mycotoxins are a group of structurally similar fungal metabolites that are capable of producing a wide range of toxic effects. Deoxynivalenol (DON, vomitoxin), a trichothecene, is prevalent worldwide in crops used for food and feed production, including in Canada and the United States. Although DON is one of the least acutely toxic trichothecenes, it should be treated as an important food safety issue because it is a very common contaminant of grain. This review focuses on the ability of DON to induce toxicologic and immunotoxic effects in a variety of cell systems and animal species. At the cellular level, the main toxic effect is inhibition of protein synthesis via binding to the ribosome. In animals, moderate to low ingestion of toxin can cause a number of as yet poorly defined effects associated with reduced performance and immune function. The main overt effect at low dietary concentrations appears to be a reduction in food consumption (anorexia), while higher doses induce vomiting (emesis). DON is known to alter brain neurochemicals. The serotoninergic system appears to play a role in mediation of the feeding behavior and emetic response. Animals fed low to moderate doses are able to recover from initial weight losses, while higher doses induce more long-term changes in feeding behavior. At low dosages of DON, hematological, clinical, and immunological changes are also transitory and decrease as compensatory/adaptation mechanisms are established. Swine are more sensitive to DON than mice, poultry, and ruminants, in part because of differences in metabolism of DON, with males being more sensitive than females. The capacity of DON to alter normal immune function has been of particular interest. There is extensive evidence that DON can be immunosuppressive or immunostimulatory, depending upon the dose and duration of exposure. While immunosuppression can be explained by the inhibition of translation, immunostimulation can be related to interference with normal regulatory mechanisms. In vivo, DON suppresses normal immune response to pathogens and simultaneously induces autoimmune-like effects which are similar to human immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy. Other effects include superinduction of cytokine production by T helper cells (in vitro) and activation of macrophages and T cells to produce a proinflammatory cytokine wave that is analogous to that found in lipopolysaccharide-induced shack (in vivo). To what extent the elevation of cytokines contributes to metabolic effects such as decreased feed intake remains to be established. Although these effects have been largely characterized in the mouse, several investigations with DON suggest that immunotoxic effects are also likely in domestic animals. Further toxicology studies and an assessment of the potential of DON to be an etiologic agent in human disease are warranted.

   ORIENTATION
AB Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P-2) is an important signaling lipid and plays a crucial role in a wide variety of cellular processes by interacting with protein targets and localizing proteins at the plasma membrane. These interactions are strongly influenced by the lateral distribution of PI(4,5)P-2 as well as its ionization state. The characterization of the PI(4,5)P-2 ionization state provides important information about how PI(4,5)P-2 interacts with other membrane resident or associated chemical species. In this study we have used solid-state MAS P-31 NMR to investigate the interactions of PI(4,5)P-2 with potential cluster promoting agents, divalent cations and cholesterol. Both Ca2+ and cholesterol were found previously to promote formation of local PI(4,5)P-2 clusters in vitro. The NMR approach allows us to probe independently the ionization state of PI(4,5)P-2 two phosphomonoester groups. We investigated mixed phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PI(4,5)P-2 multilamellar vesicles in the presence of micro and millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+. We found that both cations lead to an increased downfield chemical shift of the PI(4,5)P-2 phosphomonoester peaks, indicating an increased ionization in the presence of the divalent cations. Ca2+ has a much larger effect on PI(4,5)P-2 as compared to Mg2+ at similar concentrations. Physiological concentrations of Ca2+ are significantly lower than those found for Mg2+ and the comparison of the PI(4,5)P-2 ionization in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ at physiological concentrations resulted in similar charges of the phosphomonoester groups for both cations. PI(4,5)P-2 was also examined with vesicles containing cholesterol since cholesterol has been shown to promote PI(4,5)P-2 clustering. In the presence of 40 mol% cholesterol, the PI(4,5)P-2 phosphomonoester P-31 NMR peaks shifted slightly downfield, indicating a small increase in charge. Previously published data suggest that PI(4,5)P-2 is capable of forming an intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bond network, which leads to a reduction of the charge at the phosphomonoester groups through dissipation of the charge across the bilayer/water interface. We hypothesize that cholesterol participates in this intermolecular hydrogen bond network, resulting in a stabilization of PI(4,5)P-2 enriched domains due an increased spacing between the PI(4,5)P-2 headgroup. We also examined the cumulative effects of cholesterol combined with the divalent cations, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), separately. The combination of cholesterol and divalent cations results in an additive effect on PI(4,5)P-2 ionization, while the effect of cholesterol on PI(4,5)P-2 ionization is reduced in the presence of PE or PI.

AB 1. We have developed a comprehensive mathematical model of an afferent synaptic connection to the soma of a medial nucleus tractus solitarius (mNTS) neuron. Model development is based on numerical fits to quantitative data recorded in our laboratory. This work is part of a continuing collaborative effort aimed at identifying and characterizing the mechanisms responsible for the nonlinear integrative properties of this first synapse in the baroreceptor reflex.
   2. The complete model consists of three major parts. 1) a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH)-type membrane model of the prejunctional sensory terminal bouton; 2) a multistage model describing vesicular storage, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)- and Ca2+-dependent mobilization, release and recycling; and 3) a HH-type membrane model of the postjunctional mNTS cell that includes descriptions for a desensitizing non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) ionic current that is responsible for the fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) observed in mNTS cells. The membrane models for both the terminal bouton and the mNTS neuron are coupled to separate lumped fluid compartment models describing intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration dynamics.
   3. Our modeling strategy is twofold. The first is to validate model performance by reproducing a wide variety of experimental data both from our laboratory and from the literature. The second is to explore the functional aspects of the model in order to gain a greater appreciation for the balance between presynaptic mechanisms (e.g., terminal membrane properties and vesicular dynamics) and postsynaptic mechanisms (e.g., non-NMDA receptor kinetics and neuronal dynamics) that underlie the afferent synaptic drive of mNTS neurons.
   4. The model accurately reproduces EPSP dynamics recorded with the use of a wide range of stimulus protocols. The model can also mirror the unique pattern of graded frequency- and use-dependent reduction in peak EPSP magnitude observed experimentally through 60 s of constant, suprathreshold synaptic activation. We demonstrate how vesicular mobilization, recycling, and receptor kinetics can function synergistically in establishing synaptic transfer. Furthermore, we show that by allowing the aggregate rate of vesicle mobilization to respond in a use-dependent manner, it is possible to compensate for the attenuating affects of desensitization at elevated rates of stimulation.
   5. Our simulations indicate that the low-frequency characteristics of this synapse are dominated by vesicular dynamics, whereas the high-frequency properties arise from a combination of Ca2+-dependent vesicular mobilization and the kinetics of the non-NMDA receptor. Desensitization can influence the peak magnitude and decay time of the EPSP, thereby affecting synaptic throughput. However, we demonstrate that, as the time course of neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft decreases, the influence of desensitization should be somewhat diminished. As a result, the effective bandwidth of the synapse increases and becomes limited by the gating characteristics of the non-NMDA channel.
   6. The model also includes a neuromodulatory aspect in that the frequency response of the synapse can be modulated by an adenylate cyclase-mediated regulatory mechanism. Although our simulations indicate the behavior of a limited number of possible neuromodulatory agents, the results demonstrate the pivotal role such agents could play in modifying synaptic transfer characteristics presynaptically.
   7. Both continuous and burst-mode tract stimulation evoke patterns of action potentials in spontaneously active mNTS neurons that are mimicked very well by our model. Our simulations demonstrate that, as the rate of stimulation increases beyond similar to 20-30 Hz, the inherent low-pass frequency-response characteristics of the synapse limit the overall dynamic range of the mNTS neuron, causing the postsynaptic cell to ''entrain'' at frequencies within its normal operating range. These results suggest that this first synapse in the baroreflex pathway is well suited for transmitting sustained low-frequency (i.e., less than or equal to 10 Hz) activity to mNTS neurons but cannot faithfully transmit high-frequency (i.e., greater than or equal to 20 Hz) activity.

AB Background: Convulsive status epilepticus is the most common neurological emergency in children. Its management is important to avoid or minimise neurological morbidity and death. The current first-choice second-line drug is phenytoin (Epanutin, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA), for which there is no robust scientific evidence.
   Objective: To determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam (Keppra, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium) is the more clinically effective intravenous second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus and to help better inform its management.
   Design: A multicentre parallel-group randomised open-label superiority trial with a nested mixed-method study to assess recruitment and research without prior consent.
   Setting: Participants were recruited from 30 paediatric emergency departments in the UK.
   Participants: Participants aged 6 months to 17 years 11 months, who were presenting with convulsive status epilepticus and were failing to respond to first-line treatment.
   Interventions: Intravenous levetiracetam (40 mg/kg) or intravenous phenytoin (20 mg/kg).
   Main outcome measures: Primary outcome - time from randomisation to cessation of all visible signs of convulsive status epilepticus. Secondary outcomes - further anticonvulsants to manage the convulsive status epilepticus after the initial agent, the need for rapid sequence induction owing to ongoing convulsive status epilepticus, admission to critical care and serious adverse reactions.
   Results: Between 17 July 2015 and 7 April 2018, 286 participants were randomised, treated and consented. A total of 152 participants were allocated to receive levetiracetam and 134 participants to receive phenytoin. Convulsive status epilepticus was terminated in 106 (70%) participants who were allocated to levetiracetam and 86 (64%) participants who were allocated to phenytoin. Median time from randomisation to convulsive status epilepticus cessation was 35 (interquartile range 20-not assessable) minutes in the levetiracetam group and 45 (interquartile range 24-not assessable) minutes in the phenytoin group (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% confidence interval 0.91 to 1.60; p = 0.2). Results were robust to prespecified sensitivity analyses, including time from treatment commencement to convulsive status epilepticus termination and competing risks. One phenytoin-treated participant experienced serious adverse reactions.
   Limitations: First, this was an open-label trial. A blinded design was considered too complex, in part because of the markedly different infusion rates of the two drugs. Second, there was subjectivity in the assessment of 'cessation of all signs of continuous, rhythmic clonic activity' as the primary outcome, rather than fixed time points to assess convulsive status epilepticus termination. However, site training included simulated demonstration of seizure cessation. Third, the time point of randomisation resulted in convulsive status epilepticus termination prior to administration of trial treatment in some cases. This affected both treatment arms equally and had been prespecified at the design stage. Last, safety measures were a secondary outcome, but the trial was not powered to demonstrate difference in serious adverse reactions between treatment groups.
   Conclusions: Levetiracetam was not statistically superior to phenytoin in convulsive status epilepticus termination rate, time taken to terminate convulsive status epilepticus or frequency of serious adverse reactions. The results suggest that it may be an alternative to phenytoin in the second-line management of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus. Simple trial design, bespoke site training and effective leadership were found to facilitate practitioner commitment to the trial and its success. We provide a framework to optimise recruitment discussions in paediatric emergency medicine trials.
   Future work: Future work should include a meta-analysis of published studies and the possible sequential use of levetiracetam and phenytoin or sodium valproate in the second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus.

TI Comparison of Enamel and Dentin Shear Bond Strengths of Current Dental
   Bonding Adhesives From Three Bond Generations
SO OPERATIVE DENTISTRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Objective: Durability is still a major challenge in adhesive dentistry. One of the biggest areas of development has been to simplify the bonding process by using all-in-one adhesives. The aim of this study was to compare the shear bond strength (SBS) to dentin and enamel of nine dental bonding agents (DBAs) from three generations after simulated aging.
   Methods and Materials: For this study, 108 sound extracted human molars were randomly assigned to nine groups (n=12). The sample teeth were mounted in self-cure acrylic resin sectioned to provide paired enamel and dentin samples. All samples were polished with 240 and 600-grit silicon carbide sandpaper and randomly grouped according to the product and substrates (enamel or dentin). Herculite Ultra resin composite cylinders were bonded on each test surface, stored in 100% humidity at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and then thermocyled for 1,000 cycles at 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C. SBS testing was performed using an Ultratester at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Statistical analysis included two-factor analysis of variance, one-sample Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests, and the Scheffe post hoc test at an alpha level of 0.05 using SAS version 9.2.
   Results: Significant differences in SBS were observed between the sixth-and seventh-generation DBAs (p=0.002) but not between the sixth-and fourth-generation DBAs. Scheffe post hoc tests for the sixth-generation DBAs showed that some DBAs yielded significantly higher enamel SBS than others, but not as much as dentin SBS. As for the seventh-generation DBAs, similar post hoc tests showed significant variations in SBS between substrates (enamel and dentin) and DBAs tested. Significant main effects were also found for the different substrates for the fourth-generation (F[1,96]=10.532; p=0.003) and seventh-generation (F[1,96]=22.254; p<0.001) DBAs, but not for the sixth-generation DBAs (F[1,96]=1.895, p=0.172). The SBS was higher on dentin than enamel for the fourth-and seventh-generation DBAs.
   Conclusion: As expected, fourth-and sixth-generation DBAs generally showed stronger SBS values than the seventh-generation all-in-one DBAs. The new sixth-generation DBA OptiBond XTR (Kerr) showed strong SBS values to both substrates and performed well in comparison to the other DBAs tested.

AB Background/Aim. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may induce different inflammatory patterns. The aim of this study was to examine the association of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) with the type of infecting microorganisms (Gram positive, Gram negative, polymicrobial) and underlying cause of secondary sepsis (peritonitis, pancreatitis, trauma). Methods. Totally, 40 critically ill patients with secondary sepsis were enrolled in the prospective study. Two patients without documented positive blood culture were excluded. We detected and enumerated both main subsets of MDSCs: granulocytic (G)-MDSCs and monocytic (M)-MDSCs on the Days 1 and 5. Blood was simultaneously drawn for a blood culture. The patients with different underlying causes of sepsis (peritonitis, pancreatitis, trauma) were perceived as separated groups and the frequencies and absolute numbers of their G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs were compared. Results. Both main MDSC subpopulations were accumulated significantly in Grampositive sepsis. Univariate logistic regression analyses of investigated variables regarding Gram-positive sepsis on the Day 5 revealed that G-MDSCs absolute number along with both MMDSCs frequency and absolute number had statistically significant power for predicting Gram-positive sepsis. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression analyses of the variables on the Day 5 determined that M-MDSCs absolute number was independent predictor of Gram-positive sepsis [odds ratio (OR) 1.012; p < 0.05]. Clinical accuracy of neutrophil (Ne)/GMDSCs (Ne/G-MDSCs) and monocyte (Mo)/M-MDSCs (Mo/M-MDSCs) ratios in predicting nature of bacteremia and outcome were investigated. Discriminative power of both Ne/G-MDSCs and Mo/M-MDSCs ratios in predicting Grampositive blood culture was statistically significant both on the Day 1 and Day 5 [areas under curve (AUCs): 0.684 and 0.692, and 0.707 and 0.793, respectively). Ne/G-MDSCs both on the Day 1 and Day 5 were statistically significant predictors of lethal outcome (AUCs: 0.694 and 0.678, respectively). There were no statistically significant differences in G-MDSCs and M-MDSCs among different three groups of patients regarding peritonitis, pancreatitis and trauma as causes of sepsis neither on the Day 1 nor on the Day 5. Conclusion. Gram-positive infectious agents were powerful inducers of MDSCs generation in sepsis. Also, underlying causes of secondary sepsis might not seem to influence the MDSCs accumulation.

AB Although monochorionic (MC) dizygotic twins (DZT) are extremely rare in natural pregnancy, six pairs of such twins have Successively been reported in a recent short period. All six cases of MC DZT were the products of pregnancy by assisted reproductive technology (ART). In this overview, we summarize these six cases and discuss possible mechanisms of this twinning, and clinical implications of confined blood cell chimerism (CBC). The placental MC membrane was diagnosed ultrasonographically in all cases and pathologically in four. The presence of CBC was confirmed In four cases by haplotyping at polymorphic marker loci in peripheral blood leukocytes, karyotyping of lymphocytes and skin fibroblasts. and/or ABO blood group typing As CBC is attributable to placental vessel anastomosis between DZT, it may become a risk factor for twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), mortality, and for other complications in twins. MC DZT may produce psychological trauma, especially in a girl/woman when she grows tip and is known to be chimeric for a male karyotype and vice versa. although genital organs are generally normal-unlike freemartin in cattle. In addition. CBC in twins may mislead physicians when genotyping, for a disease-susceptibility test is performed ill medical practice in the near future. Blood group chimera may also cause confusion if a blood transfusion is necessary. Therefore, sufficient informed consent prior to ART and genetic counseling before/after birth are absolutely necessary for improved quality of life. It is most likely that all six cases are the consequence of fusion between two outer cell masses from two zygotes. The ART used in the six MC DZT included in vitro fertilization-embryonic transfer (IVF-ET) into the uterus, FSH-induced superovulation followed by intrauterine insemination, and/or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The use of an ovulation-inducing agent and implantation of several fertilized eggs at close sites are probably the events common among these cases. Assisted hatching. simultaneous ET. the use of eggs that have developed to the blastcyst stage. and cell culture procedures that lead to changes of the nature of cell surface, all may increase the chance of a cell fusion. This "chance hypothesis" can simply explain why MC DZT are very rare in natural pregnancy. Large-scale research oil the prevalence of ART-associated MC DZT and long-term follow-tip of the twins are essential.

AB Shrimp aquaculture is the principal seafood product in international trade, and half of the total shrimp production was derived from aquaculture. Vibrio parahaemolyticus, is an opportunistic pathogen that causes symptomatic infections in shrimps as well in seafood. Phage has been proposed as bacterial pathogen controlling agents in a process called phage therapy. Phage particles are natural inhabitants of ecosystem so there is no harm or environmental hazards, while reintroduced into the same environment with enriched count. Based on our initial studies, three phages (VP1, VP7 and VP9) and pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus (BG 24) were taken. Two sets of experiments were conducted as phage (individual and cocktail) dispersed in water and mixed with fed diet to control V. parahaemolyticus infection in Penaeus monodon. According to phage treatment in water, 20% of shrimp mortality was observed. Other individual phage therapies VP1, VP7 and VP9 showed 30, 40 and 40% mortality respectively. During the phage fed diet experimental studies, shrimp immune parameters, gut phage count and bacterial count were monitored. Cocktail of phage fed shrimps produced a good haemocyte count and in control the cell count was drastically decreased. Similarly, total phenoloxidase and respiratory burst activity (superoxide anions) was observed high in cocktail phage treated shrimps. Lysozyme activity was gradually increased in all the phage treated group and significantly reduced in control. The cumulative survival rate stated that the cocktail phage fed shrimps survived 70% after 144 h and others 60-65%. Our results stated that phages also infect V. parahaemolyticus in the shrimp gut and its debris produce an immune response in shrimps, which can battle any infection non-specifically as immune stimulants. Application of phages as cocktile will improve the shrimp immune system and used as therapeutic and prophylactic measure for specific infection in shrimps.
   Statement of relevance: Application of antibiotic may diminish the beneficial microbial flora of shrimp pond. Application of phage particles in water mixed with feed can control the infection in shrimp and pathogenic bacteria count in shrimp surface is quietly reduced. Therefore, phages have the ability to infect and destroy specific bacteria in the pond. Like probiotics and immunomodulators, phages also induce the immune response in shrimp by phage lysed V. parahaemolyticus debris. Moreover, induced non specific immune system in shrimp may combat and control other pathogenic bacteria or virus. Cocktail of phages can wipe out the pathogenic bacteria, even if the bacteria develop resistance against any one of the cocktail phages.
   The applications of phages showed promising results, when orally administered against V. parahaemolyticus infection. This revealed that the use of phages as both a therapeutic and prophylactic measure for infection in shrimp simultaneously reduces seafood pathogen, which causes infection in humans.

AB Depositing cationic polyelectrolytes (PEs) from micellar solutions that include surfactants (SU) onto surfaces is a rich, complex, highly relevant, and challenging topic that covers a broad field of practical applications (e.g., from industrial to personal care). The role of the molecular architecture of the constituents of the PEs are often overruled, or at least and either, underestimated in regard to the surface properties. In this work, we aim to evaluate the effect of a model biomimetic surface that shares the key characteristics of the extreme surface of hair and its concomitant chemo-and physisorbed properties onto the deposition of a complex PEs:SU system. To tackle out the effect of the molecular architecture of the PEs, we consider (i) a purely linear and hydrophilic PE (P-100) and (ii) a PE with lateral amphiphilic chains (PegPE). Using numerical self-consistent field calculations, we show that the architecture of the constituents interfere with the surface properties in a nonintuitive way such that, depending on the amphiphilicity and hydrophilicity of the PEs and the hydrophobicity of the surface, a re-entrant adsorbing transition can be observed, the lipid coverage of the model hair surface being the unique control parameter. Such a behavior is rationalized by the anticooperative associative properties of the coacervate micelles in solution, which is also controlled by the architecture of the PEs and SU. We now expect that PEs adsorption, as a rule, is governed by the molecular details of the species in solution as well as the surface specificities. We emphasize that molecular realistic modeling is essential to rationalize and optimize the adsorption process of, for example, polymer conditioning agents in water-rinsed cosmetic or textile applications.

AB Choline (Ch) is an essential nutrient that seems to be involved in a wide variety of metabolic reactions and functions that affect the nervous system, while thioacetamide (TAA) is a well-known hepatotoxic agent. The induction of prolonged Ch-deprivation (CD) in rats receiving TAA (through the drinking water) provides an experimental model of mild progressive hepatotoxicity that could simulate commonly-presented cases in clinical practice. In this respect, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a 30-day dietary CD and/or TAA administration ( 300 mg/L of drinking water) on the serum total antioxidant status (TAS) and the activities of brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Na+,K+-ATPase and Mg2+-ATPase of adult rats. Twenty male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: A (control), B (CD), C ( TAA), D (CD+TAA). Dietary CD was provoked through the administration of Ch-deficient diet. Rats were sacrificed by decapitation at the end of the 30-day experimental period and whole brain enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically. Serum TAS was found significantly lowered by CD (-11% vs Control, p<0.01) and CD+TAA administration (-19% vs Control, p<0.001), but was not significantly altered due to TAA administration. The rat brain AChE activity was found significantly increased by TAA administration (+11% vs Control, p<0.01), as well as by CD+TAA administration (+14% vs Control, p<0.01). However, AChE was not found to be significantly altered by the 30-day dietary CD. On the other hand, CD caused a significant increase in brain Na+, K+-ATPase activity (+16% vs Control, p<0.05) and had no significant effect on Mg2+-ATPase. Exposure to TAA had no significant effect on Na+,K+-ATPase, but inhibited Mg2+-ATPase (-20% vs Control, p<0.05). When administered to CD rats, TAA caused a significant decrease in Na+,K+-ATPase activity (-41% vs Control, p<0.001), but Mg2+-ATPase activity was maintained into control levels. Our data revealed that an adult-onset 30-day dietary-induced CD had no effect on AChE activity. Treatment with TAA not only reversed the stimulatory effect of CD on adult rat brain Na+, K+-ATPase, but caused a dramatic decrease in its activity (-41%). Previous studies have linked this inhibition with metabolic phenomena related to TAA-induced fulminant hepatic failure and encephalopathy. Our data suggest that CD ( at least under the examined 30-day period) is an unfavorable background for the effect of TAA-induced hepatic damage on Na+, K+-ATPase activity (an enzyme involved in neuronal excitability, metabolic energy production and neurotransmission).

AB Many species frequently return to previously visited foraging sites. This bias towards familiar areas suggests that remembering information from past experience is beneficial. Such a memory-based foraging strategy has also been hypothesized to give rise to restricted space use (i.e. a home range). Nonetheless, the benefits of empirically derived memory-based foraging tactics and the extent to which they give rise to restricted space use patterns are still relatively unknown. Using a combination of stochastic agent-based simulations and deterministic integro-difference equations, we developed an adaptive link (based on energy gains as a foraging currency) between memory-based patch selection and its resulting spatial distribution. We used a memory-based foraging model developed and parameterized with patch selection data of free-ranging bison Bison bison in Prince Albert National Park, Canada. Relative to random use of food patches, simulated foragers using both spatial and attribute memory are more efficient, particularly in landscapes with clumped resources. However, a certain amount of random patch use is necessary to avoid frequent returns to relatively poor-quality patches, or avoid being caught in a relatively poor quality area of the landscape. Notably, in landscapes with clumped resources, simulated foragers that kept a reference point of the quality of recently visited patches, and returned to previously visited patches when local patch quality was poorer than the reference point, experienced higher energy gains compared to random patch use. Furthermore, the model of memory-based foraging resulted in restricted space use in simulated landscapes and replicated the restricted space use observed in free-ranging bison reasonably well. Our work demonstrates the adaptive value of spatial and attribute memory in heterogeneous landscapes, and how home ranges can be a byproduct of non-omniscient foragers using past experience to minimize temporal variation in energy gains.

AB 1 Conscious, Long Evans rats (n = 10), chronically instrumented for the measurement of regional haemodynamics, were studied on 3 consecutive experimental days to assess responses to angiotensin II (AII) (I 25 pmol kg-1, i.v.) and noradrenaline (1 nmol kg-1, i.v.) in the absence and presence of the AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123319 (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) (day 1), the AT1-receptor antagonist, EXP 3174 (1 mg kg-1, i.v.) (day 2), and PD 123319 (10 mg kg-1, i.v.) given 24 h after EXP 3174 (day 3).
   2 In naive rats (day 1), PD 123319 did not antagonize the haemodynamic effects of AII or noradrenaline. EXP 3174 (day 2) caused a marked, prolonged blockade of the haemodynamic effects of AII but not those of noradrenaline. Twenty four h after administration of EXP 3174 (day 3) there was still significant attenuation of the haemodynamic effects of AII. However, administration of PD 123319 at this time caused a further inhibition (lasting 1 h) of the effects of AII but not those of noradrenaline.
   3 An identical 3 day protocol was used in a separate group of rats (n = 6) in which the AT2-receptor antagonist, PD 123177, was given instead of PD 123319, and the results were essentially the same, i.e., PD 123177 significantly attenuated the haemodynamic effects of AII but only when given 24 h after EXP 3174.
   4 In a separate group of rats (n = 4), a low dose of EXP 3174 (60 mug kg-1 i.v.) was given to naive rats in order to simulate the degree of inhibition of the effects of AII seen after administration of AT2-receptor antagonists in animals pretreated with EXP 3174. This low dose of EXP 3174 did not produce a sustained inhibition of the effects of AII and the time course of recovery of All responses was similar to that seen with PD 123319 or PD 123177 given after the high dose of EXP 3174.
   5 The apparent inhibition of the effects of All by the AT2-receptor antagonists, PD 123319 and PD 123177, when these were administered 24 h after the AT1-receptor antagonist, EXP 3174, may have been due to the functional activation of AT2-receptors and/or loss of AT2-receptor antagonist selectivity, and/or the displacement of nonspecifically bound EXP 3174 by AT2-receptor antagonists. While the latter explanation seems the most likely, these results raise the possibility that nonpeptide, AII-receptor antagonists that act at both AT1- and AT2-receptors may have therapeutic advantages over selective AT1-receptor antagonists.

AB Asphaltene, as a destructive fraction of crude oil, reduces productivity by deposition in wells, pipelines and porous media and causes additional pressure drop on the fluid flow. The AUT-Force 110 multifunctional additive has been developed for the first time by the team of researchers of this paper, which has been identified as an inhibitor, dispersant and solvent for asphaltene sediment and its effectiveness has previously been proven. In this study, first, two crude oil sample from southwestern fields of Iran were selected. The selection criteria were differences in asphaltene molecular structure. The structure and molecular geometry of asphaltene have been determined using elemental analysis, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Carbon-13 (C13) nuclear magnetic resonance test. Then asphaltene was coated onto metal powder surface (crude oil pipeline simulator) by means of a unique process. The steel coated with asphaltene was then washed with AUT-Force 110 to determine its effectiveness in separating the asphaltene adsorbed onto the metal surface. SEM images clearly showed that the multifunctional additive, regardless of asphaltene type, was able to change the mechanism of asphaltene adsorption at the metal surface from multilayer to single layer. In addition, Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) demonstrated that in the presence of AUT-Force 110, iron (as the main constituent of metal powder) would increase by more than 12% in acidic asphaltene and more than 4% in basic asphaltene. AUTForce 110 can also remove acidic and basic groups of asphaltene from metal powder surface by altering the electrostatic properties of the surface. The results of the spectroscopy showed that in addition to polar compounds, the multifunctional additive also reduces the amount of aliphatic and paraffinic functional groups at the surface of metal powder. In addition to static conditions, the efficiency of AUT-Force 110 in fluid flow condition was also investigated. For this purpose, two separate laboratory setups were designed and implemented. In the first setup, the surface charge of asphaltene flocs was determined in the presence of an electric field and the results of the zeta potential measurement test were verified. Asphaltene was often observed around the positive electrode (cathode), indicating that the predominant charge of asphaltene samples is negative. However, the higher the number of nitrogenous agents in asphaltene, the lower the amount of asphaltene accumulated around the cathode. In the second setup, a pipeline with accessories was designed to investigate the performance of the AUT-Force 110 as a drag force reducer in the pipeline. The reduction of drag force by AUT-Force 110 occurs with increasing fluid flow rate in the pipe. An increase in the flow rate is equivalent to growth in fluid flow turbulence, which could ultimately provide a better environment for drag reducer to function more efficiently.

AB More consideration on individual attribute or behavior has been recognized as the important segment for a comprehensive understanding of information propagation. In this paper, we investigate the impacts of individual attention-decay effect on dynamical process under the framework of activity-driven network. In order to explicitly describe the attention-decay, a modified model incorporating sub-infected (or decay) status based on SIR is proposed. In the current model, infected individuals may reduce their attentions towards information at a state-dependent decay rate formulated by threshold model, which is determined by the time-varying state of their neighbors. Whereafter, outbreak thresholds of information dynamics under different circumstances are obtained and the comparison with the classic model is also carried out accordingly. The results show that the introduction of attention-decay effect greatly interferes with the outbreak threshold and prevalence scale of information. Extensive numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the validity and efficiency of our theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The flux dynamics of sensitive particles cannot be satisfactorily modeled using the classical diffusion theory. The presence of disturbing exogenous agents (DEAs) in the substratum can introduce critical modifications in the process that induce a bi-flux behavior. This paper presents an alternative approach to anomalous diffusion processes that comprise two simultaneous fluxes. The primary flux responds to the classical Fick's law, whereas the secondary flux is governed by a new law. Particles can move from the primary to the secondary flux, thereby triggering a new dynamical process. The bi-flux behavior presents strong deviations from classical solutions; particularly in anisotropic media. According to common knowledge, localized anisotropy in a substratum disturbing the physical parameters of the diffusion process can act like an attractor of the flow. Besides physicochemical reactions, the population dynamics can also benefit from the new theory. The Hermite finite-element method is employed to obtain the numerical solution for the spatial domain and the backward-difference approach for the time domain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Under low reducing agent rate and high pulverized-coal injection rate operations, coke powder and unburnt char are generated in the blast furnace. These powders flow through the packed bed inside the furnace entrained by the gas flow. The powders accumulation in packed bed will deteriorate gas and liquid permeability and creates an unstable situation inside the blast furnace. Thus, it is important to quantitatively evaluate the accumulation rate on a distribution channel of coke powders. In this study, the behavior of the powder particles passing through the orifice formed by three coarse particles that osculate one another and compound in an equilateral triangle was numerically analyzed using the DEM-CFD. The results revealed the effect of drag force on the powder motion passing through the orifice. Moreover, the effect of the position of the powder passing through the orifice to pressure drop fluctuation inside the triangular prism is also analyzed.

DE Spatial exploration; Persistence; Networks; Random matrices
AB This work explores the features of a graph generated by agents that hop from one node to another node, where the nodes have evolutionary attractiveness. The jumps are governed by Boltzmann-like transition probabilities that depend both on the euclidean distance between the nodes and on the ratio (beta) of the attractiveness between them. It is shown that persistent nodes, i.e., nodes that never been reached by this special random walk are possible in the stationary limit differently from the case where the attractiveness is fixed and equal to one for all nodes (beta = 1). Simultaneously, one also investigates the spectral properties and statistics related to the attractiveness and degree distribution of the evolutionary network. Finally, a study of the crossover between persistent phase and no persistent phase was performed and it was also observed the existence of a special type of transition probability which leads to a power law behaviour for the time evolution of the persistence.

AB The synchronization phenomenon that occurs in the Langerhans islets among pancreatic beta cells is an interesting topic because these cells are responsible for the release of insulin in the blood stream. The aim of this work is to generate in-phase bursting electrical activity (BEA) in beta cells with different behaviors such as active, inactive, and continuous spiking cells based on mathematical models using a discrete time coupling. The approach considers two steps, the former is a mechanism on how to force beta cells to switch from silent phase to active, the latter is based on how to deal with in phase synchronization between active beta cells. The coupling signal is triggered in discrete events caused by the crossing of a threshold of an active beta cell which is given or defined by a Poincare plane. The coupling on the inactive cells is applied to the state in which are the concentrations of agents which regulate the BEA. Based on numerical simulations, synchronization in the insulin release is obtained from beta cells with different behaviors.

AB The parasitoid is a broad evolutionary association of hymenopteran insects which are well-known as biological control agents. Parasites are different from predators because parasites only take resources from one host, whereas predators eat many preys. The preeminent target of this study is to present a fractional model of host-parasitoid population dynamical system through the Caputo operator. The host-parasitoid population dynamical model is a system of three dimensional coupled differential equations. This research also investigates the possibility for obtaining new chaotic behaviors with singular fractional operator and shows the chaotic behavior at different values of fractional order. Furthermore, two numerical schemes Adam-Bashforth-Moulton and new Toufik-Atangana mechanism were suggested to solve fractional host-parasitoid population numerically. Again, some numerical simulations are perform to assess the efficiency of the newly proposed method. Some attractive illustration is presented through graphically. We strongly believe that the proposed work will open various new doors of investigations toward modeling on parasitoid.

AB Current methods for predicting residential burglaries mostly rely on analyses of crime patterns based on a real information. While this model is valid on an urban scale, it fails to consider street-scale environmental factors as well as offender behaviors in response to those factors. To improve the predictability of crime-simulation studies, this study investigated two influential factors in the occurrence of residential burglary: the physical properties of building elements and offender behaviors in response to those properties. First, a prediction algorithm was designed based on analyses of the factors. Next, a prediction method was established by modeling a virtual 3-D environment and a virtual offender using the algorithm. Lastly, the probability of residential burglary was analyzed via a simulation using the prediction method. A comparison of the simulation results with actual residential burglary data confirmed that the proposed method has statistically significant predictability. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Travelling-wave dielectrophoretic phenomena involving cell detection and manipulation are very interesting for biomedical and biotechnological applications. However, electrohydrodynamic phenomena may interfere with the action of dielectrophoresis. The main goal of our study is to calculate the interplay of these effects. In so doing, we have been able to go beyond the order-of-magnitude estimations, which were available in the literature. In this framework we have taken into account the effects of using square signals, which calls for a calculation of the combined polarisability effects due to the superposition of different frequencies. Thermal gradients are also a triggering agent of electrohydrodynamic effects. We have undertaken the pertinent thermal simulations with a concern for the influence of different boundary conditions. The dynamics of the thermal fields were also assessed in order to estimate the characteristic times of electrohydrodynamic phenomena. All these results have been used in a study of the fluid flow pattern motion at different frequencies and its influence on the particle behaviour.

ID EXTRUSION PROCESS
AB Since different colors of plasticine, used to simulate metal forming processes (MFP), are manufactured by adding various agents to a base material, they are different in composition, mechanical properties and in their response to the deformation loads. In addition to selecting appropriate materials and controlling the deformation speed of process, we can also select metal forming lubricants to effectively reduce friction at the interface of die/workpiece. The true characteristics of plasticine were first clearly identified by designing the compression experiments via 2(k) factorial design method with lubrication type, deformation speed, and material type (color) as the main process factors. The obtained data were then analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) method. The results of this statistical study showed that color of plasticine, lubricant type used at the interfaces of the die/workpiece and deformation speed of process had a significant and positive effects on the flow behavior of plasticine as well as two-factor interactions.

AB This study examined the relationship between public-sector performance (PSP) and several aspects of citizenship involvement as perceived by 260 households in a large Israeli city. Participants reported their perceptions of local municipality operation (e.g., human quality of public servants, initiation and creativity, morality, and ethical standards), resultant organizational performance (e.g., satisfaction with operation and satisfaction with services), and two types of citizenry values: active citizenship involvement and faith in citizenship involvement. Five alternative models were suggested to test the relationship. Me employed path analysis of latent variables to test the models. A structural equation modeling (SEM) using LISREL VIII showed the superiority of one model, in which (1) perceptions of public service operation positively affected performance and faith in citizenship involvement and (2) active citizenship involvement was positively affected by faith in citizenship involvement while it simultaneously was negatively affected by PSP The implications of these results are discussed, especially regarding the paradoxical effect of public-sector performance on active citizenship involvement.

AB A deterministic model is developed for the spatial spread of an epidemic disease in a geographical setting. The model is focused on outbreaks that arise from a small number of infected individuals in sub-regions of the geographical setting. The goal is to understand how spatial heterogeneity influences the transmission dynamics of susceptible and infected populations. The model consists of a system of partial differential equations with a diffusion term describing the spatial spread of an underlying microbial infectious agent. The model is applied to simulate the spatial spread of the 2016-2017 seasonal influenza epidemic in Puerto Rico. In this simulation, the reported case data from the Puerto Rican Department of Health are used to implement a numerical finite element scheme for the model. The model simulation explains the geographical evolution of this epidemic in Puerto Rico, consistent with the reported case data.

AB The use of ferromagnetic nanoparticles for hyperthermia and thermoablation therapies has shown great promise in the field of nanobiomedicine. Even local hyperthermia offers numerous advantages as a novel cancer therapy; however, it requires a remarkably high heating power of more than 1 kW g(-1) for heat agents. As a candidate for high heat generation, we focus on ferromagnetic nanoparticles and compare their physical properties with those of superparamagnetic substances. Numerical simulations for ideal single-domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles with cubic and uniaxial magnetic symmetries were carried out and MH curves together with minor loops were obtained. From the simulation, the efficient use of an alternating magnetic field (AMF) having a limited amplitude was discussed. Co-ferrite nanoparticles with various magnitudes of coercive force were produced by co-precipitation and a hydrothermal process. A maximum specific loss power of 420 W g(-1) was obtained using an AMF at 117 kHz with H-0 = 51.4 kA m(-1) (640 Oe). The relaxation behaviour in the ferromagnetic state below the superparamagnetic blocking temperature was examined by Mossbauer spectroscopy.

AB This paper develops and simulates a model of a Bayesian market maker who transacts with noise and position traders in derivative markets. The impact of noise trading is examined relative to price determination in FX futures, noise transmission from futures to options, and risk-management behaviour linking the two markets. The model simulations show noise trading in futures results in wider bid-ask spreads, increased price volatility, and greater variation in hedging costs. Above all, the Bayesian market maker manages price-risk by trend chasing not for speculative purposes, but to avoid being caught on the wrong side of the market. The pecuniary effects from this risk-management strategy suggest that noise trading tends to constrain the market maker's capacity to arbitrage; particularly when the underlying price is mean averting as opposed to a Martingale and trading sessions exhibit significant price volatility.

AB We study by Monte Carlo simulation the coating process of colloidal dimers onto spherical nanoparticles. To this end we investigate a simplified mixture of hard spheres (the guest particles) and hard dimers formed by two tangent spheres of different sizes (the encapsulating agents) in an implicit-solvent representation; in our scheme, the range of effective interactions between the smaller particle in a dimer and a guest sphere depends on their relative size. By tuning the size and concentration of guests, under overall dilute conditions a rich phase behavior emerges: for small sizes and/or low concentrations, the preferred arrangement is compact aggregates (capsules) of variable sizes, where one or few guest particles are coated with dimers; for larger sizes and moderate guest concentrations, other scenarios are realized, including equilibrium separation between a guest-rich and a guest-poor phase. Our results serve as a framework for a more systematic investigation of self-assembled structures of functionalized dimers capable of encapsulating target particles, like for instance bioactive substances in a colloidal dispersion.

AB The response of a spatially non-uniform suspension of spheres to several forcing agents - forces and torques applied to the spheres, and an imposed simple shear - is studied numerically for Stokes flow conditions. While the standard results are recovered in the uniform case, it is found that the nonuniformity of the particle probability distribution gives rise to qualitatively new features. For example, the rheological behavior of the system cannot be described solely in terms of an effective viscosity; a relative velocity between particles and fluid can arise; the particles can either lead or lag the local angular velocity of the fluid elements. It is shown that a mixture effective viscosity can be calculated for all three cases with mutually consistent results. In a subsequent paper the present results will be used to derive in a systematic way closure relations for an averaged-equations description of the suspension. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB This paper analyzes the dynamics of an explicit random process of prices and price expectations of finitely many assets in an economy with overlapping generations of heterogeneous consumers. They maximize expected utility with respect to subjective transition probabilities defined by Markov kernels which describe the forecasting behavior of agents. Give such forecasting rules (predictors) and an exogenous process of dividends, the evolution of equilibrium asset prices and expectations is described by a random dynamical system in the sense of Arnold (1998). The paper investigates the long-run behavior (stationary solutions) by proving the existence and stability of random fixed points for mean-variance preferences under various predictors, including unbiased predictions, and adaptive, as well as OLS forecasting. An explicit characterization of rational expectations solutions is given, providing a full dynamic characterization of asset price processes for the classical CAPM in the case of stationary OLG economies. Numerical simulations are used to compare the performance of the different predictors under an AR(1) dividend process.

AB As the chemical flooding has proved to be one of the most efficient methods to unlock the trapped oil in porous media, studies on any further improvements in the rheological, phase, and flow behaviors of the common Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery (CEOR) agents through the use of nanostructured-based materials have gathered significant importance in the field of petroleum engineering. Despite the extensive research in this area, the role of physical properties of polymers including molecular weight (MW) in the improvement of the flow characteristics of the resultant hybrid in a low-permeable carbonate rock has been scrutinized neither experimentally nor numerically so far. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of dispersed Hydrophilic Silica-Nanoparticles (HSNPs) in the polymer solution on the improvement of oil recovery during polymer flooding. Thus, rheological studies were performed to scrutinize the impacts of salinity, polymer content, and polymer MW on the viscoelastic behavior of the hybrid. An understanding of how the hybrid behaves when flowing through a relatively low-permeable carbonate rock was acquired by conducting core flood experiments. To monitor the mechanisms of the fluid flow and determine the influencing factors in the fluid distribution through complex pore systems, microfluidic models were utilized. The viscoelastic behavior of the hybrid shows that dispersing HSNPs in a polymer solution consisting of a polymer with lower MW can improve the viscosifying ability and non-Newtonian behavior of the solution. This trend becomes more noticeable by increasing polymer content. However, the employed Nanoparticles (NPs) have a distinct impact on the non-Newtonian behavior of the polymers with higher MW. The results from core flooding experiments reveal that the oil recovery factor is nearly 60% of Original Oil In-Place (OOIP) for the hybrid flooding, which displays pronounced enhancement in ultimate oil recovery, due to the proper mobility ratio of the displacement process. Pore-scale observations and the outputs of numerical simulations exhibit that wettability reversal and polymer adsorption reduction are also responsible for the improvement of oil recovery. The findings of this study not only present the underlying mechanisms of oil recovery during the hybrid flooding of low-permeable carbonate rocks but also provide a new reference for formulating a novel CEOR agent.

AB Time is one crucial dimension conveying information in animal communication. Evolution has shaped animals' nervous systems to produce signals with temporal properties fitting their socio-ecological niches. Many quantitative models of mechanisms underlying rhythmic behaviour exist, spanning insects, crustaceans, birds, amphibians, and mammals. However, these computational and mathematical models are often presented in isolation. Here, we provide an overview of the main mathematical models employed in the study of animal rhythmic communication among conspecifics. After presenting basic definitions and mathematical formalisms, we discuss each individual model. These computational models are then compared using simulated data to uncover similarities and key differences in the underlying mechanisms found across species. Our review of the empirical literature is admittedly limited. We stress the need of using comparative computer simulations - both before and after animal experiments - to better understand animal timing in interaction. We hope this article will serve as a potential first step towards a common computational framework to describe temporal interactions in animals, including humans.

AB The formation of emulsions from multiple immiscible fluids is governed by classical concepts such as surface tension, differential chemical affinity and viscosity, and the action of surface-active agents. Much less is known about emulsification when one of the components is active and thus inherently not constrained by the laws of thermodynamic equilibrium. We demonstrate one such realization consisting in the encapsulation of an active liquid crystal (LC)-like gel, based on microtubules and kinesin molecular motors, into a thermotropic LC. These active nematic emulsions exhibit a variety of dynamic behaviors that arise from the cross-talk between topological defects separately residing in the active and passive components. Using numerical simulations, we show a feedback mechanism by which active flows continuously drive the passive defects that, in response, resolve the otherwise degenerated trajectories of the active defects. Our experiments show that the choice of surfactant, which stabilizes the active/passive interface, allows tuning the regularity of the self-sustained dynamic events. The hybrid active-passive system demonstrated here provides new perspectives for dynamic self-assembly driven by an active material but regulated by the equilibrium properties of the passive component.

TI Analytic approach to co-evolving dynamics in complex networks:
   dissatisfied adaptive snowdrift game
SO NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB We investigate the formulation of mean-field (MF) approaches for co-evolving dynamic model systems, focusing on the accuracy and validity of different schemes in closing MF equations. Within the context of a recently introduced co-evolutionary snowdrift game in which rational adaptive actions are driven by dissatisfaction in the payoff, we introduce a method to test the validity of closure schemes and analyse the shortcomings of previous schemes. A previous scheme suitable for adaptive epidemic models is shown to be invalid for the model studied here. A binomial-style closure scheme that significantly improves upon the previous schemes is introduced. Fixed-point analysis of the MF equations not only explains the numerical observed transition between a connected state with suppressed cooperation and a highly cooperative disconnected state, but also reveals a previously undetected connected state that exhibits the unusual behaviour of decreasing cooperation as the temptation for uncooperative action drops. We proposed a procedure for selecting proper initial conditions to realize the unusual state in numerical simulations. The effects of the mean number of connections that an agent carries are also studied.

AB In some complex control tasks, learning a direct mapping from an agent's sensors to its actuators is very difficult. For such tasks, decomposing the problem into more manageable components can make learning feasible. In this paper, we provide a task decomposition, in the form of a decision tree, for one such task. We investigate two different methods of learning the resulting subtasks. The first approach, layered learning, trains each component sequentially in its own training environment, aggressively constraining the search. The second approach, coevolution, learns all the subtasks simultaneously from the same experiences and puts few restrictions on the learning algorithm. We empirically compare these two training methodologies using neuro-evolution, a machine learning algorithm that evolves neural networks. Our experiments, conducted in the domain of simulated robotic soccer keepaway, indicate that neuro-evolution can learn effective behaviors and that the less constrained coevolutionary approach outperforms the sequential approach. These results provide new evidence of coevolution's utility and suggest that solution spaces should not be over-constrained when supplementing the learning of complex tasks with human knowledge.

ID MICROTUBULE SELF-ORGANIZATION; QUANTUM COMPUTATION; TUBULIN; CONDUCTION;
   PATTERNS
AB Microtubules and actin filaments are dynamic fibres constituting the skeleton of living cells. They show seemingly computational behaviours. Indeed, depending on conditions of reaction, they self-organise into temporal and/or spatial morphologies in vitro and act as micro-machine processors and actuators in living cells. Other systems - such as the bacterium-actin system - exist that 'know' how to re-use the cytoskeleton for their own use (e.g. propulsion inside the cell).
   We discuss here about the possible reuse of the cytoskeleton for constructing fibrillar-based Computational systems. I analyze particularly the possible existence of computational events based on 'chemical collisions' between microtubules. A molecular model of microtubule disassembly has been developed to verify that heterogeneities of composition and/or concentration of the chemical medium can torin from shrinking microtubules and persist. They could serve as an efficient communication channel between fibrillar agents. Numerical simulations show that only very weak heterogeneities of composition form around the microtubule ends. However, the model predicts that they are notable when produced by arrays of numerous fibres such as microtubule arrays or cornets of actin.

AB We consider a two-species system of nonlocal interaction PDEs modeling the swarming dynamics of predators and prey, in which all agents interact through attractive/repulsive forces of gradient type. In order to model the predator-prey interaction, we prescribed proportional potentials (with opposite signs) for the cross-interaction part. The model has a particle-based discrete (ODE) version and a continuum PDE version. We investigate the structure of particle stationary solution and their stability in the ODE system in a systematic form, and then consider simple examples. We then prove that the stable particle steady states are locally stable for the fully nonlinear continuum model, provided a slight reinforcement of the particle condition is required. The latter result holds in one space dimension. We complement all the particle examples with simple numerical simulations, and we provide some two-dimensional examples to highlight the complexity in the large time behavior of the system.

AB Limiting the threat of free-riding behavior is an important design issue for peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks. However, the fairness policy that rewards contributors with credit in one of the most popular P2P file sharing networks, eMule/eDonkey, hasn't been thoroughly studied. In this paper, motivated by our experiments with the eMule/eDonkey network, we firstly theoretically analyze the content exchange process with credit in eMule/eDonkey and then verify the mathematical model by an agent-based simulation. Both the numerical and simulation-based results confirm our discovery in the experiments that eMule/eDonkey's local credit strategy can not provide enough fairness as it doesn't explicitly punish free-riders. To overcome this drawback, we propose a new free-riding control scheme, which can simply maintain the current credit local structure and take advantage of the credit policy. Extensive numerical evaluation and simulation indicate that this scheme significantly improves system fairness.

AB The problem of managing effective pedestrian evacuation during disruptions is a significant challenge because of the complexity and randomness of the passenger flow dynamics as well as the difficulty in predicting the responsive behaviour of the passengers. In this study, a hybrid agent-based and discrete-event simulation model of passenger flow is designed and implemented to assess the service level performance and the crowdedness ratio in a transfer metro station. This study investigates the statistical significance of the results obtained by the design alternatives and the safety analysis of a multiple-level transfer station through a real-world case study. The simulation model is designed to test various disruption scenarios, including train failure in the tunnel, as well as fire at the station gallery of a crowded metro station. The simulation result shows that the evacuation time can be decreased by 19.5%, compared with the basic design layout.

DT Article
ID PLASTICITY; CORTEX
AB The notion that behaviour influences perception seems self-evident, but the mechanism of their interaction is not known. Perception and behaviour are usually considered to be separate processes. In this view, perceptual learning constructs compact representations of sensory events, reflecting their statistical properties(1,2), independently of behavioural relevance(3,4). Behavioural learning(5,6), however, forms associations between perception and action, organized by reinforcement(7,8), without regard for the construction of perception. It is generally assumed that the interaction between these two processes is internal to the agent, and can be explained solely in terms of the neuronal substrate(9). Here we show, instead, that perception and behaviour can interact synergistically via the environment. Using simulated and real mobile robots, we demonstrate that perceptual learning directly supports behavioural learning and so promotes a progressive structuring of behaviour. This structuring leads to a systematic bias in input sampling, which directly affects the organization of the perceptual system. This external, environmentally mediated feedback matches the perceptual system to the emerging behavioural structure, so that the behaviour is stabilized.

AB Determination of the existence of intervisibility between pairs of points above realistically undulating terrain is a fundamental operation within land-based military simulations. However, transitions between regions where an intelligently piloted vehicle is respectively exposed and concealed are of particular importance, yet are often very difficult to identify a priori. Tn this paper we show how a meaningful gradient of intervisibility can be directly calculated, and we argue that this provides a valuable indication of the direction to the nearest point of opposite visibility. Moreover, direct methods for evaluating such gradients are also relevant to some classes of behavioural models for vehicles moving over such terrain. Numerical simulation results are presented in support of the theoretical analyses.
   We will also outline how. simple randomized, yet differentiable topography, exhibiting realistic undulations, can be conveniently generated as a thermalized elastic manifold. The availability of such an ensemble of different topographies provides a powerful test of the adaptability of any terrain-dependent algorithm, and forms an integral part of the validation of our analysis.

AB Traveling waves form a basic class of solutions to reaction-diffusion equations, which can describe a large number of phenomena. The basic property characterizing traveling wave solutions is their speed of propagation. In this study we analyze its dependence on the diffusivities of the interacting agents. We show that this dependence is subject to some relations, which can be derived by simple scaling properties. We augment our findings by an investigation of reaction-diffusion systems describing intercellular calcium dynamics in the presence of buffer molecules. We establish some mathematical results concerning the behavior of the velocity of traveling waves in the case of fast buffer kinetics, (paying special attention to the vicinity of zero speed), and present outcomes of numerical simulations showing how complicated the interplay between the diffusion coefficients of calcium and buffering molecules can be, especially in models with more than one kind of buffer molecules.

AB Organizational structure affects both the overall behavior of firms and the situations of individuals and subunits within firms. The effect of exogenous changes in the environment (market prices, costs, or regulations) on organizations can be partitioned into the immediate direct effect of the change and the full effect after organizational structure has had time to adjust. This paper develops a computational model of the diffusion of a profitable innovation through a firm, and uses numerical simulations to calculate the relative importance of the direct and structural adjustment components of changes in profitability. One finding is that a failure to recognize the importance of organizational structure on the performance of firms will lead to serious bias in estimation of the costs or benefits of a change in external circumstances. The type of network model developed also has implications for the individuals and divisions that make up the firm. We examine some of the structural characteristics of well-adapted organizations, and show that asymmetries and economic inequalities emerge even when the individual agents' personal characteristics are identical.

AB Two-lane two-way urban streets play a significant role in the transportation system. Due to the high mixture of traffic flow, few models are capable of describing the complex interaction with multiple types of agents involved. This paper proposes a Strategy Selection and Transition (SSAT) model formulated as a hierarchical 'Motivation-Decision-Action' framework. The motivation layer uses the Risk-Motion-Field to select a driving strategy as the driving intention. Then, the decision layer dynamically adjusts the intention through the strategy transition embodied in a well-defined Finite-State Machine. Finally, in the action layer, a set of corresponding operational models specify the decided behavior into control parameters. As per our numerical test, SSAT model outperforms VISSIM and TransModeler, which are two widely-used simulation software, at the macroscopic level. Besides, overtaking-distance ratio and trajectory distribution replicate the evidence of the highly mixed traffic flow. In addition, the case study is also satisfactory.

AB The release behavior of typical commercial tissue expanders has been examined by carrying out two kinds of experiments: 1) Determination of chemical nature and its modification after in vivo use by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. This study has been parallelled by scanning electron microscopy with associated energy dispersive X-ray analysis of surface, as well as by silicon compounds analysis of tissues around implants. 2) Kinetic examination of silicon compounds released by the biomaterial in physiologic solution at 36 +/- 0.3 degrees C. Results of these investigations have shown independently that the starting material was not a filler-free, pure polymer, but a composite, reinforced elastomer, with the reinforcing agent most seemingly represented by silicon dioxide. Release of latter, with a relatively fast kinetics, is compatible with data of the simulating laboratory runs in the physiologic solution. All these facts seem to rule out any hypothesis of a prevailing siloxane oligomer migration. The correlation of kinetic and physicochemical tests with the in vivo behavior is discussed.

AB We present a novel approach towards the financial Ising model. Most studies utilize the model to find settings which generate returns closely mimicking the financial stylized facts such as fat tails, volatility clustering and persistence, and others. We tackle the model utility from the other side and look for the combination of parameters which yields return dynamics of the efficient market in the view of the efficient market hypothesis. Working with the Ising model, we are able to present nicely interpretable results as the model is based on only two parameters. Apart from showing the results of our simulation study, we offer a new interpretation of the Ising model parameters via inverse temperature and entropy. We show that in fact market frictions (to a certain level) and herding behavior of the market participants do not go against market efficiency but what is more, they are needed for the markets to be efficient.

AB From experiments by Foe and von Dassow (Foe, V. E., and G. von Dassow. 2008. J. Cell Biol. 183: 457-470) and others, we infer a molecular mechanism for positioning the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Computer simulations reveal how this mechanism depends on quantitative motor-behavior details and explore how robustly this mechanism succeeds across a range of cell sizes. The mechanism involves the MKLP1 (kinesin-6) component of centralspindlin binding to and walking along microtubules to stimulate cortical contractility where the centralspindlin complex concentrates. The majority of astral microtubules are dynamically unstable. They bind most MKLP1 and suppress cortical Rho/myosin II activation because the tips of unstable microtubules usually depolymerize before MKLP1s reach the cortex. A subset of astral microtubules stabilizes during anaphase, becoming effective rails along which MKLP1 can actually reach the cortex. Because stabilized microtubules aim statistically at the equatorial spindle midplane, that is where centralspindlin accumulates to stimulate furrow formation.

DE Autonomous agents; collision avoidance; deep learning in robotics and

AB We learn end-to-end point-to-point and pathfollowing navigation behaviors that avoid moving obstacles. These policies receive noisy lidar observations and output robot linear and angular velocities. The policies are trained in small, static environments with AutoRL, an evolutionary automation layer around reinforcement learning (RL) that searches for a deep RL reward and neural network architecture with large-scale hyper-parameter optimization. AutoRL first finds a reward that maximizes task completion and then finds a neural network architecture that maximizes the cumulative of the found reward. Empirical evaluations, both in simulation and on-robot, show that AutoRL policies do not suffer from the catastrophic forgetfulness that plagues many other deep reinforcement learning algorithms, generalize to new environments and moving obstacles, are robust to sensor, actuator, and localization noise, and can serve as robust building blocks for larger navigation tasks. Our path-following and point-to-point policies are, respectively, 23% and 26% more successful than comparison methods across new environments.

AB We study the role of strategy correlations and timing of adaptation for the dynamics of Minority Games, both simulationally and analytically. Using the exact generating functional approach a la De Dominicis we compute the phase diagram and the behaviour of batch and on-line games with correlated strategies, complementing exisiting replica studies of their statics. It is shown that the timing of adaptation can be relevant; while conventional games with uncorrelated strategies are nearly insensitive to the choice of on-line versus batch learning, we find qualitative differences when anti-correlations are present in the strategy assignments. The available standard approximations for the volatility in terms of persistent order parameters in the stationary ergodic states become unreliable in batch games under such circumstances. We then comment on the role of oscillations and the relation to the breakdown of ergodicity. Finally, it is discussed how the generating functional formalism can be used to study mixed populations of so-called 'producers' and 'speculators' in the context of the batch Minority Games.

DE Cooperation; Spatial correlations; Evolutionary game theory
AB The evolution of cooperation is studied within the context of an evolutionary snowdrift game on three special networks chosen to have the same uniform degree but with different extents of spatial correlations. The cooperative behaviors on the networks differ in where the phase transitions take place and the frequencies of cooperation in the mixed phase. With only the spatial correlations being different, the study allows us to gauge the accuracy of different theoretical approaches and shed light on the choice of theoretical approaches in handling spatial correlations. It is found that analyzing the last surviving patterns often provides an understanding in the transitions in the cooperative behavior. We also construct a theoretical framework to describe the dynamical process. For different approaches of incorporating the agents' spatial correlations, the local configuration approximation captures all the features observed in numerical simulations, while the commonly used pair approximation is too crude for quantitative purposes in studying cooperation, especially on networks with more complicated spatial correlations.

AB Purpose Knowledge sharing is an important way to improve the knowledge system of industrial construction, and the supervision mechanism is an important way to improve the efficiency of knowledge sharing. However, some research works and practices indicate that the effects of applying the supervision mechanism are not obvious. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to propose an incentive method of knowledge sharing based on the supervision mechanism for promoting knowledge sharing among member enterprises in the industrial construction supply chain. Design/methodology/approach A basic incentive model and an optimization model of knowledge sharing in the industrial construction supply chain based on the supervision mechanism were developed via the principal-agent theory. Weighted coefficients of explicit and implicit knowledge sharing were introduced into the basic model, while the supervision reward was added into the basic model of the optimization model. The effect of these two models was compared and analyzed via numerical simulation. Findings The optimal incentive coefficient and effort level of knowledge sharing can be obtained by solving the two aforementioned models. The results of the comparison between the two models indicate that the introduction of a supervisory reward improved the effort level and expected earnings produced by knowledge sharing, but reduced the confirmed equal earnings Research limitations/implications - Mutual transformation between tacit and explicit knowledge was not considered, and supervisory costs were also not considered, in the estimation of the output of knowledge sharing. Practical implications - The new models proposed by this study provide theoretical guidance for the design of knowledge sharing incentive measures in the industrial construction supply chain based on the supervision mechanism. The findings suggest that member enterprises should pay attention to the costs of knowledge sharing, in order to obtain more benefits.of member enterprises in the industrial construction supply chain.
   Originality/value This study introduced the weight coefficients of explicit and implicit knowledge sharing into a previous incentive model, proposed an incentive optimization model of knowledge sharing in the industrial construction supply chain based on a supervisory mechanism, and revealed the change rules of related variables that affect the model with the change in weight coefficients. The findings verify the effectiveness of introducing supervisory reward measures and extend the range of theoretical application.

AB In-situ leaching (ISL) could be a viable alternative to conventional open cut mining, which is becoming increasingly uneconomic and energy intensive with increasing global mineral extraction and decreasing ore-grade. However, ISL is only applicable in permeable rock media. ISL has the potential to be adopted as an economic and energy efficient mining technology, provided that effective and safe artificial fracture stimulation can be performed in host rock to enhance permeability. In this paper, the fracture performance of a slow energy releasing fracturing agent known as 3G-DTM (3rd generation disruptive technology for mining) in jointed rock masses was assessed. Sandstone specimens (80 mm x 80 mm x 50 mm, L x W x H) with artificially created joints were fractured by injecting 3G-DTM into a pre-drilled injection well of each specimen. These fractured specimens were CT scanned to map the produced fracture pattern. The experiments were also simulated numerically using particle flow code (PFC3D 5.0) to further investigate the fracture performance of 3G-DTM in jointed rocks. The results reveal that the fracture propagation terminates at the joint interface. Furthermore, as the distance from the joint to the injection well reduces (from 40 mm to 4 mm), the fracture density of the numerical simulation reduces (crack count from 19.441 to 11,320) due to increased strain energy dissipation at the rock joint (a reduction of the total system strain energy from 4.1 J to 2.4 J). Joint orientation with respect to the injection well showed little variation except when the joint was oriented at 45 degrees to the injection well. At this orientation, additional shear fractures (an increase by 22% on average compared to the other cases) were observed in the fracture network in addition to the predominantly tensile fractures found otherwise. A two-staged fracturing process was observed when the joint passed through the injection well. The numerical simulation extended for rock masses with more complex joint geometries indicate that 3G-DTM charging produces a denser fracture network (crack count from 19,570 to 28,881) with an increase in the number of fracture intersections with a transect per unit length (from 10 to 40). This is favourable for artificial fracture stimulation in field applications, even in jointed rock masses. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The purpose of this work is to present a simple, fast, cost effective and environmentally friendly magnetic dispersive solid-phase microextraction (MDSPME) method, employing a composite based on ZSM-5 zeolite decorated with iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (i.e., ZSM-5/Fe2O3) as a valuable sorbent, for the simultaneous separation and preconcentration of cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) from urine samples for subsequent measurement by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. The composite was first saturated with zinc and then modified with a hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide surfactant and sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate chelating agent. A two-step multivariate strategy, using Plackett-Burman and circumscribed central composite designs, has been employed to optimize experimental parameters affecting MDSPME. The method has been evaluated under optimized extraction conditions (i.e., amount of sorbent, 50 mg; sample pH, 4.0; extraction time, 3 min; eluent solvent, nitric acid; eluent solvent volume, 432 L; eluent solvent concentration, 11.8 M and elution time, 2 min) using standard addition calibration. Calibration curves using standards between 0 and 100 mu g L-1 gave a good linearity with correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.998 to 0.9997 for Cd, from 0.998 to 0.9998 for Hg and from 0.9996 to 0.9999 for Pb (N = 8). The repeatability of the method has been evaluated at 3 and 50 g L-1 obtaining coefficients of variation between 2 and 5% (n = 6). The limit of detection values ranged from 0.15 to 0.20 mu g L-1 for Cd, from 0.42 to 0.73 mu g L-1 for Hg and from 0.23 to 0.39 mu g L-1 for Pb. These values satisfy the threshold limit (3.4 g L-1 for Cd, 10.0 Vg L-1 for Hg and 85.0 mu g L-1 for Pb) established by the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Spain) for normal content of these metals in human urine and by the World Health Organization for normal mercury content in urine (i.e., 10 mu g L-1). Finally, three urine samples were used to assess the applicability of the developed procedure. Recovery values ranged between 87 and 107% showing negligible matrix effects.

AB Introduction: Invasive Pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a leading cause of infection-associated death in immunosuppressed patients. Early detection and early administration of antifungal therapy are critical factors in improving outcome for patients with IPA. Here, we evaluated the imaging properties of a In-111-labeled cyclic peptide targeted to Aspergillus fumigatus in an immunosuppressed murine model of IPA.
   Methods: A cyclic peptide c(CGGRLGPFC)-NH2 was labeled with In-111 by means of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA). Two days after intranasal inoculation of 17.5 x 10(6) conidia of A. fumigatus, mice were injected In-111-DTPA-c(CGGRLGPFC)-NH2 intravenously. Biodistribution data were obtained at 2 h, and gamma-images were acquired at 10 min and 2 h after radiotracer injection. Healthy mice were used as controls. In addition, a group of infected mice were co-injected with the radiotracer and unlabeled c(CGGRLGPFC)-NH2 to evaluate the inhibition of radiotracer's binding to infected lungs. Autoradiographs of lungs from infected and healthy mice were compared with corresponding photographs of transaxial sections of the lung tissues stained for A. fumigatus hyphae.
   Results: The labeling efficiency was >98%, with specific radioactivity of up to 74 MBq/nmol peptide. Significantly higher uptake of In-111-DTPA-c(CGGRLGPFC)-NH2 was observed in the lungs of mice infected with A. fumigatus than in those of healthy mice (0.37 +/- 0.06 %ID/g vs. 0.14 +/- 0.02 %ID/g, P=.00044). Simultaneous injection with unlabeled peptide reduced radioactivity in the infected lungs by 41% (P=.0037). Increased radioactivity in the lungs of infected mice was visible in gamma images at both 10 min and 2 h after radiotracer injection. Moreover, autoradiography confirmed radiotracer uptake in infected lungs, but not in the lungs of healthy mice or infected mice co-injected with unlabeled peptide.
   Conclusions: gamma-Imaging with In-111-DTPA-c(CGGRLGPFC)-NH2 clearly delineated experimental IPA in mice. Peptides directly targeting fungi therefore may be valuable agents for noninvasive detection of opportunistic mycoses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB It is well accepted that non-polar oils can be used as collector extender in oil agglomeration flotation of many different types of mineral. In this paper, in order to study the influences of oil structures on the non-polar oil assisted dodecylamine (DDA) flotation of quartz, the research focuses on the interaction of DDA (collector) and non-polar oil (collector extender) in aqueous phase. In this work, saturated hydrocarbon dodecane and cyclohexane, unsaturated hydrocarbon dodecene, aromatic hydrocarbon dimethylbenzene and 1-methylnaphthalene were chosen as researched subjects, and the influences of oil structures on interfacial activity of oil-DDA-water ternary models were investigated by experimental and theoretical methods. The flotation results demonstrated that the collecting capability of the oil and DDA combination follows the order of 1-methylnaphthalene > dimethylbenzene > dodecene > cyclohexane > dodecane. Moreover, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation is performed to investigate the interfacial property of these five non-polar oil-DDA-water systems, and five parameters, radial distribution functions, interaction energy, density distribution, interfacial thickness and self diffusion coefficient are proposed to reveal the influence mechanism of molecular structure on interfacial activity of the ternary oil-DDA-water systems. The same trends are obtained from the parameters described above, aromatic hydrocarbon dimethylbenzene and 1-methylnaphthalene performance better than saturate hydrocarbon and unsaturated hydrocarbon. The researched results indicate the interaction between non-polar oil and DDA hydrophobic alkyl tail would enhance the mobility of oil component, which induce significant change of interfacial thickness and diffusivity. Additionally, the interaction between DDA hydrophilic head group and water molecules via strong hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions and weak electrostatic attraction would lead to water molecules penetrate through DDA monolayer and adsorb on oil surface. The researches enable us to obtain a deeper microscopic-level understanding of the interaction between oil-DDA-water ternary components, and maybe have some references for designing of oil-assisted flotation agent.

AB Density functional theory has been applied to an ab initio Study of the molecular and the dissociative adsorption of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) oil TiO2. Rutile (110)-(1 x 1) and anatase (101)-(1 x 1) Surfaces, free of defects and of OH, have been modeled using two-dimensionally periodic slabs (2-DPS) and also clusters with unsaturated edge atoms terminated with pseudohydrogen. Molecular adsorption Occurs via the formation of a Ti-5c center dot center dot center dot O=P dative bond at unsaturated, 5-fold-coordinated Ti Surface sites. C-H center dot center dot center dot O bonds between CH3 groups and surface 0 atoms also contribute, but dative bonding between methoxy O atoms and Ti-5c sites has no significant effect. In 2-DPS calculations, all TiO2 Surfaces considered give about the same adsorption energy (Delta E-ads)for molecular adsorption. There does, however, appear to be a small variation among the different Substrates whereby Delta E-ads increases with Surface energy. Two spectroscopic Signatures of molecular adsorption have been computed. One is a shift of -70 cm(-1), relative to the gas-phase value, in the nu(P=O) stretching frequency, and the other is a shift of 0.5 eV to higher bindind energy, relative to the gas-phase value, of the molecular HOMO. Several hypothetically possible products have been considered for the first step in dissociative adsorption. The most favorable is a (CH3)(CH3O)P(-O-)(2) bridge between two Ti-5c Sites together with a CH3 bonded to the O atom of a (Ti-)(2)O-2c site. This model is consistent with experimental results for DMMP adsorption oil OH-free rutile (110) surfaces. Oil all TiO2 Surfaces considered, dissociative adsorption is more exothermic than molecular adsorption. In 2-DPS calculations, Delta E-ads for dissociative adsorption is essentially the same for rutile (110) and anatase (101), but is smaller than that for anatase (010). The cluster models give results that are generally consistent with those of 2-DPS models; however, Delta E-ads is somewhat overestimated in the cluster Calculations.

AB The family of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE), also termed prion diseases, is a group of fatal, neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of a misfolded protein, the disease-associated prion protein PrPSc. This glycoprotein differs in secondary structure from its normal, cellular isoform PrPC, which is physiologically expressed mostly by neurons. Scrapie is a prion disease first described in the 18th century in sheep and goats, and has been established as a model in rodents to study the pathogenesis and pathology of prion diseases. Assuming a multitude of molecular parameters change in the tissue in the course of the disease, FTIR microspectroscopy has been proposed as a valuable new method to study and identify prion-affected tissues due to its ability to detect a variety of changes in molecular structure and composition simultaneously. This paper reviews and discusses results from previous FTIR microspectroscopic studies on nervous tissue of scrapie-infected hamsters in the context of histological and molecular alterations known from conventional pathogenesis studies. In particular, data from studies reporting on disease-specific changes of protein structure characteristics, and also results of a recent study on hamster dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are discussed. These data include an illustration on how the application of a brilliant IR synchrotron light source enables the in situ investigation of localized changes in protein structure and composition in nervous cells or tissue due to PrPSc deposition, and a demonstration on how the IR spectral information can be correlated with results of complementary studies using immunohistochemistry and x-ray fluorescence techniques. Using IR microspectroscopy, some neurons exhibited a high accumulation of disease-associated prion protein evidenced by an increased amount of beta-sheet at narrow regions in or around the infected nervous cells. However, not all neurons from terminally diseased hamsters showed PrPSc deposition. Generally, the average spectral differences between all control and diseased DRG spectra are small but consistent as demonstrated by independent experiments. Along with studies on the purified misfolded prion protein, these data suggest that synchrotron FTIR microspectroscopy is capable of detecting the misfolded prion protein in situ without the necessity of immunostaining or purification procedures.

AB Purpose: Imatimb (Glivec) has been established as a highly effective therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. The recommended daily dosage of 400-600 mg requires simultaneous intake of up to six of the current 100-mg capsules. Due to the need to swallow multiple capsules per dose, there is a potential negative impact on treatment adherence; therefore, a new imatinib 400-mg film-coated tablet has been developed. To improve dosing flexibility, particularly with regard to the pediatric population and the management of adverse events, a scored 100-mg film-coated tablet has also been introduced. Experimental design: A group of 33 healthy subjects were randomly assigned to one of six treatment sequences, in which they received imatinib as 4x100-mg capsules (reference), 4x100-mg scored tablets (test), and 1x400-mg tablet (test). Blood sampling was performed for up to 96 h after dosing, followed by a 10-day washout period prior to the next sequence. After the third dosing, subjects were monitored to assess delayed drug-related adverse events. Pharmacokinetic parameters were assessed using concentration-time curves for plasma imatinib and its metabolite CGP74588. Results: Median T-max, was 2.5 h for capsules and tablets. Mean AUC((0-inf)) values were 27094, 26081 and 25464 ng.h/ml for 4x100-mg capsules, 4x100-mg tablets, and 1x400-mg tablets, respectively. C-max values were 1748, 1638 and 1606 ng/ml, and t(1/2) values were 15.8, 15.9 and 15.7 h. The test/reference ratios for AUC((0-inf)), AUC((0-96 h)), and C-max were 0.98, 0.98 and 0.95 for 4x100-mg tablets versus 4x100-mg capsules, and 0.95, 0.95 and 0.92 for 1x400-mg tablet versus 4x100-mg capsules. The 95% confidence intervals were fully contained within the interval (0.80, 1.25). Eight mild and one moderate adverse event considered to be drug related were reported. These events showed no clustering by type of dosage form and were of little to no clinical significance. Conclusions: Film-coated 100-mg (scored) and 400-mg tablet dose forms of imatinib are bioequivalent to the commercial 100-mg hard-gelatin capsule, and are as safe and well tolerated.

AB Purpose: To investigate the feasibility of fast and simultaneous assessment of T-1, T-2, and M-0 (relative proton density) changes in skeletal muscle studies using an inversion recovery true fast imaging with steady-state precession (TrueFISP) sequence.
   Materials and Methods: NMR signal dynamics in calf muscles were analyzed under four different conditions: intravenous injection of a low-molecular weight Gd contrast agent (CA), postarterial occlusion reactive hyperemia, local cooling, and an exercise bout. Experiments were conducted on a clinical 3T whole-body scanner.
   Results: At rest, average muscle T-1 and T-2 values obtained from the IR-TrueFISP experiments were 1.34 +/- 0.13 seconds and 45 +/- 5 msec, respectively (median 6 standard deviation). 1) Noticeable T-1 decreases (Delta T-1 max approximate to-30%) were measured in the calf muscles after CA injection, while no significant changes were observed for T-2 and M-0. 2) T-2 increased rapidly during reactive hyperemia and reached a peak value (+6%) at about 1 minute post-ischemia. During ischemia, a significant decrease was observed only in the soleus muscle. No significant paradigm-related changes in M-0 and T-1 were noted in all muscle groups, except in the m. soleus (Delta T-1 approximate to+1% during reactive hyperemia). 3) Opposite variations in muscle T-1 (Delta T-1 max approximate to-30%) and M-0 (Delta M-0 max approximate to+25%) associated with local cooling were detected. 4) Concomitant changes in T-1 (Delta T-1 max approximate to+15%), T-2 (Delta T-2 max approximate to+35%), and M-0 (Delta M-0 max approximate to+16%) were observed in the activated muscles following the exercise bout.
   Conclusion: IR-TrueFISP was sufficiently fast and sensitive to detect small and transient T-1, T-2, and M-0 changes in the calf muscles under different experimental conditions. The sequence offers a time-resolution adequate to track rapid physiological adaptations in skeletal muscle.

AB Epidemiological models of infectious diseases are essential tools in support of risk assessment, surveillance design, and contingency planning in public and animal health. Direct pathogen transmission from host to host is an essential process of each host pathogen system and respective epidemiological modeling concepts. It is widely accepted that numerous diseases involve indirect transmission (IT) through pathogens shed by infectious hosts to their environment. However, epidemiological models largely do not represent pathogen persistence outside the host explicitly. We hypothesize that this simplification might bias management-related model predictions for disease agents that can persist outside their host for a certain time span. We adapted an individual-based, spatially explicit epidemiological model that can mimic both transmission processes. One version explicitly simulated indirect pathogen transmission through a contaminated environment. The second version simulated direct host-to-host transmission only. We aligned the model variants by the transmission potential per infectious host (i.e., basic reproductive number R0) and the spatial transmission kernel of the infection to allow unbiased comparison of predictions. The quantitative model results are provided for the example of surveillance plans for early detection of foot-and-mouth disease in wild boar, a social host. We applied systematic sampling strategies on the serological status of randomly selected host individuals in both models. We compared between the model variants the time to detection and the area affected prior to detection, measures that strongly influence mitigation costs. Moreover, the ideal sampling strategy to detect the infection in a given time frame was compared between both models. We found the simplified, direct transmission model to underestimate necessary sample size by up to one order of magnitude but to overestimate the area put under control measures. Thus, the model predictions underestimated surveillance efforts but overestimated mitigation costs. We discuss parameterization of IT models and related knowledge gaps. We conclude that the explicit incorporation of IT mechanisms in epidemiological modeling may reward by adapting surveillance and mitigation efforts.

AB Gut microbiome disequilibrium is increasingly implicated in host fitness reductions, including for the economically important and disease-challenged western honey bee Apis mellifera. In laboratory experiments, the antibiotic tetracycline, which is used to prevent American Foulbrood Disease in countries including the US, elevates honey bee mortality by disturbing the microbiome. It is unclear, however, how elevated individual mortality affects colony-level fitness.
   We used an agent-based model (BEEHAVE) and empirical data to assess colony-level effects of antibiotic-induced worker bee mortality, by measuring colony size. We investigated the relationship between the duration that the antibiotic-induced mortality probability is imposed for and colony size.
   We found that when simulating antibiotic-induced mortality of worker bees from just 60 days per year, up to a permanent effect, the colony is reduced such that tetracycline treatment would not meet the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) honey bee protection goals. When antibiotic mortality was imposed for the hypothetical minimal exposure time, which assumes that antibiotics only impact the bee's fitness during the recommended treatment period of 15 days in both spring and autumn, the colony fitness reduction was only marginally under the EFSA's threshold.
   Synthesis and Applications. Modelling colony-level impacts of antibiotic treatment shows that individual honey bee worker mortality can lead to colony mortality. To assess the full impact, the persistence of antibiotic-induced mortality in honey bees must be determined experimentally, in vivo. We caution that as the domestication of new insect species increases, maintaining healthy gut microbiomes is of paramount importance to insect health and commercial productivity. The recommendation from this work is to limit prophylactic use of antibiotics and to not exceed recommended treatment strategies for domesticated insects. This is especially important for highly social insects as excess antibiotic use will likely decrease colony growth and an increase in colony mortality.

AB Objective. To determine the effect of the coadministration of the multidrug resistance (MDR) modulators cyclosporin A (CyA) alone or plus dexverapamil (D-Ver) on idarubicin (IDA) pharmacokinetics in patients with acute leukemia.
   Methods: Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in 27 patients with a diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), who were being treated with a combination chemotherapy regimen including idarubicin and cytarabine for the induction of a first remission (n = 14), or of a second remission (n = 7), or for remission consolidation (n = 6). Of these 27 patients, nine were coadministered CyA and seven were coadministered CyA plus D-Ver as MDR modulators. Blood was sampled at appropriate intervals after each of the three IDA daily administrations. IDA and idarubicinol (IDAOL) were assayed by HPLC. Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed by means of a two-compartment open model with zero-order absorption and first-order elimination using the WinNonlin pharmacokinetic software package.
   Results: CyA markedly increased the area under the concentration time-curve (AUC) of both IDA [558.26 (197.25) mu g.h.l(-1) vs 315.44 (158.28) mu g.h.l(-1); P < 0.01] and IDAOL [2896.60 (736.383) mu g.h.l(-1) vs 1028.49 (603.95) mu g.h.l(-1); P < 0.001] when coadministered as a single modulator, due to a lower total body clearance (CL) [83.51 (52.44) l.h(-1).m(-2) vs 139.65 (69.45) l.h(-1).m(-2); NS]. When patients received two MDR modulators simultaneously (D-Ver plus CyA), IDA exposure was essentially the same as in those of the no inhibitor group [331.29 (95.49) mu g.h.l(-1) vs 315.44 (158.28) mu g.h.l(-1); NS], whereas the IDAOL total body exposure was greater than in the no inhibitor group [2030.32 (401.11) mu g.h.l(-1) vs 1028.49 (603.95) mu g.h.l(-1); P < 0.01], even if less than in patients receiving CyA as a single MDR modulator (IDA + CyA group) [AUC 2030.32 (401.11) mu g.h.l(-1) vs 2896.60 (736.38) mu g.h.l(-1); P < 0.05], suggesting an antagonistic effect against those of CyA on IDA and IDAOL elimination and/or an unpredictable redistribution. The main pharmacokinetic parameters of IDA, such as CL and volume of distribution at steady state (Vd(ss)), were remarkably affected by the coadministration of CyA or CyA plus D-Ver, but no statistically significant difference was noted because of IDA pharmacokinetic interpatient variation.
   Conclusion: The results show that CyA alone at a dose of 10 mg.kg(-1) daily significantly increased systemic body exposure to both IDA and IDAOL in acute leukemia, and suggest that these pharmacokinetic effects were at least partially decreased when D-Ver was coadministered with CyA. Our findings raise important questions concerning the need for a dosage adjustment of IDA when MDR modulators are coadministered.

AB Olduvai site integrity has been questioned through interpretations of fluvial inputs on most assemblages from Beds I and II that rest on a contradictory use of taphonomic variables, lack of geological support, and lack of adequate experimentally-supported referential frameworks. Most variables used to address fluvial impact in faunal assemblages have been independently used in other contexts and all of them are subjected to variable degrees of equifinality. Their resolution when applied to archaeological assemblages is low. A more recent approach founded on experimentation simulating actual archaeological sites shows that it is the intrinsic properties of each bone specimen (i.e., composition and shape) that best determine the resistance of each bone to be moved by water, regardless of size. The application of this approach, which combines the relative representation of specimens according to their composition (i.e., texture: dense or spongy-trabecular or mixed) and shape (flat, tube, or cube-polyhedral), shows not only that fluvial inputs on bone assemblages can be well detected, but also that the scale and magnitude of such inputs can be efficiently assessed. Thus, site formation can be more accurately interpreted with the aid of these new experimental analogical frameworks. A selection of some of the most relevant Olduvai sites from Bed I and Bed II have been used to show that all represent autochthonous concentrations of fossil materials and that their potential fluvially-caused distortion was marginal in most sites and moderate (in the form of semi-lag assemblages) in just a couple of them. This reinforces the causality of biotic agents (i.e., hominins and carnivores) in the formation of these sites.

AB The integrity of the genetic information is constantly threatened by oxidizing agents. Oxidized guanines have all been linked to different types of cancers. Theoretical approaches supplement the assorted experimental techniques, and bring new sight and opportunities to investigate the underlying microscopic mechanics. Unfortunately, there is no specific force field to DNA system including oxidized guanines. Taking high level ab initio calculations as benchmark, we developed the ABEEM sigma pi fluctuating charge force field, which uses multiple fluctuating charges per atom. And it was applied to study the energies, structures and mutations of base pairs containing oxidized guanines. The geometries were obtained in reference to other studies or using B3LYP/6-31+G* level optimization, which is more rational and time-saving among 24 quantum mechanical methods selected and tested by this work. The energies were determined at MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ level with BSSE corrections. Results show that the constructed potential function can accurately simulate the change of H-bond and the buckled angle formed by two base planes induced by oxidized guanine, and it provides reliable information of hydrogen bonding, stacking interaction and the mutation processes. The performance of ABEEM sigma pi polarizable force field in predicting the bond lengths, bond angles, dipole moments etc. is generally better than those of the common force fields. And the accuracy of ABEEM sigma pi PFF is close to that of the MP2 method. This shows that ABEEM sigma pi. model is a reliable choice for further research of dynamics behavior of DNA fragment including oxidized guanine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Spherical latex particles were used as a colloid model to investigate the aggregation process resulting from the action of electrolytes and polyelectrolytes. The colloid size distribution was directly determined using a particle counter technique. Bell shaped curves were expected for diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) when particle sticking succeeded each interparticle collision. The colloid size frequency was described by a continuously decreasing curve when reaction limited aggregation (RLA) was expected. The last mode implied that the collision efficiency for sticking might depend on the aggregate size. Starting with the cluster size distribution, we calculated the different moments of the size distribution.
   When electrostatic forces modulated the interparticle interactions, in the presence of a excess of electrolyte or at a polymer concentration inducing fast aggregation, the reduced size distribution exhibited a typical maximum and the aggregation kinetic was described by a simple scaling law. As a result, a time invariant size polydispersity characterized the long time behavior. Apart from these ideal coagulation conditions, the flocculation proceeded at a slower rate and the dynamic scaling laws required two scaling exponents, w and z. The cluster size polydispersity factor increased with aggregation period as a result of variable collision efficiency.
   When flexible polymer acted as an inter-particle bridging agent, the amount of polymer adsorbed on a colloid surface also modulated the rate of aggregation but the aggregation mode itself was only determined by the polymer/colloid interaction. Fast aggregation was found to induce maximal cluster size polydispersity.
   In all these situations, colloid aggregation modes were analyzed using the results of computer simulation of the cluster-cluster aggregation and the experimental results were presented via a scaling approach. Validity of scaling relations was verified for electrolyte and polyelectrolyte induced aggregation and the different processes corresponded to diffusion and reaction limited aggregation.

AB The protein mediated approach is a common method for the synthesis of photoluminescent gold quantum clusters (GQCs), where proteins, acting as reducing and stabilizing agents, react with gold salts through cysteine residues. For the better understanding of the phenomenon, the aqueous phase reaction of HAuCl4 and L-cysteine has been investigated at the supramolecular level by various experimental techniques and molecular mechanics simulations. We have observed the formation of a novel photoluminescent product, (AuCys)(n)(beta), which shows emission in the orange region of the spectrum. Small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SWAXS) measurements have revealed the presence of nanosized lamellae, which have an internal multilayer superlattice structure with a characteristic periodic distance of 1.3 nm. Based on the results, the layers are built up by zigzag shaped (AuCys)(n), polymer chains connected through aurophilic bonds. The aurophilic network is stabilized via salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which are also responsible for the interlayer interactions. Here, the evolution of the multilayer structure has been monitored by the combined application of photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved SAXS. It has been concluded that there is a strong correlation between the emission and the scattering intensity, which suggests that the two- and three-dimensional aggregation of the building blocks to form sheets and multilayers are simultaneous processes. Furthermore, we have revealed that the formation and behavior of (AuCys)(n)(beta) show significant differences to that of Au-L-glutathione compounds described earlier despite the similarity of L-cysteine and L-glutathione. These results evidence that L-cysteine and gold species form building blocks that can be applied expansively in supramolecular and cluster chemistry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Recognition of DNA sequence information by the natural antitumor agent ecteinascidin 743 (ET743) has been proposed to operate through a direct readout mechanism involving specific hydrogen bonding interactions between the drug and the DNA minor groove prior to covalent alkylation of a guanine base. 5'-AGC and 5'-CGG are examples of high-reactivity target triplets whereas 5'-CGA is a low-reactivity sequence. Molecular dynamics computer simulations were first used to explore the stability and behavior of the pre-covalent complex between ET743 and a DNA nonamer containing the 5'-AGC binding site in the central region. The pre-covalent complex was stable, and some unreported distinctive features were observed that may not be amenable to direct experimental verification. A similar simulation with ET743 bound to another nonamer containing a central 5'-CGA triplet did not result in a stable association supporting the proposed role of a hydrogen bonding network in the stabilization of these complexes. The covalent complexes between ET743 and the nonamers containing the 5'-AGC and 5'-CGG target sites were then simulated. In each case the drug displayed the predicted binding mode and gave rise to a widening of the minor groove. In addition, we show that as a consequence of ET743 binding to the target sequences, positive roll is introduced that results in smooth bending of the helix toward the major groove, in agreement with results from gel electrophoresis experiments. Similar results were obtained with the synthetic compound phthalascidin, which presents a biological profile almost indistinguishable from that of ET743. The local bending elements in AGC and CGG were found to be different, and the distinct behavior of these sequences in the absence of bound drugs was in consonance with their intrinsic bending propensities.

AB We have analyzed molecular dynamics simulations of tripositive lanthanide ions Ln(3+) in aqueous solution. Combining a variety of new approaches for the analysis and the visualization of the first hydration shells, we were able to extract in detail their angular structure and their dynamic behavior along the series of Ln(3+) ions. For a heavy lanthanide ion (Yb3+) the eight water molecules of the first hydration shell form a well-defined square antiprism, whereas for a nine-coordinate light lanthanide ion (Nd3+) the first hydration shell adopts the tricapped trigonal prism geometry. In the middle of the series both geometries coexist. Both the square antiprism and the tricapped trigonal prism rearrange via 90 degrees pseudorotations of the main symmetry axis. The pertaining transition state of lowered symmetry is a dodecahedron for the Yb3+ octaaqua complex and a capped square antiprism for the Nd3+ enneaaqua complex. The lifetime of a square antiprism between two pseudorotations is 11 ps but amounts to only 2 ps for a tricapped trigonal prism. The Lifetime of a square antiprism from the simulation of Yb3+ (CN = 8) is in quantitative agreement with the correlation time for the fluctuation of the zero-field splitting from experimental EPR spectra of the Gd3+ octaaqua complex. This correlation time, of relevance for the understanding of the mechanism of the H-1 relaxation of Gd3+-based MRI contrast agents, is linked to transient distorsions of the Gd3+ aqua complex from perfect symmetry that were so far assumed to be due to random impacts of solvent molecules. On the basis of our MD-simulations we can go beyond these general notions and propose a model with 90 degrees pseudorotations of the coordination polyhedron as the principal mechanism for distorsions of the first hydration shell.

AB Mechanical stimulation of the healing tendon is thought to regulate scar anisotropy and strength and is relatively easy to modulate through physical therapy. However, in vivo studies of various loading protocols in animal models have produced mixed results. To integrate and better understand the available data, we developed a multiscale model of rat Achilles tendon healing that incorporates the effect of changes in the mechanical environment on fibroblast behavior, collagen deposition, and scar formation. We modified an OpenSim model of the rat right hindlimb to estimate physiologic strains in the lateral/medial gastrocnemius and soleus musculo-tendon units during loading and unloading conditions. We used the tendon strains as inputs to a thermodynamic model of stress fiber dynamics that predicts fibroblast alignment, and to determine local collagen synthesis rates according to a response curve derived from in vitro studies. We then used an agent-based model (ABM) of scar formation to integrate these cell-level responses and predict tissue-level collagen alignment and content. We compared our model predictions to experimental data from ten different studies. We found that a single set of cellular response curves can explain features of observed tendon healing across a wide array of reported experiments in rats-including the paradoxical finding that repairing transected tendon reverses the effect of loading on alignment-without fitting model parameters to any data from those experiments. The key to these successful predictions was simulating the specific loading and surgical protocols to predict tissue-level strains, which then guided cellular behaviors according to response curves based on in vitro experiments. Our model results provide a potential explanation for the highly variable responses to mechanical loading reported in the tendon healing literature and may be useful in guiding the design of future experiments and interventions.

AB Diniz Behn CG, Booth V. Simulating microinjection experiments in a novel model of the rat sleep-wake regulatory network. J Neurophysiol 103: 1937-1953, 2010. First published January 27, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.00795.2009. This study presents a novel mathematical modeling framework that is uniquely suited to investigating the structure and dynamics of the sleep-wake regulatory network in the brain stem and hypothalamus. It is based on a population firing rate model formalism that is modified to explicitly include concentration levels of neurotransmitters released to postsynaptic populations. Using this framework, interactions among primary brain stem and hypothalamic neuronal nuclei involved in rat sleep-wake regulation are modeled. The model network captures realistic rat polyphasic sleep-wake behavior consisting of wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-REM (NREM) sleep states. Network dynamics include a cyclic pattern of NREM sleep, REM sleep, and wake states that is disrupted by simulated variability of neurotransmitter release and external noise to the network. Explicit modeling of neurotransmitter concentrations allows for simulations of microinjections of neurotransmitter agonists and antagonists into a key wake-promoting population, the locus coeruleus (LC). Effects of these simulated microinjections on sleep-wake states are tracked and compared with experimental observations. Agonist/antagonist pairs, which are presumed to have opposing effects on LC activity, do not generally induce opposing effects on sleep-wake patterning because of multiple mechanisms for LC activation in the network. Also, different agents, which are presumed to have parallel effects on LC activity, do not induce parallel effects on sleep-wake patterning because of differences in the state dependence or independence of agonist and antagonist action. These simulation results highlight the utility of formal mathematical modeling for constraining conceptual models of the sleep-wake regulatory network.

AB The progression of human prostate cancer from histomorphologic to clinical expression often requires several decades. This study emphasizes the importance of developing relevant human prostate cancer models to study the molecular events leading to prostate cancer progression. These models will provide a rational basis for chemopreventive and treatment strategies to retard the progression of human prostate cancer from its localized to its metastatic state. In our laboratory, we have established the LNCaP progression and ARCaP models and the in vitro three-dimensional growth models involving prostate cancer and bone stroma to study the progression of prostate cancer. We propose that prostate cancer may progress from an androgen-dependent to an androgen-independent stale. While existing as androgen-independent tumors (defined as tumors capable of growing in castrated hosts and secreting PSA in serum), prostate cancer may assume three different phenotypes as it progresses: androgen-independent while remaining androgen-responsive; androgen-independent and unresponsive to androgen stimulation; and androgen-independent but suppressed by androgen. It is conceivable that any androgen-independent human prostate cancer may contain variable proportions of cells that exhibit these three phenotypes. This concept may have important implications in determining strategies for chemopreventive and therapeutic trials. We have established three-dimensional growth models of prostate cancer cells either in collagen gel or microgravity-simulated growth conditions to form viable and functional organoids which contain prostate cancer epithelial cells admired with prostate or bone stromal cells. These in vitro models combined with the in vivo models described above will enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of prostate cancer growth and progression, and hence could improve efficiency in screening chemopreventive and therapeutic agents which alter the biologic behaviors of human prostate cancer.

AB In this paper, the creep deformation mechanisms are investigated in nickel-based single crystal superalloys. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are conducted to model various temperatures, stress conditions, and phase interface crystal orientations. Ni-based single-crystal superalloys are of great importance in the aircraft industry due to their excellent high temperature creep resistance. This characteristic mainly originates from two features considered in their structure; firstly, their two-phase micro-structure comprising gamma gamma and gamma prime gamma', and secondly the nature of this superalloy itself, which is a single-crystal. MD is a powerful tool to gain insight into creep behavior at small scales, where dislocations and high-temperature diffusional phenomena are the most critical deformation agents. The parameters considered in the creep deformation are temperature, stress, and phase interface crystal orientation. The simulations are observed in various temperature conditions including 1100, 1200, 1400, 1600, and 1700 K. Stress levels are applied from 0.5 to 5.0 GPa with a sequence of 0.5 GPa, and phase interface crystal orientations are imposed on (001), (011) and (111). Various mechanisms are detected, including the gamma' precipitate shearing, micro-twinning, the diffusion-mediated climb that allows the dislocations to bypass the gamma' precipitates, and rafting that refers to directional gamma' coarsening. The results are shown to be in good agreement with available experimental data. The steady-state creep phase is associated with a constant strain rate, which is calculated for each model. The power-law equation is employed to predict the steady-state strain rate as a function of stress, temperature, the required activation energy, and the stress exponent parameter. Finally, a deformation map is presented for different phase interface models based on the stress exponent parameter values.

AB The broad bandgap tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) is the least investigated semiconductor material for photo catalytic water decontamination in sunlight exposure. A detailed study covering the synthesis, characterization and the evaluation of photocatalytic activity of SnO2, in the natural sunlight exposure, is presented. The structural characterization by XRD revealed the formation of phase pure tetragonal SnO2 with the average crystallite size of similar to 41.5 nm whereas minor Sn2+ states in the material were identified by XPS analysis. As explored by diffuse reflectance (DR) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, the material exhibited a distinct absorption edge at similar to 3.4 eV. The morphological and microstructure analysis of the synthesized SnO2 was carried out by FESEM and HRTEM. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and chronopotentiometry (CP) predicted the better charge transport and retention ability of the material under illumination whereas the Mott-Schottky extrapolation prophesied the n-type behavior with the flat-band potential of -0.60 V. The photocatalytic activity of SnO2 was assessed in the exposure of complete spectrum natural sunlight for the removal of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. The HPLC and TOC analysis monitored the progress of degradation and mineralization whereas the released chloride ions were evaluated by ion chromatography. The effect of the transition metal ions (Fe3+, Cu2+, Ni2+. and Zn2+) as electron capture agents and H2O2 as ROS generator was explored during the degradation process. The utility of the material for the simultaneous removal of chlorophenols in the mixture was also investigated. The SnO2 exhibited sustained activity in the repeated use. Based on experimental evidence congregated, the mechanism of the removal process and the efficacy of SnO2 for sunlight photocatalytic decontamination of water was established. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigates the hydrodynamic characteristics of the lower, middle, and upper sectors of a highly stratified estuary, the Itajai-Acu river estuary (south of Brazil similar to 27 degrees S/48.5 degrees W). The study is based on a 25-h field campaign with three sampling stations positioned at 2, 17, and 38 km inward from the river mouth, during low river discharge condition and spring tide. The experimental data gathered was reduced and analyzed in terms of distribution of variables in time and space tide average vertical profiles and decomposition of the advective transport of salt and suspended particulate matter (SPM). Tidal range was nearly constant along the estuary, presenting time lag of about 2 h between lower and upper estuary. The ebb discharge peaks were about twice the discharge flood peaks and occurred simultaneously. The tide was the main determining agent in the lower estuary, where currents, salt stratification, and SPM distributions presented a repetitive behavior. In the middle estuary, the tide effects were also observed, but the presence of saline waters decreased along the time due to increasing river discharge during the campaign. The distribution of SPM in the mid- and upper estuary presented patched pattern not associated with tides and may be attributed to short-term flood contributions of tributaries. Currents presented ebb dominance in all three sectors; in the middle and upper estuary, they presented also a time asymmetry, with ebb currents longer than flood. The advective transport of salt in the lower estuary was upstream, with dominance of gravitational circulation term. In the mid-estuary, there was practically no transport, with balance between fluvial discharge (downstream) and tidal correlation (upstream). The advective transport of SPM was upstream in the lower estuary and downstream in the mid- and upper estuary, being dominated by gravitational circulation in the former and fluvial discharge in the others.

AB A previously published simulation and data fitting procedure for the reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) process using the PREDICI simulation program has been extended to cumyl phenyldithioacetate mediated styrene and methyl methacrylate (MMA) bulk homopolymerizations. The experimentally obtained molecular weight distributions (MWDs) for the styrene system are narrow and unimodal and shift linearly with monomer conversion to higher molecular weights. The MMA system displays a hybrid of conventional chain transfer and living behavior, leading to bimodal MWDs. The styrene system has been subjected to a combined experimental and modeling study at 60 degreesC, yielding a rate coefficient for the addition reaction of free macroradicals to polymeric RAFT agent, k(beta), of approximately 5.6 x 10(-5) L mol(-1) s(-1) and a decomposition rate coefficient for macroradical RAFT species, k-(beta), of about 2.7 x 10(-1) s(-1). The transfer rate coefficient to cumyl phenyldithioacetate is found to be close to 2.2 x 10(5) L mol(-1) s(-1). The MMA system has been studied over the temperature range 25-60 degreesC. The hybrid behavior observed in the MMA polymerizations has been exploited (at low monomer conversions) to perform a Mayo analysis allowing the determination of the temperature dependence of the transfer to cumyl phenyldithioacetate reaction. The activation energy of this process is close to 26 kJ mol(-1). In contrast to the styrene system, the PREDICI simulation procedure cannot be successfully applied to cumyl phenyldithioacetate mediated MMA polymerizations for the deduction of k(beta) and k-(beta). This inability is due to the hybrid nature of the cumyl phenyldithioacetate-MMA system, leading to a significantly reduced sensitivity toward k(beta) and k(-beta).

AB Dicumyl peroxide (DCPO) is usually employed as an initiator for polymerization, a source of free radicals, a hardener, and a linking agent. In Asia, due to its unstable reactive nature, DCPO has caused many thermal explosions and runaway reaction incidents in the manufacturing process. This study was conducted to elucidate its essentially thermal hazard characteristics. In order to analyze the runaway behavior of DCPO in a batch reactor, thermokinetic parameters, such as heat of decomposition (Delta H (d)) and exothermic onset temperature (T (0)), were measured via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Thermal runaway phenomena were then thoroughly investigated by DSC. The thermokinetics of DCPO mixed with acids or bases were determined by DSC, and the experimental data were compared with kinetics-based curve fitting of thermal safety software (TSS). Solid thermal explosion (STE) and liquid thermal explosion (LTE) simulations of TSS were applied to determine the fundamental thermal explosion behavior in large tanks or drums. Results from curve fitting indicated that all of the acids or bases could induce exothermic reactions at even an earlier stage of the experiments. In order to diminish the extent of hazard, hazard information must be provided to the manufacturing process. Thermal hazard of DCPO mixed with nitric acid (HNO(3)) was more dangerous than with other acids including sulfuric acid (H(2)SO(4)), phosphoric acid (H(3)PO(4)), and hydrochloric acid (HCl). By DSC, T (0), heat of decomposition (Delta H (d)), and activation energy (E (a)) of DCPO mixed with HNO(3) were calculated to be 70 A degrees C, 911 J g(-1), and 33 kJ mol(-1), respectively.

AB Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is regulated by multiple mechanisms, one of these being changes in the polymerization state of the enzyme which is influenced by enzyme concentration. To better understand the regulation of PFK in vivo, the present study monitored the effects of changing enzyme concentration and of protein crowding on enzyme activity and properties. Purified PFK from white muscle of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was characterized under assay conditions that simulated the physiological state of resting muscle [pH 7.2, 7.5 mM MgATP, 0.2 mM fructose-6-phosphate (F6P)], and with experimental manipulation of enzyme concentration in two ways: (a) increasing the amount of PFK (0.1 or 0.6 mu g/ml) added, and (b) crowding the enzyme by the addition of polyethylene glycol (PEG) (or other agents) to the assay mixture. A marked decrease in ATP inhibition of the enzyme was observed when PFK was studied in buffer containing PEG, as well as when assays were carried out with the purified enzyme at a concentration of 0.6 mu g/ml, as compared with a 6-fold diluted enzyme. Enzyme concentration also altered the F6P saturation curve, S-0.5 values for F6P decreasing when PFK concentration was increased or crowding reagents were added. The inclusion of PEG in the assay mixture shifted the pH profile of PFK leftward with much higher enzyme activity observed as compared to that in the absence of PEG, especially at low pH values. These results provide evidence that the allosteric behaviour of fish muscle PFK is affected by enzyme concentration and support the proposal that the more aggregated forms of the enzyme have higher affinity for fructose 6-phosphate and are less inhibited by Mg.ATP.

AB Elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) may constitute a significant physiological barrier to drug delivery in solid tumors. Strategies for overcoming this barrier have not been developed to date, To identify and characterize various mechanisms regulating IFP and to develop strategies for overcoming the IFP barrier, we modeled the tumor as a poroelastic solid, We used this model to simulate the effect of changes in microvascular pressure and tumor blood now (TBF) on IFP, To test model predictions, the effects of changes in arterial pressure and TBF on IFP were measured using a tissue-isolated tumor preparation. IFP in the center of an isolated tumor was predicted to follow variation of the arterial pressure with a time delay of the order of magnitude of 10 s, and this delay was found to be 11 +/- 6 s experimentally, Following a cessation of TBP, the time constant of the drop in IFP was predicted to be of the order of 1000 s and was found to be 1500 +/- 900 s experimentally, The former time scale is characteristic of transcapillary fluid exchange, and the latter of percolation of fluid through the interstitial matrix, Relying on the good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental data, we estimated the effect of blood pressure modulation on macromolecular uptake in solid tumors, Our results show that no appreciable increase of macromolecular uptake should occur either by an acute or by a chronic increase of blood pressure. On the other hand, higher uptake would result from periodic modulation of blood pressure, Therefore, the effectiveness of a vasoconstrictor such as angiotensin II to increase macromolecular delivery should be significantly enhanced by periodic rather than bolus or continuous administration of the vasoactive agent.

AB The development of specific agents against amyloidoses requires an understanding of the conformational behavior of fibrillogenic peptides in different environments on the microscopic level. We present extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the fibrillogenic Bindin (103-120) B18 fusion peptide for several different environments: a water-trifluorethanol (TFE) mixture, pure water, aqueous buffer containing 100 mM NaCl, and a buffer-vapor interface. The peptide was studied as an isolated molecule in solution or at an interface. In the simulations, the conformational behavior of the peptide was found to strongly depend on the environment in agreement with experimental data. Overall, large portions of the peptide were unstructured. Preformed alpha-helical conformations were least stable in pure water and most stable in the water-TFE mixture and the buffer-vapor interface. In all environments, the alpha-helical conformation was most stable in the region around residues 113-116, which are mainly hydrophilic. Extended configurations in water or buffer folded into structures containing beta-sheets in agreement with data from circular dichroism spectroscopy. In buffer, the beta-sheet content was larger than in water and alpha-beta transitions were observed at elevated temperature. beta-Sheets were formed by hydrophobic residues; turns were formed by hydrophilic residues. A few typical beta-sheets that contain different residues are suggested. A B18 molecule in a strand-loop-strand conformation placed in buffer in contact with vapor was spontaneously adsorbed to the buffer-vapor interface with its hydrophobic side pointing toward the vapor phase. The adsorption induced the formation of turns at positions 108-119 and alpha-helical conformations in the region around residues 114-117. alpha-Helices were parallel to the interface plane in agreement with data from IR reflection absorption spectroscopy.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop Pickering water-in-oil nano-emulsions only stabilized by Eudragit RL100 nanoparticles (NPs), in order to increase the nano-emulsion stability and create a barrier to improve the drug encapsulation and better control the drug release. The first part of this study was dedicated to investigating the nano-emulsion formulation by ultrasonication and understanding the interfacial behavior and role of NPs in the stabilization of the water/oil interface. The focus was on the surface coverage in the function of the formulation parameters (volume fractions) to disclose the extents and limitations of the process. The main physicochemical analysis of the Pickering nano-emulsions was performed by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. On the other hand, the second experimental approach was dedicated to understanding the interfacial behavior of the Eudragit RL100 NPs toward a model water/oil interface, using a dynamic tensiometer with axisymmetric drop shape analysis. The study investigated the NPs' adsorption, as well as their rheological behavior. The aim of this part was to reveal the main phenomena that govern the interactions between NPs and the interface in order to understand the origin of Pickering nano-emulsions' stability. The last part of the study was concerned with the stability and in vitro release of a model encapsulated drug (ketoprofen) in a gastric and simulated intestinal environment. The results showed that Pickering nano-emulsions significantly improved the resistance to gastric pH, inducing a significantly slower drug release compared to classical nano-emulsions' stabilized surfactants. These Pickering nano-emulsions appear as a promising technology to modify the delivery of a therapeutic agent, in the function of the pH, and can be, for instance, applied to the oral drug delivery of poorly soluble drugs.

AB The targeted delivery of nanoparticle carriers holds tremendous potential to transform the detection and treatment of diseases. A major attribute of nanoparticles is the ability to form multiple bonds with target cells, which greatly improves the adhesion strength. However, the multivalent binding of nanoparticles is still poorly understood, particularly from a dynamic perspective. In previous experimental work, we studied the kinetics of nanoparticle adhesion and found that the rate of detachment decreased over time. Here, we have applied the adhesive dynamics simulation framework to investigate binding dynamics between an antibody-conjugated, 200-nm-diameter sphere and an ICAM-1-coated surface on the scale of individual bonds. We found that nano adhesive dynamics (NAD) simulations could replicate the time-varying nanoparticle detachment behavior that we observed in experiments. As expected, this behavior correlated with a steady increase in mean bond number with time, but this was attributed to bond accumulation only during the first second that nanoparticles were bound. Longer-term increases in bond number instead were manifested from nanoparticle detachment serving as a selection mechanism to eliminate nanoparticles that had randomly been confined to lower bond valencies. Thus, time-dependent nanoparticle detachment reflects an evolution of the remaining nanoparticle population toward higher overall bond valency. We also found that NAD simulations precisely matched experiments whenever mechanical force loads on bonds were high enough to directly induce rupture. These mechanical forces were in excess of 300 pN and primarily arose from the Brownian motion of the nanoparticle, but we also identified a valency-dependent contribution from bonds pulling on each other. In summary, we have achieved excellent kinetic consistency between NAD simulations and experiments, which has revealed new insights into the dynamics and biophysics of multivalent nanoparticle adhesion. In future work, we will leverage the simulation as a design tool for optimizing targeted nanoparticle agents.

AB To separate the long-lived minor actinides (MA(III) = Am(III), Cm(111)) and some specific fission products (FP) such as Pd(II), Mo(VI), Cs(I) and Sr(II) from high-level liquid waste (HLLW), we have been studying a new partitioning process by extraction chromatography using several novel silica-based extraction resins. In this work, we examined the separation behavior of the elements contained in a simulated MA-effluent by the CMPOSiO2-P packed column. In addition, as an attempt to further isolate Am(III) and Cm(III) from the heavy RE(III) such as Eu(III), Gd(III) and Dy(III) contained in the MA-effluent, we investigated the possibility of separation by using a silica-based cationic exchange resin. Furthermore, to isolate Sr(II) from the HLLW, adsorption and separation performances of Sr(II) and some other FP elements were studied by using a novel silica-based crown ether extraction resin, DtBuCH18C6/SiO2-P. The experimental results demonstrated that the elements in the simulated MA-effluent can be successfully separated to (1) Pd, (2) MA-hRE and (3) Zr-Mo, by CMPO/SiO2-P packed column using water and a dilute DTPA solution as eluents. Am(III) and Cm(III) are expected to be effectively separated from light RE(III) and Y(III) by the SiSCR cationic resin. However, more effective separation between Am(II), Cm(III) and heavy RE(III) such as Eu(III), Gd(III) and Dy(III) needs further approach. DtBuCH18C6/SiO2-P showed a highly selective adsorption for Sr(III) so that the Sr(II) could be completely separated from other FPs except a portion of Ba(II). (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB In this contribution, for the first time, fatty acids/nano copper/polyester composites were prepared by a facile and one-step route through simultaneous in situ formation of copper nanoparticles and direct absorption of fatty acids to polyester fibers for thermal energy management and thermal conductivity improvement. This eliminates synthesis of copper particles in the separate processing and also other processing such as electrospinning of fibers with using solvents and micro and nano encapsulation as well as shortening the time and processing steps. Two eutectics of fatty acids including myristic/lauric acid and myristic/stearic acid were used as phase change materials, ascorbic acid as a clean reducing agent for in situ synthesis of copper nanoparticles and polyester fibers as supporting material. The thermal behavior of the samples was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis. Based on experimental results, the prepared composites provided a proper and wide temperature range of phase transitions from 29.4-34.2 to 35.7-52.7 degrees C with corresponding enthalpies of 40.3-53.9 and 41.9-55.0 J/g, respectively, that is appropriate for using in diverse applications. The incorporation of copper nanoparticles into eutectic of phase change materials leads to a 77.5% increase in thermal conductivity for the sample treated with lowest copper content. In addition, the treated samples indicated good thermal stability and reliability even after 100 melting and solidifying cycles. Finally, the mentioned method can be utilized for producing shape-stable composite phase change material with appropriate phase transition ranges for low temperature energy storage/retrieval systems.

AB Degradation of organic compounds by active chlorine is a feasible technology for elimination of recalcitrant pollutant discharge into the environment. However, the achievement of a highly efficient treatment system requires the development of well-founded reactor design and scale-up methods. Modeling and simulation can provide description of the complex interrelations of phenomena inside the reactor to analyze their behavior and thus help the development of the desired reactors and treatment systems. Thus, in this paper we propose a comprehensive model for active chlorine generation in a filter press type reactor focused on the mass transport coupled with the kinetics of electrochemical reactions and the electrical potential distribution.Two approaches are used: the reactive diffusion migration layer (RDML) model based on the Nernst-Planck equation in laminar regime and the mass transfer wall function (MTWF) model intended to account for the effect of turbulence induced by the inlet and outlet reactor distributors. It is aimed at acquiring detailed space and time information on relevant operating characteristics inside the reactor such as local efficiency, overpotential distribution along the electrode, zones of high current density, among others. The comparison of model results to experimental data show that the MTWF approach predicts better the behavior of chloride oxidation for active chlorine generation and efficiency at 100 and 200 A m(-2) and 0.8 and 1.6 L min(-1) than the RDML model. The predicted generation rate of oxidizing agents allows describing closely the degradation process of Reactive Black 5 as a test system. (C) 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Purpose - Psychological perspective has been omitted or considered a secondary issue by past studies focused on e-commerce recommendation systems (RS). However, this perspective is key to gaining a better understanding of consumer behaviours when these systems are used to support purchasing processes at online stores. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach - The field study consisted of a simulated online shopping process undertaken by a sample of internet users with a recommender system at a real online store (Pixmania). The authors applied rigorous and detailed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to assess the empirical validity of the model.
   Findings - The proposed sequence of psychological outcomes is valid, with the exception of one hypothesized relationship. In particular, satisfaction with an online store's recommender has a strong influence on a consumer's willingness to purchase one of the items related to his/her shopping goal. However, this satisfaction has no direct effect on a consumer's intention to make add-on purchases based on the recommender's suggestions. On the contrary, the results support the idea that add-on purchases are conditioned by a previous purchase related to the consumer's initial shopping goal. On the other hand, a consumer's flow state while shopping improves all his/her psychological outcomes linked to an online store's recommender. The influence of flow state is particularly interesting when seeking to gain a better understanding of consumers' unplanned purchases based on the recommender's suggestions. These findings have important implications for practitioners.
   Originality/value - This paper discusses in detail and empirically test a set of psychological outcomes that emerge when an e-vendor's recommender is used to assist a consumer's shopping process. To the best of the knowledge, this is the first attempt that empirically tests most of the hypothesized relationships within an online store's RS context.

AB The dynamics of a stochastic type-I Hodgkin-Huxley-like point neuron model exposed to inhibitory synaptic noise are investigated as a function of distance from spiking threshold and the inhibitory influence of the general anesthetic agent propofol. The model is biologically motivated and includes the effects of intrinsic ion-channel noise via a stochastic differential equation description as well as inhibitory synaptic noise modeled as multiple Poisson-distributed impulse trains with saturating response functions. The effect of propofol on these synapses is incorporated through this drug's principal influence on fast inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) type-A receptors via reduction of the synaptic response decay rate. As the neuron model approaches spiking threshold from below, we track membrane voltage fluctuation statistics of numerically simulated stochastic trajectories. We find that for a given distance from spiking threshold, increasing the magnitude of anesthetic-induced inhibition is associated with augmented signatures of critical slowing: fluctuation amplitudes and correlation times grow as spectral power is increasingly focused at 0 Hz. Furthermore, as a function of distance from threshold, anesthesia significantly modifies the power-law exponents for variance and correlation time divergences observable in stochastic trajectories. Compared to the inverse square root power-law scaling of these quantities anticipated for the saddle-node bifurcation of type-I neurons in the absence of anesthesia, increasing anesthetic-induced inhibition results in an observable exponent < -0.5 for variance and > -0.5 for correlation time divergences. However, these behaviors eventually break down as distance from threshold goes to zero with both the variance and correlation time converging to common values independent of anesthesia. Compared to the case of no synaptic input, linearization of an approximating multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model reveals these effects to be the consequence of an additional slow eigenvalue associated with synaptic activity that competes with those of the underlying point neuron in a manner that depends on distance from spiking threshold.

ID CONTINUAL REASSESSMENT METHOD; CLINICAL-TRIALS; DESIGN
AB The scientific goal of a phase I oncology trial of a new chemotherapeutic agent is to find a dose with an acceptable level of toxicity. For ethical reasons, dose-finding is done adaptively, with doses chosen for successive cohorts of patients based on the data obtained from previous cohorts. Typically. patients are at risk for several qualitatively different toxicities, each occurring at several possible severity levels. In this article, we describe how we addressed the dose-finding problem in a phase I trial of gemcitabine for treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. The oncologists planning the trial wanted to account for differences in importance among the toxicities that they had identified. They also requested that the dose-finding method utilize the fact that a low-grade toxicity observed at a given dose, although not dose-limiting. provides a warning that a higher grade of that toxicity is likely to occur at a higher dose. Conventional phase I methods reduce each type of toxicity to an indicator of its occurrence at or above a severity level considered dose-limiting, define "toxicity" as the maximum of these indicators, and base dose-finding on that single binary variable. Because conventional methods do not address the aforementioned concerns, we developed a Bayesian method for dose-finding in the sarcoma trial based on a vector of correlated, ordinal-valued toxicities with severity levels varying with dose. We also developed a method for jointly eliciting the prior, a vector of weights quantifying the clinical importance of each level of each type of toxicity, and a target total toxicity burden acceptable to the physicians. Our method assigns each cohort the dose with a current posterior mean total toxicity burden closest to the target. The elicitation process is iterative, with the oncologists repeatedly shown the algorithm's behavior and asked to adjust their weights to ensure that the statistical decisions reflect appropriate clinical behavior. We describe how this methodology has worked in the sarcoma trial, present simulations and sensitivity analyses of the trial under several clinical scenarios, and provide guidelines for general application.

   CADMIUM; STYRENE; HEARING
AB A number of studies have been conducted in recent years investigating the potential effects on various health endpoints of the combination of noise and a variety of different industrial substances. This review indicates that the information available in both animals and humans on this subject is limited particularly with respect to assessing occupational risk. Most studies have focused on auditory effects in animals, although investigations have been performed for other toxicological endpoints. For some substances, notably toluene, the information from animals studies does suggest an interaction but these were performed only al exposure levels to both noise and chemicals which were each individually ototoxic. Single simultaneous exposure to noise and styrene did not result in any enhancement of auditory impairment above that produced by noise or styrene alone. Single simultaneous exposure to noise and carbon monoxide (GO), however, showed some evidence of enhancement of ototoxicity beyond that produced by noise or carbon monoxide alone, although only at high atmospheric concentrations of CO. When 1,3-dinitrobenzene was administered parentally at neurotoxic dose levels with continuous noise exposure, there was an increased severity of effects in the brain stem. Combined exposure to noise and lead and/or cadmium resulted in histopathological heart lesions of undefined severity, a finding which was not observed for either of those agents in isolation. Dermal exposure to dimethylformamide and noise or inhalation exposure to xylene and noise resulted in some biochemical changes in cardiac muscle which were of doubtful toxicological significance. In developing mice, there was evidence that combined exposure to cadmium sulphate and noise caused an increased incidence of external and skeletal malformations but only at dose levels of cadmium which would have induced developmental effects. Overall, for each of these chemicals and endpoints observed there is a suggestion of some interaction with noise exposure. From the data that are currently available, however, inferences cannot be drawn on whether or not interactions would have occurred at lower, more occupationally relevant, levels of exposure. A number of studies have investigated human populations exposed to both noise and industrial chemicals. Due to confounding factors, however, it was concluded that these data were inadequate for assessing the combined effects of noise and chemical exposure on hearing.

DE visual perception; efficient coding; natural image statistics; virtual
   environments; virtual agents; active vision
AB The efficient coding hypothesis posits that sensory systems are tuned to the regularities of their natural input. The statistics of natural image databases have been the topic of many studies, which have revealed biases in the distribution of orientations that are related to neural representations as well as behavior in psychophysical tasks. However, commonly used natural image databases contain images taken with a camera with a planar image sensor and limited field of view. Thus, these images do not incorporate the physical properties of the visual system and its active use reflecting body and eye movements. Here, we investigate quantitatively, whether the active use of the visual system influences image statistics across the visual field by simulating visual behaviors in an avatar in a naturalistic virtual environment. Images with a field of view of 120 degrees were generated during exploration of a virtual forest environment both for a human and cat avatar. The physical properties of the visual system were taken into account by projecting the images onto idealized retinas according to models of the eyes' geometrical optics. Crucially, different active gaze behaviors were simulated to obtain image ensembles that allow investigating the consequences of active visual behaviors on the statistics of the input to the visual system. In the central visual field, the statistics of the virtual images matched photographic images regarding their power spectra and a bias in edge orientations toward cardinal directions. At larger eccentricities, the cardinal bias was superimposed with a gradually increasing radial bias. The strength of this effect depends on the active visual behavior and the physical properties of the eye. There were also significant differences between the upper and lower visual field, which became stronger depending on how the environment was actively sampled. Taken together, the results show that quantitatively relating natural image statistics to neural representations and psychophysical behavior requires not only to take the structure of the environment into account, but also the physical properties of the visual system, and its active use in behavior.

AB The actions of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-aminoacridine (THA) and 9-aminoacridine (9-AA) on glutamatergic receptors were studied using the whole-cell and outside-out variants of the patch-clamp technique. Typically, either N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) or kainate alone or combined with various concentrations of THA or 9-AA was applied via a U tube to activate whole-cell currents. Other superfusion techniques were also used. THA (25-50 mu M) and 9-AA (10-25 mu M) reduced the peak and steady-state amplitudes of NMDA-activated whole-cell inward currents and had no significant effect on outward currents. At higher concentrations, these agents produced a delayed current peak in addition to a further depression of the current size. A delayed current peak was a high-amplitude current peak delayed in relation to the time course of control currents. THA and 9-AA were much less potent in blocking kainate-activated currents. Also, the blockade of kainate currents was voltage independent, and no delayed current peak was generated. With the same superfusion method, the antagonists APV (DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) and Mg++ were tested independently of THA or 9-AA and were found not to produce delayed current peaks or NMDA-activated whole-cell currents. Bath perfusion of THA (250 mu M) abolished the delayed current peaks produced by pulse application of NMDA and THA, whereas bath perfusion of the competitive blocker APV did not have this effect. High concentrations of glycine (10 mu M) did not alter THA's blocking effects or the production of delayed current peaks. Outside-out patches exposed to pulses of NMDA and THA displayed a delayed increase in the channel-opening probability. Apparently, this is the microscopic counterpart of the delayed current peaks. We also performed stationary single-channel analyses of currents recorded from outside-out patches exposed to continuous bath perfusion of NMDA (1-5 mu M) and various concentrations of THA or 9-AA. Either one of these agents produced a reduction in the mean open time coupled with an apparent shortening of the mean burst length at concentrations on the order of 10(-5) M. The data were fitted to a model with two sequentially arranged blocked states. The resulting rate constants were used in computer simulations. The computer-simulated traces of whole-cell NMDA-activated currents under the effect of THA mimicked all the major features of the experimental traces obtained under the nonstationary conditions of concentration jumps. In conclusion, the depression of the amplitude of NMDA-activated whole-cell currents and the appearance of a delayed current peak produced by either THA or 9-AA were interpreted as being due to rapidly reversible channel blockade. Because of some of the unique characteristics of the channel blockade produced by these compounds, they have proved to be potentially powerful tools in the study of the kinetics of NMDA receptor channels.

TI Cost of multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Germany-An update
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES

DT Article
DE Cost analysis; Monte Carlo simulation; Tuberculosis; MDR-TB; XDR-TB;
   Antimicrobial resistance
AB Background: In 2019, new therapeutic recommendations for multidrug-resistant (MDR-) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) were published by the WHO, advocating the use of oral drugs and stepwise composition of antibiotic regimens. To date, the economic consequences of those recommendations in low incidence settings have not been evaluated.
   Objective: To assess the costs of applying the new recommendations against a set of 86 MDR-TB/XDR-TB strains, each with individual phenotypic drug resistance patterns, identified in 2018/2019 by the German National Reference Center for Mycobacteria.
   Methods: Hospitalization costs as covered by German statutory health insurance and the loss of productivity due to illness were calculated using the most recent 2018 statistical data. Costs due to combining five agents in the intensive phase and costs of outpatient monitoring were determined by Monte-Carlo simulation covering all treatment options over an 18-month period. Drug costs were compared to those arising under the approach recommended by the WHO in 2016.
   Results: Hospitalization costs per MDR-TB patient were (sic)30,152 and the mean costs of antimicrobials over a period of 18 months were (sic)66,854 (range (sic)20,671 to (sic)187,444). Total treatment costs, including outpatient monitoring, were (sic)73,551.56 per patient (range (sic)30,114 to (sic)145.878). In addition, we determined an average cost of (sic)11,410.20 due to productivity loss over a period of 6 months sick leave. Despite a shortened minimum recommended treatment duration (18 versus 20 months), the estimated costs were 24.5% higher based on the 2019 recommendations as compared to the 2016 guideline version.
   Conclusion: Higher costs for treating MDR-TB/XDR-TB in Germany are to be expected under the new WHO regimens. However, it must be determined whether treatment duration and costs associated with sick leave may be further reduced in the future through shorter hospital stays and earlier culture conversion.

AB Potential differences in drug clearance between Japanese and Caucasians were investigated by integrating data on demography, liver size, the abundance of the major cytochromes P450 and in vitro metabolic parameters. Eleven drugs ( alprazolam, caffeine, chlorzoxazone, cyclosporine, midazolam, omeprazole, sildenafil, tolbutamide, triazolam, S-warfarin and zolpidem) fulfilled the entry criteria of the study ( i.e. the necessary in vitro metabolism data were available and clearance values had been reported both in Caucasians and Japanese). Values of relevant biological variables were obtained from the literature, and clearance predictions were made using the Simcyp (R) Population-Based ADME Simulator. The ratios of observed oral clearance ( CLp.o.)values in Caucasians compared with Japanese ranged from 0.6 to 2.8 ( integrating data from 82 sources). The CLp.o. values for alprazolam, caffeine and zolpidem were not statistically different between Caucasian and Japanese ( p > 0.05), whereas those for chorzoxazone, cyclosporine, omeprazole, tolbutamide and triazolam were higher in Caucasians ( p < 0.05), and those for midazolam, sildenafil and S-warfarin were higher in Japanese ( p < 0.05). CLp.o. values, predicted from in vitro data, were within 3-fold of observed in vivo values for seven of the 11 drugs in Japanese. Values for the predicted ratios ranged from 1.6 to 4.9. The predicted ratios were not significantly different from observed ratios for cyclosporine, omeprazole, tolbutamide and triazolam. Only partial success in predicting ethnic differences in clearance indicates the need for larger and more reliable databases on relevant variables. With such information, in silico predictions might be used with more confidence to decrease the need for repeating pharmacokinetic studies in different ethnic groups.

AB This paper presents a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Patos Lagoon carried out within the framework of ECOSUD (Estuaries and Coastal Areas. Basis and Tools for a More Sustainable Development), a research project financed by the European Community. This lagoon is located in the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul, between the cities of Rio Grande and Porto Alegre. It is approximately 250 km long, runs parallel to the coast and has an area of 10,360 km(2). The estuarine area is 60 km long. It receives major tributaries, which bring pollutants from farms and industry and also from waste from nearby cities like Pelotas and Rio Grande. Due to the importance of this resource and the problems presented for economic and recreational activities, numerical studies must be carried out to characterize the hydrodynamic behavior of various potentially productive areas such as Mangueira Bay. This hydrodynamic characterization complements water-quality studies in this area, and both act as inputs for aquaculture and water-resources planning. Different simulations were carried out with a two-dimensional model, RMA-2 (USACE), under a combination of several forcing agents during specific periods. These simulations were calibrated and validated with the available data.

AB This research assessed how the performance and team skills of three-person teams working with an Intelligent Team Tutoring System (ITTS) on a virtual military surveillance task were affected by feedback privacy, participant role, task experience, prior team experience, and teammate familiarity. Previous work in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) has focused on outcomes for task skill training for individual learners. As research extends into intelligent tutoring for teams, both task skills and team skills are necessary for good team performance. This work includes a brief review of previous research on ITTSs, feedback, teams, and teamwork, including the recounting of two categories of a framework of teamwork performance, Communication and Cognition, which are relevant to the present study. This research examines the effects of an intelligent agent, as well as features of the team, its members, and the task being undertaken, on team communication (measured by relevant key-presses) and team situation awareness (as measured by scores on a quiz). Thirty-seven teams of three participants, each at their own computer running a multiplayer surveillance simulation, were given just-in-time private (individually delivered) or public (team-delivered) performance feedback during four 5-min trials. In the fourth trial, two of the three participants switched roles. Feedback type, teamwork experience, and teammate familiarity had no statistically significant effect on communication or team situation awareness. However, higher levels of role experience and task experience showed significant and medium-sized effects on communication performance. Results, based on performance data and structured interview responses, also revealed areas of improvement in future feedback design and a potential benchmark for feedback frequency in an action-oriented serious game-based ITTS. Among the conclusions are six design objectives for future ITTSs, establishing a foundation for future research on designing effective ITTSs that train interpersonal skills to nascent teams.

   CLINICAL-RESPONSE; PRACTICAL METHOD; DRUGS; CLOZAPINE
AB Objective: Atypical antipsychotic drug treatment is clinically effective with a low risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Explanations for the mechanism underlying this beneficial therapeutic profile of atypical over typical antipsychotic agents include 1) simultaneous antagonism of dopamine D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors or 2) selective action at limbic cortical dopamine D(2)-like receptors with modest striatal D(2) receptor occupancy. Amisulpride is an atypical antipsychotic drug with selective affinity for D(2)/D(3) dopamine receptors and provides a useful pharmacological model for examining these hypotheses. The authors' goal was to evaluate whether treatment with amisulpride results in "limbic selective" D(2)/D(3) receptor blockade in vivo.
   Method: Five hours of dynamic single photon emission tomography data were acquired after injection of [(123)I]epidepride (approximately 150 MBq). Kinetic modeling was performed by using the simplified reference region model to obtain binding potential values. Estimates of receptor occupancy were made relative to a healthy volunteer comparison group (N=6).
   Results: Eight amisulpride-treated patients (mean dose=406 mg/day) showed moderate levels of D(2)/D(3) receptor occupancy in the striatum (56%), and significantly higher levels were seen in the thalamus (78%) and temporal cortex (82%).
   Conclusions: Treatment with amisulpride results in a similar pattern of limbic cortical over striatal D(2)/D(3) receptor blockade to that of other atypical antipsychotic drugs. This finding suggests that modest striatal D(2) receptor occupancy and preferential occupancy of limbic cortical dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors may be sufficient to explain the therapeutic efficacy and low extrapyramidal symptom profile of atypical antipsychotic drugs, without the need for 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism.

AB Since its founding, the American state has relied both upon what we now call "traditional" administration-public, hierarchical, and bureaucratic-and upon more privatized approaches to governance involving state and non-state actors and institutions in contractual relationships and networks. Studying past public-private governance schemes affords new opportunities to understand why, how, and under what circumstances state actors eschew direct public action in favor of boundary-spanning arrangements. I demonstrate this by presenting a case study of the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), a new Federal entity created in 1940 by President Franklin Roosevelt. NDRC relied upon contracting and an existing scientific community to create a highly effective network of scientists and laboratories spanning the public, for profit, and nonprofit sectors. Beyond presenting novel empirical evidence, I contribute to theory by providing new insights into the factors and conditions that spur state actors to adopt a networked approach to governance, and by proposing the concept of a "twilight" network, defined as a network whose structure and behavior are legal, yet simultaneously overt and covert. I also show that qualitative, detailed historical research may valuably extend our understanding of public-private governance arrangements and the "state of agents."

AB The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of etching, with different hydrofluoric acid concentrations at the intaglio surface of feldspathic ceramic inlays, on the fatigue failure load of restored premolars. A total of 60 upper premolars were embedded in plastic cylinders with acrylic resin (up to 3 mm below the cement-enamel junction) and prepared using a device specially designed for that purpose. Teeth were randomly assigned to three groups (n=20): HF1, HF5, and HF10 (etching with hydrofluoric acid for 60 seconds at concentrations of 1%, 5%, and 10%, respectively). Preparations were scanned and restorations were milled by a computer-aided design / computer-aided manufacturing system. The inner surfaces of the inlays were etched and received an application of a silane coupling agent; the dentin and enamel were treated appropriately for the luting system (RelyX ARC, 3M-ESPE). The restorations were cemented and the fatigue failure load (in N) was determined using the staircase method (10 Hz; 10(5) cycles in each step). The initial load (585.5 N) was applied on the slopes of the cusps (labial and palatal/lingual, simultaneously) through a cylinder attached to the test machine (Instron Electro-Puls E3000). The tested samples were analyzed under a stereomicroscope for failure analysis. Fatigue data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance. There was no statistical difference among the fatigue failure loads (in N): HF1 (448.5+/-79.1), HF5 (360.7+/-55.4), and HF10 (409.5+/-121.1). Regarding the fracture mode, there was a predominance of interfacial fracture (50%), followed by cusp fracture (34.6%). It may be concluded that the etching with hydrofluoric acid at the tested concentrations (1%, 5%, and 10%) does not influence the fatigue failure load of feldspathic ceramic inlays cemented on premolars.

AB The study of recurrent epidemic outbreaks has been attracting great attention for decades, but its underlying mechanism is still under debate. Based on a large number of real data from different cities, we find that besides the seasonal periodic outbreaks of influenza, there are also non-periodic outbreaks, i.e. non-seasonal or non-annual behaviors. To understand how the non-periodicity shows up, we present a network model of SIRS epidemic with both time-dependent infection rate and a small possibility of persistent epidemic seeds, representing the influences from the larger annual variation of environment and the infection generated spontaneously in nature, respectively. Our numerical simulations reveal that the model can reproduce the non-periodic outbreaks of recurrent epidemics with the main features of real influenza data. Further, we find that the recurrent outbreaks of epidemic depend not only on the infection rate but also on the density of susceptible agents, indicating that they are both the necessary conditions for the recurrent epidemic patterns with non-periodicity. A theoretical analysis based on Markov dynamics is presented to explain the numerical results. This finding may be of significance to the control of recurrent epidemics.

AB Process intensification of liquid liquid extraction based on single drop studies is discussed. Design, simulation and optimization of this process, usually adopts with swarm of drops, and depends on individual drops behavior as well as the relevant influential parameters. Improving mass transfer performance with optimized operating conditions or using additives like salts and nanoparticles are distinctive concerns. Accordingly, as a systematic study, the hydrodynamic and mass transfer behavior of drops as well as effects of operating parameters are considered. Due to the importance of subject, the behavior of nanoparticles for improving extraction process, with or without external fields, is highly regarded. Furthermore, the promising techniques/materials of reactive extraction, microfluidic extraction, ionic liquid solvents, their combination and coupling heat and mass transfer are considered. The content will bring greater clarity to select additives and to employ suitable conditions. Indeed, drop intensification methods, in relation to the drop breakage/coalescence, build the high performance industrial scale operations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nanocellulose reinforced foams are lightweight with improved mechanical properties; however, the strain-rate effect on their mechanical response is not yet fully understood. In this work, rigid polyurethane foams (PUFs) nanostructured with bacterial nanocellulose at 0.2 wt % (BNCF) and without it (PUF) are synthesized and subjected to compression tests at different strain rates. The BNC acts as a nucleation agent, reducing the cell size but maintaining a similar apparent density of 40.4 +/- 3.3 kg m(-3). Both BNCF and PUF exhibit strain-rate effect on yield stress and densification strain. The BNCF exhibits localized progressive crushing and reduced friability, causing a remarkable recovery in the transverse direction. Numerical simulations show that functionally graded foams subjected to impact could be designed using different layers of PUF and BNCF to vary energy absorption and acceleration rate. The results presented herein warrant further research of the mechanical properties of nanostructured foams for impact applications. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB Since the donation list contains a lot of information, the cooperation may be promoted if the list can be skillfully applied. If the donation list is published completely, it will be considered as moral coercion. However, it is unfair to cooperators who contribute more money if organizers do not publish the list. Thus, how to publish the donation list properly is a subject worth studying. In our paper, we take reputation, behavior diversity and face culture into account at the same time to study the role of donation list in the public goods game. The results of numerical simulations show that the effect of publishing the list incompletely is better than that of publishing it completely or keeping it secret. Furthermore, there exists an optimum threshold to make the results best. And reasonable neighborhood relations are needed to promote cooperation. In addition, some personal attributes, such as the habit of data selection and mental capacity, have influences on cooperation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The mechanical properties (i.e., stress-strain relationship and peak stress) of nanosilica filled epoxies were studied using an Instron machine and a split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus over a range of strain rates from 8 x 10(-4) s(-1) up to similar to 5 x 10(3) s(-1) under uniaxial compression. It was found that the nanosilica particles only reinforce epoxies slightly under both quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. With a unit cell model, it was observed that owing to the existence of nanosilica, the surrounding strain field was changed and the strain-softening characteristics of the epoxy introduced a negative effect of the nanosilica particles as a reinforcement agent. That is, the particle strengthening effect depended on the mechanical characteristics of epoxy matrix. This was further confirmed by numerically simulating the mechanical behaviors of the composites for which (a) the matrix might assume different strain softening or strain-hardening characteristics and (b) there were higher loadings of rigid silica particles.

AB Objective: To analyse the relationship between a series of estimated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters and the reported efficacy of ceftizoxime.
   Design: Retrospective literature search and analysis using different correlation models.
   Methods: The following parameters were calculated for each group of patients included in the study from the simulated plasma concentration curves corresponding to the dosage regimen administered: (i) peak concentration at steady state divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (Cmax (SS)/MIC); (ii) the time that the plasma drug concentration exceeded the MIC scaled to 24 hours at steady state [(t(ss))(24h) > MIC]; (iii) the total area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours at steady state divided by the MIC [(AUC(SS))(24h)/MIC]; and (iv) the AUC at steady state for the period of time that the concentration is above the MIC over a period of 24 hours divided by the MIC [(AUIC(SS))24h] A univariate correlation analysis was performed considering efficacy [rate (%) of clinical cure or bacterial eradication] as the dependent variable and the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameter as the independent variable, using linear and nonlinear models.
   Results: (tss)24h > MIC was the only parameter that was statistically correlated with efficacy, the linear model being the best choice among the 4 relationship approaches tested. A biased frequency distribution of reported efficacy data constricts the correlation analysis to a narrow range of efficacy and hinders interpretation of the results.
   Conclusions: The reporting of cases with low efficacy rates as well as those with high efficacy rates, including information on patient idiosyncrasies and the infecting organisms, would be of great help in performing retrospective analyses of the use of antimicrobial agents, leading to the optimisation of therapy with this type of drug in clinical practice.

AB The carbon composite agglomerates have been numerically examined. The previously presented multifluid blast furnace model is modified to simulate blast furnace operation with carbon composite agglomerates charging. The model considers the behavior of carbon composite agglomerates, namely, conservation equations of chemical species contained in this material including chemical reactions and phase transformations are newly added. A series of simulating calculations are performed to examine the effect of charging carbon composite agglomerates. The result reveals that with increase in carbon composite agglomerates charging ratio in-furnace temperature level tends to decrease, the location of cohesive zone shifts downward, and the reductions of carbon composite agglomerates and sinter are delayed. On the other hand, the productivity tends to increase while coke rate and total reducing agent rate show decrease. The energy consumption for unit production of hot metal is lowered. The performance of blast furnace is improved in the tested range mainly due to the decrease in heat requirements for solution loss, sinter reduction and silicon transfer reactions, heat outflow by top gas and wall heat loss.

AB We study at particle and kinetic level a collective behavior model based on three phenomena: self-propulsion, friction (Rayleigh effect) and an attractive/repulsive (Morse) potential rescaled so that the total mass of the system remains constant independently of the number of particles N. In the first part of the paper, we introduce the particle model: the agents are numbered and described by their position and velocity. We identify five parameters that govern the possible asymptotic states for this system (clumps, spheres, dispersion, mills, rigid-body rotation, flocks) and perform a numerical analysis on the 3D setting. Then, in the second part of the paper, we describe the kinetic system derived as the limit from the particle model as N tends to infinity; we propose, in 1D, a numerical scheme for the simulations, and perform a numerical analysis devoted to trying to recover asymptotically patterns similar to those emerging for the equivalent particle systems, when particles originally evolved on a circle.

TI CAN ROAD TRAFFIC LAW-ENFORCEMENT PERMANENTLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF
   ACCIDENTS
SO ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
LA English
DT Article
AB In this paper it is argued that conventional analyses of road user adaptation to traffic law enforcement, based on parametric rational-choice theory, are flawed. Such analyses only consider road-user actions as a response to enforcement level and penalty size and do not simultaneously consider enforcement as a response to road-user behaviour. If each party is considered a rational agent who adapts to the other's behaviour, the proper way to analyze the outcomes is by the way of game theory. A game-theoretic model is presented and the main implications are: (i) most attempts at enforcing road traffic legislation will not have any lasting effects, either on road-user behaviour or on accidents; (ii) imposing stricter penalties (in the form of higher fines or longer prison sentences) will not affect road-user behaviour; (iii) imposing stricter penalties will reduce the level of enforcement; (iv) implementing automatic traffic surveilance techniques and/or allocating enforcement resources according to a chance mechanism, and not according to police estimates of violation probability, can make enforcement effects last, but both alternatives are difficult to implement. Relevant empirical studies are reviewed, and they seem to support the conclusions arrived at by the game-theoretic model.

AB This paper is devoted to exploring the complex dynamics of contest model, where two agents compete for some object with asymmetric valuations by simultaneously choosing efforts at each step. We build the nonlinear discrete system to describe the dynamic contest with bounded rationality, and discuss the stability conditions of the Nash equilibrium theoretically. Meanwhile, our numerical simulation experiments also reveal that the model can exhibit very complex dynamical behaviors. In particular, there exist two different routes to chaos for the system: the period-doubling (flip) bifurcation which leads to periodic cycles and chaos, and the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation which derives an attractive invariant closed curve. These two routes are significantly different for economic views. In addition, the stability of Nash equilibrium point is badly affected by the system parameters, such as the adjustment speeds, the values of the object, and so on. Therefore, the parameter adjustment method could be properly applied to make the system return to its stable state. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An ongoing question in biological control consists of whether antagonistic interaction between different agents can be reduced in pest biocontrol. This study investigated the behavioral performance of Habrobracon hebetor Say on Ephestia kuehniella Zeller larvae treated with Metarhizium anisopliae (Metsch.) Soroldn sensu lato (s.l.) (isolate M14) at two different temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). A type II functional response was observed in female wasps of all treatments. Estimated handling time and attack rate values were not statistically different at two thermal conditions. Female wasps avoided the odor of fungus infected host larvae when offered simultaneously with healthy ones at 30 degrees C revealed by olfactory choice test. The number of untreated larvae parasitized by H. hebetor females was significantly differed between temperatures (25 and 30 degrees C). Overall, this study suggests that application of M. anisopliae s.l. for biological control of E. kuehniella is compatible with concurrent use of H. hebetor at 30 degrees C. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Ecological communities can remain stable in the face of disturbance if their constituent species have different resistance and resilience strategies. In turn, local stability scales up regionally if heterogeneous landscapes maintain spatial asynchrony across discrete populations-but not if large-scale stressors synchronize environmental conditions and biological responses. Here, we hypothesized that droughts could drastically decrease the stability of invertebrate metapopulations both by filtering out poorly adapted species locally, and by synchronizing their dynamics across a river network. We tested this hypothesis via multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models on spatially replicated, long-term data describing aquatic invertebrate communities and hydrological conditions in a set of temperate, lowland streams subject to seasonal and supraseasonal drying events. This quantitative approach allowed us to assess the influence of local (flow magnitude) and network-scale (hydrological connectivity) drivers on invertebrate long-term trajectories, and to simulate near-future responses to a range of drought scenarios. We found that fluctuations in species abundances were heterogeneous across communities and driven by a combination of hydrological and stochastic drivers. Among metapopulations, increasing extent of dry reaches reduced the abundance of functional groups with low resistance or resilience capacities (i.e. low ability to persist in situ or recolonize from elsewhere, respectively). Our simulations revealed that metapopulation quasi-extinction risk for taxa vulnerable to drought increased exponentially as flowing habitats contracted within the river network, whereas the risk for taxa with resistance and resilience traits remained stable. Our results suggest that drought can be a synchronizing agent in riverscapes, potentially leading to regional quasi-extinction of species with lower resistance and resilience abilities. Better recognition of drought-driven synchronization may increase realism in species extinction forecasts as hydroclimatic extremes continue to intensify worldwide.

AB Study design: Lithium has attracted much attention as a neuroregenerative agent for spinal cord injury in animal models. We hypothesized that the lithium can be beneficial to patients with spinal cord injury. The safety and pharmacokinetics of lithium has been studied in our earlier phase I clinical trial, indicating its safety. This is a phase II clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy on chronic spinal cord injury patients.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of lithium on chronic spinal cord injury patients.
   Setting: A major spinal cord injury rehabilitation center in Beijing, China.
   Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week parallel treatment arms with lithium carbonate and with placebo. A total of 40 chronic spinal cord injury subjects were recruited. Oral lithium carbonate was titrated or placebo was simulated to maintain the serum lithium level of 0.6-1.2 mmoll(-1) for 6 weeks, followed by a 6-month follow-up. The functional outcomes and the neurological classifications, as well as the safety parameters, adverse events and pharmacokinetic data were carefully collected and monitored.
   Results: No significant changes in the functional outcomes and the neurological classifications were found. The only significant differences were in the pain assessments using visual analog scale comparing the lithium and the placebo group. No severe adverse event was documented in the study.
   Conclusion: The lithium treatment did not change the neurological outcomes of patients with chronic spinal cord injury. It is worth to investigate whether lithium is effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain in chronic spinal cord injury. Sponsorship: China Spinal Cord Injury Network Company Limited.

AB The degradation of enrofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug used in veterinary medicine, was investigated with the brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum striatum. After 8 weeks, mycelia suspended in a defined liquid medium had produced 273, 18.5, and 6.7% (CO2)-C-14 from [C-14] enrofloxacin labeled either at position C-2, at position C-4, or in the piperazinyl moiety, respectively. Enrofloxacin, applied at 10 ppm, was transformed into metabolites already after about 1-week The most stable intermediates present in 2-day old supernatants were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography combined with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Eight of 11 proposed molecular structures could be confirmed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy or by cochromatography with reference compounds. We identified (i) 3-, 6-, and 8-hydroxylated congeners of enrofloxacin, which have no or only very little residual antibacterial activity; (ii) 5,6-(or 6,8-), 5,8-, and 7,8-dihydroxylated congeners, which were prone to autoxidative transformation; (iii) an isatin-type compound as well as an anthranilic acid derivative, directly demonstrating cleavage of the heterocyclic core of enrofloxacin; and (iv) 1-ethylpiperazine, the 7-amino congener, and desethglene-enrofloxacin, representing both elimination and degradation of the piperazinyl moiety. The pattern of metabolites implies four principle routes of degradation which might be simultaneously employed. Each route, initiated by either oxidative decarboxylation, defluorination, hydroxylation at C-8, or oxidation of the piperazinyl moiety, may reflect an initial attack by hydroxyl radicals at a different site of the drug. During chemical degradation of [4-C-14]enrofloxacin with Fenton's reagent, five confirmatory metabolites, contained in groups i and iv, were identified. These findings provide new evidence in support of the hypothesis that brown rot fungi may be capable of producing hydroxyl radicals, which could be utilized to degrade wood and certain xenobiotics.

AB The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) TMC278/rilpivirine is an anti-AIDS therapeutic agent with high oral bioavailability despite its high hydrophobicity. Previous studies established a correlation between ability of the drug molecule to form stable, homogeneous populations of spherical nanoparticles (similar to 100-120 nm. in diameter) at low pH in surfactant-independent fashion and good oral bioavailability. Here, we hypothesize that the drug is able to assume surfactant-like properties under physiologically relevant conditions, thus facilitating formation of nanostructures in the absence of other surfactants. The results of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations indeed show that protonated drug molecules behave as surfactants at the water/aggregate interface while neutral drug molecules assist aggregate packing via conformational variability. Our simulation results suggest that amphiphilic behavior at low pH and intrinsic flexibility influence drug aggregation and are believed to play critical roles in the favorable oral bioavailability of hydrophobic drugs.

AB The photocatalytic reduction of nitrate to nitrogen and the simultaneous production of hydrogen was investigated over copper loaded titania (P25) nanoparticles using glycerol as sacrificial agent and UV-A/Vis radiation. The experiments demonstrated that total nitrogen (i.e., nitrate, nitrite, and ammonia) removal efficiencies over 93% were achieved for initial nitrate concentrations up to 150 mg/I. A parallel hydrogen production up to 14 mu M was recorded. Hydrogen generation was affected by nitrate reduction. The reaction rates were dependent on pH and both glycerol and nitrate starting concentrations in the mixture. However, a linear model can be used to describe the process for low concentration of nitrate and constant pH. The system showed a remarkable photoefficiency in decontamination of nitrate-containing solutions and concomitant hydrogen evolution. This study lays the foundation for the future development of numerical models able to predict the chemical behavior of simultaneous proton and nitrate reduction over solar photocatalytic reforming of organics.

AB Humans have long marveled at the ability of animals to navigate swiftly, accurately, and across long distances. Many mechanisms have been proposed for how animals acquire, store, and retrace learned routes, yet many of these hypotheses appear incongruent with behavioral observations and the animals' neural constraints. The "Navigation by Scene Familiarity Hypothesis" proposed originally for insect navigation offers an elegantly simple solution for retracing previously experienced routes without the need for complex neural architectures and memory retrieval mechanisms. This hypothesis proposes that an animal can return to a target location by simply moving toward the most familiar scene at any given point. Proof of concept simulations have used computer-generated ant's-eye views of the world, but here we test the ability of scene familiarity algorithms to navigate training routes across satellite images extracted from Google Maps. We find that Google satellite images are so rich in visual information that familiarity algorithms can be used to retrace even tortuous routes with low-resolution sensors. We discuss the implications of these findings not only for animal navigation but also for the potential development of visual augmentation systems and robot guidance algorithms.

AB Initial feasibility of a novel closed-loop controller created by our group for closed-loop control of vasopressor infusions has been previously described. In clinical practice, vasopressor potency may be affected by a variety of factors including other pharmacologic agents, organ dysfunction, and vasoplegic states. The purpose of this study was therefore to evaluate the effectiveness of our controller in the face of large variations in drug potency, where 'effective' was defined as convergence on target pressure over time. We hypothesized that the controller would remain effective in the face up to a tenfold variability in drug response. To perform the robustness study, our physiologic simulator was used to create randomized simulated septic patients. 250 simulated patients were managed by the closed-loop in each of 7 norepinephrine responsiveness conditions: 0.1 x, 0.2 x, 0.5 x, 1 x, 2 x, 5 x, and 10 x expected population response to drug dose. Controller performance was evaluated for each level of norepinephrine response using Varvel's criteria as well as time-out-of-target. Median performance error and median absolute performance error were less than 5% in all response levels. Wobble was below 3% and divergence remained negative (i.e. the controller tended to converge towards the target over time) in all norepinephrine response levels, but at the highest response level of 10 x the value approached zero, suggesting the controller may be approaching instability. Response levels of 0.1 x and 0.2 x exhibited significantly higher time-out-of-target in the lower ranges (p < 0.001) compared to the 1 x response level as the controller was slower to correct the initial hypotension. In this simulation study, the closed-loop vasopressor controller remained effective in simulated patients exhibiting 0.1 to 10 x the expected population drug response.

AB This work studies the effect of microwaves in the synthesis of carbon adsorbents using pecan nutshell biomass as a precursor in a hybrid multimode microwave cavity avoiding the utilization of chemical activation or susceptors. The dielectric properties were calculated using the cavity perturbation method, and the power distribution of the electromagnetic field inside cavity was obtained by COMSOL Multiphysics. S-350-MW was obtained using at 350 degrees C and 200 W and it was characterized using elemental analysis, potentiometric titration, FT-IR and nitrogen adsorption isotherms at -196 degrees C. The adsorption of Pb(II), in single and binary solutions with Cu(II), Cd(II) and Zn (II) in batch systems indicate that the removal of Pb(II) is affected in the presence of Cu(II) due to the competition of these ions as a result of their similarities such as Pauling electronegativity. Finally, the removal of Pb(II) in continuous systems using packed bed columns showed the pH has the most significant effect according to the variance analysis. The finding highlighted the importance of the acidic functional groups in the performance of carbonaceous adsorbents for the removal of Pb(II). Results of this study contribute to the understandings and application of a hybrid heating system and establish the basis of the role of heating processes in the preparation of carbonaceous adsorbents using microwaves. The Pb(II) removal efficiency achieved in this study is significantly higher than the values reported for carbons prepared by using microwave heating which employs susceptors and/or chemical agents reported in literature, demonstrating that it is possible to obtain effective carbon absorbents for the removal of Pb(II) without the use of any additional susceptors or chemical activation.

AB The efficacy of whitening toothpastes is questionable and controversial. Clinicians, patients and researchers have expressed concern with whitening toothpastes due to the risk of wearing the dental structure and the potential for disappointment if the advertised cosmetic results are not achieved. Objective: This study compared the whitening performance of toothpastes with different whitening technologies after initial and continued use. Material and Methods: Ninety bovine incisors were stained using a concentrated solution of black tea. They were randomly distributed into 6 groups, according to the toothpaste whitening technology: activated charcoal (B&W), blue covarine (WAD), hydrogen peroxide (LWA), microbeads (Oral B 3D White Perfection - 3DW) and optimized abrasives (XW4D). They were compared to a traditional toothpaste without a whitening agent (TA - control). Specimens underwent a brushing machine with controlled pressure, time and temperature. A calibrated examiner measured the color using a VITA-Classical scale before the first brushing cycle (T0), after the first brushing cycle (TI), and after a brushing cycle that simulates continuous use (TCU). Whitening performance was evaluated by the difference of shades (Delta SGU) between T0-TI and T0-TCU timepoints, using the Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's non-parametric test. The Wilcoxon test was used to evaluate the cumulative effect (alpha=0.05). Results: Statistically significant differences were observed between toothpastes in both TI and TCU (p<0.05). The time of use also had a significant effect (p<0.05). Conclusion: Only WAD and 3DW showed whitening performance after the first use (TI). The greatest whitening performance after continuous use was obtained by WAD, followed by LWA and 3DW. The use of conventional toothpaste (TA) promotes no tooth whitening. Clinical relevance: Microbead abrasives (3DW) and blue covarine (WAD) were the active technology tested that presented the best global tooth whitening performance.

AB Information gathering comprises actions whose (sensory) consequences resolve uncertainty (i.e., are salient). In other words, actions that solicit salient information cause the greatest shift in beliefs (i.e., information gain) about the causes of our sensations. However, not all information is relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal model of selective attention based on active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant exploration. In this scheme, attention modulates the expected fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner. This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain, and so the agent-driven to reduce expected surprise (i.e., uncertainty) - does not actively seek them out. Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in conditions such as autism and anxiety may be due to a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way.

AB Centrifugal force is applied to a molten metal during a centrifugal casting process. Therefore, grains of primary solidified phase, inclusions or other additional agents are separated if centrifugal force is strong. The centrifugally separated structure is strongly influenced by a relationship between solidification rate of castings and centrifugal separation speed. However, it is difficult to observe or measure what happens in the process because the process is carried out under high temperatures and the material is usually opaque. Therefore, we tried to observe the centrifugal separation behavior during the centrifugal casting process by using 2-phase flow simulation based on MPS (Moving Particle Semi-implicit) method which is one of particle methods. We simulated centrifugal separation behaviors in the process and investigated an influence of density difference between the phases, particle size, viscosity and rotation speed. As a result, the centrifugal separation behavior was well simulated by the particle method, and also well evaluated by Stokes's law by considering an influence of an apparent viscosity increase caused by an error included in the MPS method.

AB Food-grade biopolymers, such as proteins and polysaccharides, may impact the gastrointestinal fate of foods through various mechanisms. In this study, we examined the influence of e-polylysine (an antimicrobial) and pectin (a thickening agent) on the behavior of a standard rodent diet (full-fat and fat-free) in a simulated gastrointestinal tract that included mouth, stomach, and small intestine phases. Powdered biopolymers were incorporated into the standard diet in either individual or complexed form. The presence of the biopolymers altered the microstructure and charge characteristics of the gastrointestinal contents. In particular, the presence of pectin appeared to increase the rate and extent of lipid digestion, which may have been due to its ability to inhibit protein aggregation. Our results do not support the hypothesis that polylysine inhibits lipid digestion, as has been reported previously. Overall, the results of this study may be useful for interpreting animal feeding studies of the influence of biopolymers on the gastrointestinal fate of foods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In obstacle environments, the problem of coordination tracking control for a team of Euler Lagrange systems is investigated under modeling uncertainties, actuator faults and disturbances. First, syncretizing the Null-Space-based Behavioral (NSB) control, graph theory and finite-time control method, a novel desired velocity is predesigned to achieve the finite-time obstacle avoidance and coordination tracking. Then a set of finite-time fault-tolerant coordination control laws (FFCCLs) are presented to guarantee all of the agents to track a dynamic target while avoiding obstacles/collisions. To improve the robustness and control accuracy of the systems, an adaptive control gain is incorporated into the FFCCL so that the derived algorithm can be implemented without manual parameter adjustment. Both of the control architectures are distributed, model-independent and robust with respect to modeling uncertainties, actuator faults and disturbances. Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the control strategies, showing that the overall motion of the two tasks can be accomplished satisfactorily with high precision.

AB N-1-ary-benzimidazol (NABZ) derivatives, an important class of HIV-1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), have been considered as one of the most successful agents for treating with AIDS at present. However, their three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) and mechanism of action in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) have not been well understood. In this paper, 38 NABZs were firstly docked into the binding pocket of the HIV-1 RT to elucidate their interaction mechanism, and molecular dynamics simulations were then carried out to confirm the reliability of the docking results. The docking-based 3D-QSAR models were generated using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) methods to give insights into the key structural features of NABZs for their activity. Both models yield satisfactory statistical parameters of the internal and external validation, and the CoMSIA model (Q(2)=0.670, R-2=0.987, and rpred2 = 0.954) showed slightly better predictive ability than the CoMFA model (Q(2)=0.613, R-2=0.985, and rpred2 = 0.939). The graphical contours demonstrated that the sulfonyl linker was a significant bridge for binding to the HIV-1 RT. The constructed pharmacophore with eight key features further verified the docking and 3D-QSAR results, indicating that the hydrogen-bond acceptor groups at the C-4-positon of the arylacetamide moiety were important for the anti-HIV-1 activity, in addition to 3,5-dimethylphenyl, benzimidazole, and arylacetamide moieties. These studies might provide significant insights into the key structural features for designing potent HIV-1 NNRTIs.

AB Purpose: To determine aqueous and vitreous humor ofloxacin levels following oral and topical application of ofloxacin in patients with noninflamed cornea and intact crystalline lens, and to compare the drug levels provided by each route.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-six patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy for various ocular pathologies were divided into two groups. Fourteen patients received two drops of 0.3% ophthalmic solution of ofloxacin every 30 minutes for 3 hours and every 60 minutes for the next 3 hours, and 12 patients received a single oral dose of 400 mg ofloxacin 8 hours before surgery. The aqueous and vitreous humor samples were simultaneously collected after oral or topical administration during pars plana vitrectomy to assess penetration of the drug. Samples were assayed for ofloxacin concentrations by a previously described method using high-performance liquid chromatography.
   Results: The aqueous and vitreous humor levels of ofloxacin were 1.54 +/- 0.27 mu g/mL (mean +/- standard error) and 1.77 +/- 0.24 mu g/mL after oral and 1.44 +/- 0.24 mu g/mL and 0.37 +/- 0.05 mu g/mL after topical ofloxacin administration, respectively. Aqueous humor levels were not statistically different following oral or topical administration (P > 0.8). However, vitreous level of the drug after oral administration was significantly higher than that after topical administration (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Ocular bioavailability of ofloxacin in aqueous humor after oral and topical administration is similar when the drug is applied as described. Penetration of ofloxacin into vitreous humor is less than that into aqueous humor following topical application. The aqueous humor levels of ofloxacin via both routes and the Vitreous level of the drug after oral route exceed the minimum inhibitory concentrations for certain bacterial species that frequently cause intraocular infection.

AB Since chemicals' ecotoxic effects depend for most soil species on the dissolved concentration in pore water, the equilibrium partitioning (EP) method is generally used to estimate hazardous concentrations (HC50) in the soil from aquatic toxicity tests. The present study analyzes the statistical uncertainty in terrestrial HC50s derived by the EP-method. For 47 organic chemicals, we compared freshwater HC50s derived from standard aquatic ecotoxicity tests with porewater HC50s derived from terrestrial ecotoxicity tests. Statistical uncertainty in the HC50s due to limited species sample size and in organic carbon-water partitioning coefficients due to predictive error was treated with probability distributions propagated by Monte Carlo simulations. Particularly for specifically acting chemicals, it is very important to base the HC50 on a representative sample of species, composed of both target and non-target species. For most chemical groups, porewater HC50 values were approximately a factor of 3 higher than freshwater HC50 values. The ratio of the porewater HC50/freshwater HC50 was typically 3.0 for narcotic chemicals (2.8 for nonpolar and 3.4 for polar narcotics), 0.8 for reactive chemicals, 2.9 for neurotoxic chemicals (4.3 for AChE agents and 0.1 for the cyclodiene type), and 2.5 for herbicides-fungicides. However, the statistical uncertainty associated with this ratio was large (typically 2.3 orders of magnitude). For 81% of the organic chemicals studied, there was no statistical difference between the hazardous concentration of aquatic and terrestrial species. We conclude that possible systematic deviations between the HC50s of aquatic and terrestrial species appear to be less prominent than the overall statistical uncertainty. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB NB4 cells are the only in vitro model of differentiation in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although these cells respond to all-trans-retinoic acid to form neutrophils, our group has recently shown that these cells are capable of terminal monocytic differentiation in response to combined treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-3 (1,25 D-3) and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). We show here that the agents need not be present simultaneously, but may be added sequentially. TPA treatment prior to 1,25 D-3 Zed to the appearance of adherent cells; however, when 1,25 D-3 treatment preceded TPA treatment cells expressed all differentiation markers reflective of terminal differentiation. This priming effect of 1,25 D-3 was both dose and time dependent. Increasing the interval between 1,25 D-3 and TPA treatment caused a decrease in this priming potential indicative of limited commitment inducing capacity of 1,25 D-3. In Order to characterize the mechanism of action of 1,25 D-3 and TPA, chemical inhibitors of phosphorylation were used. Staurosporine and bisindolymaleimide GF 109203X treatment prior to and during 1,25 D-3 treatment or TPA treatment caused attenuation of the differentiation response. Experiments utilizing tyrosine kinase and phosphatase inhibitors supported the hypothesis that 1,25 D-3 Signaling was mediated by both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation cascades. Results from this study provide evidence to support the hypothesis that 1,25 D-3 signaling occurs via nongenomic mechanisms which when combined with the signaling effects of TPA, allow for the terminal differentiation of APL cells. This model should be used to develop new differentiation therapies for APL and other leukemias. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

AB Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major pathogen responsible for health care-associated infections, and treatment options are limited. Tedizolid (TZD) is a novel oxazolidinone antibiotic with activity against MRSA. Previously, daptomycin (DAP) has demonstrated synergy with other antibiotics against MRSA. We sought to determine the efficacy of the combination of TZD and DAP against MRSA in an in vitro model of simulated endocardial vegetations (SEVs). TZD simulations of 200 mg once daily and DAP simulations of 6 mg/kg of body weight and 10 mg/kg once daily were tested alone and in the combinations TZD plus DAP at 6 mg/kg or DAP at 10 mg/kg against two clinical strains of MRSA, 494 and 67. These regimens were tested in SEV models over 8 days to determine the antibacterial activity of the regimens and whether synergy or antagonism might be present between the agents. Against both strains 494 and 67 and at both DAP dose regimens, the combination of TZD and DAP was antagonistic at 192 h. In all cases, DAP alone was statistically superior to DAP plus TZD. When the combination was stopped after 96 h, transitioning to DAP at 6 mg/kg or DAP at 10 mg/kg alone resulted in better antibacterial activity than either of the TZDplus- DAP combinations, further demonstrating antagonistic effects. Against MRSA, we demonstrated that TZD and DAP have antagonistic activity that hinders their overall antimicrobial efficacy. The exact nature of this antagonistic relationship is still undetermined, but its presence warrants further study of the potentially harmful grouping of the two antibiotics in clinical use.

AB In comparative effectiveness research (CER), often the aim is to contrast survival outcomes between exposure groups defined by time-varying interventions. With observational data, standard regression analyses (e.g., Cox modeling) cannot account for time-dependent confounders on causal pathways between exposures and outcome nor for time-dependent selection bias that may arise from informative right censoring. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to fit marginal structural models (MSMs) has commonly been applied to properly adjust for these expected sources of bias in real-world observational studies. We describe the application and performance of an alternate estimation approach in such a study. The approach is based on the recently proposed targeted learning methodology and consists in targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with super learning (SL) within a nonparametric MSM. The evaluation is based on the analysis of electronic health record data with both IPW estimation and TMLE to contrast cumulative risks under four more or less aggressive strategies for treatment intensification in adults with type 2 diabetes already on 2+ oral agents or basal insulin. Results from randomized experiments provide a surrogate gold standard to validate confounding and selection bias adjustment. Bootstrapping is used to validate analytic estimation of standard errors. This application does the following: (1) establishes the feasibility of TMLE in real-world CER based on large healthcare databases; (2) provides evidence of proper confounding and selection bias adjustment with TMLE and SL; and (3) motivates their application for improving estimation efficiency. Claims are reinforced with a simulation study that also illustrates the double-robustness property of TMLE. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Aims IFN-beta (IFN beta) signalling is increased in patients with insufficient coronary collateral growth (i.e. arteriogenesis) and IFN beta hampers arteriogenesis in mice. A downside of most pro-arteriogenic agents investigated in the past has been their pro-atherosclerotic properties, rendering them unsuitable for therapeutic application. Interestingly, type I IFNs have also been identified as pro-atherosclerotic cytokines and IFN beta treatment increases plaque formation and accumulation of macrophages. We therefore hypothesized that mAb therapy to inhibit IFN beta signalling would stimulate arteriogenesis and simultaneously attenuate-rather than aggravate-atherosclerosis.
   Methods and results In a murine hindlimb ischaemia model, atherosclerotic low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR-/-) mice were treated during a 4-week period with blocking MAbs specific for mouse IFN-alpha/beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) or murine IgG isotype as a control. The arteriogenic response was quantified using laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) as well as immunohistochemistry. Effects on atherosclerosis were determined by quantification of plaque area and analysis of plaque composition. Downstream targets of IFN beta were assessed by real-time PCR(RT-PCR) in the aortic arch. Hindlimb perfusion restoration after femoral artery ligation was improved in mice treated with anti-IFNAR1 compared with controls as assessed by LDPI. This was accompanied by a decrease in CXCL10 expression in the IFNAR1 MAb-treated group. Anti-IFNAR1 treatment reduced plaque apoptosis without affecting total plaque area or other general plaque composition parameters. Results were confirmed in a short-term model and in apolipoprotein E knockout (APOE)(-/-) mice.
   Conclusion Monoclonal anti-IFNAR1 therapy during a 4-week treatment period stimulates collateral artery growth in mice and did not enhance atherosclerotic burden. This is the first reported successful strategy using MAbs to stimulate arteriogenesis.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) in the differentiation between physiological and simulated pathophysiological lower limb muscle perfusion pressures in healthy volunteers.
   Methods The lower limb muscle perfusion pressures in eight healthy volunteers were assessed in the supine position (as a control) and then subsequently in an elevated position with a thigh tourniquet applied to induce venous stasis. An intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 ml contrast agent was given to create a perfusion signal, which was measured with a multiple-frequency probe. Semiquantitative analysis was performed using specific software to create a perfusion curve which allowed measurement of six parameters: the time to arrival (TTA) starting from bolus application (s); peak of signal intensity (%); time to peak (TTP) maximum (seconds); regional blood volume (RBV), regional blood flow (RBF), and mean transit time (MTT) in seconds. Statistical analysis was performed using the Mann-Whitney U test as a non-parametric test (IBM SPSS statistics, version 21, USA).
   Results The group of simulated hypoperfusion showed significant higher values for TTA (39.8 +/- 5.1 s) (p = 0.028), TTP (43.8 +/- 13.6 s) (p = 0.003), RBV (8,424 +/- 5,405) (p = 0.028), and MTT (262 +/- 90.6 s) (p = 0.005). In contrast, the parameter of regional blood flow (32.1 +/- 10.9) was significantly lower (p = 0.038). The peak signal intensity (25.8 +/- 8.2 %) was lower, but this was not significant (p = 0.083).
   Conclusions CEUS provides a reliable non-invasive imaging modality for the assessment of lower limb muscle perfusion pressures. This may be of clinical use in the assessment of a developing compartment syndrome. Further clinical studies are required to further define its accuracy and reproducibility.

AB This article identifies and investigates the two seemingly conflicting tales that characterise the English health policy process at the national level since 1997. The first tale points to a high degree of central political control over the initiation and development of policy, and the maintenance of the system of strong central government, traditionally referred to as the 'Westminster and Whitehall model'. The second tale describes a system of 'network governance', suggesting a more complex health policy process in which central government (in particular, the Department of Health as its agent) is weaker than before and no longer holds a monopoly over the health policy-making process. The paper reviews the limited empirical evidence on the English health policy process since 1997 to determine which of the two narratives more accurately captures the nature of it at the national level. It concludes that, while many of the trends noted by the 'from-governmentto-governance' thesis are evident in the case of health policy, the process has been less affected than other areas of public policy by the appearance of new actors, the move to new institutional arenas and the transformation of relationships. Rather than one of the tales being right and the other wrong, as the literature in this area tends to suggest, it is more accurate to describe the current situation as marked by the simultaneous presence of different modes of policy-making - both 'command-and-control' as well as a more inclusive, complex set of mechanisms. Indeed, top-down coordination and control of the policy process may be seen as a response to the greater practical difficulties facing the 'core executive' in managing policy processes that involve an increased number of influential actors.

TI Meta-analysis of rare adverse events in randomized clinical trials:
   Bayesian and frequentist methods
SO CLINICAL TRIALS
LA English
DT Article
DE Meta-analysis; randomized controlled trials; Bayesian analysis; rare
   event; regulatory science; rosiglitazone
AB Background/aims:
   Regulatory approval of a drug or device involves an assessment of not only the benefits but also the risks of adverse events associated with the therapeutic agent. Although randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating effectiveness, the number of treated patients in a single RCT may not be enough to detect a rare but serious side effect of the treatment. Meta-analysis plays an important role in the evaluation of the safety of medical products and has advantage over analyzing a single RCT when estimating the rate of adverse events.
   Methods:
   In this article, we compare 15 widely used meta-analysis models under both Bayesian and frequentist frameworks when outcomes are extremely infrequent or rare. We present extensive simulation study results and then apply these methods to a real meta-analysis that considers RCTs investigating the effect of rosiglitazone on the risks of myocardial infarction and of death from cardiovascular causes.
   Results:
   Our simulation studies suggest that the beta hyperprior method modeling treatment group-specific parameters and accounting for heterogeneity performs the best. Most models ignoring between-study heterogeneity give poor coverage probability when such heterogeneity exists. In the data analysis, different methods provide a wide range of log odds ratio estimates between rosiglitazone and control treatments with a mixed conclusion on their statistical significance based on 95% confidence (or credible) intervals.
   Conclusion:
   In the rare event setting, treatment effect estimates obtained from traditional meta-analytic methods may be biased and provide poor coverage probability. This trend worsens when the data have large between-study heterogeneity. In general, we recommend methods that first estimate the summaries of treatment-specific risks across studies and then relative treatment effects based on the summaries when appropriate. Furthermore, we recommend fitting various methods, comparing the results and model performance, and investigating any significant discrepancies among them.

AB We previously showed that palmitic acid methyl ester (PAME) and stearic acid methyl ester (SAME) are simultaneously released from the sympathetic ganglion and PAME possesses potent vasodilatory properties which may be important in cerebral ischemia. Since PAME is a potent vasodilator simultaneously released with SAME, our hypothesis was that PAME/SAME confers neuroprotection in rat models of focal/global cerebral ischemia. We also examined the neuroprotective properties of Solutol HS15, a clinically approved excipient because it possesses similar fatty acid compositions as PAME/SAME. Asphyxial cardiac arrest (ACA, 6 min) was performed 30 min after PAME/SAME treatment (0.02 mg/kg, IV). Solutol HS15 (2 ml/kg, IP) was injected chronically for 14 days (once daily). Histopathology of hippocampal CA1 neurons was assessed 7 days after ACA. For focal ischemia experiments, PAME, SAME, or Solutol HS15 was administered following reperfusion after 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). 2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium staining of the brain was performed 24 h after MCAO and the infarct volume was quantified. Following ACA, the number of surviving hippocampal neurons was enhanced by PAME-treated (68 %), SAME-treated (69 %), and Solutol-treated HS15 (68 %) rats as compared to ACA only-treated groups. Infarct volume was decreased by PAME (83 %), SAME (68 %), and Solutol HS15 (78 %) as compared to saline (vehicle) in MCAO-treated animals. PAME, SAME, and Solutol HS15 provide robust neuroprotection in both paradigms of ischemia. This may prove therapeutically beneficial since Solutol HS15 is already administered as a solublizing agent to patients. With proper timing and dosage, administration of Solutol HS15 and PAME/SAME can be an effective therapy against cerebral ischemia.

AB Alzheimer's disease is characterized using amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation. The present work was carried out to extend and design a novel quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model on inhibition efficiency of some of new 2-arylethenylquinoline derivatives against the A beta(1-42) peptide aggregation. The QSAR study, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to explore the influence of the structural features and investigate the molecular mechanism of ligands interactions with the A beta(1-42) peptide. Using molecular docking was understood that electron donating groups with small size help to create interactions between the ligands and peptide residues to stabilize the conformation of ligands at the binding pocket. QSAR model was developed using the most stable conformations and parameters that obtained from the molecular docking. It is shown that, a combination of docking parameters and structural descriptors of inhibitor compounds can describe the inhibition efficiency on A beta(1-42) peptide. The model exhibited statistically significant results so that the coefficient of determination R-train(2), Q(LOO)(2), R-ext(2) and GH (goodness of hit) are 0.912, 0.915, 0.836 and 0.804, respectively. The stability and binding modes of the compounds 1 and 13 with the most inhibition efficiency and compounds 12 and 36 with the lowest inhibition efficiency were determined by molecular dynamics simulations in GROMACS package. It is showed that interactions of compounds 1 and 13 are stable after 25ns of trajectories. Based on obtained results, 10 new drug compounds have been designed that provide better inhibition efficiency with the A beta(1-42) peptide than the reference compounds. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose To evaluate the effects of three luting resins and roughening of the dentinal walls on the long term retention of tapered titanium dowels
   Materials and Methods Ninety six single-rooted teeth were endodontically treated All root specimens were divided into three groups (n = 32) Dowel spaces were then prepared with ISO 90 drills 10 mm deep Corresponding prefabricated tapered titanium dowels were air abraded and luted with Panavia 21 (P21), Super Bond C&B (SB) or with Chemiace II (CH) according to the manufacturers instructions In the subgroups of each luting agent the dentinal walls were either left in their original state as prepared by the drills (n = 16) or roughened with a handheld diamond coated ISO 90 cutting instrument (n = 16) The bonded specimens were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 3 days (n = 8) or 150 days with simulated aging conditions of 37,500 thermal cycles (5 degrees C/55 degrees C) and 300,000 mechanical loading cycles with 30 N (n = 8) Dowel retention in N was measured using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min Statistical analysis was performed with ANOVAs followed by Scheffe post hoc tests
   Results The dowel retention with P21 and SB was significantly higher than that of CH (p <= 0 05) Roughening the dentinal walls significantly increased the retention for all cements (p <= 0 01) Storage for 150 days with thermal cycling and mechanical loading caused a significant decrease in dowel retention (p <= 0 05)
   Conclusion P21 and SB luting resins provided a durable retention of prefabricated titanium dowels in root canals, especially for root canals with roughened dentinal walls as the combined result of sliding friction micromechanical interlocking and adhesive dentin bonding

AB The forces driving cultural accumulation in human populations, both modern and ancient, are hotly debated. Did genetic, demographic, or cognitive features of behaviorally modern humans (as opposed to, say, early modern humans or Neanderthals) allow culture to accumulate to its current, unprecedented levels of complexity? Theoretical explanations for patterns of accumulation often invoke demographic factors such as population size or density, whereas statistical analyses of variation in cultural complexity often point to the importance of environmental factors such as food stability, in determining cultural complexity. Here we use both an analytical model and an agent-based simulation model to show that a full understanding of the emergence of behavioral modernity, and the cultural evolution that has followed, depends on understanding and untangling the complex relationships among culture, genetically determined cognitive ability, and demographic history. For example, we show that a small but growing population could have a different number of cultural traits from a shrinking population with the same absolute number of individuals in some circumstances.

AB Adaptive networks rely on in-network and collaborative processing among distributed agents to deliver enhanced performance in estimation and inference tasks. Information is exchanged among the nodes, usually over noisy links. The combination weights that are used by the nodes to fuse information from their neighbors play a critical role in influencing the adaptation and tracking abilities of the network. This paper first investigates the mean-square performance of general adaptive diffusion algorithms in the presence of various sources of imperfect information exchanges, quantization errors, and model non-stationarities. Among other results, the analysis reveals that link noise over the regression data modifies the dynamics of the network evolution in a distinct way, and leads to biased estimates in steady-state. The analysis also reveals how the network mean-square performance is dependent on the combination weights. We use these observations to show how the combination weights can be optimized and adapted. Simulation results illustrate the theoretical findings and match well with theory.

TI Learning to transfer optimal navigation policies

DE statistical relational learning; mobile robotics; navigation; imitation;

AB Autonomous agents that act in the real world utilizing sensory input greatly rely on the ability to plan their actions and to transfer these skills across tasks. The majority of path-planning approaches for mobile robots, however, solve the current navigation problem from scratch, given the current and goal configuration of the robot. Consequently, these approaches yield highly efficient plans for the specific situation, but the computed policies typically do not transfer to other, similar tasks. In this paper, we propose to apply techniques from statistical relational learning to the path-planning problem. More precisely, we propose to learn relational decision trees as abstract navigation strategies from example paths. Relational abstraction has several interesting and important properties. First, it allows a mobile robot to imitate navigation behavior shown by users or by optimal policies. Second, it yields comprehensible models of behavior. Finally, a navigation policy learned in one environment naturally transfers to unknown environments. In several experiments with real robots and in simulated runs, we demonstrate that our approach yields efficient navigation plans. We show that our system is robust against observation noise and can outperform hand-crafted policies.

ID AUTOREGRESSIVE CONDITIONAL HETEROSKEDASTICITY
AB Recently, genetic programming has been proposed to model agents' adaptive behavior in a complex transition process where uncertainty cannot be formalized within the usual probabilistic framework. However, this approach has not been widely accepted by economists. One of the main reasons is the lack of the theoretical foundation of using genetic programming to model transition dynamics. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, motivated by the recent applications of algorithmic information theory in economics, we would like to show the relevance of genetic programming to transition dynamics given this background. Second, we would like to supply two concrete applications to transition dynamics. The first application, which is designed for the pedagogic purpose, shows that genetic programming can simulate the Iron-smooth transition, which is;difficult to be captured by conventional tool kits, such as differential equations and difference equations. In the second application, genetic;programming is:applied to simulate the adaptive behavior of speculators. This simulation shows that genetic programming can generate artificial time series with the statistical properties frequently observed in real financial time series.

AB Icodextrin (ICO) has better biocompatibility and an improved ultrafiltration profile in long-dwell peritoneal dialysis compared to those of glucose. However, the long-term repeated use of a single ICO osmotic agent may cause a change in the peritoneal transport characteristics, leading to a reduction in the ultrafiltration profile. Many studies have shown that such a reduction can be quite significant in some patients. In this study, the factors responsible for this decline are investigated via a series of numerical simulations. The peritoneal transport characteristics and ultrafiltration profile are predicted using a three-pore model. To account for the continuous absorption of ICO from the abdominal cavity during peritoneal dialysis, the three-pore model is modified to accommodate a non-constant concentration of ICO in blood. The simulation results show that the presence of residual ICO in blood results in poorer ultrafiltration behavior. Long-duration and repeated use and exposure to ICO result in a residual concentration of ICO in blood, which changes the mesothelial tissue around the blood capillaries in the peritoneal membrane and causes a reduction in ultrafiltration performance.

AB A non-hydrostatic, fully compressible, regional-scale numerical model of the atmosphere that includes parameterization of cloud microphysics is run in a two-dimensional mode. It uses two different observed vertical profiles of temperature, relative humidity and wind to simulate the local circulation evolution and impact on convection and nocturnal fog occurrence in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The atmospheric behaviour generated by the model is similar to the observations of the two summer days with and without sea breeze progression over the plateau. The convective development occurs in the afternoon of the two experiments but with different features and intensities. In the experiment with sea-breeze progression, there is fog formation over the plateau during the following night, in accordance with the observations. A strong northwesterly flow acting in the lower troposphere, with intensity varying between 7 and 10 m s(-1), appears as an inhibiting agent of the sea-breeze progression over the plateau and of convective development in the afternoon and of the nocturnal fog occurrence. In this case, observed gusts during the night are well simulated and appear to be related to the topography.

AB This paper investigates the complex behaviors and entropy properties for a novel random complex interacting stock price dynamics, which is established by the combination of stochastic contact process and compound Poisson process, concerning with stock return fluctuations caused by the spread of investors' attitudes and random jump fluctuations caused by the macroeconomic environment, respectively. To better understand the fluctuation complex behaviors of the proposed price dynamics, the entropy analyses of random logarithmic price returns and corresponding absolute returns of simulation dataset with different parameter set are preformed, including permutation entropy, fractional permutation entropy, sample entropy and fractional sample entropy. We found that a larger lambda or gamma leads to more complex dynamics, and the absolute return series exhibit lower complex dynamics than the return series. To verify the rationality of the proposed compound price model, the corresponding analyses of actual market datasets are also comparatively preformed. The empirical results verify that the proposed price model can reproduce some important complex dynamics of actual stock markets to some extent.

AB Recent empirical and theoretical works on collective behaviors based on a topological interaction are beginning to offer some explanations as for the physical reasons behind the selection of a particular number of nearest neighbors locally affecting each individual's dynamics. Recently, flocking starlings have been shown to topologically interact with a very specific number of neighbors, between six to eight, while metric-free interactions were found to govern human crowd dynamics. Here, we use network-and graph-theoretic approaches combined with a dynamical model of locally interacting self-propelled particles to study how the consensus reaching process and its dynamics are influenced by the number k of topological neighbors. Specifically, we prove exactly that, in the absence of noise, consensus is always attained with a speed to consensus strictly increasing with k. The analysis of both speed and time to consensus reveals that, irrespective of the swarm size, a value of k,10 speeds up the rate of convergence to consensus to levels close to the one of the optimal all-to-all interaction signaling. Furthermore, this effect is found to be more pronounced in the presence of environmental noise.

AB In this work, a comprehensive three-dimensional numerical model was developed to simulate the coal-fired chemical looping combustion (CLC) process using ilmenite as oxygen carrier in a pressurized circulating fluidized bed (CFB) fuel reactor. Both gas-solid flow and chemical reactions were considered. The chemical reactions contain steam gasification of coal and subsequent reduction reactions of intermediate gasification products with the oxygen carrier. This model predicted the main features of the complex gas-solid flow behaviors from the velocity and voidage profiles. The concentrations of gas solid components, the conversions of char and oxygen carrier, and the distributions of reaction rates were also obtained. Meanwhile, further simulations were performed to evaluate the effects of operating variables on the fuel conversion in the fuel reactor. The conversion of carbon in char is directly related to the extent of gasification, which is promoted by increasing the temperature or the fraction of steam in gasification agent. This work indicates a promising way to research the CLC process of solid fuels in a CFB fuel reactor.

AB We investigate chemical aspects of mating in the marine copepod Temora longicornis (Copepoda, Calanoidea). Our emphasis is the female pheromone signaling in form of well-defined trails for males to follow, observed in Doall et al. (Phil Trans R Soc Lond B 353: 681-689, 1998). The viscous environment and the properties of the odorants play important roles as the spread of the pheromone trail limits the time during which it is useful for tracing. A key observation from our earlier work is the ability of a searching male to detect the direction of the female and to correct its swimming direction if necessary. We propose a simple mathematical model for the spread of a pheromone from a moving source and carry out numerical simulations of two possible detection mechanisms. We find that a searching agent that is capable to detect a ratio outperforms a searcher that depends on the gradient of a single compound. This suggests that copepod sex pheromones consist of blends of chemical compounds, and that a ratio detection mechanism similar to that in airborne insects is at work.

AB Thermal emissions - or anthropogenic heat fluxes (Q(F)) - from human activities impact urban climates at a local and larger scale. DASH considers both urban form and function in simulating Q(F) through the use of an agent-based structure that includes behavioural characteristics of urban residents. This allows human activities to drive the calculation of Q(F), incorporating dynamic responses to environmental conditions. The spatial resolution of simulations depends on data availability. DASH has simple transport and building energy models to allow simulation of dynamic vehicle use, occupancy and heating-cooling demand, and release of energy to the outdoor environment through the building fabric. Building stock variations are captured using archetypes. Evaluation of DASH in Greater London for periods in 2015 uses a top-down inventory model (GQF) and national energy consumption statistics. DASH reproduces the expected spatial and temporal patterns of Q(F), but the annual average is smaller than published energy data. Overall, the model generally performs well, including for domestic appliance energy use. DASH could be coupled to an urban land surface model and/or used offline for developing coefficients for simpler/faster models.

AB The production process for expanded polypropylene foam beads (EPP), which consists of steaming, depressurizing, cooling, and ageing operations, was consistently simulated by a set of mathematical models. The models, developed from Yang and Lee's ageing models (Yang and Lee, J. Cell. Plast., 39, 59 (2003)) for extrusion foam products, were extended in terms of the fundamental aspects of mass and heat transport phenomena. Evaporation and condensation of blowing agents and heat conduction during the steam chest molding and ageing processes were modeled. The governing equations were established by integrating the mass transfer equations of steam and air at the intercellular walls with the constitutive equations of evaporation and condensation in each cell, the equation of heat conduction from the mold to the foam, and the mechanical force balance equation on the cell walls. The models simulate the stress exerted on the steaming chest mold and predict the expansion behavior of cells in the EPP bead-foam board throughout the ageing process. A sensitivity analysis was also performed by the models to find the key factors which might allow the theoretical determination of the ejection time and shortening of the length of the ageing process.

AB A dot in the vastness of the Atlantic, Ascension Island remains a lifelong goal for the green sea turtles that hatched there, returning as adults every three or four years to nest. This navigating puzzle was brought to the scientific community's attention by Charles Darwin and remains a topic of considerable speculation. Various cues have been suggested, with orientation to geomagnetic field elements and following odour plumes to their island source among the most compelling. Via a comprehensive in silico Investigation we test the hypothesis that multimodal cue following, in which turtles utilise multiple guidance cues, is the most effective strategy. Specifically, we combine agent-based and continuous-level modelling to simulate displaced virtual turtles as they attempt to return to the island. Our analysis shows how population homing efficiency improves as the number of utilised cues is increased, even under "extreme" scenarios where the overall strength of navigating information decreases. Beyond the paradigm case of green turtles returning to Ascension Island, we believe this could commonly apply throughout animal navigation.

ID REGRESSION; COEFFICIENTS
AB In many public policy problems, we need to estimate the way in which policy changes affect people's behavior. In the analysis of tax and subsidy reform-the topic of this article-we need to know how tax-induced price changes affect the amounts that people buy of the taxed goods. We present various economic and statistical approaches to obtaining the required estimates. We consider the standard structural methods in economics, where the behavior and welfare of individual agents are captured simultaneously by the specification of utility functions whose parameters are to be estimated. We argue that these methods are less useful than alternatives that directly consider the derivatives of the re,regression function of average behavior. We consider both parametric and nonparametric estimators of these derivatives in the context of price reform For foods in Pakistan, focussing on the advantages and disadvantages of "average derivative estimation" (ADE). ADE is attractive in principle, because it directly estimates the statistics required for policy analysis. In the practical case considered here, neither technique is a clear winner; each has strengths and weaknesses.

AB A predictive ligand based quantitative pharmacophore model has been constructed to extract the essential features accountable for the inhibition of vinca domain inhibitors. To generate pharmacophore model a set of 23 functionally diverse training compounds was exploited by employing the Phase algorithm. The statistically significant (R-2 = 0.81, Q(2) = 0.61, RMSE = 0.63 and Pearson-R = 0.79) five feature pharmacophore model consist of one hydrogen-bond acceptor, one hydrogen-bond donor, a hydrophobic feature, one positive ionizable and a ring aromatic feature was chosen to screen the ZINC natural product database of IBScreen. The retreived hits were subjected to molecular docking examination by using FlexX. Furthermore, the dynamic behaviour and conformational features of the top scored docked molecule was envisioned via molecular dynamics simulations. The rationale behind the present work was to bid healthier perceptive about the binding of the tubulin inhibitors and abet in discovering new leads with potent antitumor activities.

AB Casualty prediction in a building during earthquakes:benefits to implement the economic loss estimation in the performance-based earthquake engineering methodology. Although after-earthquake observations reveal that the evacuation has effects on the quantity of occupant casualties during earthquakes, few current studies consider occupant movements in the building in casualty prediction procedures. To bridge this knowledge gap, a numerical simulation method using refined cellular automata model is presented, which can describe various occupant dynamic behaviors and building dimensions. The simulation on the occupant evacuation is verified by a recorded evacuation process from a school classroom in real-life 2013 Ya'an earthquake in China. The occupant casualties in the building under earthquakes are evaluated by coupling the building collapse process simulation by finite element method, the occupant evacuation simulation, and the casualty occurrence criteria with time and space synchronization. A case study of casualty prediction in a building during an earthquake is provided to demonstrate the effect of occupant movements on casualty prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The time correlation functions of the electronic spin components of a metal ion without orbital degeneracy in solution are computed. The approach is based on the numerical solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation for a stochastic perturbing Hamiltonian which is simulated by a Monte Carlo algorithm using discrete time steps. The perturbing Hamiltonian is quite general, including the superposition of both the static mean crystal field contribution in the molecular frame and the usual transient ligand field term. The Hamiltonian of the static crystal field can involve the terms of all orders, which are invariant under the local group of the average geometry of the complex. In the laboratory frame, the random rotation of the complex is the only source of modulation of this Hamiltonian, whereas an additional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is needed to describe the time fluctuations of the Hamiltonian of the transient crystal field. A numerical procedure for computing the electronic paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra is proposed and discussed. For the [Gd(H2O)(8)](3+) octa-aqua ion and the [Gd(DOTA)(H2O)](-) complex [DOTA=1,4,7,10-tetrakis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo dodecane] in water, the predictions of the Redfield relaxation theory are compared with those of the Monte Carlo approach. The Redfield approximation is shown to be accurate for all temperatures and for electronic resonance frequencies at and above X-band, justifying the previous interpretations of EPR spectra. At lower frequencies the transverse and longitudinal relaxation functions derived from the Redfield approximation display significantly faster decays than the corresponding simulated functions. The practical interest of this simulation approach is underlined. (C) 2001 American Institute of Physics.

AB A bottom-up modelling approach together with a set of calibration methodologies is presented to predict residential building occupants' time-dependent activities, for use in dynamic building simulations. The stochastic model to predict activity chains is calibrated using French time-use survey data (of 1998/1999), based on three types of time-dependent quantities: (i) the probability to be at home, (ii) the conditional probability to start an activity whilst being at home, and (iii) the probability distribution function for the duration of that activity. The behaviour of the individual agents in the model is first calibrated using a generic approach, where every individual is assumed to behave the same. A refinement is then presented to account for variations in the behaviours of sub-populations, having specific individual characteristics. Furthermore, a statistical approach is introduced for the modelling of transitions between two successive activity types as a Markov process. The models are then validated using a cross-validation technique, and their predictive performance is compared at an individual level, as well as for aggregated (sub-)populations.

AB The conversion of gaseous molecular iodine into iodine oxide aerosols has significant relevance in the understanding of the fission product iodine volatility in a LWR containment during severe accidents. In containment, the high radiation field caused by fission products released from the reactor core induces radiolytic oxidation into iodine oxides. To study the characteristics and the behaviour of iodine oxides in large scale, two THAI tests Iod-13 and Iod-14 were performed, simulating radiolytic oxidation of molecular iodine by reaction of iodine with ozone, with ozone injected from an ozone generator. The observed iodine oxides form submicron particles with mean volume-related diameters of about 0.35 mu m and show low deposition rates in the THAI tests performed in the absence of other nuclear aerosols. Formation of iodine aerosols from gaseous precursors iodine and ozone is fast as compared to their chemical interaction. The current approach in empirical iodine containment behaviour models in severe accidents, including the radiolytic production of I-2-oxidizing agents followed by the I-2 oxidation itself, is confirmed by these THAI tests.

TI Bond Type and Discretization of Nonmuscle Myosin II Are Critical for

AB Molecular motors drive cytoskeletal rearrangements to change cell shape. Myosins are the motors that move, cross-link, and modify the actin cytoskeleton. The primary force generator in contractile actomyosin networks is nonmuscle myosin II (NMMII), a molecular motor that assembles into ensembles that bind, slide, and cross-link actin filaments (F-actin). The multivalence of NMMII ensembles and their multiple roles have confounded the resolution of crucial questions, including how the number of NMMII subunits affects dynamics and what affects the relative contribution of ensembles' cross-linking versus motoring activities. Because biophysical measurements of ensembles are sparse, modeling of actomyosin networks has aided in discovering the complex behaviors of NMMII ensembles. Myosin ensembles have been modeled via several strategies with variable discretization or coarse graining and unbinding dynamics, and although general assumptions that simplify motor ensembles result in global contractile behaviors, it remains unclear which strategies most accurately depict cellular activity. Here, we used an agent-based platform, Cytosim, to implement several models of NMMII ensembles. Comparing the effects of bond type, we found that ensembles of catch-slip and catch motors were the best force generators and binders of filaments. Slip motor ensembles were capable of generating force but unbound frequently, resulting in slower contractile rates of contractile networks. Coarse graining of these ensemble types from two sets of 16 motors on opposite ends of a stiff rod to two binders, each representing 16 motors, reduced force generation, contractility, and the total connectivity of filament networks for all ensemble types. A parallel cluster model, previously used to describe ensemble dynamics via statistical mechanics, allowed better contractility with coarse graining, though connectivity was still markedly reduced for this ensemble type with coarse graining. Together, our results reveal substantial tradeoffs associated with the process of coarse graining NMMII ensembles and highlight the robustness of discretized catch-slip ensembles in modeling actomyosin networks.
   SIGNIFICANCE Agent-based simulations of contractile networks allow us to explore the mechanics of actomyosin contractility, which drives many cell shape changes, including cytokinesis, the final step of cell division. Such simulations should be able to predict the mechanics and dynamics of nonmuscle contractility; however, recent work has highlighted a lack of consensus on how to best model nonmuscle myosin II. These ensembles of similar to 32 motors are the key components responsible for driving contractility. Here, we explored different methods for modeling nonmuscle myosin II ensembles within the context of contractile actomyosin networks. We show that the level of coarse graining and the choice of unbinding model used to model motor unbinding under load indeed has profound effects on contractile network dynamics.

AB There have been major advances in the treatment and understanding of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the last decade. Among these are the availability of newer stimulant formulations, an appreciation of the combined effects of medication and behavioural therapies, and a better understanding of the neurobiology of the disorder in children (aged 6-12 years), adolescents and adults. This article focuses on the evaluation of the efficacy and safety profiles of medications used for the management of ADHD.
   In assessing the various medical treatments for ADHD, certain issues and analyses have become important to address. The diagnosis, characterization and quantification of ADHD symptoms are crucial to assessing treatment effectiveness. A standardized setting for measuring the severity of ADHD symptoms is the laboratory school protocol, which simulates a school environment with tightly controlled timing of measurements. This method has been adapted successfully to the adult workplace environment to help with the evaluation of adult ADHD symptoms.
   Statistical analyses, such as effect size and number needed to treat, may aid in the comparison and interpretation of ADHD study results. Although an objective approach to evaluating the efficacy and safety profiles of the available medications provides necessary details about the medical options, typical clinical decisions are often based on trial and error and may be individualized based on a patient's daily routine, comorbidities and risk factors.
   Stimulants remain the US FDA-approved medical treatment of choice for patients with ADHD and are associated with an exceptional response rate. Findings of the Multimodal Treatment of Children With ADHD study suggest that the combination of behavioural and medical therapy may benefit most patients. Nonstimulant agents, such as atomoxetine (FDA-approved), and several non-approved agents, bupropion, guanfacine and clonidine, may offer necessary alternatives to the stimulants. This is especially important for patients who have comorbidities that are contraindicated for stimulant use based on medical issues and/or risk for stimulant abuse. Typical psychiatric comorbidities in patients with ADHD include oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, anxiety, substance abuse disorder, tic disorder, and Tourette's syndrome.
   Although relatively safe, both stimulants and atomoxetine have class-related warnings and contraindications and are associated with adverse effects that require consideration when prescribing. Polypharmacy is a common psychiatric approach to address multiple symptoms or emergent adverse effects of necessary treatments. Future research may provide an improved understanding of polypharmacy and better characterization of the factors that influence the diagnosis and successful treatment of patients with ADHD.

TI Gel propellants
SO PROGRESS IN ENERGY AND COMBUSTION SCIENCE
LA English
DT Review
AB The transformation of a liquid propellant into a semi-solid gel state paves way for energetically improved, reliable, safer, and possibly green futuristic propellant for rocket and ramjet propulsion. A review of the progress achieved on gel propellants so far is essential to expand the capabilities of gel propellants by adopting new avenues for research and development towards actual space flights. In keeping with this objective, we comprehensively present various aspects of gel propellants in this review. Physically, gel propellants are the fluids whose rheological properties are altered by gelling agents so that they behave as solids at rest and can be atomized and combusted like conventional liquid propellants. The current definition of the gel propellants emphasizes their ability to flow under shear and gel propellants are almost exclusively intended to function like liquid propellants. Gel propellants have a considerable history; and research and development is continuously expanding across the world. Different research groups are working on the relevant areas of this field and research has gathered momentum in the first two decades of the present century. Hundreds of studies on all the aspects of gel propulsion including formulation, rheological behavior, atomization, combustion, and applications, have appeared. Gel propellants have been applied in rocket motors, ramjets, furnace combustion, and afterburners of jet engines. On this background, compilation and organization of the accumulated knowledge in this field, identification of relevant issues, unraveling of the links among the different areas of study, and identification of the open gaps for future study have become essential and these are the chief objectives in organizing the present review. This review encompasses the formulation, flow characterization, atomization, and combustion of gel propellants. We begin with a perspective on gel propellants and discuss the relevant aspects of conventional liquid propellants and previous efforts to improve their energetic performance. Inherent advantages of gel propellants and the challenges faced in their realization are considered. Formulation of gel propellants and their simulants is covered with emphasis on the description of different types of gelling agents and methods of their incorporation into the liquid propellants. Our emphasis is on the connection between formulation parameters and flow properties of gels. Of special significance are the recent attempts at formulating hypergolic gel propellants other than the hydrazine class. Flow properties of gels are of critical importance in tailoring their behaviors. Therefore, non-Newtonian flow properties of the gel propellants are discussed. Gels are 'complex fluids' and a number of rheological functions and measurement methods are necessary for comprehensively characterizing the complexity. Hence, we describe the rheological properties of many gel propellants and focus on their interpretation. Rheological matching of gels to develop gel propellant simulants is considered. Simulants provide a useful strategy to conduct flow and atomization experiments for hazardous or expensive propellants. Atomization of gel propellants is discussed with the aid of results in which various aspects of atomization of gel propellants using conventional and specially designed atomizers have been addressed. We also discuss the role of rheological properties in determining the behavior of gel fragments, ligaments, and droplets.
   A large amount of quantitative data on the spray properties are compiled and discussed in this review. Theoretical analyses of gel propellant breakup are reviewed. Discussion on combustion is divided into droplet combustion and spray combustion. In droplet combustion, we include the studies on hypergolic and non-hypergolic gel propellants and consider the processes during heating, vaporization, and combustion of tethered and freely falling droplets of gel propellants. Attempts at theoretical analysis of these processes are considered. In case of hypergolic gels, current understanding of their ignition is reviewed using modeling studies. Spray combustion of gel propellants is considered with reference to the modeling studies on canonical spray diffusion and premixed flames and experimental observations corroborating their findings are discussed. A majority of spray combustion studies reported to date have been carried out on small-scale rocket motors. These studies are reviewed here and the reported performance parameters are compiled. In each of the sections, we also review the status of metalized gel propellants with consideration to choice of metals and experience with metal slurries. A roadmap for future progress is proposed and recommendations are made based on the discussion in the preceding sections. We have given particular attention to the linkages among the four areas of gel propellant combustion. Selected data have been extensively tabulated for many of the specific topics considered in this review and it is supplemented by a separate comprehensive table. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Recent advances in molecular biology such as gene editing [1], bioelectric recording and manipulation [2] and live cell microscopy using fluorescent reporters [3], [4] - especially with the advent of light-controlled protein activation through optogenetics [5] - have provided the tools to measure and manipulate molecular signaling pathways with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision. This has produced ever increasing detail about the molecular mechanisms underlying development and regeneration in biological organisms. However, an overarching concept - that can predict the emergence of form and the robust maintenance of complex anatomy - is largely missing in the field. Classic (i.e., dynamic systems and analytical mechanics) approaches such as least action principles are difficult to use when characterizing open, far-from equilibrium systems that predominate in Biology Similar issues arise in neuroscience when trying to understand neuronal dynamics from first principles. In this (neurobiology) setting, a variational free energy principle has emerged based upon a formulation of self-organization in terms of (active) Bayesian inference. The free energy principle has recently been applied to biological self-organization beyond the neurosciences [6], [7]. For biological processes that underwrite development or regeneration, the Bayesian inference framework treats cells as information processing agents, where the driving force behind morphogenesis is the maximization of a cell's model evidence. This is realized by the appropriate expression of receptors and other signals that correspond to the cell's internal (i.e., generative) model of what type of receptors and other signals it should express. The emerging field of the free energy principle in pattern formation provides an essential quantitative formalism for understanding cellular decision-making in the context of embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression. In this paper, we derive the mathematics behind Bayesian inference - as understood in this framework - and use simulations to show that the formalism can reproduce experimental, top-down manipulations of complex morphogenesis. First, we illustrate this 'first principle' approach to morphogenesis through simulated alterations of anterior-posterior axial polarity (i.e., the induction of two heads or two tails) as in planarian regeneration. Then, we consider aberrant signaling and functional behavior of a single cell within a cellular ensemble - as a first step in carcinogenesis as false 'beliefs' about what a cell should 'sense' and 'do'. We further show that simple modifications of the inference process can cause - and rescue - mis-patterning of developmental and regenerative events without changing the implicit generative model of a cell as specified, for example, by its DNA. This formalism offers a new road map for understanding developmental change in evolution and for designing new interventions in regenerative medicine settings. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Multiple unit dosage forms for oral delivery of bioactive agents offer many advantages over single unit products (e.g., site-specific delivery, predictable gastrointestinal transit time and less localized adverse effects). In view of such benefits, this paper investigates the crosslinking of sodium alginate, low methoxylated pectin and their novel binary mixture with calcium ions through ionotropic gelation to pelletize the model drug, diclofenac sodium, using "environmentally benign" solvents and processing techniques. Crosslinked pellets of the above polymers in 2% (w/v) aqueous calcium chloride solution were prepared and evaluated for their structural and release behavior. The average size of the different pellets was 1.3 mm and drug entrapment capacity was optimized by reducing the calcium chloride solution pH to 1.6. Three types of pellet formulations were subjected to dissolution studies using the USP 23 Apparatus 2 and 3 over a pH range simulating the human gastrointestinal tract. Negligible drug release occurred in pH 1-4. However, rate of drug release in pH 6.6 ranged from rapid to slow (i.e., 100% drug release in 4 to 10 h, respectively) but always in a controlled manner. Weight change/erosion studies and swelling measurements were used to provide experimental correlation of kinetic model analysis for each of the three pellet systems. From model fitting studies and statistical treatment, the modified Hopfenberg equation {M-t/M-infinity = 1-[1-k(1)(t-t(L,) (min))](n)} best described the release kinetics for calcium-pectinate pellets. The model assumes heterogeneous erosion with kinetic constant k(1) = k(0)/C(0)r(0), in which k(0) is the erosion rate constant, C-0 is the uniform initial concentration of drug in the matrix, r(0) is the initial radius and t(L,) (min) is the lag time. The n values of 1, 2 and 3 apply to a slab, cylinder and sphere, respectively. In addition, the exponential models, namely the Power Law (M-t/M-infinity = k(1)t(n)) and its derivative containing the lag time [M-t/M-infinity = k(1)(t-t(L, min))(n)], employed in the statistical treatment of data provided n values of approximate to 0.8-1 in the case of the calcium-alginate and calcium-alginate-pectinate release kinetics. It is concluded that the proper selection of rate-controlling polymers and their interactive potential for crosslinking is important, and will determine the overall size and shape of pellets, the duration and pattern of dissolution profiles, pH sensitivity, drug loading capacity and mechanism of drug release.

AB In this paper, we present design of a transdermal drug delivery system for treatment of cardiovascular or hemodynamic disorders such as hypertension. The system comprises of integrated control electronics and microelectromechanical system devices such as micropump, micro blood pressure sensor and microneedle array. The objective is to overcome the limitations of oral therapy such as variable absorption profile and the need for frequent dosing, by fabricating a safe, reliable and cost effective transdermal drug delivery system to dispense various pharmacological agents through the skin for treatment of hemodynamic dysfunction such as hypertension. Moreover, design optimization of a piezoelectrically actuated valveless micropump is presented for the drug delivery system. Because of the complexity in analysis of piezoelectric micropump, which involves structural and fluid field couplings in a complicated geometrical arrangement, finite element (FE) numerical simulation rather than an analytical system has been used. The behavior of the piezoelectric actuator with biocompatible polydimethylsiloxane membrane is first studied by conducting piezoelectric analysis. Then the performance of the valveless micropump is analyzed by building a three dimensional electric-solid-fluid model of the micropump. The effect of geometrical dimensions on micropump characteristics and efficiency of nozzle/diffuser elements of a valveless micropump is investigated in the transient analysis using multiple code coupling method. The deformation results of the membrane using multifield code coupling analysis are in good agreement with analytical as well as results of single code coupling analysis of a piezoelectric micropump. The analysis predicts that to enhance the performance of the micropump, diffuser geometrical dimensions such as diffuser length, diffuser neck width and diffuser angle need to be optimized. Micropump flow rate is not strongly affected at low excitation frequencies from 10 to 200 Hz. The excitation voltage is the more dominant factor that affects the flow rate of the micropump as compared with the excitation frequency. However, at extremely high excitation frequencies beyond 8,000 Hz, the flow rate drops as the membrane exhibits multiple bending peaks which is not desirable for fluid flow. Following the extensive numerical analysis, actual fabrication and performance characterization of the micropump is presented. The performance of the micropump is characterized in terms of piezoelectric actuator deflection and micropump flow rate at different operational parameters. The set of multifield simulations and experimental measurement of deflection and flow rate at varying voltage and excitation frequency is a significant advance in the study of the electric-solid-fluid coupled field effects as it allows transient, three dimensional piezoelectric and fluid analysis of the micropump thereby facilitating a more realistic multifield analysis. The results of the present study will also help to conduct relevant strength duration tests of integrated drug delivery device with micropump and microneedle array in future.

AB Heavy-oil resources represent a large percentage of global oil and gas reserves, however, owing to the high viscosity, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques are critical issues for extracting this type of crude oil from the reservoir. According to the survey data in Oil & Gas Journal, thermal methods are the most widely utilized in EOR projects in heavy oil fields in the US and Canada, and there are not many successful chemical flooding projects for heavy oil reported elsewhere in the world. However, thermal methods such as steam injection might be restricted in cases of thin formations, overlying permafrost, or reservoir depths over 4500 ft, for which chemical flooding becomes a better option for recovering crude oil. Moreover, owing to the considerable fluctuations in the oil price, chemical injection plans should be employed consistently in terms of either technical or economic viewpoints. The numerical studies in this work aim to clarify the predominant chemical injection schemes among the various combinations of chemical agents involving alkali (A), surfactant (S) and polymer (P) for specific heavy-oil reservoir conditions. The feasibilities of all potential injection sequences are evaluated in the pre-evaluation stage in order to select the most efficient injection scheme according to the variation in the oil price which is based on practical market values. Finally, optimization procedures in the post-evaluation stage are carried out for the most economic injection plan by an effective mathematic tool with the purpose of gaining highest Net Present Value (NPV) of the project. In technical terms, the numerical studies confirm the predominant performances of sequences in which alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) solution is injected after the first preflushing water whereby the recovery factor can be higher than 47%. In particular, the oil production performances are improved by injecting a buffering viscous fluid right after the first chemical slug rather than using a water slug in between. The results of the pre-evaluation show that two sequences of the ASP group have the highest NPV corresponding to the dissimilar applied oil prices. In the post-evaluation, the successful use of response surface methodology (RSM) in the estimation and optimization procedures with coefficients of determination R-2 greater than 0.97 shows that the project can possibly gain 4.47 $ MM at a mean oil price of 46.5 $/bbl with the field scale of a quarter five-spot pattern. Further, with the novel assumption of normal distribution for the oil price variation, the chemical flooding sequence of concurrent alkali-surfactant-polymer injection with a buffering polymer solution is evaluated as the most feasible scheme owing to the achievement of the highest NPV at the highly possible oil price of 40-55 $/bbl compared to the other scheme.

AB The operation of a human-machine interface is increasingly often referred to as a two-learners problem, where both the human and the interface independently adapt their behavior based on shared information to improve joint performance over a specific task. Drawing inspiration from the field of body-machine interfaces, we take a different perspective and propose a framework for studying co-adaptation in scenarios where the evolution of the interface is dependent on the users' behavior and that do not require task goals to be explicitly defined. Our mathematical description of co-adaptation is built upon the assumption that the interface and the user agents co-adapt toward maximizing the interaction efficiency rather than optimizing task performance. This work describes a mathematical framework for body-machine interfaces where a naive user interacts with an adaptive interface. The interface, modeled as a linear map from a space with high dimension (the user input) to a lower dimensional feedback, acts as an adaptive "tool" whose goal is to minimize transmission loss following an unsupervised learning procedure and has no knowledge of the task being performed by the user. The user is modeled as a non-stationary multivariate Gaussian generative process that produces a sequence of actions that is either statistically independent or correlated. Dependent data is used to model the output of an action selection module concerned with achieving some unknown goal dictated by the task. The framework assumes that in parallel to this explicit objective, the user is implicitly learning a suitable but not necessarily optimal way to interact with the interface. Implicit learning is modeled as use-dependent learning modulated by a reward-based mechanism acting on the generative distribution. Through simulation, the work quantifies how the system evolves as a function of the learning time scales when a user learns to operate a static vs. an adaptive interface. We show that this novel framework can be directly exploited to readily simulate a variety of interaction scenarios, to facilitate the exploration of the parameters that lead to optimal learning dynamics of the joint system, and to provide an empirical proof for the superiority of human-machine co-adaptation over user adaptation.

AB In inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), a reward function is learnt to generalize experts' behavior. This paper proposes a model-free IRL algorithm based on an ensemble method, where the reward function is regarded as a parametric function of expected features. In other words, the parameters are updated based on a weak classification method. The IRL is formulated as a problem of a boosting classifier, akin to the renowned Adaboost algorithm for classification, feature expectations from experts' demonstration, and the trajectory induced by an agent's current policy. The proposed approach takes individual feature expectation as attractor or expeller, depending on the sign of the residuals of the state trajectories between expert's demonstration and the one induced by RL with the currently approximated reward function, so as to tackle its central challenges of accurate inference, generalizability, and correctness of prior knowledge. Then, the proposed method is applied further to approximate an abstract reward function from observations of more complex behavior composed of several basic actions. The results of the simulations in a labyrinth are shown to validate the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, behaviors composed of a set of primitive actions on a soccer robot field are examined for the applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Emotional corpora provide an important empirical foundation for investigation when researchers aim at implementing emotion-aware spoken dialog systems. One of the fundamental research questions is how to acquire an appropriate, realistic emotion corpus. The primary aim of this paper is to address the methodological desiderata in producing emotion corpora in human-machine interaction (HMI). It proposes a substantial refinement of the Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) technique in order that a scenario designed to elicit affected speech in HMI could result in realistic and useful data. In addition, the paper reports about the NIMITEK corpus of affected behavior in HMI produced during a refined WOZ simulation. The evaluation of the corpus with respect to the perception of its emotional content demonstrated that the corpus contains recordings of emotions that were overtly signaled. The range of emotional reactions is indicative of the kind of emotional reactions than can be expected to occur in the interaction with the sort of spoken dialog systems considered in this study. Since the subjects were not restricted by given predetermined linguistic constraints on the language to use, their utterances are indicative of the way in which nontrained, nontechnical users probably like to converse with conversational agents as well.

AB We develop a macroscopic constitutive model for temperature-dependent visco-elastic effects accompanied by curing, which are important phenomena in production processes. Within a thermodynamic framework we use an additive ternary decomposition of the logarithmic Hencky strain tensor into mechanical, thermal and chemical parts. Based on the concept of stoichiometric mass fractions for resin, curing agent and solidified material the bulk compression modulus as well as the bulk heat- and shrinking dilatation coefficients are derived and compared with ad hoc assumptions from the literature. Moreover, we use the amount of heat generated during differential scanning calorimetry until completion of the chemical reactions, to define the chemical energy. As a major result, the resulting latent heat of curing occurring in the heat-conduction equation derived in our approach reveals an ad hoc approach from the literature as a special case. In addition, thermodynamic consistency of the model will be proved, and the numerical implementation of the constitutive equations into a finite-element program is described. In the examples we illustrate the characteristic behaviour of the model, such as shrinking due to curing and temperature dependence and simulate the deep drawing of a spherical part with the finite-element-method.

AB A decision-support system for combating abalone poaching is proposed. A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is used to model context-based behaviour of vessels in a maritime abalone poaching situation. The context and behaviour is informed by Expert knowledge. The model is utilised for both data generation and behaviour classification. Data generation is performed by sampling in the DBN. The result is that a set of vessels are simulated in an abalone poaching situation. Several vessel classes including poaching, patrol, fishing, tourist, and recreational vessels are modelled. The generated data is intended to model surveillance data that may have been produced by sensors such as optical, infrared or radar sensors. Classification is performed using the filtering and smoothing inference methods on the DBN. A vessel class is inferred given tracked vessel data and contextual information. The purpose is to identify vessels that exhibit poaching behaviour. The novelty of this work includes a derivation of the generalised pseudo Bayes smoothing algorithm for the classification model. This smoothing algorithm is demonstrated to provide more accurate classification results than the previously proposed filtering method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is motivated by the desire to develop optimal defensive control strategies that discourage an attacker from engaging in attack while simultaneously encouraging retreat. We develop a general, two-player, differential game in which one player represents an attacker and the opposing player represents the defender. The attacker possesses superior dynamics such that it is capable of terminating the game either in engagement or retreat as it so chooses. The defender is incapable of directly preventing engagement. Instead, the defender uses the manipulation of the attacker's utility function as a form of indirect control in an attempt to make retreat a more attractive option over engagement. The solution to the overall engage or retreat differential game is found by solving two related optimization problems: the differential game of engagement and the optimal constrained retreat. The equilibrium open-loop control strategies and resulting game values of the attack or retreat game are expressed in terms of the solutions to these subproblems. Within the optimal constrained retreat problem, a value function constraint is imposed in order to prevent the attacker from moving into regions where engagement becomes optimal. This leads to regions of constrained retreat which we refer to as escort regions.

AB The paper uses a non-scale growth model to examine the behavior of a small open economy to varying degrees of foreign aid fungibility. Shifting government resources to public consumption while allocating the aid to either type of public expenditure or as a pure transfer changes the productivity of the private factors in production. Agents respond, as with any government transfer, by adjusting consumption, debt and work effort. Private capital accumulation slows and the welfare effect dominates. The fungibility results maintain for parameterizations that reflect limited substitution in production and where the public capital externality is small. The analysis, which employs extensive numerical simulations, emphasizes the tradeoffs between long-run capital accumulation and welfare that maintain even when aid is fungible. The simulations highlight the complementarity between foreign aid and public expenditure, the tradeoff between welfare and capital accumulation, and that aid cannot replace the government's own commitment to financing public expenditure. The results suggest that a policy in which the government is required to maintain its expenditure commitment to public capital yields the highest level effects to capital accumulation, consumption and output.

AB Models of the solar nebula reveal that it might have been gravitationally unstable, both early and later in its evolution. Such instabilities produce density waves and associated gravitational torques, which are potent agents of angular momentum transport. In previous work, we conducted a series of numerical simulations designed to quantify the effects of gravitational instabilities in a generalizable way (Tomley, Cassen, & Steiman-Cameron 1991). Here we present a second series of simulations in which we examine disks of greater size, increased star/disk mass ratio, and flatter surface density distribution than those in our initial study. The purpose is to represent disks at a later stage of evolution than those already studied, to test the quantitative relations derived in our earlier work and to explore the effects of mass ratio on the results. The new results indicate that the tendencies for unstable, uncooled disks to heat to stability and for dynamical evolution rates to be proportional to cooling rates are general characteristics of the behavior of gravitationally unstable disks. Nevertheless, there are quantitative, and (for strong cooling) even qualitative differences that are revealed in the new simulations, particularly with regard to the cooling rates at which clumping tends to occur.

AB Echogenic particles, such as microbubbles and volatile liquid micro/nano droplets, have shown considerable potential in a variety of clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The accurate prediction of their response to ultrasound excitation is however extremely challenging, and this has hindered the optimisation of techniques such as quantitative ultrasound imaging and targeted drug delivery. Existing characterisation techniques, such as ultra-high speed microscopy provide important insights, but suffer from a number of limitations; most significantly difficulty in obtaining large data sets suitable for statistical analysis and the need to physically constrain the particles, thereby altering their dynamics. Here a microfluidic system is presented that overcomes these challenges to enable the measurement of single echogenic particle response to ultrasound excitation. A co-axial flow focusing device is used to direct a continuous stream of unconstrained particles through the combined focal region of an ultrasound transducer and a laser. Both the optical and acoustic scatter from individual particles are then simultaneously recorded. Calibration of the device and example results for different types of echogenic particle are presented, demonstrating a high throughput of up to 20 particles per second and the ability to resolve changes in particle radius down to 0.1 mu m with an uncertainty of less than 3%.

AB Objective: To describe tests of nociception which appear in the "pre-clinical" literature.
   Data sources: References obtained by computerized bibliographic research (Medline (R)) and the authors' personal data.
   Data synthesis: Ethical problems arising from the study of the pain in awake animals, problems arising from the choice of stimulus and stimulus parameters and the quantification of responses are presented. Pain in animals can be estimated only by examining their reactions, but at the same time, the existence of a reaction does not necessarily mean that there is a concomitant sensation. A description of the signs of pain in mammals is proposed. A noxious stimulus can be defined by its physical nature, its site of application and what has previously happened to the tissues at this site. Electrical stimulation short-circuits the process of transduction at free nerve endings and is not specific; however it has the advantage that it can be applied suddenly and briefly and thus results in synchronised signals in the relevant primary afferent fibres which can be differentiated into A delta and C fibres. Heat selectively stimulates thermoreceptors and nociceptors, but the low calorific power of conventional stimulators restricts their usefulness. Radiant sources have the disadvantage of emitting waves in the visible and the adjacent infrared spectra, for which the skin is a poor absorber and good reflector. Thermodes have the disadvantage of activating mechanoreceptors and thermoreceptors simultaneously; furthermore, their capacity for transferring heat depends on the quality of contact with skin and thus on the pressure with which they are applied. These problems can be overcome by using CO, lasers but even today, the cost of these is a major disadvantage. Chemical stimuli differ from those mentioned above by the progressive onset of their effectiveness, their duration of action and the fact that they are of an inescapable nature. Experimental models employing chemical stimuli are undoubtedly the most similar to acute clinical pain. A wide spectrum of reactions are observed in nociceptive tests, but in almost every case they involve motor responses. After defining the ideal characteristics of a nociceptive test, tests based on the use of short duration and longer duration stimuli are presented. In tests of phasic pain, reactions are evoked by thermal (tail-flick test, hot-plate test), mechanical or electrical (flinch-jump test, vocalisation test) stimuli. Tests of tonic pain employ injections of algogenic agents intradermally (formalin test) or intraperitoneally (writhing test) or even the dilation of hollow organs. All these tests will be critically appraised in a subsequent paper [1].
   Conclusion: The tail-flick and hot-plate tests are the most used, but there is an increasing recourse to the formalin test and tests involving foot withdrawal after mechanical stimulation. (C) 2001 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB Surface active agents play a significant role ininterfacial dynamics of multiphase systems. While the understanding of their behavior is crucial to many important practical applications, realistic mathematical modeling and computer simulation represent an extraordinary task. By employing a front-tracking method with Eulerian adaptive mesh refinement capabilities in concert with a finite volume scheme for solving an advection-diffusion equation constrained to a moving and deforming interface, the numerical challenges posed by the full three-dimensional computer simulation of transient, incompressible two-phase flows with an insoluble surfactant are efficiently and accurately tackled in the present work. The individual numerical components forming the resulting methodology are here combined and applied for the first time. Verification tests to check the accuracy and the simulation of the deformation of a droplet in simple shear flow in the presence of an insoluble surfactant are performed, the results being compared to laboratory experiments as well as to other numerical data. In all the cases considered, the methodology presents excellent conservation properties for the total surfactant mass (even to machine precision under certain circumstances). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Digital games often center on a series of challenges designed to vary in difficulty over the course of the game. Designers, however, lack ways to ensure challenges are suitably tailored to the abilities of each game player, often resulting in player boredom or frustration. Challenge tailoring refers to the general problem of matching designer-intended challenges to player abilities. We present an approach to predict temporal player performance and select appropriate content to solve the challenge tailoring problem. Our temporal collaborative filtering approach-tensor factorization-captures similarities among players and the challenges they face to predict player performance on unseen, future challenges. Tensor factorization accounts for varying player abilities over time and is a generic approach capable of modeling many kinds of players. We use constraint solving to optimize content selection to match player skills to a designer-specified level of performance and present a model-performance curves-for designers to specify desired, temporally changing player behavior. We evaluate our approach in a role-playing game through two empirical studies of humans and one study using simulated agents. Our studies show tensor factorization scales in multiple game-relevant data dimensions, can be used for modestly effective game adaptation, and can predict divergent player learning trends.

AB We explore the emergent behavior in heterogeneous populations where players negotiate via an ultimatum game: two players are offered a gift, one of them (the proposer) suggests how to divide the offer while the other player (the responder) can either accept or reject the deal. Rejection is detrimental to both players as it results in no earnings. In this context, our contribution is twofold: (i) we consider a population where the distribution Of used strategies is constant over time and Properties of the random payoff received by the players (average and higher moments) are reported from simple exact methods and corroborated by computer simulations: (ii) the evolution of a population is analyzed via Monte Carlo simulations where agents may change independently the proposing and accepting parameters of their strategy depending on received payoffs. Our results show that evolution leads to a stationary state in which wealth (accumulated payoff) is fairly distributed. As time evolves, an increase in average payoff and a simultaneous variance decrease is observed when we use a dynamics based on a probabilistic version of the saying: "One should not comply with small earnings, but one's greed must be limited."

AB We describe a logic-based AI architecture based on Brooks' subsumption architecture. In this architecture, we axiomatize different layers of control in First-Order Logic (FOL) and use independent theorem provers to derive each layer's outputs given its inputs. We implement the subsumption of lower layers by higher layers using nonmonotonic reasoning principles. In particular, we use circumscription to make default assumptions in lower layers, and nonmonotonically retract those assumptions when higher layers draw new conclusions. We also give formal semantics to our approach. Finally, we describe layers designed for the task of robot control and a system that we have implemented that uses this architecture for the control of a Nomad 200 mobile robot.
   Our system combines the virtues of using the represent-and-reason paradigm and the behavioral decomposition paradigm. It allows multiple goals to be serviced simultaneously and reactively. It also allows high-level tasks and is tolerant to different changes and elaborations of its knowledge in runtime. Finally, it allows us to give more commonsense knowledge to robots. We report on several experiments that empirically show the feasibility of using fully expressive FOL theorem provers for robot control with our architecture and the benefits claimed above.

AB Flexible pipes have been used widely in the sewer pipe system due to its low cost and easy construction compared to rigid pipes. Mechanical strength of various types of flexible pipes, such as PVC and PE, can be increased by their geometric structures. For example, the double-walled tubes were introduced to enhance the radial strength and their material properties were improved by the addition of reinforcing agent such as glass fiber. However, there have been rarely systematic studies regarding detailed material properties for various types of the structure and material. In this study, we numerically analyzed mechanical properties of flexible pipes with various types by the finite element method. As a result, we find the dependence of the deformation behavior both on the type of material and the structure of the pipe for various circumstances. On the other hand, these simulation results could be useful for estimating pipe deterioration process, since many years of observation are needed to estimate the pipe deterioration process but flexible pipes started being used recently and hence there exists rare observed deterioration data. So, we roughly estimate the deterioration process of flexible pipes in terms of geometric structures and materials.

AB Open access to electric power transmission networks has been carried out in order to foster generation competition and customer choice worldwide. When several PPSs request to simultaneously supply power to customers based oil bilateral contracts, it is expected that the transmission network accepts amounts of wheeled power requested by the PPSs as much as possible. It is possible to maximize total requested wheeled power by controlling power flow through transmission lines. It is well known that FACTS device is available to control line flow flexibly. In this paper, in order to maximize total wheeled power simultaneously requested by several PPSs, the authors propose an algorithm to determine the optimal reactance of TCSC (a type of FACTS device). The proposed algorithm is based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), which is an optimization method based on swarm intelligence. In the proposed algorithm, PSO is improved to enhance ability of searching global minimum by giving different characteristic to behavior of each agent. In order to check the validity of the proposed method, numerical results are shown for 6 and IEEE 30 bus system models. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB The California red scale Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell) (Homoptera: Diaspididae) is a major pest of California citrus, with infestations causing growers significant financial losses. It has recently developed resistance to traditional insecticide sprays. An alternative suppression tactic is the release of a biological control agent, Aphytis melinus DeBach (Aphelinidae: Hymenoptera) that feeds on red scale. Although many aspects of the red scale-Aphytis interaction are now understood, it is difficult to differentiate the effects of temperature and population fluctuations in the field. To investigate such complex interactions, we propose a new stochastic modeling technique, based on event-driven competing risks, that incorporates details of life histories as well as the host-parasitoid interaction. Our continuous-time, individual-oriented modeling approach quantifies relationships among individuals and describes the resulting coupling between the interacting populations. The event-structured simulation drives time in contrast to the usual time-driven stochastic dynamic programming. Our system, developed in the public domain using the R statistical package, allows for different biological clocks, since both red scale and Aphytis development respond to temperature (degree-days) while searching female Aphytis follow a diurnal time schedule, contingent upon temperature-dependent egg maturation.

AB With the use of long-term numerical simulations, we study the evolution and orbital behavior of cometary nuclei in cold Kuiper belt-like debris disks under the gravitational influence of dwarf planets (DPs); we carry out these simulations with and without the presence of a Neptune-like giant planet. This exploratory study shows that in the absence of a giant planet, 10 DPs are enough to induce strong radial and vertical heating on the orbits of belt particles. On the other hand, the presence of a giant planet close to the debris disk, acts as a stability agent reducing the radial and vertical heating. With enough DPs, even in the presence of a Neptune-like giant planet some radial heating remains; this heating grows steadily, re-filling resonances otherwise empty of cometary nuclei. Specifically for the solar system, this secular process seems to be able to provide material that, through resonant chaotic diffusion, increase the rate of new comets spiraling into the inner planetary system, but only if more than the similar to 10 known DP sized objects exist in the trans-Neptunian region.

AB Industrial districts are made up of numerous firms or industries interacting in myriad ways. We create and study a model of trade and service interactions in an industrial district, and then extend it to investigate the effect of both positive (mutualistic) and negative (competitive) non-trade interactions on the behaviour of two different types of industrial district-Marshallian and hub-and-spoke. In particular we study whether the structure of the district, or the positioning of the relationships, makes a difference to the outcome for the district as a whole.
   We find that both these aspects make a difference. For instance, in both Marshallian and hub-and-spoke districts a competitive relationship between firms that are directly linked by trade has a stronger effect than competition between firms that are not. On the other hand in a Marshallian district it is possible to make the district more 'egalitarian' by adding a mutualistic relationship between suppliers or between intermediary firms, but this effect is not seen in hub-and-spoke districts. We highlight for further investigation a hypothesis suggested by our results that the effects of mutualism on an industrial district are more pronounced than those of competition.

AB The microbiological risk assessment during production, processing and treatment of foods illustrates an important basis for the judgement of the safety of food products. Since the mid-nineties the concept of risk analysis according to Codex Alimentarius requirements ist pursued more intensely. Risk assessment is part of the risk analysis process besides risk management and risk communication. A strict separation between risk management and assessment should lead to a systematic, scientifically based and independent process without considering economic or political constraints whereas the decision on protective measures or the acceptance of risks lies in the responsibility of the managers. Risk assessment can only be successfully implemented in an interdisciplinary approach between physicians, veterinarians, microbiologists, molecularbiologists, food technologists, epidemiologists and mathematicians. Surveillance, monitoring programs and other data collections on a variety of parameters like statistics on foodborne human cases, the prevalence of zoonotic agents in animals, the distribution of micro-organisms in the environment and in foods, the behaviour of micro-organisms during food processing and the consumption habits of consumers deliver the necessary data for risk assessors. With the aim of mathematic modelling and simulation it is possible to calculate the probability of health problems in humans after the consumption of a foodstuff contaminated with a specific pathogenic micro-organism.

AB In this paper, we present an agent-based, evolutionary, model of output- and labor-market dynamics. Firms produce a homogeneous, perishable good under constant returns to scale using labor only. Labor productivities are firm-specific and change stochastically due to technical progress. The key feature of the model resides in an explicit microfoundation of the processes of. (i) matching between firms and workers, (ii) job search, (iii) wage setting, (iv) endogenous formation of aggregate demand, and (v) endogenous price formation. Moreover, we allow for a competitive process entailing selection of firms on the basis of their revealed competitiveness. Simulations show that the model is able to robustly reproduce Beveridge, Wage and Okun curves under quite broad behavioral and institutional settings. The system generates endogenously an Okun coefficient greater than one even if individual firms employ production functions exhibiting constant returns to labor. Monte Carlo simulations also indicate that statistically detectable shifts in Okun and Beveridge curves emerge as the result of changes in institutional, behavioral, and technological parameters. Finally, the model generates sharp predictions about how system parameters affect aggregate performance (i.e. average GDP growth) and its volatility.

AB While the neurobiology of simple and habitual choices is relatively well known, our current understanding of goal-directed choices and planning in the brain is still limited. Theoretical work suggests that goal-directed computations can be productively associated to modelbased (reinforcement learning) computations, yet a detailed mapping between computational processes and neuronal circuits remains to be fully established. Here we report a computational analysis that aligns Bayesian nonparametrics and model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) to the functioning of the hippocampus (HC) and the ventral striatum (vStr)-a neuronal circuit that increasingly recognized to be an appropriate model system to understand goal-directed (spatial) decisions and planning mechanisms in the brain. We test the MB-RL agent in a contextual conditioning task that depends on intact hippocampus and ventral striatal (shell) function and show that it solves the task while showing key behavioral and neuronal signatures of the HC-vStr circuit. Our simulations also explore the benefits of biological forms of look-ahead prediction (forward sweeps) during both learning and control. This article thus contributes to fill the gap between our current understanding of computational algorithms and biological realizations of (model-based) reinforcement learning.

ID BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICS
AB Rich phenomena from complex systems have long intrigued researchers, and yet modeling system micro-dynamics and inferring the forms of interaction remain challenging for conventional data-driven approaches, being generally established by scientists with human ingenuity. In this study, we propose AgentNet, a model-free data-driven framework consisting of deep neural networks to reveal and analyze the hidden interactions in complex systems from observed data alone. AgentNet utilizes a graph attention network with novel variable-wise attention to model the interaction between individual agents, and employs various encoders and decoders that can be selectively applied to any desired system. Our model successfully captured a wide variety of simulated complex systems, namely cellular automata (discrete), the Vicsek model (continuous), and active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (non-Markovian) in which, notably, AgentNet's visualized attention values coincided with the true variable-wise interaction strengths and exhibited collective behavior that was absent in the training data. A demonstration with empirical data from a flock of birds showed that AgentNet could identify hidden interaction ranges exhibited by real birds, which cannot be detected by conventional velocity correlation analysis. We expect our framework to open a novel path to investigating complex systems and to provide insight into general process-driven modeling.

AB Autocatalytic kinetics are observed during the biphasic alkaline hydrolysis of C-4, C-6 and C-8 (butanoate, hexanoate and octanaoate) ethyl esters. Ethanol and alkanoate anions are the products of the reaction. A kinetic model including spontaneous dissolution of the organic phase into the aqueous phase, aqueous hydrolysis of the ester, formation of ester containing aggregates and micellisation has been proposed. For C-4, taking into account salting-in and solvent effects is sufficient to reproduce the autocatalytic behaviour. For C-8, the major autocatalytic process is an ester containing aggregates (ECA) mediated phase transfer. For C-6, it appears that the role of ECA is double. Small sized ECA which are formed at the beginning of the reaction do not perform rapid phase transfer and trap surfactant molecules. Larger ECA which appear at the end of the reaction are the main phase transfer agent. Using an empirical formula to describe the size of the interface, the model is able to reproduce the effect of a variation of the volumic ratio of the two phases as well as the effect of stirring rate and non-emulsified experiments.

AB We investigate experimentally and numerically the effect of wettability on viscous-liquid impregnation into a single layer of woven fibers confined between the parallel plates. In our experiments, special attention is paid to the flow-front behaviors and the characteristic flow fields induced by the pressure difference attempted to the mold. We change the wettability between the fiber and viscous fluid by coating the bundles with fluorine-based coating agent. Correlation between the flow-front behaviors and void formation are indicated in terms of the capillary number Ca, and of so-called modified capillary number Ca that incorporates the effect of the contact angle between the fiber and liquid, theta(f). Through our three dimensional multiphase simulations, the impregnation process is examined as functions of Ca and Ca by varying either of the characteristic velocity, the surface tension, the viscosity, or the contact angle. We illustrate that the wettability is a crucial factor to dominate the impregnation and void formation processes, and that the modified capillary number does not apparently measure the formation of the macrovoids.

AB In this paper, we have established methylenebis (4-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one) as a promising anticancer scaffold with kinesin spindle protein (KSP) inhibitory activity under malignant condition. A series of biscoumarin derivatives (MN1 to MN30) with different substituent were synthesized, and their anticancer activity was explored. Six biscoumarin derivatives that were found active were further selected to formulate organic nanoparticles (ONPs). Anticancer activity of both the forms (viz conventional and ONPs) was compared. MN30 was found most potent whereby MN10 showed good anticancer activity in both, e., conventional and ONP form; the structural activity relationship (SAR) study has been established. Computational investigation revealed biscoumarin scaffold as a suitable pharmacophore to bind against KSP protein. Molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed protein-ligand stability and dynamic behavior of biscoumarin-KSP complex. Finally, accruing signal transduction model was formulated to explain the observed MTT trend of conventional and ONP form. The model seems useful towards solving population specific varied results of chemotherapeutic agents. According to the model, MN10 and MN30 derivatives have good pharmacodynamics inertia and therefore, both the molecules were able to provide dose-dependent cytotoxic results.

AB This paper analyses the effects of introducing two typical Keynesian features, namely rule-of-thumb (RoT) consumers and consumption habits, into a standard labour market search model. RoT consumers use the margin that hours and wage negotiation provides them to improve their lifetime utility, by narrowing the gap in utility with respect to Ricardian consumers. This margin for intertemporal optimisation has not been studied yet, because this class of restricted agents has been mainly used in models with no equilibrium unemployment. Our approach allows for a deeper study of the effects of shocks on vacancies, unemployment, hours, wages and how they interact. As habits increase, RoT consumers find it optimal, after a positive technology shock, to negotiate lower hours and higher wages, and this mechanism reduces the simulated correlation between the real wage (or productivity) and total hours to values closer to those obtained empirically. Thus, with the interaction of RoT consumers and consumption habits, the labour market search model improves significantly in reproducing some of the stylised facts characterising the US labour market.

AB We simulate shocks to the real sector and evaluate how the financial system reacts and amplifies these events using unique Brazilian loan-level data between banks and banks and firms. Our analysis considers the feedback behavior that exists between the financial and real sectors through a micro-level financial accelerator. We find a strong "network effect" in which the network structure can either attenuate or amplify shocks from the real sector and thus plays a major role in contagion processes. We also find that government-owned banks are the most susceptible banks to receiving shocks from firms of any economic sector. There is empirical evidence to support the claim that more diversified portfolios of banks contribute to higher sector riskiness levels. Our results suggest that systemic risk models should account for the interconnectedness among economic agents such as the interbank and real and financial sector linkages in a multilayer approach. Overall, we show that the feedback between the real and financial sector matters in systemic risk estimation and most models that do not take into consideration could be severely underestimating systemic risk.

ID TRAFFIC FEATURES; MERGING BEHAVIOR; COLLISION; SECTION; SAFETY; TIME
AB Lane changes are complex safety- and throughput-critical driver actions. Most lane-changing models deal with lane-changing maneuvers solely from the merging driver's standpoint and thus ignore driver interaction. To overcome this shortcoming, we develop a game-theoretical decision-making model and validate the model using empirical merging maneuver data at a freeway on-ramp. Specifically, this paper advances our repeated game model by using updated payoff functions. Validation results using the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) empirical data show that the developed game-theoretical model provides better prediction accuracy compared to previous work, giving correct predictions approximately 86% of the time. In addition, a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the rationality of the model and its sensitivity to variations in various factors. To provide evidence of the benefits of the repeated game approach, which takes into account previous decision-making results, a case study is conducted using an agent-based simulation model. The proposed repeated game model produces superior performance to a one-shot game model when simulating actual freeway merging behaviors. Finally, this lane change model, which captures the collective decision-making between human drivers, can be used to develop automated vehicle driving strategies.

AB Seed dispersals deal with complex systems through which the data collected using advanced seed tracking facilities pose challenges to conventional approaches, such as empirical and deterministic models. The use of stochastic models in current seed dispersal studies is encouraged. This review describes three existing stochastic models: the birth-death process (BDP), a 2 dimensional () symmetric random walks and a intermittent walks. The three models possess Markovian property, which make them flexible for studying natural phenomena. Only a few of applications in ecology are found in seed dispersals. The review illustrates how the models are to be used in seed dispersals context. Using the nonlinear BDP, we formulate the individual-based models for two competing plant species while the cover time model is formulated by the symmetric and intermittent random walks. We also show that these three stochastic models can be formulated using the Gillespie algorithm. The full cover time obtained by the symmetric random walks can approximate the Gumbel distribution pattern as the other searching strategies do. We suggest that the applications of these models in seed dispersals may lead to understanding of many complex systems, such as the seed removal experiments and behaviour of foraging agents, among others.

AB Understanding the impacts of human recreation on natural resources is of critical importance in constructing effective management strategies. The Grand Canyon River Trip Simulator is a computer program that models complex, dynamic human-environment interactions in the river corridor of the Grand Canyon National Park. The system consists of a database and simulator engine. The database contains 487 trip diaries that report all stops for activities and camping along the 447 km Colorado River corridor within the purview of the National Park Service. The computer simulation employs statistics and artificial intelligence in creating an individual-based modeling system. This simulation system successfully models the recreational rafting behavior and captures the decision making of rafting parties as they responsively seek to optimize their experience. The model allows the Park managers to assess the likely impact of various alternative management scenarios for rafting trips on the Colorado River. The Grand Canyon River Trip Simulator advances our abilities to model complex systems in the context of human-environment interactions. It may serve as a suitable template for modeling a suite of other complex adaptive systems including ecosystems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

DT Article
ID DRAG REDUCTION; BENTONITE
AB Viscoelasticity plays a significant role in improving the performance of the drilling fluid by manipulating its elastic properties. An appropriate value of the first normal stress difference (N-1), extensional viscosity (eta(e)), and relaxation time (theta) enhance the cutting transportability, hole-cleaning ability, filtration loss, and lubrication behavior. However, the performance of the drilling fluid deteriorates during the drilling of high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) wells under acid gas and salt(s) contamination. Therefore, it is a challenging task to synthesize a thermally and rheologically stable drilling fluid, which is acid as well as salt(s) resistant, and maintain its desired properties. Although several water-soluble synthetic polymer-based drilling fluids have been used widely for the drilling of HPHT wells, most of these are limited at less than 200 degrees C. Polyanionic cellulose (PAC) has an excellent heat-resistant stability, salt tolerance, calcium and magnesium resistant, and strong antibacterial activity, and it exhibits exceptional filtration and rheological behavior under HPHT conditions. However, using PAC beyond 200 degrees C is limited because of the presence of the biodegradable cellulose units in it. To use the extraordinary properties of PAC, it is aimed to increase the thermal stability of PAC through appropriate modification.
   In this study, PAC-grafted copolymers involving acrylamide (a salt-tolerant viscosifying agent), 2-acrylamide-2-methyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (a thermally stable lubricating and fluid-loss control agent), and sodium 4-styrene sulfonate (a high-temperature deflocculant) is synthesized optimally through maximizing the thermal degradation stability of the grafted copolymer and minimizing the filtration loss as well as the coefficient of friction (CoF) of the drilling fluid simultaneously. Optimally synthesized PAC-grafted copolymers are then used to prepare water-based mud (WBM) involving American Petroleum Institute (API)-grade bentonite and alpha-glycol functionalized nano fly ash, and the tests for steady shear viscosity and viscoelasticity are performed to determine the rheological stability of mud beyond 200 degrees C. The amplitude sweep tests for viscoelasticity are performed to determine the linear viscoelasticity range (LVR), structural stability, gel strength, and dynamic yield point (YP), whereas frequency, time, and temperature sweep tests are performed to obtain the elastic modulus (G'), viscous modulus (G ''), and complex viscosity under HPHT conditions to check the stability of the drilling fluids under different holding times. Dynamic and static aging tests of the developed drilling fluids are performed at elevated temperature and pressure, and the aged muds are tested by evaluating the rheology, frictional, and filtration-loss behavior as per the API recommended procedure. The stability of the aged muds is also tested by evaluating the N-1, eta(e), and theta using a cone and plate rheometer. The performance of the proposed drilling fluids is also tested under acidic, sodium chloride (NaCl), and calcium chloride (CaCl2) environments at HPHT bottomhole conditions. The experimental results under HPHT conditions reveal that the performance of the mud (i.e., thermal stability, cutting transportability, hole-cleaning ability, filtration loss, and lubrication behavior) could be considerably improved by increasing the elastic properties of the drilling fluid by manipulating the molecular weight of the proposed PAC-grafted copolymer. Finally, the environmental effect of the developed muds is evaluated by finding the lethal concentration that kills 50% of the shrimp population (i.e., LC50) and the Hg and Cd contamination, and they are found to be environmentally safe.

AB Simultaneous administration of the diuretic furosemide (10 mg/kg) and a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril (5 mg/kg) results in short-latency thirst and sodium appetite (i.e., the rapid ingestion of water and NaCl solution). To elucidate potential mechanisms for mediating this behavior, changes in plasma levels of key hormones involved in fluid intake and balance were characterized in rats subjected to this treatment protocol. Rats treated jointly with furosemide and low-dose captopril had exaggerated increases in plasma renin activity and angiotensin I but equivalent increases in plasma aldosterone compared with rats treated with either agent alone. Treatment with furosemide plus low-dose captopril increased plasma vasopressin but not plasma oxytocin. The administration of a higher dose of captopril (100 mg/kg) with furosemide, a combination of drugs that does not stimulate fluid intake (29), further increased plasma renin activity and angiotensin I but prevented the rise in plasma vasopressin. The results support the hypothesis that thirst and salt appetite generated by this protocol depend on angiotensin II formed within brain circumventricular organs rather than the systemic circulation.

AB Simple Summary Recent advances in nanotechnology gave rise to trials with various types of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) to enhance the radiosensitization of cancer cells while reducing or maintaining the normal tissue complication probability during radiation therapy. This work reviews the physical and chemical mechanisms leading to the enhancement of ionizing radiation's detrimental effects on cells and tissues, as well as the plethora of experimental procedures to study these effects of the so-called "NPs' radiosensitization". The paper presents the need to a better understanding of all the phases of actions before applying metallic-based NPs in clinical practice to improve the effect of IR therapy. More physical and biological experiments especially in vivo must be performed and simulation Monte Carlo or mathematical codes based on more accurate models for all phases must be developed. Many different tumor-targeted strategies are under development worldwide to limit the side effects and improve the effectiveness of cancer therapies. One promising method is to enhance the radiosensitization of the cancer cells while reducing or maintaining the normal tissue complication probability during radiation therapy using metallic nanoparticles (NPs). Radiotherapy with MV photons is more commonly available and applied in cancer clinics than high LET particle radiotherapy, so the addition of high-Z NPs has the potential to further increase the efficacy of photon radiotherapy in terms of NP radiosensitization. Generally, when using X-rays, mainly the inner electron shells are ionized, which creates cascades of both low and high energy Auger electrons. When using high LET particles, mainly the outer shells are ionized, which give electrons with lower energies than when using X-rays. The amount of the produced low energy electrons is higher when exposing NPs to heavy charged particles than when exposing them to X-rays. Since ions traverse the material along tracks, and therefore give rise to a much more inhomogeneous dose distributions than X-rays, there might be a need to introduce a higher number of NPs when using ions compared to when using X-rays to create enough primary and secondary electrons to get the desired dose escalations. This raises the questions of toxicity. This paper provides a review of the fundamental processes controlling the outcome of metallic NP-boosted photon beam and ion beam radiation therapy and presents some experimental procedures to study the biological effects of NPs' radiosensitization. The overview shows the need for more systematic studies of the behavior of NPs when exposed to different kinds of ionizing radiation before applying metallic-based NPs in clinical practice to improve the effect of IR therapy.

TI Thermal Behavior of Cylindrical Buckling Restrained Braces at Elevated

DT Article
ID TUBULAR COLUMNS; FIRE; MODEL
AB The primary focus of this investigation was to analyze sequentially coupled nonlinear thermal stress, using a three-dimensional model. It was meant to shed light on the behavior of Buckling Restraint Brace (BRB) elements with circular cross section, at elevated temperature. Such bracing systems were comprised of a cylindrical steel core encased in a strong concrete-filled steel hollow casing. A debonding agent was rubbed on the core's surface to avoid shear stress transition to the restraining system. The numerical model was verified by the analytical solutions developed by the other researchers. Performance of BRB system under seismic loading at ambient temperature has been well documented. However, its performance in case of fire has yet to be explored. This study showed that the failure of brace may be attributed to material strength reduction and high compressive forces, both due to temperature rise. Furthermore, limiting temperatures in the linear behavior of steel casing and concrete in BRB element for both numerical and analytical simulations were about 196 degrees C and 225 degrees C, respectively. Finally it is concluded that the performance of BRB at elevated temperatures was the same as that seen at room temperature; that is, the steel core yields prior to the restraining system.

SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE

ID POLITICAL-ECONOMY; EQUILIBRIUM; EFFICIENCY; POLICIES
AB This paper is concerned primarily with the economic and welfare consequences of federal redistributive grants. We use a model which has two regions, each with households, firms and regional governments as well as a federal government. Private agents are (utility and profit) maximisers and we assume that regional governments are empire-builders in that they choose their expenditure and tax levels so as to maximise total expenditure-the size of their empire. Labour is free to move between regions in response to utility differences and does so until such differences have been eliminated. Inter-regional migration, inter-regional trade flows and federal government redistribution are the main sources of interconnectedness between the two regions. The model is linearised in log-differences and simulated using a calibration based on Australian state-level data. We find that the welfare effect of intergovernmental transfers is trivial but that all other variables of interest change substantially-consumption, employment, prices, taxes, wages, output and government expenditure. Finally, the signs of the effects of a federal transfer are not affected by the empire-building behaviour of regional governments although the magnitude of the effects is generally dampened.

TI Formulation, in vitro characterization and optimization of taste-masked
   orally disintegrating co-trimoxazole tablet by direct compression
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction
   Orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) is a dosage form that overcomes the problem of swallowing which is prevalent in about 35% of the general population. Co-trimoxazole (CTX) is given for patients with HIV for the prophylaxis of opportunistic infection (OI), commonly for pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. It was reported that CTX was associated with a 25-46% reduction in mortality among individuals infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Esophageal candidiasis which usually comes along with HIV/AIDS is one of AIDS defining illness affecting up to 1 in 5 of people with AIDS. This opportunistic illness is manifested by painful or difficulty of swallowing. In this respect, CTX ODT offer the advantages of both liquid dosage forms in terms of easy swallowing thereby improve patient compliance and solid dosage forms in terms of dose uniformity, stability, lower production, and transportation costs. The objective of this study was to formulate, characterize and optimize CTX ODT which could overcome swallowing problem and improve patient compliance. Co-trimoxazole ODTs were prepared by direct compression technique using a semi synthetic super disintegrant (crospovidone) along with other excipients. Two taste masking techniques were employed, addition of sweetening agent, and solid dispersion by using a pH sensitive polymer, Eudragit E-100 at different ratios (1:1, 1:2 and 1:3). Taste masking was determined by comparing taste threshold value and in vitro drug release. Preliminary study was used to investigate the effect of crospovidone, compression force (CF) and Hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) on disintegration time, friability and wetting time (WT). Factorial design was used as it enables simultaneous evaluation of formulation variables and their interaction effect. From the preliminary study, the factors that were found significant were further optimized using central composite design. Design-Expert 8.0.7.1 software was employed to carry out the experimental design. The bitterness threshold concentration of Trimethoprim was found to be 150 mu g/ml and the in vitro drug release of the three batches of drug to polymer ratio (F1:1, 1:2 and 1:3) was 2.80 +/- 0.05, 2.77 +/- 0.00 and 2.63 +/- 0.00 respectively. From the optimization study, the optimal concentration for the superdisintegrant was 8.60% w/w and a CF of 11.25 KN which gave a rapid disintegration and WT of 13.79 and 23.19 seconds respectively and a friability of 0.666%.
   Conclusion
   In this study, co-trimoxazole ODT was formulated successfully. Central composite design was effectively used to model and optimize friability, DT and WT. The method was found effective for estimating the effect of independent variables on the dependent variables by using polynomial equation and surface plots. Optimization of the response variables was possible by using both numerical and graphical optimization and the predicted optimal conditions were confirmed experimentally and were found to be in good agreement within 5% of the predicted responses. The results of the study showed that CTX ODT had significantly rapid disintegration, less than 1% friability and enhanced dissolution profiles. The successful formulation of CTX ODT can solve difficulty of swallowing of conventional tablets for some group of patients which are unable to swallow solid oral dosage form.

AB Background Rickettsia bacteria are responsible for diseases in humans and animals around the world, however few details are available regarding its ecology and circulation among wild animals and human populations at high transmission risk in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ticks and Rickettsia spp. in wild boars, corresponding hunting dogs and hunters.
   Methods Serum samples and ticks were collected from 80 free-range wild boars, 170 hunting dogs and 34 hunters from southern and central-western Brazil, from the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado biomes, respectively, between 2016 and 2018. Serum samples were tested by indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay (IFA) to detect IgG antibodies against Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia parkeri, Rickettsia bellii, Rickettsia rhipicephali and Rickettsia amblyommatis. Tick species were identified by morphological taxonomic keys, as previously described. A total of 164 ticks including A. sculptum, A. brasiliense and A. aureolatum were tested in PCR assays for Spotted Fever Group (SFG) Rickettsia spp.
   Results A total of 58/80 (72.5%) wild boars, 24/170 (14.1%) hunting dogs and 5/34 (14.7%) hunters were positive (titers 64) to at least one Rickettsia species. A total of 669/1,584 (42.2%) ticks from wild boars were identified as Amblyomma sculptum, 910/1,584 (57.4%) as Amblyomma brasiliense, 4/1,584(0.24%) larvae of Amblyomma spp. and 1/1,584 (0.06%) nymph as Amblyolmma dubitatum. All 9 ticks found on hunting dogs were identified as Amblyomma aureolatum and all 22 ticks on hunters as A. sculptum. No tested tick was positive by standard PCR to SFG Rickettsia spp.
   Conclusions The present study was the concomitant report of wild boar, hunting dog and hunter exposure to SFG rickettsiae agents, performed in two different Brazilian biomes. Wild boar hunting may increase the risk of human exposure and consequently tick-borne disease Wild boars may be carrying and spreading capybara ticks from their original habitats to other ecosystems. Further studies can be required to explore the ability of wild boars to infecting ticks and be part of transmission cycle of Rickettsia spp.
   Author summary The present study reported serological findings and molecular assays of Rickettsia spp and ticks of wild boars, simultaneous to their correspondent hunting dogs and hunters. Seropositivity for Rickettsia spp. was higher in wild boars when compared to dogs and humans but was similar between dogs and humans. Despite Rickettsia spp. prevalence was statistically higher in southern than central-western Brazil for wild boars, no significance was observed in hunting dogs and hunters. For the first time, A. sculptum ticks were founded in wild boars from the subtropical climate of southern Brazil. Despite human beings have been considered less exposed to ticks (and therefore rickettsiae) than animals, specific human activities such as wild boar hunting may increase the risk of exposure and consequently tick-borne disease. Wild boars may be carrying and spreading capybara ticks from their original habitats to other ecosystems. These results may provide important findings for public action planning to prevent neglected vector-borne diseases in overlapping areas of wild boars, hunting dogs and hunters. Further studies can be required to explore the ability of wild boars to infecting ticks and be part of transmission cycle of Rickettsia spp.

AB In evolutionary games, the temptation mechanism reduces cooperation percentage while the reputation mechanism promotes it. Inferring reputation theory proposes that agent's imitating neighbors with the highest reputation takes place with a probability. Although reputation promotes cooperation, when and how it enhances cooperation is still a question. This paper investigates the condition where the inferring reputation probability promotes cooperation. Hence, the effects of reputation and temptation on cooperation are explored under the spatial prisoners' dilemma game, utilizing the methods of simulation and statistical analysis. Results show that temptation reduces cooperation unconditionally while reputation promotes it conditionally, i.e. reputation countervails temptation conditionally. When the inferring reputation probability is less than 0.5, reputation promotes cooperation substantially and thus countervails temptation. However, when the inferring reputation probability is larger than 0.5, its contribution to cooperation is relatively weak and cannot prevent temptation from undermining cooperation. Reputation even decreases cooperation together with temptation when the probability is higher than 0.8. It should be noticed that inferring reputation does not always succeed to countervail temptation and there is a specific interval for it to promote cooperation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are important as a public health problem all over the world. There are some difficulties in prevention and control programs of STIs due to clinical and laboratory diagnostic problems.The most common STIs are Chlamydia trachomatis infections, trichomoniasis and gonorrhea. The study aimed to investigate the direct microscopic examination, culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in the diagnosis of Trichomonas vaginas infection; to determine other microbiological agents that may cause vaginal discharge and to evaluate the various social variables in women with vaginal discharge admitted to the outpatient clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Akdeniz University Hospital. Two hundred and fifteen patients were enrolled in the study. The socio-demographic features of the patients were recorded. Vaginal/endocervical swab specimens taken from patients were evaluated by microscopic examination. Swab specimens were inoculated into blood agar, MacConkey agar and chocolate agar for bacterial culture. Modified Trichosel broth with 5% horse blood (Becton Dickinson, USA) was used for Trichomonas spp. culture. The presence of C.trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and T.vaginalis in swab samples were investigated by multiplex PCR assay (BD Max CT/GC/TV, Becton Dickinson, USA). At least one pathogen was detected among 65 (30.3%) samples. T.vaginalis was detected by microscopic examination and PCR in four of 215 (1.9%) patients. Existence of yeast morphology was observed in 21 (9.8%) specimens by microscopic examination. Twenty four (11.2%) patients were diagnosed as bacterial vaginosis microscopically according to Nugent score system. Candida species grew in 32 (14.9%) and Streptococcus agalactiae grew in 2 (0.9%) of the specimens. C.trachomatis was detected in 2 (0.9%) samples and N.gonorrhoeae in 1 (0.5%) sample by PCR. In this study, 95.3% of the patients were married and 96.7% had only one sexual partner in the mean time. The rate of detection of pathogens were statistically higher in women who have had two or more pregnancies (p< 0.05). In our study, T.vaginalis together with N.gonorrhoecre and C.trachomatis were investigated by PCR method in women with vaginal discharge. The use of multiplex PCR test allowed simultaneous investigation of multiple pathogens in the patient samples.

AB Objective: The role of percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of carotid bifurcation lesions has been limited by its potential for producing embolic debris. We evaluated the efficacy of a proximal occlusion catheter (POC) in the prevention Of embolic events during carotid artery stenting. In addition, pressure measurements relevant to the clinical application Of this device were obtained from 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
   Methods: The POC is a guiding catheter with an occlusion balloon attached on the outside of the catheter at its distal end. Occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) was achieved by inflating the balloon while access to carotid bifurcation lesions was obtained through the inner lumen. The POC was inserted in the CCA of 10 dogs via the femoral artery. The side port of the POC was connected to a sheath placed in the femoral vein, thereby creating an external arteriovenous shunt. Ten artificial radiopaque particles simulating embolic particles and contrast agent were introduced in the CCA and monitored fluoroscopically. As a control, the same procedure was performed with a standard guiding catheter without an occlusion balloon. In 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery stump pressures and the pressure in the internal jugular vein were measured.
   Results. Without the external arteriovenous shunt, in all animals there was prograde flow in the distal CCA despite CCA occlusion. This flow was derived from the thyroid artery. However, once the arteriovenous shunt was activated, reversal of now in the distal CCA was achieved in each animal, and all the artificial particles were recovered from the side port of the POC. In the control group, each particle embolized to the brain (100%, P < .01). In the patients, the mean stump pressures in the ICA and external carotid artery and the jugular vein pressure mere 51.8 +/- 14.2, 62.2 +/- 15.1, and 6.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg, respectively. In each case, the jugular vein pressure was the lowest among the three.
   Conclusions: Obtaining proximal CCA control by inflating the POC does not sufficiently prevent embolization. However, reversal of flow in the ICA can always be created with the external shunt, which effectively prevents embolization. Thus, POC may markedly lower procedural stroke rates during carotid artery stenting. The ability of POC to prevent embolization before crossing the lesion with a guidewire may be an important advantage over other distal protection devices.

AB The molecular structures of Li-2[Ni(tmdta)]center dot 5H(2)O (la, tmdta = trimethylenediaminetetraacetate), {C-(NH2)(3)}(2)[Ni(tmdta)]center dot 6H(2)O (lb), and {Ni(H2O)(6)}[Ni(tmdta)]-2H(2)O (2a) have been determined. The central trimethylenediamine chelate ring shows half-chair (hc) geometries in la and lb, while a twist-boat (tb) conformation is encountered in 2a. The coexistence of tb and hc forms in the solid state prompted us to elucidate the existence of a tb reversible arrow hc equilibrium in aqueous solution. Evaluation of the data from solid state vibrational spectra (Raman and ER) for the hc and tb forms showed excellent agreement with simulated spectra obtained with DFT computations (TPSSh/TZVP). This outstanding matching between theory and experiment enabled us to build composite spectra with varying hc:tb ratios. Comparison of these results with Raman and IR spectra recorded for [Ni(tmdta)](2-) in aqueous solution revealed that simulated Raman and IR spectra with a hc:tb ratio = 2:3 match the solution spectra in an accurate way. This equilibrium ratio enabled us to compute C-13 NMR sifts for the paramagnetic solution spectrum of [Ni(tmdta)](2-) based on the relative contributions by hc and tb fractions. This leads to computed shifts that agree closely with the experimental ones. Also, the kinetics of the skeleton dynamics could be estimated quantitatively by temperature-dependent C-13 NMR spectroscopic measurements. An interesting effect encountered for the very first time here concerns a drastic intensity difference of the 10Dq band ((3)A(2g) -> T-3(2g) (F) transition) in solid state electronic spectra of tb vs hc isomers, where the intensity of this band in the case of the hc form is much lower than that of the tb conformer and thus more similar to the case of the usual Ni-II chromophore in octahedral environment. The equilibrium constants for complex formation and protonation of Ni-II-trndta at low pH have been estimated by pH-dependent UV vis titration experiments. Correlation of these data with those of Ni-II-edta and related 3d M-II edta and tmdta complexes allow important conclusions on the consequences resulting from extending the central diamine ring in the ligand by one methylene group in terms of both complex and protolytic stability for edta vs tmdta complexes.

AB A novel and efficient, amine-functionalized three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) titanium (Ti) catalyst modified using transition metal-monosubstituted polyoxometalate (3DOM K-5[CO(H2O)PW11O39]-(EtO)(3)SiCH2CH2CH2NH2-TiO2 or 3DOM PW11Co-APS-TiO2) was fabricated by self-assembly method. First, methanol bath was used to soak polystyrene spheres to obtain large size 3DOM TiO2, which was further functionalized using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APS). Amine-functionalized 3DOM TiO2 materials impregnated with monosubstituted polyoxometalate (POM, K-5[Co(H2O)PW11O39]) were prepared by coordination of cobalt (Co) present in the units of POM, with the amine groups present on the surface of 3DOM TiO2. The materials so obtained were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Scanning electron microscopy, Transmission electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption-desorption tests. The results showed that the primary Keggin structures of the composites remained intact, simultaneously, 3DOM PW11 Co-APS-TiO2 had anatase crystalline structure, and PW11 Co was successfully bonded to 3DOM TiO2 by Co-N bond with APS as the coupling agent. Broadening of absorption band was observed for the product compared to the monomers, 3DOM TiO2 and PW11Co. However, the 3DOM structure was retained in the product; therefore, the accessibility of the diffusing species was significantly improved because of the permeability offered by the macroporous structure. The UV photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants revealed better activities of 3DOM PW11 Co-APS-TiO2 compared to PW11Co, 3DOM TiO2, and PW11 Co-APS-TiO2. Moreover, 3DOM PW11 Co-APS-TiO2 exhibited superior photocatalytic degradation of Rhodamine B (RB), Salicylic acid (SA), Congo red (CR), and Malachite green oxalate (MG) under microwave-assisted irradiation. Leakage of PW11Co from the hybrid photocatalyst was barely observed during the photocatalytic tests, attributed to strong coordination interactions between the Keggin units and the amine-functionalized Ti surface. The capture experimental results of photocatalysis revealed that the dominant active species were OH center dot and O-2(-center dot). Moreover, in this study, the procedure and possible mechanism of the UV photodegradation of organic pollutants in the aqueous system was proposed and discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Disposable non-invasive and compatible real time monitoring tool was developed in order to follow the cleaning process of paper artwork directly in situ. This tool was based on a biocompatible cleaning hydrogel coupled with flow electrochemical diagnostic tool, suitable to verify in situ and in a simple way the assessment of degradation of artwork and the efficiency of cleaning process. In this paper, the results obtained by applying this tool on a great format artwork with a lining as support, "Le Nozze di Psiche", engraved by Diana Scultori, printed in 1613, are reported. This opera was affected by a structural and chromatic deterioration due to a strong oxidative degradation. Such deterioration was probably accelerated by the adhesive (a mixture of starch paste and animal glue) used in a previous lining intervention. In this case, the cleaning agents used are rigid hydrogels of Gellan gum, modified with hydrolytic enzymes. By using the flow sampling system, all materials removed by the gel was carried up to a thin layer cell containing a selective electrochemical biosensors, suitable to monitor both treatments, the cleaning process and the removal of lining. These were monitored, allowing understanding when both processes were completed, thus avoiding lengthy and unnecessary cleaning applications. The effectiveness of cleaning with Gellan gel was assessed quantitatively by using non-invasive optical reflectance spectroscopy by a portable instrumentation, elaborating data with an improved version of the Kubelka-Munk theory in order to recover the absorption coefficient of the cellulose fibers of "Le Nozze di Psiche". The concentration of oxidized groups acting as chromophores was obtained by comparing the experimental optical absorption spectra to those simulated computationally by using TDDFr-based calculations. By following the cleaning with Gellan gel the results indicate a large decrease of the concentration of degradation product of cellulose. Moreover, chromatographic analysis were carried out in order to evaluate the amount of acid compound, produced during the aging and present on the graphic artwork, using the Gellan gel after cleaning step. The results obtained from the restoration of "Le Nozze di Psiche" have allowed the restorers to evaluate innovative methods for cleaning treatment of paper artworks with a highly specialized scientific-diagnostic approach.

AB Four new porphyrin derivatives are described: one (1) with a methoxyphenyl group and three pyridinium units (for comparison only), and three others with either adenine (2, 3) or thymine (4) bases. The synthetic strategies vary from known literature procedures in that the methylation of pyridinium subunits takes place before the formation of the hybrid molecule, beginning with simultaneous condensation of pyridinealdehyde and 3-(propionyloxy)benzaldehyde, with subsequent chromatography under improved conditions. The thymine derivative 4 is obtained from trimethylated tetrapyridylporphyrin T4PyP by treatment with a suitable thymine-alkyl bromide. Dilution experiments in water show the absence of intermolecular porphyrin associations under the experimental conditions used. UV and NMR spectroscopic data indicate strong intramolecular self -stacking between the porphyrin moiety and the covalently attached nucleobases. This results in smaller affinities of porphyrin-nucleobase conjugates towards added nucleosides than observed with the reference compounds tris- or tetrakis-pyridinium porphyrin (I and TMPyP, respectively). Compounds 2-4 displayed no significant discrimination between A and T based on complementarity of nucleobases, which is explained by the strong competition from bulk water with Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds. Interactions of ligands 1-4 with ct DNA and ss-RNA polynucleotides were studied by fluorimetric and UV/Vis titration. In most cases the fluorescence of 1-4 was first quenched by addition of polynucleotide at porphyrin/polynucleotide ratios (r) close to saturation of intercalation binding sites, and then enhanced at ratios r < 0.1. The changes at r > 0.1 were attributed to intermolecular association of porphyrins along the polynucleotide groove, while the changes observed at large excess of intercalation binding sites (r much less than 0.1) indicate intercalation of porphyrin into the polynucleotide. Scatchard analyses at r much less than 0.1 are in most cases in line with the formation of only 1:1 complexes. With poly U the non-complementary compounds I and 4 showed only increased fluorescence, while the complementary compounds 2 and 3 showed decreases as well as increases. Addition of poly U to 2 and 3 induced strong bathochromic shifts of the Soret bands, characteristic of intercalation. Although no affinity difference between complementary and non-complementary complexes of 2-4 and ss-polynucleotides was observed, significant differences in emission changes in poly U titrations suggest specific interactions of the adenine conjugates 2 and 3.

AB Oral administration of calcitonin could improve compliance to long-term treatment. Efficacy and safety of a novel oral formulation was assessed on 277 postmenopausal women. The results show (1) effective enteral absorption, (2) marked inhibition of bone resorption with minimal alteration of formation, and (3) reproducibility of responses over 3 months.
   Introduction: We have recently introduced an Eligen technology-based oral formulation of salmon calcitonin (sCT) that effectively delivers the hormone to the circulation. The efficacy and safety during longer-term administration, however. has not been investigated in the target population.
   Materials and Methods: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging clinical trial including 277 healthy postmenopausal women 55-85 years of age. Women received treatment with either daily (0.15, 0.4. 1.0, or 2.5 mg) or intermittent doses (1.0 mg, every other day) of sCT combined with the delivery agent (8-[N-2-hydroxi-5-chloro-benzoyl]-amino-caprylic acid, 200 mg) or placebo for 3 months. All participants received 1000 mg calcium plus 400 IU vitarnin D daily throughout the study. Efficacy parameters were the acute and/or pre-dose changes in serum and urinary C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), N-mid osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSALP), calcium, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) measured by established immunoassays.
   Results: After the first dose, sCT evoked dose-dependent decreases in serum CTx (-60.8% to -81.8% from baseline) compared with placebo, reaching nadirs 2-3 h after drug intake, after which, gradual increases were observed. The simultaneous acute changes in OC were statistically nonsignificant. Area under the curve (AUC) of serum CTx responses at months 1 and 3 showed strong correlation with those at baseline (both r = 0.78, p < 0.001). At month 3. the placebo-corrected changes in the pre-dose value of serum and urinary CTx were significant only in the 1.0-mg dose group (-18.9% and -20.5%, respectively, p < 0.05). The placebo-corrected change in OC was - 8.6 (p = 0.09), whereas the change in BSALP was -7.3 (p = 0.02). The oral formulation was well tolerated, with mild to moderate gastrointestinal and skin manifestations apparent mainly in the high-dose groups.
   Conclusion: The results of this 3-month trial show that the novel Eligen technology-based oral formulation of sCT has potential to become a safe and effective treatment for postmenopausal bone loss. Future trials are needed to assess the impact of long-term administration on changes in BMD and fracture risk.

AB Disseminated fungal infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Prophylaxis with amphotericin B can be limited by renal toxicity. Oral triazoles can be limited by poor absorption, large interindividual pharmacokinetic (PK) variability, and hepatic toxicity, leading to interruptions in therapy and breakthrough infections. Intravenous (i.v.) micafungin has potential advantages, because of its better safety profile, specifically in terms of hepatic and renal toxicity, and lack of drug-drug interactions with common medications used in the HSCT setting. We hypothesized that higher dose micafungin (3 mg/kg) every other day will provide drug exposure similar to standard dosing (1 mg/kg) given daily, and improve patient compliance in very young children in whom oral medications can be challenging, at reduced administration costs. Both animal and adult patient data support the use of this approach. Fifteen children (M/F = 11/4, aged <= 10 years; mean: 3.9 years, range: 0.6-10 years) with various hematologic, metabolic, and immune deficiency disorders undergoing HSCT received a single dose of micafungin (3 mg/kg) i.v. over 1 hour. Dose selection was based on published PK data in pediatric patients, and exploration of different dosing regimens using Monte Carlo PK/PD simulation. Blood samples were drawn around this dose and PK analysis was conducted using standard noncompartmental methods. Micafungin at 3 mg/kg dose was well tolerated in all patients. Measurable plasma concentrations were present in all cases at 48 hours. Half-life and clearance observed were comparable to previous pediatric PK data, with clearance being higher than adults as expected. Volume of distribution was higher in our patients compared to published pediatric data, likely because of a larger proportion of very young children in our study cohort. After correction for protein binding, concentrations at the end of the dosing interval during maintenance treatment remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of highly susceptible fungal pathogens. These data suggest that alternate day micafungin dosing, as described here, may provide an attractive alternative for antifungal prophylaxis in HSCT patients and merits further evaluation.

AB Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate the response of a tumor and parent vessels to stimulating factors in the tumor microenvironment in different configurations. How a tumor grows and induces angiogenesis in different distances of a parent vessel is investigated. Moreover, interstitial fluid pressure and its effects on tumor cell phenotype are considered in the model. Methods A multiscale continuum-discrete model of a vascular tumor is utilized to simulate the growth of a cluster of tumor cells positioned in different distances of parent vessels. An agent-based probabilistic angiogenesis model is coupled to a discrete tumor model to simulate branching, anastomosis, blood flow, wall shear stress, and interstitial tumor pressure in which tumor cells are divided to necrotic, hypoxic, and proliferative. Results Starting the simulations from 9 initial tumor cells, the model proved that tumors grow to a certain size and also reach to a certain distance before being able to induce sprouting. For tumors placed 2 and 2.5 mm away from a parent vessel, initiation of angiogenesis is delayed significantly in comparison with closer distances. For the initial cluster positioned in a distance of 2.5 mm away, first sprout is seen after 47 days. Moreover, dendritic shape of the tumor is seen prior to angiogenesis which is a sign of cells being starved and wandered in the domain to reach the oxygen source. The trend of tumor growth obeys power law function which aligns with the experimental results. Discussion The mathematical model revealed the importance of geometry and position of an initial tumor cluster in determining the behavior and final architecture of a vascular tumor. As a tumor cell appears in farther distances from a parent vessel, duration of its growth and inducing angiogenesis becomes longer and the chance of suppressing the tumor in the initial days of growth is higher. Also, the importance of angiogenesis in making tumors devastating is again corroborated by mathematical models.

AB More than 1.2 million people die in road crashes each year, and more than 20 million are severely injured, making it the 9th leading cause of death in the world (2.2% of all deaths globally). Pedestrian deaths comprise more than 35% of road accident deaths, mostly as a result of pedestrian-vehicle crashes. This paper proposes a new model for formulating the dynamics of the interaction between drivers and pedestrians at congested conflict spots where drivers and/or pedestrians do not closely follow the traffic laws and regulations. In this type of spots, characterized by heavy traffic, pedestrians and vehicles interact in close proximity, often requiring sharp and aggressive maneuvers to avoid crashes. The model is based on the Probabilistic Navigation Function (PNF), originally developed for robotics motion planning, that constructs a trajectory according to the probabilistic collision risks. According to this model, pedestrians construct a virtual risk map that assigns the entire crossing area with probabilities for a collision with vehicles, and then select their actions based on their perceived probability for collision. Many accidents can be interpreted in terms of the proposed model, either as a result of incorrect perception of risks, or, despite proper estimation of risks, by a wrong choice of collision maneuvers. The development of the model follows a theoretical and experimental investigation of pedestrian/vehicle interactions at crosswalks. The model is implemented in an agent-based simulation system for pedestrian/driver interaction, and is validated using video clips taken at several congested road spots. It can be used for analyzing the effect of changes in location architecture and traffic regulations for each spot. The model can also serve as a standard tool in simulations for assessing accident risks in urban environments. Finally, it can be utilized in control systems of autonomous vehicles and in drivers' on-board alert systems.

AB At present, inhibitors have been widely used in the field of coal fire prevention and control, but there are some defects in the use of them. So it is necessary to find a new practical and economical inhibitor. Dissolvable tiny-foam extinguisher (DTE) is environment-friendly, high in thermal stability, and fast in cooling. In view of the good performance of the product, the thermal behavior effects of DTE on coal spontaneous combustion were investigated through experimental tests. A scanning electron microscopy was used to study changes in the surface microstructure of raw coal after DTE treatment. Laser thermal conductivity analysis and simultaneous thermal analysis were used to test the effects of DTE at mass fraction of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15% on the thermophysical properties, mass loss, characteristic temperature, and heat release of coal during heating. The surface of the DTE-treated coal sample was covered in a dense film. The treated coal sample had lower thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity values and a higher specific heat capacity. Moreover, coal treated with DTE showed no obvious oxygen absorption or mass gain during initial heating, and the dry cracking temperature was greatly increased by 37 degrees C, 53 degrees C, and 100 degrees C, respectively. The initial heat release temperature increased by more than 170 degrees C, and the amount of the initial heat absorption was more than 52.2 times that of untreated samples. Oxidation kinetics were applied to calculate the activation energy of the coal during thermal decomposition and ignition, and the activation energies of the treated samples at the thermal decomposition and combustion stages increased by 161%, 179%, and 173%, respectively. From these results, we concluded that DTE could inhibit heat accumulation by blocking oxygen contact with the coal and greatly reducing heat release during heating. Besides, only a small quantity of DTE was needed to effectively inhibit coal self-ignition. These results provide reference for the field application of DTE in restraining coal spontaneous combustion.

   FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM
AB The use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has increased rapidly over the last years. Due to their low resources, sensors come along with new issues regarding network security and energy consumption. Focusing on the network availability, previous studies proposed to protect clustered network against denial of service attacks with the use of traffic monitoring agents on some nodes. Those control nodes have to analyze the traffic inside a cluster and to send warnings to the cluster head whenever an abnormal behavior (e.g., high packets throughput or non-retransmission of packets) is detected. But if the control nodes (cNodes) die out of exhaustion, they leave the network unprotected. To better fight against attacks, we try to enhance this solution by renewing periodically the election process. Furthermore, we propose three energy-aware and secure methods to designate the cNodes in a hierarchically clustered WSN. The first one is a simple self-election process where nodes randomly designate themselves. It leads to a better load balancing than a static method (i.e., with no renewal), but we argue that we can obtain better results by considering the remaining energy of the nodes at cNodes selection time. Hence, the second algorithm is purely based on the residual energy of the sensors. We discuss limitations of this deterministic process concerning security and cluster coverage and suggest workarounds. These improvements lead us to the third mechanism. It is based on residual energy too, but it includes a democratic election process in which nodes in the cluster vote to optimize the cNode role attribution. Results obtained from simulation experiments with the ns-2 tool are provided to analyze the energy repartition in the network and to compare the three selection algorithms. All experimental outcomes show improvements of the load balancing in the network, while maintaining good detection coverage, in regard to static selection. Furthermore, the analysis of the respective performances of the three mechanisms is used as a basis to establish recommendations regarding the use cases of those methods.

AB Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) have been widely used in consumer products, therapeutic agents, and drug delivery systems. However, the fate and behavior of ZnO NPs in living organisms are not well described. The purpose of this study was to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to describe the dynamic interactions of (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs in mice. We estimated key physicochemical parameters of partition coefficients and excretion or elimination rates, based on our previously published data quantifying the biodistributions of 10 nm and 71 nm (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs and zinc nitrate (Zn-65(NO3)(2)) in various mice tissues. The time-dependent partition coefficients and excretion or elimination rates were used to construct our physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. In general, tissue partition coefficients of (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs were greater than those of Zn-65(NO3)(2), particularly the lung partition coefficient of 10 nm (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs. Sensitivity analysis revealed that 71 nm (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs and Zn-65(NO3)(2) were sensitive to excretion and elimination rates in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Although the partition coefficient of the brain was relative low, it increased time-dependently for (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs and Zn-65(NO3)(2). The simulation of Zn-65(NO3)(2) was well fitted with the experimental data. However, replacing partition coefficients of (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs with those of Zn-65(NO3)(2) after day 7 greatly improved the fitness of simulation, suggesting that ZnO NPs might decompose to zinc ion after day 7. In this study, we successfully established a potentially predictive dynamic model for slowly decomposed NPs. More caution is suggested for exposure to (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs <10 nm because those small (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs tend to accumulate in the body for a relatively longer time than 71 nm (ZnO)-Zn-65 NPs and Zn-65(NO3)(2) do.

AB Statement of problem: Daily disinfection of maxillofacial prosthesis may reduce their service-life and lead to replacement.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate possible alterations in the mechanical behavior of two maxillofacial elastomers after application of four different disinfection procedures.
   Material and methods: The materials tested were two maxillofacial elastomers, a commercially available polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and an experimental chlorinated polyethylene (CPE). Different disinfection procedures such as microwave exposure, hypochlorite solution, neutral soap and a commercially antimicrobial solution, were applied for a period which simulates one year of a real service life. Mechanical behavior was investigated through tensile and microindentation tests in various depths. Mathematical models were fitted to tensile curves. Alterations in tensile parameters (maximum stress, maximum strain, elasticity and viscoelasticity parameter) were subjected to two way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests (alpha=.05).
   Results: Most of the tensile parameters presented significant alterations among different disinfection procedures and maxillofacial materials which became also harder. Microwave exposure caused greater changes in PDMS and CPE elastomer whereas commercial antimicrobial solution and neutral soap did not significantly affect them. Microindentation and tensile tests revealed similar changes in materials' elastic modulus and hardness whereas the observed changes were greater into smaller depths.
   Conclusions: Tensile and microindentation properties of PDMS and CPE elastomers presented changes after disinfected with four different procedures. Changes in the surface of both materials were more intense than in the bulk of the materials. Microwave exposure affected most the two elastomers, so concerning the findings of this study is not recommended for the disinfection of the examined PDMS and CPE elastomers. Moreover, microwave exposure and hypochlorite solution caused greater changes in the surface (3 mu m) of CPE samples as indicated by microindentation results. PDMS affected less from the commercial antimicrobial agent and CPE from neutral soap, which seems to be the most suitable disinfection techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Global demand for silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), and their inevitable release into the environment, is rapidly increasing. AgNPs display antimicrobial properties and have previously been recorded to exert adverse effects upon marine phytoplankton. However, ecotoxicological research is often compromised by the use of non-ecologically relevant conditions, and the mechanisms of AgNP toxicity under environmental conditions remains unclear. To examine the impact of AgNPs on natural marine communities, a natural assemblage was exposed to citrate-stabilised AgNPs. Here, investigation confirmed that the marine dominant cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus is particularly sensitive to AgNP exposure. Whilst Prochlorococcus represents themost abundant photosynthetic organism on Earth and contributes significantly to global primary productivity, little ecotoxicological research has been carried out on this cyanobacterium. To address this, Prochlorococcus was exposed to citrate-stabilised AgNPs, as well as silver in its ionic form(Ag2SO4), under simulated natural conditions. Both AgNPs and ionic silver were observed to reduce Prochlorococcus populations by over 90% at concentrations >= 10 mu g L-1, representing the upper limit of AgNP concentrations predicted in the environment (10 mu g L-1). Longer-term assessment revealed this to be a perturbation which was irreversible. Through use of quenching agents for superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, alongside incubations with ionic silver, it was revealed that AgNP toxicity likely arises from synergistic effects of toxic superoxide species generation and leaching of ionic silver. The extent of toxicity was strongly dependent on cell density, and completely mitigated in more cell-dense cultures. Hence, the calculation and reporting of the particle-to-cell ratio reveals that this parameter is effective for standardisation of experimental work, and allows for direct comparison between studies where cell density may vary. Given the key role that marine cyanobacteria play in global primary production and biogeochemical cycling, their higher susceptibility to AgNP exposure is a concern in hotspots of pollution.

AB Natural communities can be complex. Such complexity makes it difficult to discern the mechanisms generating community structure. In this paper we review concepts and issues related to linking functional and community studies while also including greater complexity into the experimental realm. These principles are primarily illustrated with case studies involving predation ecology in a freshwater snail-fish-crayfish model system. The system illustrates how predator impacts on prey are mediated by multiple prey traits, correlations between traits, functional trade-offs in predator defence, interactions between predators, and interactions with other community members. We argue for a pluralistic approach to investigating mechanisms of community structure; that is, an approach that integrates many subdisciplines of ecology and evolution. We discuss four main areas that when used together yield important insights on community structure. First, selection gradient analyses formally link functional and community ecology. This formalisation is shown to help identify targets of selection, estimate environment-specific mortality rates, and identify agents of selection in complex communities. Second, we encourage increased focus on emergent community properties (results not predicted based on pairwise species interactions). Third, we emphasise that a community, rather than a web of species interactions, may more profitably be viewed as a network of trait interactions. This trait-centred view makes clear how indirect community effects arise between species that do not interact physically. This perspective also leads to our fourth topic, the integration of phenotypes. Just as populations evolve co-adapted suites of traits, so too should individuals embody integrated trait correlations, termed 'trait integration', rather than randomly assembled collections of phenotypes. All the perspectives mentioned above suggest that investigations should focus on multiple traits and multiple environments simultaneously, rather than singular, atomised components of complex systems.

AB During the last two decades, analysis of 1/f noise in cognitive science has led to a considerable progress in the way we understand the organization of our mental life. However, there is still a lack of specific models providing explanations of how 1/f noise is generated in coupled brain-body-environment systems, since existing models and experiments typically target either externally observable behaviour or isolated neuronal systems but do not address the interplay between neuronal mechanisms and sensorimotor dynamics. We present a conceptual model of a minimal neurorobotic agent solving a behavioural task that makes it possible to relate mechanistic (neurodynamic) and behavioural levels of description. The model consists of a simulated robot controlled by a network of Kuramoto oscillators with homeostatic plasticity and the ability to develop behavioural preferences mediated by sensorimotor patterns. With only three oscillators, this simple model displays self-organized criticality in the form of robust 1/f noise and a wide multifractal spectrum. We show that the emergence of self-organized criticality and 1/f noise in our model is the result of three simultaneous conditions: a) non-linear interaction dynamics capable of generating stable collective patterns, b) internal plastic mechanisms modulating the sensorimotor flows, and c) strong sensorimotor coupling with the environment that induces transient metastable neurodynamic regimes. We carry out a number of experiments to show that both synaptic plasticity and strong sensorimotor coupling play a necessary role, as constituents of self-organized criticality, in the generation of 1/f noise. The experiments also shown to be useful to test the robustness of 1/f scaling comparing the results of different techniques. We finally discuss the role of conceptual models as mediators between nomothetic and mechanistic models and how they can inform future experimental research where self-organized critically includes sensorimotor coupling among the essential interaction-dominant process giving rise to 1/f noise.

AB BackgroundAdvances in digitized video-tracking and behavioural analysis have enabled accurate recording and quantification of mosquito flight and host-seeking behaviours, facilitating development of individual (agent) based models at much finer spatial scales than previously possible.MethodsQuantified behavioural parameters were used to create a novel virtual testing model, capable of accurately simulating indoor flight behaviour by a virtual population of host-seeking mosquitoes as they interact with and respond to simulated stimuli from a human-occupied bed net. The model is described, including base mosquito behaviour, state transitions, environmental representation and host stimulus representation.ResultsIn the absence of a bed net and human host bait, flight distribution of the model population was relatively uniform throughout the arena. Introducing an unbaited untreated bed net induced a change in distribution with an increase in landing events on the net surface, predominantly on the sides of the net. Adding the presence of a simulated human bait dramatically impacted flight distribution patterns, exploratory foraging and, the number and distribution of landing positions on the net, which were determined largely by the orientation of the human within. The model replicates experimental results with free-flying living mosquitoes at human-occupied bed nets, where contact occurs predominantly on the top surface of the net. This accuracy is important as it quantifies exposure to the lethal insecticide residues that may be unique to the net roof (or theoretically any other surface). Number of net contacts and height of contacts decreased with increasing attractant dispersal noise.ConclusionsResults generated by the model are an accurate representation of actual mosquito behaviour recorded at and around a human-occupied bed net in untreated and insecticide-treated nets. This fine-grained model is highly flexible and has significant potential for in silico screening of novel bed net designs, potentially reducing time and cost and accelerating the deployment of new and more effective tools for protecting against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Background Nitric oxide (NO) has a wide range of functions in the skin, and topical NO donors have several potential clinical applications. However, currently available donors are either unstable on the skin surface, release low concentrations of NO, or have a short duration of action. Endogenous S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs) store and transport NO within the body and can be used as exogenous sources of NO.
   Objectives To study in vitro and in vivo the chemical and biological behaviour of two RSNO species, S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) and S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNAC), in an easily applied hydrogel, and to correlate dermal nitrite concentration with erythema following application of the RSNOs. To assess the suitability of GSNO and SNAC as biologically effective NO donors for clinical research and as potential therapeutic agents.
   Methods/patients GSNO (0.3 mol g(-1)) and SNAC (0.6 mol g(-1)) were incorporated in Synperonic F-127 hydrogels (Uniquema, Belgium). The in vitro kinetics of decomposition were measured by spectrophotometry at 37 degreesC. The RSNO-containing hydrogels were applied to the forearm skin of eight subjects. Blood flow was measured by laser Doppler for 3 h following application of NO donors and dermal nitrite simultaneously measured in microdialysate in four subjects.
   Results The mean peak blood flow achieved was 250. At blood flow values of < 250, dermal nitrite correlated closely with blood flow and could be defined by the equation: blood flow = (nitrite concentration x 0.66) + 120, (P = 0.013). At higher blood flows there was a paradoxical fall in dermal nitrite concentration.
   Conclusions Topical RSNOs produce a consistent, sustained and biologically effective release of NO on human skin in vivo, which offers advantages over currently available topical NO donors. Dermal nitrite concentration-the oxidation product of NO-is directly correlated with blood flow at low and moderate levels of blood flow. At high levels of blood flow, there is a reduction in dermal nitrite, which is presumed to be due to increased blood scavenging.

ID DETECTING SENSITIZATION; RESISTANCE; BEHAVIOR
AB An experimental design method was used to determine the effect of factors that significantly affect the response of the double loop-electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation (DL-EPR) test in controlling the susceptibility to intergranular corrosion (IGC) of UNS S43000 (AISI 430) ferritic stainless steel. The test response is expressed in terms of the reactivation/activation current ratio (I (r) /I (a) pct). Test results analysed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method show that the molarity of the H(2)SO(4) electrolyte and the potential scanning rate have a more significant effect on the DL-EPR test response than the temperature and the depassivator agent concentration. On the basis of these results, a study was conducted in order to determine the optimal operating conditions of the test as a nondestructive technique for evaluating IGC resistance of ferritic stainless steel components. Three different heat treatments are considered in this study: solution annealing (nonsensitized), aging during 3 hours at 773 K (500 A degrees C) (slightly sensitized), and aging during 2 hours at 873 K (600 A degrees C) (highly sensitized). The aim is to find the operating conditions that simultaneously ensure the selectivity of the attack (intergranular and chromium depleted zone) and are able to detect the effect of low dechromization. It is found that a potential scanning rate of 2.5 mV/s in an electrolyte composed of H(2)SO(4) 3 M solution without depassivator, at a temperature around 293 K (20 A degrees C), is the optimal operating condition for the DL-EPR test. Using this condition, it is possible to assess the degree of sensitization (DOS) to the IGC of products manufactured in ferritic stainless steels rapidly, reliably, and quantitatively. A time-temperature-start of sensitization (TTS) diagram for the UNS S43000 (France Inox, Villepinte, France) stainless steel was obtained with acceptable accuracy by this method when the IGC sensitization criterion was set to I (r) /I (a) > 1 pct. This diagram is in good agreement with the time-temperature-start of precipitation (TTP) diagram that delineates the domain of low dechromization consecutive to chromium carbide precipitation.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In the present age, due to the rapid increase in antibiotic resistance worldwide, TB has become a major threat to human life. Regardless of significant efforts have been inclined to improve the healthcare systems for improving diagnosis, treatment, and anticipatory measures controlling TB is challenging. To date, there are no such therapeutic chemical agents available to fight or control the bacterial drug-resistance. The catalase-peroxidase enzyme (katG) which encoded by the katG gene of Mtb is most frequently getting mutated and hence promotes Isoniazid resistance by diminishing the normal activity of katG enzyme. In the current study, an effort has been intended to find novel and therapeutically active antibacterial chemical compounds through pharmacoinformatics methodologies. Initially, the five mutant katG were generated by making mutation of Ser315 by Thr, Ile, Arg, Asn, and Gly followed by structural optimizations. About eight thousand small molecules were collected from the Asinex antibacterial library. All molecules were docked to active site of five mutant katG and wild type katG. To narrow down the chemical space several criteria were imposed including, screening for highest binding affinity towards katG proteins, compounds satisfying various criterion of drug-likeliness properties like Lipinski's rule of five (RO5), Veber's rule, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile, and synthetic accessibility. Finally, five molecules were found to be important antibacterial katG inhibitors. All the analyzed parameters suggested that selected molecules are promising in nature. Binding interactions analysis revealed that proposed molecules are efficient enough to form a number of strong binding interactions with katG proteins. Dynamic behavior of the proposed molecules with katG protein was evaluated through 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Parameters calculated from the MD simulation trajectories adjudged that all molecules can form stable complexes with katG. High binding free energy of all proposed molecules definitely suggested strong affection towards the katG. Hence, it can be concluded that proposed molecules might be used as antibacterial chemical component subjected to experimental validation.

AB Vessel-generated underwater noise can affect humpback whales, harbor seals, and other marine mammals by decreasing the distance over which they can communicate and detect predators and prey. Emerging analytical methods allow marine protected area managers to use biologically relevant metrics to assess vessel noise in the dominant frequency bands used by each species. Glacier Bay National Park (GBNP) in Alaska controls summer visitation with daily quotas for vessels ranging from cruise ships to yachts and skiffs. Using empirical data (weather, AIS vessel tracks, marine mammal survey data, and published behavioral parameters) we simulated the movements and acoustic environment of whales and seals on 3 days with differing amounts of vessel traffic and natural ambient noise. We modeled communication space (CS) to compare the area over which a vocalizing humpback whale or harbor seal could communicate with conspecifics in the current ambient noise environment (at 10-min intervals) relative to how far it could communicate under naturally quiet conditions, known as the reference ambient noise condition (RA). RA was approximated from the quietest 5th percentile noise statistics based on a year (2011) of continuous audio data from a hydrophone in GBNP, in the frequency bands of whale and seal sounds of interest: humpback "whup" calls (50-700 Hz, 143 dB re 1 mu Pa source level, SL); humpback song (224-708 Hz, 175 dB SL), and harbor seal roars (4-500 Hz, 144 dB SL). Results indicate that typical summer vessel traffic in GBNP causes substantial CS losses to singing whales (reduced by 13-28%), calling whales (18-51%), and roaring seals (32-61%), especially during daylight hours and even in the absence of cruise ships. Synchronizing the arrival and departure timing of cruise ships did not affect CS for singing whales, but restored 5-12% of lost CS for roaring seals and calling whales, respectively. Metrics and visualizations like these create a common currency to describe and explore methods to assess and mitigate anthropogenic noise. Important next steps toward facilitating effective conservation of the underwater sound environments will involve putting modeling tools in the hands of marine protected area managers for ongoing use.

AB The objective of the presented study was to demonstrate the potential of a bottom-up "ethological" approach and individual-based model of Markov-like stochastic processes, employed to gain insights into the factors driving behavior and fate of the invasive propagule, which determine the initial stages of pest invasion and "cryptic" existence of the localized, ultra-low density incipient pest populations. The applied model, PESTonFARM, is driven by the parameters derived directly from the behavior and biology of the target insect species, and spatiotemporal traits of the local terrain and climate. The model projections are actively generated by behavior of the primary causative actors of the invasion processes-individual "virtual" insects-members of the initial propagules or incipient populations. Algorithms of the model were adjusted to reflect behavior and ecology of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, used as a case-example in the presented study. The model was parametrized based on compiled published experimental information about C. capitata behavior and development, and validated using published data from dispersion and trapping studies. The model reliably simulated behavior, development and dispersion of individual members of an invasive cohort, and allowed to quantify pest establishment and detection chances in landscapes of varying spatiotemporal complexity, host availability and climates. The results support the common view that, under optimal conditions (farmland with continuous fruit availability and suitable climate), even a single propagule of medium size (100 females) usually results in pest establishment and detection within the first year post-invasion. The results demonstrate, however, that under specific sub-optimal conditions determined by the local climate, weather fluctuations and landscape topography (e.g., sub-urban), the incipient cryptic populations may occasionally continue for several generations, and remain undetected by typical pest surveillance grids for the periods extending beyond 2-years post-invasion.

AB The question of the influence of nanoparticles (NPs) on chain dimensions in polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) has been treated mainly through the fundamental way using theoretical or simulation tools and experiments on well-defined model PNCs. Here we present the first experimental study on the influence of NPs on the polymer chain conformation for PNCs designed to be as close as possible to industrial systems employed in the tire industry. PNCs are silica nanoparticles dispersed in a styrenebutadiene- rubber (SBR) matrix whose NP dispersion can be managed by NP loading with interfacial coatings or coupling additives usually employed in the manufacturing mixing process. We associated specific chain (d) labeling, and the so-called zero average contrast (ZAC) method, with SANS, in situ SANS and SAXS/TEM experiments to extract the polymer chain scattering signal at rest for non-cross linked and under stretching for cross-linked PNCs. NP loading, individual clusters or connected networks, as well as the influence of the type, the quantity of interfacial agent and the influence of the elongation rate have been evaluated on the chain conformation and on its related deformation. We clearly distinguish the situations where the silica is perfectly matched from those with unperfected matching by direct comparison of SANS and SAXS structure factors. Whatever the silica matching situation, the additive type and quantity and the filler content, there is no significant change in the polymer dimension for NP loading up to 15% v/v within a range of 5%. One can see an extra scattering contribution at low Q, as often encountered, enhanced for non-perfect silica matching but also visible for perfect filler matching. This contribution can be qualitatively attributed to specific h or d chain adsorption on the NP surface inside the NP cluster that modifies the average scattering neutron contrast of the silica cluster. Under elongation, NPs act as additional cross-linking junctions preventing chain relaxation and giving a deformation of the chain with the NP closer to a theoretical phantom network prediction than a pure matrix.

AB Nearly half of the world's oil reserves are found in carbonate reservoirs, which have heterogeneous formation characteristics and are naturally fractured. Because of the permeability contrast between the matrix and fracture network in these reservoirs, primary and secondary oil recovery processes are ineffective. Consequently, there has been a growing interest in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) from fractured carbonate reservoirs (FCRs) over the past years and many successful attempts have involved the use of different thermal or non-thermal EOR methods to improve oil recovery. Nonetheless, many researchers have recently directed their studies towards the use of low salinity water (LSW), nanopartides (NPs), and surfactant (LNS) as EOR agents in carbonates because they are environmentally friendly and incur low costs. Several studies have reported the successful application of the solutions of LSW, NPs, and surfactants either as individual solutions or in combinations, to carbonate formations. The challenges associated with their implementations such as fines migration for LSW flooding, surfactant adsorption onto the pore walls, and instability of NPs under harsh conditions, have also been identified in literature and addressed. However, relatively few investigations have been conducted on FCRs to study the effectiveness of these LNS EOR applications in the presence of fractures. This review, therefore, presents the reports of EOR in FCRs using LNS and identifies the mechanisms that influence these results. It has been shown that fines migration could either promote EOR or reduce recovery based on the occurrence of formation damage. In addition, surfactants with the tendency to form micro-emulsions will be efficient for EOR applications in FCRs. Finally, LNS solutions show promising results with emerging techniques such as alternating injection, which could be applied in FCRs. The findings from this study set the stage for future investigations into EOR in FCRs. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, biopolymers acquire incremental attention on industrial scale owing to their distinct properties. Guar gum is a hydrophilic, biodegradable polysaccharide widely implemented in several industries. In this study, native guar gum (GG) and palmitate-guar gum (PGG) were evaluated as potential candidates for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Spectroscopic characterization of GG and PGG conducted through FT-IR and H-1 NMR spectra. Thermal behavior screened through TGA, DSC and DTA analysis. Moreover, the surface morphology and grafting process investigated through Atomic force microscope (AFM) images. Rheological behavior modeled as a function of shear stress/shear rate and viscosity/shear rate profiles. Both biopolymers display shear-thinning performance and well fitted with Allometricl model, while scanning of shear stress is well fitted by the Hershel-Bulkley model. The theological assessment confirms that GG and PGG solutions exhibit non-Newtonian performance and reasonable salt resistance. In addition, the elastic and dynamic properties indicate that GG and PGG systems are elastic gels since elastic modulus (G') prevail viscous modulus (G ''). On the other hand, the Monte Carlo simulation conducted to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the wettability alteration through adsorption of biopolymer chains on SiO2-quartz crystal. The obtained simulation outputs reveal that PGG film is more stable than GG film and displays a higher surface coverage, and more negatively electrostatic energies with SiO2-quartz crystal rather than GG. Moreover, contact angle and wettability alteration assessed mathematically as a function of capillary pressure and interfacial tension of water/oil phases. Flooding tests conducted on sandstone core at nearby reservoir conditions and cumulative oil recovery was reported relevant to injected pore volumes. Based on the core flooding data, the reported GG and PGG biopolymers can be considered as a well-optimized EOR- and wettability modifying candidates in the saline reservoirs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Unintentional mortality of higher trophic-level species in commercial fisheries (bycatch) represents a major conservation concern as it may influence the long-term persistence of populations. An increasingly common strategy to mitigate bycatch of harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), a small and protected marine top predator, involves the use of pingers (acoustic alarms that emit underwater noise) and time-area fishing closures. Although these mitigation measures can reduce harbor porpoise bycatch in gillnet fisheries considerably, inference about the long-term population-level consequences is currently lacking. We developed a spatially explicit individual-based simulation model (IBM) with the aim to evaluate the effectiveness of these two bycatch mitigation measures. We quantified both the direct positive effects (i.e., reduced bycatch) and any indirect negative effects (i.e., reduced foraging efficiency) on the population size using the inner Danish waters as a biological system. The model incorporated empirical data on gillnet fishing effort and noise avoidance behavior by free-ranging harbor porpoises exposed to randomized high-frequency (20- to 160-kHz) pinger signals. The IBM simulations revealed a synergistic relationship between the implementation of time-area fishing closures and pinger deployment. Time-area fishing closures reduced bycatch rates substantially but not completely. In contrast, widespread pinger deployment resulted in total mitigation of bycatch but frequent and recurrent noise avoidance behavior in high-quality foraging habitat negatively affected individual survival and the total population size. When both bycatch mitigation measures were implemented simultaneously, the negative impact of pinger noise-induced sub-lethal behavioral effects on the population was largely eliminated with a positive effect on the population size that was larger than when the mitigation measures were used independently. Our study highlights that conservationists and policy makers need to consider and balance both the direct and indirect effects of harbor porpoise bycatch mitigation measures before enforcing their widespread implementation. Individual-based simulation models, such as the one presented here, offer an efficient and dynamic framework to evaluate the impact of human activities on the long-term survival of marine populations and can serve as a basis to design adaptive management strategies that satisfy both ecological and socioeconomic demands on marine ecosystems.

AB It is shown that the temperature dependence of the DNP enhancement of the NMR signal from water protons at 3.4 T using TEMPOL as a polarising agent can be obtained provided that the nuclear relaxation, T-1I, is sufficiently fast and the resolution sufficient to measure the H-1 NMR shift. For high radical concentrations (similar to 100 mM) the leakage factor is approximately 1 and, provided sufficient microwave power is available, the saturation factor is also approximately 1. In this situation the DNP enhancement is solely a product of the ratio of the electron and nuclear gyromagnetic ratios and the coupling factor enabling the latter to be directly determined. Although the use of high microwave power levels needed to ensure saturation causes rapid heating of the sample, this does not prevent maximum DNP enhancements, epsilon(0), being obtained since T-1I is very much less than the characteristic heating time at these concentrations. It is necessary, however, to know the temperature variation of T-1I to allow accurate modelling of the behaviour. The DNP enhancement is found to vary linearly with temperature with e(0)(T) = -2 +/- 2 - (1.35 +/- 0.02) T for 6 degrees C <= T <= 100 degrees C. The value determined for the coupling factor, 0.055 +/- 0.003 at 25 degrees C, agrees very well with the molecular dynamics simulations of Sezer et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2009, 11, 6626) who calculated 0.0534, however the experimental values increase much more rapidly with increasing temperature than predicted by these simulations. Large DNP enhancements (vertical bar epsilon(0)vertical bar > 100) are reported at high temperatures but it is also shown that significant enhancements (e.g. similar to 40) can be achieved whilst maintaining the sample temperature at 40 degrees C by adjusting the microwave power and irradiation time. In addition, short polarisation times enable rapid data acquisition which permits further enhancement of the signal, such that useful liquid state DNP-NMR experiments could be carried out on very small samples.

   PERMISSIBLE LEVELS; SAFETY FACTOR; LIMITS; PHARMACOKINETICS;
   CONTAMINANTS; VARIABILITY; WORKPLACE
AB Because airborne exposure varies greatly over time and between individual workers, occupational hygienists should adopt sampling strategies which recognize the inherent statistical nature of assessing exposure.  This analysis indicates that the traditional practice of testing 'compliance' with occupational exposure limits (OELs) should be discarded.  Rather, it is argued that acceptable exposure should be defined with reference to the exposure distribution.  Regarding the many statistical issues which come into play, it is concluded that hygienists should continue to apply the log-normal model for summarizing and testing data.  However, sampling designs should move away from methods which are biased (e.g. sampling only the worst case) and which rely upon job title and observation as the primary means of assigning workers into groups.  Since exposure data often lack independence (e.g. owing to the autocorrelation of serial measurements) and there exist large differences in exposure between workers in the same job group, random sampling designs should be adopted.  It is also shown that the relationship between the mean of a long-normal distribution and exposures in the right tail allows one to evaluate simultaneously the mean exposure and the maximum frequency with which exposures exceed the OEL.
   Investigation of the biological concepts relies heavily upon a conceptual model which depicts the exposure-response continuum as a sequence of time series related to exposure, burden, damage and risk.  Analysis of the linkages between these processes identifies two kinetic conditions which are necessary if variability of exposure is to affect appreciably the individual's risk of chronic disease.  First, the variation of exposure from interval to interval must be efficiently translated into burden and damage (no damping), and second, during periods of intense exposure the relationship between burden and damage must be non-linear (curving upwards).  On the basis of current knowledge it appears that relatively few chronic toxicants satisfy both these conditions.  Even for those substances which cause damage only when a threshold is exceeded, a statistical argument suggests that the maximum risk can still be related to the mean exposure received over time.
   It is concluded that the risk of chronic disease generally depends upon the mean exposure received by the individual worker over time.  Thus, the sampling strategy must allow the distribution of individual mean exposures to be characterized across the population at risk.  It follows from this paradigm for assessing exposures that relatively little effort should be devoted to the evaluation of short-term 'peak' exposures since such transients are unlikely to exert undue influence on long-term effects.  Regarding short-term effects it is argued that evaluation of exposures to acutely toxic agents should rely upon assessment and control of the source rather than of exposure per se.
   Finally, three approaches are evaluated for testing exposures relative to limits:  the test of compliance; a test of the frequency of  excursions; and a test of the mean exposure.  By several objective criteria it is shown that the traditional test of compliance offers a poor tool for prospective assessment.  While both of the other approaches allow rigorous testing to be conducted, evaluation of the mean exposure appears superior on the grounds of statistical power and the relationship between outcome and the long-term hazard.  However, investigation of the underlying bases for OELs indicates that exposure limits can allow more risk to prevail than is generally presumed and the variation of exposure among workers in a group can be large.  Thus, it may be necessary to incorporate safety factors into OELs prior to testing mean exposures.

AB Physical interaction with a partner plays an essential role in our life experience and is the basis of many daily activities. When two physically coupled humans have different and partly conflicting goals, they face the challenge of negotiating some type of collaboration. This requires that both participants understand their partner's state and current actions. But, how would the collaboration be affected if information about their partner were unreliable or incomplete? We designed an experiment in which two players (a dyad) are mechanically connected through a virtual spring, but cannot see each other. They were instructed to perform reaching movements with the same start and end position, but through different via-points. In different groups of dyads we varied the amount of information provided to each player about his/her partner: haptic only (the interaction force perceived through the virtual spring), visuo-haptic (the interaction force is also displayed on the screen), and partner visible (in addition to interaction force, partner position is continuously displayed on the screen). We found that incomplete information about the partner affects not only the speed at which collaboration is achieved (less information, slower learning), but also the actual collaboration strategy. In particular, incomplete or unreliable information leads to an interaction strategy characterized by alternating leader-follower roles. Conversely, more reliable information leads to more synchronous behaviors, in which no specific roles can be identified. Simulations based on a combination of game theory and Bayesian estimation suggested that synchronous behaviors correspond to optimal interaction (Nash equilibrium). Roles emerge as sub-optimal forms of interaction, which minimize the need to account for the partner. These findings suggest that collaborative strategies in joint action are shaped by the trade-off between the task requirements and the uncertainty of the information available about the partner.
   Author summary Many activities in daily life involve physical interaction with a partner or opponent. In many situations, they have conflicting goals and need to negotiate some form of collaboration. Although very common, these situations have rarely been studied empirically. In this study, we specifically address what is a 'optimal' collaboration and how it can be achieved. We also address how developing a collaboration is affected by uncertainty about partner actions. Through a combination of empirical studies and computer simulations based on game theory, we show that subject pairs (dyads) are capable of developing stable collaborations, but the learned collaboration strategy depends on the reliability of the information about the partner. High-information dyads converge to optimal strategies in a game-theoretic sense. Low-information dyads converge to strategies that minimize the need to know about the partner. These findings are consistent with a game-theoretic learning model which relies on estimates of partner actions, but not partner goals. This similarity sheds some light on the minimal computational machinery which is necessary to an intelligent agent in order to develop stable physical collaborations with a human partner.

   Agent-based model; Financial market; Balance sheets
AB We propose a simple model to simulate an interaction between banks and a financial market. In our model, banks are exposed to two sources of risks: market risk from their investments in assets external to the banking system and credit risk from lending in the interbank market. By and large, both risks increase during severe financial turmoil. In this scenario, the paper shows the conditions under which individual and the systemic defaults tend to coincide. This paper attempts to conduct a numerical simulation of banking ecosystems by using the actual values of financial items extracted from 89 Japanese banks' balance sheets. From this numerical simulation, we confirm two points: (1) when financial market prices decrease due to crashes in a trend-followers-dominant market, banks lose their net worth coincidentally. Thus, the capital adequacy ratio decreases synchronously, and any bank may not provide other banks with money through the interbank markets. (2) In a contrarians-dominant or contrarians-predominant market, we observed mean-reverting fluctuations in market prices. Bankruptcies happen asynchronously, and market prices eventually decrease. However, other banks may provide the bank suffering from a shortage of assets with money through the interbank markets. We further compare the characteristics of the banking system in four types of market modes.

AB Operators of highly automated driving systems may exhibit behaviour characteristic for overtrust issues due to an insufficient awareness of automation fallibility. Consequently, situation awareness in critical situations is reduced and safe driving performance following emergency takeovers is impeded. A driving simulator study was used to assess the impact of dynamically communicating system uncertainties on monitoring, trust, workload, takeovers, and physiological responses. The uncertainty information was conveyed visually using a stylised heart beat combined with a numerical display and users were engaged in a visual search task. Multilevel analysis results suggest that uncertainty communication helps operators calibrate their trust and gain situation awareness prior to critical situations, resulting in safer takeovers. In addition, eye tracking data indicate that operators can adjust their gaze behaviour in correspondence with the level of uncertainty. However, conveying uncertainties using a visual display significantly increases operator workload and impedes users in the execution of non-driving related tasks. Practitioner Summary: This article illustrates how the communication of system uncertainty information helps operators calibrate their trust in automation and, consequently, gain situation awareness. Multilevel analysis results of a driving simulator study affirm the benefits for trust calibration and highlight that operators adjust their behaviour according to multiple uncertainty levels.

AB We propose a three-dimensional mechanical model of embryonic tissue dynamics. Mechanically coupled adherent cells are represented as particles interconnected with elastic beams which can exert non-central forces and torques. Tissue plasticity is modeled by a stochastic process consisting of a connectivity change (addition or removal of a single link) followed by a complete relaxation to mechanical equilibrium. In particular, we assume that (i) two non-connected, but adjacent particles can form a new link; and (ii) the lifetime of links is reduced by tensile forces. We demonstrate that the proposed model yields a realistic macroscopic elasto-plastic behavior and we establish how microscopic model parameters determine material properties at the macroscopic scale. Based on these results, microscopic parameter values can be inferred from tissue thickness, macroscopic elastic modulus and the magnitude and dynamics of intercellular adhesion forces. In addition to their mechanical role, model particles can also act as simulation agents and actively modulate their connectivity according to specific rules. As an example, anisotropic link insertion and removal probabilities can give rise to local cell intercalation and large scale convergent extension movements. The proposed stochastic simulation of cell activities yields fluctuating tissue movements which exhibit the same autocorrelation properties as empirical data from avian embryos.

AB Microhabitat selection by Simulium vittatum Zetterstedt larvae in a flume was studied at different mainstream velocities on two substrates: a thin flat plate parallel to the flow and a cylinder in cross flow. The results do not support the generally accepted assumptions that simuliid larvae keep within the boundary layer to avoid the direct influence of mainstream current and that they select the fastest velocity available when offered a longitudinal velocity gradient within their tolerance range. Instead, larvae gathered along the zone of boundary layer separation and remained along the stagnation line at the leading point of the cylinder when artificially positioned there. Further, under most conditions, larvae avoided zones of maximum surface shear stress. Larval reaction to hydraulic changes was immediate. It is hypothesized that S. vittatum larvae first scan the velocity profile at the substrate, initially moving toward increasing flow velocity (or water acceleration). They then cue on a steep velocity gradient along the body as part of the processes involved in choosing a location for suspension feeding. Such conditions would maximize particle flux through the labral fans and minimize drag forces on the bulbous posterior abdomen. This study provides the first direct evidence for microhydraulic factors as causative agents in the formation of simuliid larval assemblages.

AB We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic value is maximized until there is no further information gain, after which exploitation is assured through maximization of extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control. Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or confidence in, policies. This article focuses on the basic theory, illustrating the ideas with simulations. A key aspect of these simulations is the similarity between precision updates and dopaminergic discharges observed in conditioning paradigms.

AB As existing activity-based models of travel demand simulate activity travel patterns for a typical day, dynamic models simulate behavioral response to endogenous or exogenous change along various time horizons. Prior research predominantly addressed a specific kind of change, which usually affected a specific time horizon. In contrast, the current study aims to develop a dynamic model of activity travel decisions that links short- and long-term adaptation decisions in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, this study focuses on the bottom-up process of influence, in which problems with rescheduling on a daily basis may induce a long-term change. The authors assume that travelers will first explore short-term adjustments of their habitual activity travel patterns so as to cope with change and increasing stress. Only when travelers recognize that such adaptation strategies are ineffective will they consider long-term decisions. The proposed framework integrates three key concepts: aspiration, activation, and expected utility. Moreover, both rational and emotional mechanisms are taken into account. The study demonstrates model properties by using numerical simulation. Individual travelers are represented as agents, each with their cognition of the environment, habits, preferences, and aspirations. The results offer insight into the dynamics of traveler learning adaptation and into the evolution of long-term decisions.

AB Inappropriate management of pig manure contributes considerably to pollution of waterbodies by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), and to air pollution by ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions. Dietary manipulation is recognized as a possible pollution mitigation measure, but it may affect pig growth and thereby production costs. Here we present a global meta-analysis of the effects of dietary manipulation on nutrient (N and P) excretion, gaseous (NH3 and H2S) emissions from manure, and growth performance of pigs, using data from 245 published studies. Four groups of dietary manipulation were distinguished, namely i) lowering dietary crude protein (CP) content, (ii) supplementing exogenous enzymes, (iii) supplementing fermented feed ingredients, and (iv) supplementing other additives (e.g. fermentable carbohydrates, acidifying agent/salts and probiotics) in feed. In addition, the cost-effectiveness of dietary manipulations was evaluated, expressed as US $ per kg N excretion abated. Results show that lowering CP content significantly reduced both total N excretion (28.5%) and NH3 emissions (34.4%). Addition of protease reduced N excretion (18.2%) but did not affect NH3 emissions. Supplementing other additives simultaneously reduced NH3 emissions (21.5%) and H2S emissions (23.2%). Adding phytase to feed significantly decreased total P excretion by 31.4%. Diets with fermented feed ingredients tended to decrease N excretion and emissions, but this effect was not statistically significant. All dietary manipulations significantly improved the growth performance regarding the weight gain and feed efficiency, except for lowering CP content. But lowering dietary CP content within a moderate level in combination with adding additional amino acids did not impair pig growth. The cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that various diary manipulation measures were economically beneficial to farmers through improved feed-to-meat conversion efficiency. Our results can support to the design of proper dietary formulations so as to simultaneously reduce N and P excretion and associated emissions, meanwhile enhance the growth performance of pigs with lower economic cost.

To address this shortfall, evidence converged on the idea that learning agents rely on latent-state inferences, i.e. an ability to index disparate associations from cues to rewards (or penalties) and infer which index (i.e. latent state) is presently active. Our goal was to develop a model of latent-state inferences that uses latent states to predict rewards from cues efficiently and that can describe behavior in a diverse set of experiments. The resulting model combines a Rescorla-Wagner rule, for which updates to associations are proportional to prediction error, with an approximate Bayesian rule, for which beliefs in latent states are proportional to prior beliefs and an approximate likelihood based on current associations. In simulation, we demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce learning effects both famously explained and not explained by the Rescorla-Wagner model, including rapid return of fear after extinction, the Hall-Pearce effect, partial reinforcement extinction effect, backwards blocking, and memory modification. Lastly, we derive our model as an online algorithm to maximum likelihood estimation, demonstrating it is an efficient approach to outcome prediction. Establishing such a framework is a key step towards quantifying normative and pathological ranges of latent-state inferences in various contexts.

AB Protein aggregation have been associated with several human neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. There are several small molecules that can reduce aggregation of proteins. The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that the application of more than one inhibitor either simultaneously or consecutively may result in more efficient inhibition of protein aggregation. To this end, the anti-amyloidogenic behaviour of benserazide hydrochloride (BH) and levodopa (LD) individually and in combination (BH + LD) was investigated using various biophysical, microscopic, and computational techniques. BH, LD, and BH + LD treatments showed inhibitory effects on protein aggregation and had the ability to minimise the amyloid-induced cytotoxicity in human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y). The two drugs in combination showed synergism (combination index, CI < 1) between them. These drugs also destabilised the preformed fibrils of human serum albumin (HSA). Our studies consistently showed that the BH + LD treatment showed highest efficacy towards inhibition and disaggregation of amyloid fibrils in comparison to treatment with BH and LD individually. Therefore, application of drugs in combination against fibrillogenesis may represent a new route for development of means for prevention or delaying of the aggregation-related diseases.

AB Conducting a real aircraft evacuation trial is oftentimes unaffordable as it is extremely expensive and may cause severe injury to participants. Simulation models as an alternative have been used to overcome the aforementioned issues in recent years. This paper proposes a new simulation model for emergency evacuation of civil aircraft. Its unique features and advantages over the existing models are twofold: (1) passengers' critical physical characteristics, e.g. waist size, gender, age, and disabilities, which impact the movement and egress time of individual evacuee from a statistical viewpoint, are taken into account in the new model. (2) Improvements are made to enhance the accuracy of the simulation model from three aspects. First, the staggered mesh discretization method together with the agent-based approach is utilized to simulate movements of individual passengers in an emergency evacuation process. Second, each node discretized to represent cabin space in the new model can contain more than one passenger if they are moving in the same direction. Finally, each individual passenger is able to change his/her evacuation route in a real-time manner based upon the distance from the current position to the target exit and the queue length. The effectiveness of the proposed simulation model is demonstrated on Boeing 767-300 aircraft. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated the effects of extensional strain and strain rates on the foamability of PS-talc composite. Foaming processes were observed in situ for PS-talc composites with different surface treatment, size, and weight content of talc under extensional stress. Talc with the largest particle size produced the highest cell densities despite its lower talc particle density for heterogeneous nucleation. Meanwhile, the surface treatment seemed to slightly improve the talc's dispersion, but it did not cause significant differences in their foaming characteristics. The enhanced cell nucleation that took place with the larger talc was due to the higher tensile stresses generated around them in the presence of other growing bubble as compared to those around smaller talc particles. As the level of the applied extensional strain and/or the strain rate increased, the cell density increased significantly in all cases, and the cell density differences became smaller, especially when the talc content was high. The extensional stress caused the decrease of local pressure needed to induce nucleation around the smaller talc particles, so the effects of talc size became less apparent. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB We propose and analyze a simplified version of a partial differential equation (PDE) model for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) derived from an agent-based model proposed by Roeder et al. This model describes the proliferation and differentiation of leukemic stem cells in the bone marrow and the effect of the drug Imatinib on these cells. We first simplify the PDE model by noting that most of the dynamics occurs in a subspace of the original 2D state space. Then we determine the dominant eigenvalue of the corresponding linearized system that controls the long-term behavior of solutions. We mathematically show a non-monotonous dependence of the dominant eigenvalue with respect to treatment dose, with the existence of a unique minimal negative eigenvalue. In terms of CML treatment, this shows that there is a unique dose that maximizes the decay rate of the CML tumor load over long time scales. Moreover this unique dose is lower than the dose that maximizes the initial tumor load decay. Numerical simulations of the full model confirm that this phenomenon is not an artifact of the simplification. Therefore, while optimal asymptotic dosage might not be the best one at short time scales, our results raise interesting perspectives in terms of strategies for achieving and improving long-term deep response.

The porous and pincushion structure films with different surface chemical compositions were obtained by controlling the copolymer structure and temperature and by stripping of the surface. The water contact angles on the different films were measured, and the water droplets on the pincushion structure films when reversed at 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 135 degrees and 180 degrees were also studied. It was found that the pincushion structure films revealed a water adhesion ability. Furthermore, the water droplet impact behavior on these films was investigated. The morphology variations of water droplets, spreading diameter of the droplets, energy conversion, restitution coefficient and adhesion force were examined. Finally, the schematic illustration of water droplets under the static and dynamic states in contact with the pincushion and porous structure surfaces was proposed. It is critical to materialize various applications such as microdroplet transportation, soil erosion, spray painting, anti-icing surface and antifouling agents for textiles.

AB BACKGROUND: The cost-effectiveness of initial strategies in managing Canadian patients with uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms remains controversial
   OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of six management approaches to uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms in the Canadian setting
   METHODS: The present study analyzed data from four randomized trials assessing homogeneous and complementary populations of Canadian patients with uninvestigated upper gastrointestinal symptoms with comparable outcomes Symptom-free months, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and direct costs in Canadian dollars of two management approaches based on the Canadian Dyspepsia Working Group (CanDys) Clinical Management Tool, and four additional strategies (two empirical antisecretory agents, and two prompt endoscopy) were examined and compared Prevalence data, probabilities, utilities and costs were included in a Markov model, while sensitivity analysis used Monte Carlo simulations Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were determined
   RESULTS: Empirical omeprazole cost $226 per QALY ($49 per symptom-free month) per patient CanDys omeprazole and endoscopy approaches were more effective than empirical omeprazole, but more costly. Alternatives using H-2-receptor antagonists were less effective than those using a proton pump Inhibitor No significant differences were found for most incremental cost-effectiveness ratios As willingness to pay (WTP) thresholds rose from $226 to $24,000 per QALY, empirical antisecretory approaches were less likely to be the most cost-effective choice, with CanDys omepiazole progressively becoming a more likely option For WTP values ranging from $24,000 to $70,000 per QALY, the most clinically relevant range. CanDys omeprazole was the most cost-effective strategy (32% to 46% of the time), with prompt endoscopy-proton pump inhibitor favoured at higher WTP values
   CONCLUSIONS: Although no strategy was the indisputable cost-effective option. CanDys omeprazole may be the strategy of choice over a clinically relevant range of WTP assumptions in the initial management of Canadian patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia

Given the unknown effects of e-cigarette use on cigarette smoking behaviors, e-cigarette regulation has become the subject of considerable controversy. In the absence of longitudinal data documenting the long-term effects of e-cigarette use on smoking behavior and population smoking outcomes, computational models can guide future empirical research and provide insights into the possible effects of e-cigarette use on smoking prevalence over time.
   Methods: Agent-based model examining hypothetical scenarios of e-cigarette use by smoking status and e-cigarette effects on smoking initiation and smoking cessation.
   Results: If e-cigarettes increase individual-level smoking cessation probabilities by 20%, the model estimates a 6% reduction in smoking prevalence by 2060 compared with baseline model (no effects) outcomes. In contrast, e-cigarette use prevalence among never smokers would have to rise dramatically from current estimates, with e-cigarettes increasing smoking initiation by more than 200% relative to baseline model estimates to achieve a corresponding 6% increase in smoking prevalence by 2060.
   Conclusions: Based on current knowledge of the patterns of e-cigarette use by smoking status and the heavy concentration of e-cigarette use among current smokers, the simulated effects of e-cigarettes on smoking cessation generate substantially larger changes to smoking prevalence compared with their effects on smoking initiation.

AB Background: spasticity and rigidity are serious complications associated with spinal traumatic or ischemic injury. Clinical studies show that tizanidine (Tiz) is an effective antispasticity agent; however, the mechanism of this effect is still not clear. Tiz binds not only to alpha 2-adrenoreceptors (AR) but also to imidazoline (I) receptors. Both receptor systems (AR+I) are present in the spinal cord interneurons and a-motoneurons. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic potency of systematically or spinally (intrathecally [IT]) delivered Tiz on stretch reflex activity (SRA) in animals with ischemic spasticity, and to delineate supraspinal or spinal sites of Tiz action. Experimental procedures: animals were exposed to 10 min of spinal ischemia to induce an increase in SRA. Increase in SRA was identified by simultaneous increase in recorded electromyography (EMG) activity and ankle resistance measured during computer-controlled ankle dorsiflexion (40 degrees/3 s) in fully awake animals. Animals with increased SRA were divided into several experimental subgroups and treated as follows: (i) Tiz administered systemically at the dose of 1 mg kg(-1), or IT at 10 mu g or 50 mu g delivered as a single dose; (ii) treatment with systemic Tiz was followed by the systemic injection of vehicle, or by nonselective AR antagonist without affinity for I receptors; yohimbine (Yoh), alpha 2A AR antagonist; BRL44408 (BRL), alpha 2B AR antagonist; ARC239 (ARC), nonselective AR and I(1) receptor antagonist; efaroxan (Efa), or nonselective AR and I(2) receptor antagonist; idazoxan (Ida); (iii) treatment with IT Tiz was followed by the IT injection of selective alpha 2A AR antagonist; atipamezole (Ati). In a separate group of spastic animals the effect of systemic Tiz treatment (1 mg/kg) or isoflurane anesthesia on H-reflex activity was also studied. Results: systemic and/or IT treatment with Tiz significantly suppressed SRA. This Tiz-mediated anti-SRA effect was reversed by BRL (5 mg kg(-1)), Efa (1 mg kg(-1)), and Ida (1 mg kg(-1)). No reversal was seen after Yoh (3 mg kg(-1)) or ARC (5 mg kg(-1)) treatment. Anti-SRA induced by IT Tiz (50 mu g) was reversed by IT injection of Ati (50 mu g). Significant suppression of H-reflex was measured after systemic Tiz treatment (1 mg/kg) or isoflurane (2%) anesthesia, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining of spinal cord sections taken from animals with spasticity showed upregulation of alpha 2A receptor in activated astrocytes. Conclusions: these data suggest that alpha 2A AR and I receptors, but not alpha 2B AR, primarily mediate the Tiz-induced antispasticity effect. This effect involves spinal and potentially supraspinal sites and likely targets alpha 2A receptor present on spinal neurons, primary afferents, and activated astrocytes. Further studies using highly selective antagonists are needed to elucidate the involvement of specific subtypes of the AR and I receptors in the antispasticity effect seen after Tiz treatment.

AB During joint actions, humans continuously exchange coordination signals and use nonverbal, sensorimotor forms of communication. Here we discuss a specific example of sensorimotor communication-"signaling"-which consists in the intentional modification of one's own action plan (e.g., a plan for reaching a glass of wine) to make it more predictable or discriminable from alternative action plans that are contextually plausible (e.g., a plan for reaching another glass on the same table). We first review the existing evidence on signaling in human-human interactions, discussing under which conditions humans use signaling. Successively, we distill these insights into a computational theory of signaling during online interactions. Central to our approach are the following ideas: 1) signaling endows pragmatic plans with communicative goals; 2) signaling can be understood within a cost-benefit scheme, balancing the costs for the signaling agent against its benefits for interaction success; and 3) signaling may be part of an interactive strategy that optimizes success when joint goals are uncertain. Finally, we exemplify the benefits of signaling in a series of simulations and discuss how endowing robots with signaling abilities can increase the quality of human-robot interactions by making their behavior more predictable and "legible" for humans.

AB Background: The apolipoprotein E (APOE) 64 genotype has been recommended as a potential inclusion or exclusion criterion in targeted clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) resulting from AD, and has been implemented in trials of immunotherapeutic agents.
   Methods: We tested this recommendation with clinical trial simulations using participants from a meta-database of 19 studies to create trial samples with APOE 64 proportions ranging from 0% (all noncarriers) to 100% (all carriers). For each percentage of APOE 64 carriers, we resampled the database randomly for 1000 trials for each trial scenario, planning for 18- or 24-month trials with samples from 50 to 400 patients per treatment or placebo group, up to 40% dropouts, and outcomes on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) with effect sizes from 0.15 to 0.75, and calculated statistical power.
   Results: Enrichment of clinical trial participants based on APOE 64 carrier status resulted in minimal increases in power compared with enrolling participants with the APOE 63 genotype only or enrolling patients without regard to APOE genotype. Increased screening requirements to enhance the sample would offset gains in power.
   Conclusions: Although samples enriched for APOE 64 carriers in AD or MCI clinical trials showed slightly more cognitive impairment and greater decline using the number APOE 64 alleles as an inclusion criterion most likely would not result in more efficient trials, and trials would take longer because fewer patients would be available. The APOE epsilon 4/epsilon X (where X = 2, 3 or 4) genotype could be useful, however, as an explanatory variable or covariate if warranted by a drug's action. (C) 2014 The Alzheimer's Association.

AB Mesoporous silica particles prepared through a simplified Stober method and low temperature solvent-promoted surfactant removal are evaluated as dissolution enhancers for poorly soluble compounds, using a powerful anticancer agent belonging to pyrroloquinolinones as a model for anticancer oral therapy, and anti-inflammatory ibuprofen as a reference compound. Mesoporous powders composed of either pure silica or silica modified with aminopropyl residues are produced. The influence of material composition and drug chemical properties on drug loading capability and dissolution enhancement are studied. The two types of particles display similar size, surface area, porosity, erodibility, drug loading capability and stability. An up to 50% w/w drug loading is reached, showing correlation between drug concentration in adsorption medium and content in the final powder. Upon immersion in simulating body fluids, immediate drug dissolution occurred, allowing acceptor solutions to reach concentrations equal to or greater than drug saturation limits. The matrix composition influenced drug solution maximal concentration, complementing the dissolution enhancement generated by a mesoporous structure. This effect was found to depend on both matrix and drug chemical properties allowing us to hypothesise general prediction behaviour rules. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Air pollution in big city areas resulting from exhaust emissions is a major urban problem. Often traffic pollution excess controls air pollution management decisions. There are a number of elaborate predictive models of pollutant dispersion and diffusion that address the effects of variable shapes of city buildings on pollutant concentrations, but few are fully validated. This paper presents ventilation behavior in different street canyon configurations. To evaluate dispersion in a model urban street canyon, a series of tests with various street canyon aspect ratios (BIH) are presented. Physical modeling in wind tunnels and numerical modeling can be used for dispersion simulation when investigating air quality. The flow and dispersion of gases emitted by a point source located between two buildings inside of the urban street canyons were determined by the prognostic model FLUENT using the four differences closure approximation [standard K-epsilon, RNG K-epsilon, Reynolds-stress, and large eddy simulation (LES)] and Fire Dynamics Simulator, LES methodology. Calculations are compared against fluid modeling in an industrial wind tunnel at Colorado State University. These buildings were arranged in various symmetric configurations with different separation distances and different numbers of surrounding buildings. The objective of this paper was to develop reliable computer models for the bluff body flow and transport of pollutants or chemical and biological agents in urban environments.

AB The aim of this paper is the mathematical study of the interactions between bacterial populations, materials they colonize, and drugs delivered from surfaces where they adhere. Bacteria can cause infections, which are common events in different types of medical implants as, for example, orthopedic prosthesis, and are often responsible for rejection. A controlled drug delivery to fight bacterial adhesion is crucial in reducing infection rates. A strategy recently adopted to address the problem is to deliver therapeutic agents locally by dispersing them into polymeric implant coatings. The mathematical model is composed of a system of three partial differential equations that describe the drug release from a biodegradable polymeric coating and by an ordinary differential equation that governs the density of a bacterial population. The link between the system of partial differential equations and the ordinary differential equation is defined by an integral that represents the mass of drug that is released by the polymeric coating at time t. Quasi-sharp estimates for the bacterial density that give insight into its dependence on the polymeric properties and the drug characteristics are established. Numerical experiments illustrating the behavior of the density of bacteria, depending on the characteristics of the drug-polymeric coating system, are included.

AB We have applied UTCHEM-IPhreeqc to investigate low-salinity (LS) waterflooding and LS surfactant (LSS) flooding. Numerical-simulation results were compared with laboratory experiments reported by Alagic and Skauge (2010). UTCHEM-IPhreeqc combines the UTCHEM numerical chemical-flooding simulator with IPhreeqc, the United States Geological Survey geochemical model. The IPhreeqc model was coupled to UTCHEM to model LS waterflooding as a function of geochemical reactions. The surfactant coreflood experiments were performed in vertical cores without using polymer or other mobility-control agents. These experiments were performed at a velocity greater than the critical velocity for a gravity-stable flood. After history matching the experiments, additional numerical simulations of surfactant floods at the critical velocity were run to estimate the performance under stable conditions. We also simulated a surfactant flood at higher salinity with lower interfacial tension (IFT) and compared the results with the LSS flood. These results provide new insights into LS waterflooding and surfactant flooding. Addition of surfactants prevents the retrapping of oil that was initially mobilized using LS-brine injection. The results show that the proper selection of surfactant and the design of the surfactant flood might surpass the potential benefits of LS waterflooding in terms of both higher oil recovery and lower cost. Specially, a more-effective method is expected in a stable design with no preflood.

AB Previous research on the effects of bias in criterion-related validation research has typically involved the use of statistical corrections for halo, leniency, and/or central tendency. We present arguments that likability and similarity of raters to ratees may constitute a form of predictor-related criterion bias. One cannot investigate this form of bias without clear understanding of method, predictor, and criterion constructs and careful direct measurement of each. Measurement and theorizing of method constructs is rarely, if ever, undertaken in criterion-related validation work. The results of a criterion-related validation of the use of quantitative and verbal ability and interview and role-play simulations to predict the performance of 372 federal investigative agents are reported. Using the all-Y LISREL model (Williams & Anderson, 1994), we found that likability and similarity factors were related to interview and role play measures. However, none of these potential ''biases'' affected both predictor and criterion constructs, hence there was no effect on the estimates of the relationships between the predictors and criteria. Limitations with respect to the generalizability of these results to criterion-related research in which performance data are not as carefully collected as well as advantages and disadvantages of more traditional regression and correlational analyses are discussed.

DE General equilibrium; Market selection hypothesis
ID INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR
AB The information content of prices is a central problem in the general equilibrium analysis of competitive markets. Rational expectations equilibrium identifies conditioning simultaneously on contemporaneous prices and private information as the mechanism by which information enters prices. Here we look to the ecology of markets for an explanation of the information content of prices. Markets could select across traders with different beliefs, or, reminiscent of 'the wisdom of crowds', markets could balance the diverse information of many participants. We provide theoretical support in favor of the first mechanism, and against the second. Along the way we demonstrate that the necessary condition for long-run survival in complete markets found in Sandroni [2000. Do markets favor agents able to make accurate predictions? Econometrica 68 (6), 1303-1342] and in Blume and Easley [2006. If you're so smart, why aren't you rich? Belief selection in complete and incomplete markets. Econometrica, 74 (4), 929-966] is not sufficient for long-run survival. We also demonstrate some surprising behavior of market prices when several trader types with different beliefs survive. This paper continues the research program of Blume and Easley [1992. Evolution and market behavior. journal of Economic theory 58 (1), 9-40] and Beker and Chattopadhyay [2006.

AB The induction of DNA interstrand cross-links by ionizing radiation has been largely ignored in favour of studies on double-strand break formation and repair. At least part of the problem is technical; it is difficult to detect and quantify interstrand cross-links when the same agent forms both cross-links and single strand breaks because the detection of interstrand cross-links generally involves a denaturation step. Our group has studied the induction of interstrand cross-links following irradiation of DNA containing bromouracil at specific sites. We found that the formation of interstrand cross-links requires the presence of a few (3-5) mismatched bases, comprising the bromouracil. In the absence of mismatched bases, no radiation-induced cross-linking was observed; however, even in the absence of bromouracil, cross-linking still occurred, albeit at a lower efficiency. Our molecular modelling studies demonstrate that the mobility of the bases in the mismatched region is essential for the cross-linking process. Thus, our hypothesis is that ionizing radiation induces DNA interstrand cross-links in non-hybridized regions of DNA. Some obvious examples of such DNA regions are replication forks, transcription bubbles and the D-loop of telomeres. However, an abundance of studies have made it clear that there must be many single-stranded regions in the genome, such as hairpins and cruciforms. For example, alpha satellite DNA, in centromere regions of human chromosomes, forms hairpins. Thus, a variety of non-B DNA structures (hairpins, slipped DNA and tetrahelical structures) exist in the genome and should be susceptible to the formation of radiation-induced interstrand cross-links. Although interstrand cross-links have thus far been virtually ignored in radiation biology, it will be worthwhile to develop methods to detect their presence following exposure of cells to biologically relevant levels of ionizing radiation, since, on a per lesions basis, they are probably more toxic than double-strand breaks.

DE Baldwin effect; genetic assimilation; genetic redistribution; genetic
   variation; adaptation; evolutionary computation
AB Deacon has recently proposed that complexes of genes can be integrated into functional groups as a result of environmental changes that mask and unmask selection pressures. For example, many animals endogenously synthesize ascorbic acid (vitamin C), but anthropoid primates have only a nonfunctional version of the crucial gene for this pathway. It is hypothesized that the loss of functionality occurred in the evolutionary past when a diet rich in vitamin C masked the effect of the gene, and its loss effectively trapped the animals in a fruit-eating lifestyle. As a result, the complex of abilities that support this lifestyle were evolutionarily bound together, forming a multilocus complex. In this study we use evolutionary computation simulations to explore the thesis that masking and unmasking can transfer dependence from one set of genes to many sets, and thereby integrate the whole complex of genes. We used a framework based on Hinton and Nowlan's 1987 Simulation of the Baldwin effect. Additional gene complexes and an environmental parameter were added to their basic model, and the fitness function extended. The simulation clearly demonstrates that the genetic redistribution effect can occur in silico, showing an initial advantage of endogenously synthesized vitamin C, followed by transfer of the fitness contribution to the complex of genes that together allow the acquisition of vitamin C from the environment. As is well known in the modeling community, the Baldwin effect only occurs in simulations when the Population of agents is "poised oil the brink" of discovering the generically specified solution. Similarly, the redistribution effect occurs in simulations under specific initial conditions: too little vitamin C in the environment, and its synthesis it is never fully masked; too much vitamin C, and the abilities required to acquire it are not tightly integrated. The Baldwin effect has been hypothesized as a potential mechanism for developing language-specific adaptations like innate universal grammar and other highly modular capacities. We conclude with a discussion of the relevance of genetic assimilation and generic redistribution to the evolution of language and other cognitive adaptations.

AB Several common situations in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L.) farming, such as air exposure, crowding and the use of anaesthetics, have been demonstrated to be stressful. In the present study, these conditions were simulated in the laboratory, after which head-kidney natural cytotoxic cell (NCC) activity was evaluated. For this, several specimens were air exposed for 2 min, returned to the aquarium and sampled from 0 to 4 days after exposure. NCC activity was significantly lower on the day following air-exposure compared with the control (rested fish) but not at any other time studied. Other fish were crowded (100 kg biomass m(-3), 2 h), returned to an aquarium with the same density as the control group (9 kg m(-3)) and sampled from 0 to 4 days after treatment. Head-kidney NCC activity was statistically increased compared with the control (resting) fish, 1 day after crowding. Anaesthesis for 1 h with 60 or 200 mul 2-phenoxyethanol l(-1) had no significant effect on NCC activity, while the use of 50 mg MS222 l(-1) for 1 h reduced such activity (by about 40%) compared with the control. In other experiments, fish were consecutively treated with crowding and anaesthetics. When treated with the lowest 2-phenoxyethanol concentration after crowding, the NCC activity inhibition was abolished compared with the activity in fish treated either with crowding or anaesthetic alone, while the use of the highest concentration increased such inhibition. The use of MS222 after crowding did not produce any differential effect compared with the fish treated with only one of the factors.
   In conclusion, NCC activity is affected differently according to the stress factor applied (hypoxia, crowding and/or anaesthetics). Differences in the effects provoked by these stressors on other seabream innate immune parameters are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As we known, it is popular for a designed system to achieve a prescribed performance, which have remarkable capability to regulate the flow of information from distinct and independent components. Also, it is not well understand, in both theories and applications, how self propelled agents use only limited environmental information and simple rules to organize into an ordered motion. In this paper, we focus on analysis the flocking behaviour and the line-shaped pattern for collective motion involving time delay effects. Firstly, we work on a delayed Cucker-Smale-type system involving a general communication weight and a constant delay tau > 0 for modelling collective motion. In a result, by constructing a new Lyapunov functional approach, combining with two delayed differential inequalities established by L-2-analysis, we show that the flocking occurs for the general communication weight when tau is sufficiently small. Furthermore, to achieve the prescribed performance, we introduce the line-shaped inner force term into the delayed collective system, and analytically show that there is a flocking pattern with an asymptotic flocking velocity and line-shaped pattern. All results are novel and can be illustrated by numerical simulations using some concrete influence functions. Also, our results significantly extend some known theorems in the literature.

AB Random Utility Maximization (RUM)-based mode choice models are criticized for their poor characterization of several behavioral aspects including habit and inertia in mode choice. As a result, traditional models may end up with a misleading estimation of modal shift in cases where strong habits towards a specific mode exist. In addition, given the cross-sectional nature of traditional choice models, it is hard to address individuals' sensitivity to various policy scenarios and to determine the period of time required to reap the benefits of the proposed policies. In order to contribute to this critical issue, this paper presents a review of existing literature on mode choice modeling focusing on capturing behavioral aspects related to habit and inertia formation. The paper then proposes a novel conceptual framework for a microsimulation learning-based mode shift model that compiles both reinforcement learning techniques with random utility maximization concepts. The proposed approach utilizes various elements of reinforcement learning methods to simultaneously integrate habit formation, level of information provision and awareness limitations. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the differences between traditional and learning-based modeling frameworks. The simulation results are in line with the prior expectations which can be considered a first step towards the model's credibility.

AB This paper introduces a model of 'theory of mind', namely, how we represent the intentions and goals of others to optimise our mutual interactions. We draw on ideas from optimum control and game theory to provide a 'game theory of mind'. First, we consider the representations of goals in terms of value functions that are prescribed by utility or rewards. Critically, the joint value functions and ensuing behaviour are optimised recursively, under the assumption that I represent your value function, your representation of mine, your representation of my representation of yours, and so on ad infinitum. However, if we assume that the degree of recursion is bounded, then players need to estimate the opponent's degree of recursion (i.e., sophistication) to respond optimally. This induces a problem of inferring the opponent's sophistication, given behavioural exchanges. We show it is possible to deduce whether players make inferences about each other and quantify their sophistication on the basis of choices in sequential games. This rests on comparing generative models of choices with, and without, inference. Model comparison is demonstrated using simulated and real data from a 'stag-hunt'. Finally, we note that exactly the same sophisticated behaviour can be achieved by optimising the utility function itself (through prosocial utility), producing unsophisticated but apparently altruistic agents. This may be relevant ethologically in hierarchal game theory and coevolution.

DE prompt NO; NO emission index; mole production rate
ID NO(X) FORMATION; CO2 ADDITION
AB The dilution effect of air stream according to agent type on flame structure and NO emission behaviour is numerically simulated with detailed chemistry in CH4/air counterflow diffusion flame. The volume percentage of diluents (H2O, CO2, and N-2) in air stream is systematically changed from 0 to 10. The radiative heat loss term, based on an optically thin model, is included to clearly describe the flame structure and NO emission behaviour especially at low strain rates. The effect of dilution of air stream on the decrease of maximum flame temperature varies as CO2 > H2O > N-2, even if heat capacity of H2O is the highest. It is also found that the addition of CO2 shows the tendency towards the reduction of flame temperature in both the thermal and chemical sides, while the addition of H2O enhances the reaction chemically and restrains it thermally due to a super-equilibrium effect of the chain carrier radicals caused by the breakdown of H2O in high-temperature region. The comparison of the nitrogen chemical reaction pathway between the cases of the addition of CO2 and H2O clearly displays that the addition of CO2 is much more effective to reduce NO emission.

AB The infilled CFS shear walls with FGD gypsum were developed in the paper. For lightweight design, the FGD gypsum was mixed with glazed hollow beads and air-entraining agents. Five full-scale specimens were investigated under cydic horizontal loads. The configuration of the specimens varied in compressive strength of infilled gypsum and sheathing types. The shear performance of the walls can be improved obviously due to the participation of infilled material. The failure modes are characterized by the loss of stressed skin provided by sheathings together with compressive failure of Mulled gypsum. Besides, a series of tests concerning fastener responses and material characteristics of gypsum was conducted. Furthermore, the numerical models based on OpenSEES were proposed. After calibration of parameters, a combination of beam elements with pinned joints, zero-Length elements with Pinching-4 material and equivalent truss elements with Concrete-01 material was employed to describe the nonlinear behaviour of the infilled walls. The comparison between tests and simulations was then carried out. The results of numerical models have an agreement on test results. The developed numerical model can be used for predicting cycle performance of the infilled CFS walls and related analysis of structural systems in further studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Insufficient network capacity and conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles at roadway intersections can be critical obstacles to the operational efficiency of evacuation activities. Reducing pedestrian-vehicle conflict points and expanding network capacities are two possible approaches to improving operational efficiency, especially when network accessibility varies in different evacuation stages. This paper integrates two types of network reconfiguration strategies, namely, the use of contraflow lane reversal for road lanes and pedestrian walkways and time-dependent conflict point elimination by separating pedestrian and vehicle flows with physical barriers at road intersections, to strategize pedestrian and vehicle moving directions during a mass evacuation. A multiobjective optimization model is formulated to adaptively select the appropriate locations for barriers according to different evacuation phases, and the model is solved by a modified genetic algorithm-based heuristic approach. An experiment on optimizing an urban regional evacuation network configuration in the case of a toxic gas leak accident was carried out to validate the proposed model. The numerical results show an increase of approximately 15% in the maximum evacuee throughput and a reduction of approximately 65% in the average exposure risk of evacuees of the optimal plans compared with the uncontrolled plan.

AB 1. Although bipolar disorder constitutes a major public health problem, with a high risk of suicide and an economic cost exceeding that of unipolar depression, it has received comparatively little attention, particularly at the basic science level. Perhaps as a result of this neglect, there is currently no animal model able to simulate the cyclicity which is its defining characteristic.
   2. Consequently, drug development in this area is meager and has proceeded serendipitously rather than empirically.
   3. The authors have recently reported that repeated exposure to cocaine and other stressors can induce an oscillation or cycling in a host of neurochemical and physiological systems.
   4. In order to test whether such cycling might be of potential relevance to bipolar disorder, the authors examined whether cocaine-induced cyclicity of amphetamine-evoked efflux of dopamine from slices of rat nucleus accumbens and striatum and/or cocaine induced oscillation of a behavior, stress-induced hypoalgesia, could be prevented by lithium, the agent of choice in treating this disease.
   5. The authors report that prophylactic treatment with lithium, completely and specifically prevented oscillations in each instance. This may represent an important initial step toward the development of the first cycling model of bipolar disorder.

AB Pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) are a group of emerging contaminants that have frequently been detected in aqueous environments. Phototransformation driven by solar irradiation is one of the most important natural processes for the elimination of PPCPs. In this study, primidone (PMD) was chosen as a model "photorefractory" compound. A series of experiments were conducted to assess if reactive intermediates (RIs), such as hydroxyl radical (HO center dot), singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), and triplet states of dissolved organic matter ((DOM)-D-3*), inhibited or enhanced the photochemical transformation of PMD under simulated solar irradiation. The results indicate that HO center dot plays a key role in the photodegradation of PMD and that dissolved oxygen can affect the degradation rate of PMD by promoting HO center dot formation. Our results demonstrated that PMD can not only react with free HO center dot (HO center dot(-free)) but also react with lower-energy hydroxylation agents (HO center dot(-like)). The contributions of HO center dot(-free) and HO center dot(-like) to PMD degradation in various dissolved organic matter (DOM) solutions were estimated by a methane-quenching experiment. The results indicated that the HO center dot(-like) species were important in the photodegradation of "photorefractory" compounds. The bimolecular reaction rate constant of the reaction of free HO center dot with PMD was measured as (5.21 +/- 0.02) x 10(9) M-1 s(-1) by using electron pulse radiolysis. Furthermore, PMD was used as a probe to estimate the steady-state concentration of HO center dot(-free) in various DOM solutions. Using the multivariate statistical strategies of orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and hierarchical clustering, 28 photochemical transformation products (TPs) of PMD were successfully identified from the DOM matrix.

AB Background: Some patients present with features of both primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) on the one hand and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) on the other hand, either simultaneously or consecutively. The term 'overlap syndrome (OS)' is used to describe these settings, but lack of universal agreement on what precisely constitutes an OS has generated considerable confusion. The low prevalence of OS (roughly 10% of PBC or PSC) has made it impracticable to perform randomized controlled trials. It remains unclear whether this syndrome forms a distinct entity or is a variant of PBC, PSC or AIH. Key Messages: Moderate to severe interface hepatitis is a fundamental component and histology is vital in evaluating patients with overlap presentation. Use of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group criteria for the diagnosis of OS is not recommended. For PBC-AIH OS, EASL has provided diagnostic criteria and, in most cases, it is possible to define one primary disorder ('dominant' disease), usually PBC. Patients with OS seem to have a more severe disease compared to conventional PBC. PSC-AIH OS is assumed to exist in a considerable part of mainly young patients with autoimmune liver disease and long-term progression towards cirrhosis seems to occur in the majority of cases. In children, the hepatitic feature can be very dominant, and up to 50% of pediatric AIH have cholangiographic abnormalities suggestive of PSC (autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis). Treatment of OS is empiric and includes ursodeoxycholic acid for the cholestatic component (depending on local policy for PSC) and immunosuppressive agents for the hepatitic component, either simultaneously or sequentially. The dominant clinical feature should be treated first and therapy adjusted according to the response. Conclusions: OS is not uncommon but should not be over-diagnosed in order not to expose unnecessarily PBC or PSC patients to the risk of steroid side effects. Therapy has to be individualized and not be static. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB In this article, I review the results of studies on the origin of life distinct from the popular RNA world hypothesis. The alternate scenario postulates the origin of the first bimolecular genetic system (a polynucleotide gene and a polypeptide processive polymerase) with simultaneous replication and translation and includes the following key features:
   1. The bimolecular genetic system emerges not from mononucleotides and monoamino acids, but from progenes, namely, trinucleotides aminoacylated on 3'-end by a non-random amino acid (NpNpNp similar to pX similar to Aa, where N-deoxyribo-or ribonucleoside, p-phosphate, X-a bifunctional agent, for example ribose, Aa-amino acid, similar to macroerge bond). Progenes are used as substrates for simultaneous synthesis of a polynucleotide and a polypeptide. Growth of the system is controlled by the growing polypeptide, and the bimolecular genetic system emerges as an extremely rare event. The first living being (virus-like organism protoviroid, Protoviroidum primum) arises and reproduces in prebiotic liposome-like structures using progenes. A population of protoviroids possessing the genetic system evolves in accordance with the Darwinian principle. Early evolution from protoviroid world to protocell world is shortly described.
   2. The progene forming mechanism (NpNp + Np similar to pX similar to Aa) makes it possible to explain the emergence of the prebiotic physicochemical group genetic code, as well as the selection of organic compounds for the future genetic system from the racemic environment.
   3. The protoviroid is reproduced on a progene basis via replicative transcription-translation (RTT, the first molecular genetic process) that is similar to its modern counterparts. Nothing is required for the emergence and reproduction of the protoviroid except for progenes and conditions for their formation.
   4. The general scheme of early evolution is as follows: prebiotic world -> protoviroid (nucleoprotein) world -> protocell (DNA-RNA-protein) world -> LUCA (Last Universal Common Ancestor). modern cell world -> This scheme exclude the existence of an independent RNA world as predecessor of the cellular world.

AB The role of dopamine in behaviour and decision-making is often cast in terms of reinforcement learning and optimal decision theory. Here, we present an alternative view that frames the physiology of dopamine in terms of Bayes-optimal behaviour. In this account, dopamine controls the precision or salience of (external or internal) cues that engender action. In other words, dopamine balances bottom-up sensory information and top-down prior beliefs when making hierarchical inferences (predictions) about cues that have affordance. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of changing tonic levels of dopamine firing using simulations of cued sequential movements. Crucially, the predictions driving movements are based upon a hierarchical generative model that infers the context in which movements are made. This means that we can confuse agents by changing the context (order) in which cues are presented. These simulations provide a (Bayes-optimal) model of contextual uncertainty and set switching that can be quantified in terms of behavioural and electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, one can simulate dopaminergic lesions (by changing the precision of prediction errors) to produce pathological behaviours that are reminiscent of those seen in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. We use these simulations to demonstrate how a single functional role for dopamine at the synaptic level can manifest in different ways at the behavioural level.

AB Evidence is accumulating to support the hypothesis that some animals use light-induced radical pairs to detect the direction of the Earth's magnetic field. Cryptochrome proteins seem to be involved in the sensory pathway but it is not yet clear if they are the magnetic sensors: they could, instead, play a non-magnetic role as signal transducers downstream of the primary sensor. Here we propose an experiment with the potential to distinguish these functions. The principle is to use superparamagnetic nanoparticles to disable any magnetic sensing role by enhancing the electron spin relaxation of the radicals so as to destroy their spin correlation. We use spin dynamics simulations to show that magnetoferritin, a synthetic, protein-based nanoparticle, has the required properties. If cryptochrome is the primary sensor, then it should be inactivated by a magnetoferritin particle placed 12-16 nm away. This would prevent a bird from using its magnetic compass in behavioural tests and abolish magnetically sensitive neuronal firing in the retina. The key advantage of such an experiment is that any signal transduction role should be completely unaffected by the tiny magnetic interactions (<< k(B)T) required to enhance the spin relaxation of the radical pair.

AB Chlorine-based disinfection agents are known to favor the production of disinfection by-products (DBPs), whose concentrations are restricted by international guidelines to ensure a safe consumption of drinking water. Hence, it is important to understand the behavior of DBPs within water distribution networks (WDNs) to avoid users' exposure to concentrations higher than guideline values. The buildup in chlorate concentration resulting from chlorinated disinfectants is here simulated with the EPANET 2.0 software for one benchmark WDN serving about 130,000 inhabitants. Chlorate generation was accounted by means of an empirical model, considering different boundary conditions (physicochemical features of raw water, disinfectant dose). The gathered results indicate that increases in chlorate concentration within the considered WDN are narrow. Chlorate neoformation in the WDN is, however, strictly related to the initial amount of chlorate released by the water treatment plant, i.e., to the input value in the WDN. If chlorate concentration in treatment plants is kept below 700 mu g/L (i.e., World Health Organization guideline), depending on the mixing conditions in tanks, the simulation results referred to the considered WDN show that the DBP buildup within the network is limited (in any case lower than 5-7% of the threshold value).

AB Target tracking is a fundamental problem in robotics research and has been the subject of detailed studies over the years. In this paper, we generate a data-driven target model from a real-world dataset of taxi motions. This model includes target motion, appearance, and disappearance from the search area. Using this target model, we introduce a new formulation of the mobile target tracking problem based on the mathematical concept of random finite sets. This formulation allows for tracking an unknown and dynamic number of mobile targets with a team of robots. We show how to employ the probability hypothesis density filter to simultaneously estimate the number of targets and their positions. Next, we present a greedy algorithm for assigning trajectories to the robots to allow them to actively track the targets. We prove that the greedy algorithm is a two-approximation for maximizing submodular tracking objective functions. We examine two such functions: the mutual information between the estimated target positions and future measurements from the robots and a new objective that maximizes the expected number of targets detected by the robot team. We provide extensive simulation evaluations to validate the performance of our data-driven motion model and to compare the behavior and tracking performance of robots using our objective functions.

AB Drug delivery technologies are an important area within biomedicine. Targeted drug delivery aims to reduce the undesired side effects of drug usage by directing or capturing the active agents near a desired site within the body. Herein, a numerical investigation of magnetic drug targeting (MDT) using aerosol drugs named polystyrene particle (PMS40) in human lung is presented considering one-way coupling on the transport and capture of the magnetic particle. A realistic 3D geometry based on CT scan images is provided for CFD simulation. An external non-uniform magnetic field is applied. Parametric investigation is conducted and the influence of particle diameter, magnetic source position, and magnetic number (Mn) on the deposition efficiency and particle behavior is reported. According to the results, the magnetic field increased deposition efficiency of particles in a target region, the efficiency of deposition and MDT technique has a direct relation with increasing the particle diameter for magnetic number of 1 Tesla (T) and lower (Mn <= 1(T)). Also it can be seen that there is an inverse relation between the particle diameter and deposition efficiency when Mn is more than 1 (T). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO NONLINEARITY

ID DISTRIBUTED DELAYS; BEHAVIOR; ARRAY; CHAOS
AB The full synchronization of coupled nonlinear oscillators has been widely studied. In this paper we investigate conditions for which partial synchronization of time-delayed diffusively coupled systems arises. The coupling configuration of the systems is described by a directed graph. As a novel quantitative result we first give necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of forward invariant sets characterized by partially synchronous motion. These conditions can easily be checked from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Second, we perform stability analysis of the synchronized equilibria in a (gain, delay) parameter space. For this analysis the coupled nonlinear systems are linearized around the synchronized equilibria and then the resulting characteristic function is factorized. By such a factorization, it is shown that the relation between the behaviour of different agents at the zero of the characteristic function depends on the structure of the eigenvectors of the weighted Laplacian matrix. By determining the structure of the solutions in the unstable manifold, combined with the characterization of invariant sets, we predict which partially synchronous regimes occur and estimate the corresponding coupling gain and delay values. We apply the obtained results to networks of coupled Hindmarsh-Rose neurons and verify the occurrence of the expected partially synchronous regimes by using a numerical simulation. We also make a comparison with an existing approach based on Lyapunov functionals.

AB The hot metal desulfurization in Kanbara Reactor (KR) metal treatment was simulated in this study via a transient-coupled 3D numerical model of the two-phase flow, heat transfer, and particle motion desulfurization processes. The KR impeller stirring was described via the multiple reference frame model. The volume of fluid approach was employed to capture the air-hot metal interface. The particle motion and aggregation were defined by the two-way coupled Euler-Lagrangian method. A desulfurization kinetic model was simultaneously introduced to represent the sulfur mass transfer rate. The effect of the initial diameter of desulfurizing agent (DA) particles on the desulfurization efficiency was quantitatively assessed. The lowest sulfur content was observed in the impeller vicinity and the highest one in the inactive colder liquid metal at the vessel bottom. With the DA particle initial diameter reduction from 3.0 to 0.5 mm, the overall desulfurization rate was increased from 83.2 to 97.1 pct. Insofar the specific surface area of smaller particles exceeded that of larger ones, they had higher motion velocities and heating rates, creating a greater reactivity for the desulfurization. However, desulfurization at the vessel bottom was only slightly enhanced using smaller DA particles, so the overall improvement did not exceed 20 pct. Further enhancement is envisaged by refining the impeller design and particle-adding technique.

AB In this paper, we provide a network growth model with incorporation into the ultimatum game dynamics. The network grows on the basis of the payoff-oriented preferential attachment mechanism, where a new node is added into the network and attached preferentially to nodes with higher payoffs. The interplay between the network growth and the game dynamics gives rise to quite interesting dynamical behaviors. Simulation results show the emergence of altruistic behaviors in the ultimatum game, which is affected by the growing network structure. Compared with the static counterpart case, the levels of altruistic behaviors are promoted. The corresponding strategy distributions and wealth distributions are also presented to further demonstrate the strategy evolutionary dynamics. Subsequently, we turn to the topological properties of the evolved network, by virtue of some statistics. The most studied characteristic path length and the clustering coefficient of the network are shown to indicate their small-world effect. Then the degree distributions are analyzed to clarify the interplay of structure and evolutionary dynamics. In particular, the difference between our growth network and the static counterpart is revealed. To explain clearly the evolved networks, the rich-club ordering and the assortative mixing coefficient are exploited to reveal the degree correlation.

AB Cancer is a heterogeneous disease in most respects, including its cellularity, different genetic alterations, and diverse clinical behaviors. Traditional molecular analyses are reductionist, assessing only 1 or a few genes at a time, thus working with a biologic model too specific and limited to confront a process whose clinical outcome is likely to be governed by the combined influence of many genes. The potential of functional genomics is enormous, because for each experiment, thousands of relevant observations can be made simultaneously. Accordingly, DNA array, like other high-throughput technologies, might catalyze and ultimately accelerate the development of knowledge in tumor cell biology. Although in its infancy, the implementation of DNA array technology in cancer research has already provided investigators with novel data and intriguing new hypotheses on the molecular cascade leading to carcinogenesis, tumor aggressiveness, and sensitivity to antiblastic agents. Given the revolutionary implications that the use of this technology might have in the clinical management of patients with cancer, principles of DNA array-based tumor gene profiling need to be clearly understood for the data to be correctly interpreted and appreciated. In the present work, we discuss the technical features characterizing this powerful laboratory tool and review the applications so far described in the field of oncology.

AB We here explore the utility of a paradigm that allows the simultaneous assessment of memory for object (what) and object location (where) and their comparative predominance. Two identical objects are presented during a familiarity trial; during the test trial one of these is displaced, and a new object is presented in a familiar location. When tested 5 or 80 min later, rats explored both the novel and the displaced objects more than two familiar stationary objects, indicating intact memory for both, object and place. When tested 24 h later rats explored the novel object more than the displaced familiar one, suggesting that forgetting differently influenced object and place memory, with memory for object being more robust than memory for place. Animals that received post-trial administration of the neurokinin-3 receptor agonist senktide and were tested 24 h later, now explored the novel and displaced objects equally, suggesting that the treatment prevented the selective decay of memory for location. Next, animals received NMDA lesions in either the perirhinal cortex or the hippocampus, which are hypothesized to be preferentially involved in memory for objects and memory for place, respectively. When tested 5 or 80 min later, the perirhinal cortex lesion group explored the displaced object more, indicating relatively deficient object memory, while the hippocampal lesion led to the opposite pattern, demonstrating comparatively deficient place memory. These results suggest different preferential engagement of the perirhinal cortex and hippocampus in their processing of memory for object and place. This preference test lends itself to application in the comparison of selective lesions of neural sites and projection systems as well as to the assessment of possible preferential action of pharmacological agents on neurochemical processes that subserve object vs place learning.

AB Background-The exact mechanism of stem cell therapy in augmenting the function of ischemic cardiomyopathy is unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that increased viability of the peri-infarct region (PIR) produces restorative benefits after stem cell engraftment. A novel multimodality imaging approach simultaneously assessed myocardial viability (manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [MEMRI]), myocardial scar (delayed gadolinium enhancement MRI), and transplanted stem cell engraftment (positron emission tomography reporter gene) in the injured porcine hearts.
   Methods and Results-Twelve adult swine underwent ischemia-reperfusion injury. Digital subtraction of MEMRI-negative myocardium (intrainfarct region) from delayed gadolinium enhancement MRI-positive myocardium (PIR and intrainfarct region) clearly delineated the PIR in which the MEMRI-positive signal reflected PIR viability. Human amniotic mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSCs) represent a unique population of immunomodulatory mesodermal stem cells that restored the murine PIR. Immediately following hAMSC delivery, MEMRI demonstrated an increased PIR viability signal compared with control. Direct PIR viability remained higher in hAMSC-treated hearts for > 6 weeks. Increased PIR viability correlated with improved regional contractility, left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct size, and hAMSC engraftment, as confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Increased MEMRI and positron emission tomography reporter gene signal in the intrainfarct region and the PIR correlated with sustained functional augmentation (global and regional) within the hAMSC group (mean change, left ventricular ejection fraction: hAMSC 85 +/- 60%, control 8 +/- 10%; P<0.05) and reduced chamber dilatation (left ventricular end-diastole volume increase: hAMSC 24 +/- 8%, control 110 +/- 30%; P<0.05).
   Conclusions-The positron emission tomography reporter gene signal of hAMSC engraftment correlates with the improved MEMRI signal in the PIR. The increased MEMRI signal represents PIR viability and the restorative potential of the injured heart. This in vivo multimodality imaging platform represents a novel, real-time method of tracking PIR viability and stem cell engraftment while providing a mechanistic explanation of the therapeutic efficacy of cardiovascular stem cells.

TI Physiological costs of the hearing due to noise exposure, additional
   physical stress, and combined exposure to alcohol and cigarette smoke
SO HUMAN FACTORS AND ERGONOMICS IN MANUFACTURING
LA English
DT Article
AB In 2 studies, each with 5 test series, physiological costs of the hearing due to legally tolerable noise exposures of 94 dB (A) for 1 hr have been measured audiometrically. The temporary threshold shifts (TTS) and their restitution time, as well as cardiovascular responses in work-related heart rate increases, of 10 and 8 subjects (Ss), respectively, could be shown to be modulated by additional physical stress and combined exposure to alcohol (Study l) and cigarette smoke (Study 2). Moderate dynamic muscle work (50 W) administered via a bicycle ergometer either immediately after noise, or simultaneous to the noise exposure, significantly reduced restitution time as well as the integrated restitution temporary threshold shift (IRTTS). A physical stress to 100 W-which exceeded the endurance level when demanded simultaneously to the noise exposure-did not show any favorable effects. However, if the same physical stress succeeded the noise exposure, and when it was interrupted several times for the audiometric measurements, it also brought about significant accelerations of the restitution processes. Some reductions in physiological costs of the hearing were found due to an intervening alcohol consumption (blood alcohol concentration similar to0.08%) prior to the noise exposure and a simultaneous physical load of 50 W. Smoking 10 cigarettes instead of the consumption of alcohol was associated with a reduced TTS, but a prolonged restitution time. IRTTS as total physiological costs of the most unfavorable combination of noise, simultaneous high physical workload, and preceding smoke exposure was increased. The results of the test series with cigarette smoke-probably due to the small group of just 8 Ss and the counteracting effects of the agents carbon monoxide (CO) and nicotine-were not statistically significant, but these exposures were associated with a substantial activation of the cardiovascular system. Significant heart rate increases are evidence that CO and nicotine must not be neglected as influential factors in the context of physiological costs that the organism, and especially the hearing, has to pay for noise exposures.

AB Understanding pedestrian proxemic utility and trust will help autonomous vehicles to plan and control interactions with pedestrians more safely and efficiently. When pedestrians cross the road in front of human-driven vehicles, the two agents use knowledge of each other's preferences to negotiate and to determine who will yield to the other. Autonomous vehicles will require similar understandings, but previous work has shown a need for them to be provided in the form of continuous proxemic utility functions, which are not available from previous proxemics studies based on Hall's discrete zones. To fill this gap, a new Bayesian method to infer continuous pedestrian proxemic utility functions is proposed, and related to a new definition of 'physical trust requirement' (PTR) for road-crossing scenarios. The method is validated on simulation data then its parameters are inferred empirically from two public datasets. Results show that pedestrian proxemic utility is best described by a hyperbolic function, and that trust by the pedestrian is required in a discrete 'trust zone' which emerges naturally from simple physics. The PTR concept is then shown to be capable of generating and explaining the empirically observed zone sizes of Hall's discrete theory of proxemics.

AB This paper proposes a model of the dynamics of credit contagion through non-performing loans on financial networks. Credit risk contagion is modeled in the context of the classical SIS (Susceptibles-Infected-Susceptibles) epidemic processes on networks but with a fundamental novelty. In fact, we assume the presence of two different classes of infected agents, and then we differentiate the dynamics of assets subject to idiosyncratic risk from those affected by systemic risk by adopting a SIIS (Susceptible-Infected1-Infected2-Susceptible) model. In the recent literature in this field, the effect of systemic credit risk on the performance of the financial network is a hot topic. We perform numerical simulations intended to explore the roles played by two different network structures on the long-term behavior of assets affected by systemic risk in order to analyze the effect of the topology of the underlying network structure on the spreading of systemic risk on the structure. Random graphs, i.e., the Erdos-Renyi model, are considered "benchmark" network structures while core-periphery structures are often indicated in the literature as idealized structures, although they are able to capture interesting, specific features of real-world financial networks. Moreover, as a matter of comparison, we also perform numerical experiments on small-world networks.

AB Background: Several reviews of synergisms and antagonisms in chemical mixtures have concluded that synergisms are relatively rare. However, these reviews focused on mixtures composed of specific groups of chemicals, such as pesticides or metals and on toxicity endpoints mostly relevant to ecotoxicology. Doubts remain whether these findings can be generalised. A systematic review not restricted to specific chemical mixtures and including mammalian and human toxicity endpoints is missing.
   Objectives: We conducted a systematic review and quantitative reappraisal of 10 years' of experimental mixture studies to investigate the frequency and reliability of evaluations of mixture effects as synergistic or antagonistic. Unlike previous reviews, we did not limit our efforts to certain groups of chemicals or specific toxicity outcomes and covered mixture studies relevant to ecotoxicology and human/mammalian toxicology published between 2007 and 2017.
   Data sources, eligibility criteria: We undertook searches for peer-reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, GreenFile, ScienceDirect and Toxline and included studies of controlled exposures of environmental chemical pollutants, defined as unintentional exposures leading to unintended effects. Studies with viruses, prions or therapeutic agents were excluded, as were records with missing details on chemicals' identities, toxicities, doses, or concentrations.
   Study appraisal and synthesis methods: To examine the internal validity of studies we developed a risk-of-bias tool tailored to mixture toxicology. For a subset of 388 entries that claimed synergisms or antagonisms, we conducted a quantitative reappraisal of authors' evaluations by deriving ratios of predicted and observed effective mixture doses (concentrations).
   Results: Our searches produced an inventory of 1220 mixture experiments which we subjected to subgroup analyses. Approximately two thirds of studies did not incorporate more than 2 components. Most experiments relied on low-cost assays with readily quantifiable endpoints. Important toxicity outcomes of relevance for human risk assessment (e.g. carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity) were rarely addressed. The proportion of studies that declared additivity, synergism or antagonisms was approximately equal (one quarter each); the remaining quarter arrived at different evaluations. About half of the 1220 entries were rated as "definitely" or "probably" low risk of bias. Strikingly, relatively few claims of synergistic or antagonistic effects stood up to scrutiny in terms of deviations from expected additivity that exceed the boundaries of acceptable between-study variability. In most cases, the observed mixture doses were not more than two-fold higher or lower than the predicted additive doses. Twenty percent of the entries (N = 78) reported synergisms in excess of that degree of deviation. Our efforts of pinpointing specific factors that predispose to synergistic interactions confirmed previous concerns about the synergistic potential of combinations of triazine, azole and pyrethroid pesticides at environmentally relevant doses. New evidence of synergisms with endocrine disrupting chemicals and metal compounds such as chromium (VI) and nickel in combination with cadmium has emerged.
   Conclusions, limitations and implications: These specific cases of synergisms apart, our results confirm the utility of default application of the dose (concentration) addition concept for predictive assessments of simultaneous exposures to multiple chemicals. However, this strategy must be complemented by an awareness of the synergistic potential of specific classes of chemicals. Our conclusions only apply to the chemical space captured in published mixture studies which is biased towards relatively well-researched chemicals.

AB In,this work a previously proposed empirical and analytical criterion for extinction is numerically extended and validated for varying fuel dilution, oxidant dilution, strain rate, and surface temperature. The output of this work is presented in two parts: the current Part I uses simple kinetics and constant thermal transfer properties and Part II uses detailed kinetics, varying thermal transfer properties, flame radiation feedback and flame suppression agents in order to demonstrate that conclusions from the simplified model are still valid. In addition this work goes beyond the concept of critical flame temperature or mass flux for extinction by including the influence of slow chemical kinetics through the Damkohler number which becomes even more important for commonly used fire retarded materials.
   Extinction of flames on solid fuels is modeled by decoupling the pyrolysis chemistry from the gas-phase combustion chemistry using the flame energy feedback versus pyrolysis rate curves and an energy balance at the surface. This approach has the advantage of identifying and deducing key materials properties for solid and gaseous phase from experiments. Simulations are performed in a planar stagnation-point flow diffusion flame configuration using one-step Arrhenius chemical kinetics and a simplified transport model with Lewis number equal to unity. Only quasi-steady conditions are considered for the gaseous phase even. if the pyrolysis rate of the solid is transient because the response time for the solid phenomena is, in general, much larger than the response (diffusion) time for the gaseous phenomena.
   It is found that at high pyrolysis rates and low straining rates (infinitely fast kinetics regime) there is no leakage of oxygen to the surface of solid fuel. However, as the solid fuel extinction is approached, oxygen leakage occurs because the effective air to fuel mass stoichiometric ratio becomes less than one owing to fuel dilution near the surface. At high straining rates, solid combustion cannot be sustained at any pyrolysis rate. In the infinitely fast kinetics regime, an appropriate scaling has been developed which collapses the convective heat flux curves onto a single one. In general, the critical pyrolysis fuel mass flux exhibits a universal behavior for variation of various model parameters when plotted versus a modified Damkohler number, and becomes constant when the latter is sufficiently high. Comparison with experiments is discussed, and the implications of the criterion for characterizing ignition flammability properties of solid fuels are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The buoyant motion of a bubble rising through a continuous liquid phase can be retarded by the adsorption onto the bubble surface of surfactant dissolved in the liquid phase. The reason for this retardation is that adsorbed surfactant is swept to the trailing pole of the bubble where it accumulates and lowers the surface tension relative to the front end. The difference in tension creates a Marangoni force which opposes the surface flow, rigidifies the interface and increases the drag coefficient. Surfactant molecules adsorb onto the bubble surface by diffusing from the bulk to the sublayer of liquid adjoining the surface, and kinetically adsorbing from the sublayer onto the surface. The surface surfactant distribution which defines the Marangoni force is determined by the rate of kinetic adsorption and bulk diffusion relative to the rate of surface convection. In the limit in which the rate of either kinetic or diffusive transport of surfactant to the bubble surface is slow relative to surface convection and surface diffusion is also slow, surfactant collects in a stagnant cap at the back end of the bubble while the front end is stress free and mobile. The size of the cap and correspondingly the drag coefficient increases with the bulk concentration of surfactant until the cap covers the entire surface and the drag coefficient is that of a bubble with a completely tangentially immobile surface. Previous theoretical research on the stagnant cap regime has not studied in detail the competing roles of bulk diffusion and kinetic adsorption in determining the size of the stagnant cap angle, and there have been only a few studies which have attempted to quantitatively correlate simulations with measurements.
   This paper provides a more complete theoretical study of and a validating set of experiments on the stagnant cap regime. We solve numerically for the cap angle and drag coefficient as a function of the bulk concentration of surfactant for a spherical bubble rising steadily with inertia in a Newtonian fluid, including both bulk diffusion and kinetic adsorption. For the case of diffusion-limited transport (infinite adsorption kinetics), we show clearly that very small bulk concentrations can immobilize the entire surface, and we calculate the critical concentrations which immobilize the surface as a function of the surfactant parameters. We demonstrate that the effect of kinetics is to reduce the cap angle (hence reduce the drag coefficient) for a given bulk concentration of surfactant. We also present experimental results on the drag of a bubble rising in a glycerol-water mixture, as a function of the dissolved concentration of a polyethoxylated non-ionic surfactant whose bulk diffusion coefficient and a lower bound on the kinetic rate constants have been obtained separately by measuring the reduction in dynamic tension as surfactant adsorbs onto a clean interface. For low concentrations of surfactant, the experiments measure drag coefficients which are intermediate between the drag coefficient of a bubble whose surface is tangentially mobile and one whose surface is completely immobilized. Using the separately obtained value for the diffusion coefficient of the polyethoxylate, we undertake simulations which provide, upon comparison with the measured drag coefficients, a tighter bound on the kinetic rate constants than were otherwise obtained using dynamic surface tension measurement, and this suggests a new method for the measurement of kinetic rate constants.

AB Searching for new less toxic anticancer drug candidates is a big challenge from a medical point of view. The present investigation was aimed at describing two independent synthetic approaches based on isosteric replacements, spectroscopic characteristics, in vitro anticancer and ex vivo antihaemolytic activities of novel molecules (9-22) and correlations between their standardised lipophilicity indices, computed log P-average values and pharmacokinetic descriptors. Two novel protocols for annelation of the triazinone template on hydrazinylideneimidazolidines (1-8) (showing a high reactivity towards electrophilic reagents, such as ethyl trifluoropyruvate and ethyl 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate) were developed for the first time, giving rise to two original classes of highly conjugated azaisocytosine-containing molecules (9-16 and 17-22). Both syntheses proceeded under basic conditions to yield the most probable intermediates (e.g. hemiaminals and imines), which in refluxing two-component solvent mixtures or a suitable solvent cyclised through closing the triazinone ring on functionalised imidazolidines in both cases. All fused azaisocytosine-containing congeners were investigated with the purpose of preselecting possible drug candidates with a better selectivity that could be suitable for further more detailed drug development studies. The majority of test molecules revealed strong antiproliferative effects in most tumour cell cultures and they were more cytotoxic against tumour cells than anticancer drug - pemetrexed. These cytotoxicities may be associated with the activation of initiator and executioner caspases (confirmed for compound 12) which are inducers of apoptosis. Simultaneously, three bioisosteres bearing the trifluoromethyl moiety at the C-3 and the ortho substitution at the phenyl ring (10, 12 and 13) proved to be the most promising in terms of selectivity as they were less or equally toxic to normal cells as pemetrexed. It was shown that isosteric replacement of the ethyl group in antitumour active congeners by the trifluoromethyl or isopropyl group was favourable for the selectivity of the designed drug-like molecules. Almost all new compounds revealed the protective effects in an ex vivo model of oxidatively stressed rat erythrocytes (better or comparable than that of ascorbic acid/Trolox), proving that they are safe to red blood cells. The statistically significant and predictive QSAR equations were derived that describe relationships between some pharmacokinetic descriptors (such as log K-a,K- HSA, f(u, brain), Caco-2, log K-p) and lipophilicity parameters of test molecules. Among all molecules with anticancer profile, the possible drug candidates seem to be 10, 12, 13, 19 and 21 which are the least toxic for normal cells, deprived of haemolytic effects on oxidatively-stressed red blood cells and have the optimum pharmacokinetic descriptors in terms of their lipophilicity parameters. Because of a high development potential they should be utilised in further more extended in vivo investigations aimed at developing novel less toxic anticancer agents.

AB Background and Aim: To study the alterations of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in a group of renal-transplant recipients.
   Methods and Results: A case-control study was carried out on 44 renal-transplant recipients with normal kidney function and oral glucose tolerance, and a control group of 37 healthy subjects. The following variables were studied: a) anthropometric and clinical, b) diet, c) composition of the adipose tissue fatty acids d) glycemia, insulin, and C peptide at baseline and after oral glucose tolerance rest (OGTT), e) cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B in total plasma and in high density lipoprotein (HDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) separated by ultracentrifugation, Apo A-I, Apo CII, and Apo CIII in plasma. The renal-transplant recipients had a greater waist to hip ratio (0.89+/-0.09 vs 0.69+/-0.07, p=0.0008) compared to controls. Calorie intake was similar but the transplant recipients had a lower intake of saturated fat per day (31.4+/-9.6 vs 37.4+/-10.98 g/day, p=0.05). The composition of fatty acids in adipose tissue was the same in cases and controls, except for a greater proportion of lauric acid in the transplant recipients (p=0.05). The transplant recipients had significantly higher levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and Apo B both in plasma and in VLDL, LDL, and IDL. The Apo A-I, Apo CII, and Apo CIII were significantly raised in the transplant recipients, but the Apo CII/Apo CIII ratio was significantly reduced (p=0.005). The HDL levels were similar in the transplant recipients and controls except for the HDL triglycerides, which were significantly higher (p=0.0002). Insulin values in serum were higher in the transplant recipients over the whole glucose curve with statistically significant differences at minute 90 of the curve (p=0.05). C peptide was higher in the transplant recipients at baseline (3.83+/-5.31 ng/ml VS 1.70+/-0.61 ng/ml, p=0.0001) and at minute 180 of the curve (p=0.03). The C peptide/insulin ratio was also significantly raised at these same times. Transplant recipients with hypertension had higher levels of blood glucose at minutes 30 (p=0.04) and 90 (p=0.01) of the curve, as well as a larger area under the glucose curve (p=0.03). They also had significantly higher levels of insulin at minute 90 (p=0.03), total Apo B (p=0.05), Apo B in LDL (p=0.03) and LDL-cholesterol (p=0.05).
   Conclusions: The rise in cholesterol and plasma triglycerides, rite apolipoprotein distribution pattern, the redistribution of the body fat, the changes in carbohydrate and insulin metabolism, are all the expression in renal-transplant recipients of a plurimetabolic syndrome, probably secondary to the simultaneous action of steroids, cyclosporine and hypotensive agents.

AB Majority of the observed cognitive and behavioral changes in Alzheimer's disease are postulated to be due to the deficiencies in cholinergic pathways of the brain. Enhancement of cholinergic transmission may thus stimulate the cholinergic receptors or prolong the availability of acetylcholine in synaptic cleft and hence improve the Alzheimer's disease associated symptoms. Of these two, the inhibition of cholinesterases (Acetylcholinesterase and Butyrylcholinesterase) by cholinesterase inhibitors is suggested to be a promising strategy. In this regard, various agents both natural and non-natural have been evaluated for the inhibition of cholinesterases. Phytochemical studies of some of the medicinal plants have shown the presence of many valuable compounds that show a wide range of pharmacological activity against cholinesterase enzymes. Interestingly, a good number of potent synthetic inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes reported so far are natural-product based. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of both natural and synthetic cholinesterase inhibitors reported so far. Presenting a comparative overview of synthetic and natural cholinesterase inhibitors may provide some leads for the synthesis of new cholinesterase inhibitors from medicinal plants. Structural activity relationship of the active cholinesterase inhibitors is also discussed with some insights from simulation studies. Insights for possible future research have also been highlighted.

AB In this work, the results of a detailed art technological investigation of the icon Last Supper from the Russian Memorial Church in Leipzig (Germany) are presented. The icons of the iconostasis of the church were made in the workshop of N.S. Emelyanov in Moscow in 1912. The investigation showed that the painter in principle technologically adhered to the traditional way of making icons. The panel is made of boards of lime wood with two crossbars on the reverse. The paint was applied to a chalk ground over a textile layer. The traditional iconographer's palette was expanded by a few contemporary pigments. The binding agent is classic egg tempera. Originally, the layers of paint had an oil varnish (olifa). The main aim of the project VirtEx, introduced in this paper, is to expand existing methods with numerical material and structural models to be able to predict quantitatively the behaviour of wooden artefacts under loads due to climate changes as well as mechanical loads. The detailed art technological investigation provides the required data for the computer models. The numerical data can then be validated with technologically exact copies and replicas. In the introduction to the article, the current state of research on icon painting techniques is also outlined.

AB Many physiological and pathological changes in brain function manifest in eye-movement control. As such, assessment of oculomotion is an invaluable part of a clinical examination and affords a non-invasive window on several key aspects of neuronal computation. While oculomotion is often used to detect deficits of the sort associated with vascular or neoplastic events; subtler (e.g. pharmacological) effects on neuronal processing also induce oculomotor changes. We have previously framed oculomotor control as part of active vision, namely, a process of inference comprising two distinct but related challenges. The first is inferring where to look, and the second is inferring how to implement the selected action. In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on the neuromodulatory control of active inference. This allows us to simulate the sort of changes we would expect in oculomotor behaviour, following pharmacological enhancement or suppression of key neuromodulators-in terms of deciding where to look and the ensuing trajectory of the eye movement itself. We focus upon the influence of cholinergic and GABAergic agents on the speed of saccades, and consider dopaminergic and noradrenergic effects on more complex, memory-guided, behaviour. In principle, a computational approach to understanding the relationship between pharmacology and oculomotor behaviour affords the opportunity to estimate the influence of a given pharmaceutical upon neuronal function, and to use this to optimise therapeutic interventions on an individual basis.

AB The study of epithelial morphogenesis is fundamental to increasing our understanding of organ function and disease. Great progress has been made through study of culture systems such as Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, but many aspects of even simple morphogenesis remain unclear. For example, are specific cell actions tightly coupled to the characteristics of the cell's environment or are they more often cell state dependent? How does the single lumen, single cell layer cyst consistently emerge from a variety of cell actions? To improve insight, we instantiated in silico analogues that used hypothesized cell behavior mechanisms to mimic MDCK cystogenesis. We tested them through in vitro experimentation and quantitative validation. We observed novel growth patterns, including a cell behavior shift that began around day five of growth. We created agent-oriented analogues that used the cellular Potts model along with an Iterative Refinement protocol. Following several refinements, we achieved a degree of validation for two separate mechanisms. Both survived falsification and achieved prespecified measures of similarity to cell culture properties. In silico components and mechanisms mapped to in vitro counterparts. In silico, the axis of cell division significantly affects lumen number without changing cell number or cyst size. Reducing the amount of in silico luminal cell death had limited effect on cystogenesis. Simulations provide an observable theory for cystogenesis based on hypothesized, cell-level operating principles.

AB Clonal expansion of premalignant lesions is an important step in the progression to cancer. This process is commonly considered to be a consequence of sustaining a proliferative mutation. Here, we investigate whether the growth trajectory of clones can be better described by a model in which clone growth does not depend on a proliferative advantage. We developed a simple computer model of clonal expansion in an epithelium in which mutant clones can only colonize space left unoccupied by the death of adjacent normal stem cells. In this model, competition for space occurs along the frontier between mutant and normal territories, and both the shapes and the growth rates of lesions are governed by the differences between mutant and normal cells' replication or apoptosis rates. The behavior of this model of clonal expansion along a mutant clone's frontier, when apoptosis of both normal and mutant cells is included, matches the growth of UVB-induced p53-mutant clones in mouse dorsal epidermis better than a standard exponential growth model that does not include tissue architecture. The model predicts precancer cell mutation and death rates that agree with biological observations. These results support the hypothesis that clonal expansion of premalignant lesions can be driven by agents, such as ionizing or nonionizing radiation, that cause cell killing but do not directly stimulate cell replication.

AB Purpose: To prepare chitosan films that shall be capable of simulating in vitro permeation of polar ( 5- FU) and non polar ( indomethacin) drugs across rat/ rabbit/ human epidermis. Method: Statistical designs were utilized to identify the formulation and process variables that significantly influenced permeation of both drugs across chitosan films crosslinked with sodium citrate ( Nacit). In addition, atomic absorption spectroscopy for Na+ and differential scanning calorimetry of these films were performed for understanding the cross- linking behaviour. Results: Concentration of chitosan, cross- linking time and concentration of cross- linking agent significantly influenced the in vitro flux of both drugs. Na+ content in films cross- linked with Nacit solutions without adjustment of pH was found to increase whereas, Delta H of cross- linking endothermic transition decreased. However, after dipping these films in phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4) both Na+ and Delta H was found to decrease. Such a decrease was not observed when films cross- linked with sodium citrate solutions after adjustment to pH 5 were dipped in phosphate buffer ( pH 7.4). The in vitro permeation of both drugs across latter films was significantly less. Conclusion: Adjustment of Nacit solution pH to 5 produced ionic complexes that were resistant to alkaline pH. Chitosan films can be cross- linked with Nacit to simulate in vitro permeation of polar and non polar drugs across animal/ human epidermis.

AB The goal of this paper is to present bluff body flow and transport from steady point sources of pollutants, or chemical and biological agents in an idealized urban environment This paper includes ventilation behavior in different street canyon configurations. To evaluate dispersion in a model urban street canyon, a series of tests with various street canyon aspect ratios (B/H) are presented. Both open-country roughness and urban roughness cases are considered. The flow and dispersion of gases emitted by a point source located between two buildings inside an urban street canyon were determined by the prognostic model FLUENT using four different RANS turbulent closure approximations and in the model fire dynamics simulator using a large eddy simulation methodology. Calculations are compared against fluid modeling in the Industrial Meteorological Wind Tunnel at Colorado State University. A basic building shape, the Wind Engineering Research Field Laboratory building (WERFL) at Texas Tech University, was used for this study. The urban street canyon was represented by a 1:50 scale WERFL model surrounded by models of similar dimensions. These buildings were arranged in various symmetric configurations with different separation distances and different numbers of up- or downwind buildings. Measurements and calculations reveal the dispersion of gases within the urban environment are essentially unsteady, and they are not always well predicted by the use of steady-state prediction methodologies.

DE Water pollution; Water scarcity; Evolutionary dynamics; Water-usepermits
ID MARKETS; ENCLOSURES; POWER; CHILE
AB Over the last few years water scarcity and pollution have been rapidly growing at both regional and global level. This has generated in many cases increasing intersectoral competition over the use of a limited amount of water resources. To examine the dynamics that such competition may generate in the economy, the present paper proposes a simple dynamic evolutionary model in which two sectors (A and B) compete for the use of water and studies the impact of water pricing on the dynamics of the two sectors in the presence of a population of interacting economic agents characterized by imitative behaviors. As it emerges from the model, when water is underpriced a self-enforcing process may be observed driving the economy towards a Pareto-dominated equilibrium. In such equilibrium the economy fully specializes in sector A, characterized by the highest negative impact on the water resource, at the expenses of sector B. The paper shows that a policy of fine tuning that increases water price through the endogenous water pricing mechanism examined in the model can inhibit the convergence of the economy to such an equilibrium point and can progressively shift the system towards the less water-consuming sector. Finally, assuming a Leontief production function and performing numerical simulations, it is shown how a change in water price can affect the dynamics of the model, and that the same results hold also in a more general, three-sector context.

AB In this work we present a model of an air transportation traffic system from the complex network modelling viewpoint. In the network, every node corresponds to a given airport, and two nodes are connected by means of flight routes. Each node is weighted according to its load capacity, and links are weighted according to the Euclidean distance that separates each pair of nodes. Local rules describing the behaviour of individual nodes in terms of the surrounding flow have been also modelled, and a random network topology has been chosen in a baseline approach. Numerical simulations describing the diffusion of a given number of agents (aircraft) in this network show the onset of a jamming transition that distinguishes an efficient regime with null amount of airport queues and high diffusivity (free phase) and a regime where bottlenecks suddenly take place, leading to a poor aircraft diffusion (congested phase). Fluctuations are maximal around the congestion threshold, suggesting that the transition is critical. We then proceed by exploring the robustness of our results in neutral random topologies by embedding the model in heterogeneous networks. Specifically, we make use of the European air transportation network formed by 858 airports and 11 170 flight routes connecting them, which we show to be scale-free. The jamming transition is also observed in this case. These results and methodologies may introduce relevant decision-making procedures in order to optimize the air transportation traffic.

AB All processes of life are controlled by networks of interacting biochemical components. The purpose of modelling these networks is manifold. From a theoretical point of view it allows the exploration of network structures and dynamics, to find emergent properties or to explain the organisation and evolution of networks. From a practical point of view, in silico experiments can be performed that would be very expensive or impossible to achieve in the laboratory, such as hypothesis-testing with regards to knock-out experiments or overexpression, or checking the validity of a proposed molecular mechanism. The literature on modelling biochemical networks is growing rapidly and the motivations behind different modelling techniques are sometimes quite distant from each other. To clarify the current context, we review several of the most popular methods and outline the strengths and weaknesses of deterministic, stochastic, probabilistic, algebraic and agent-based approaches. We then present a comparison table which allows one to identify easily key attributes for each approach such as: the granularity of representation or formulation of temporal and spatial behaviour. We describe how through the use of heterogeneous and bridging tools, it is possible to unify and exploit desirable features found in differing modelling techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the multidisciplinary area of biochemical networks modelling. By increasing the awareness of multiple complementary modelling approaches, we aim at offering a more comprehensive understanding of biochemical networks.

ID PRICE FLUCTUATIONS; STOCK-MARKET; SIMPLE-MODEL; BEHAVIOR; IMPACT
AB Most modem financial markets use a continuous double auction mechanism to store and match orders and facilitate trading. In this paper we develop a microscopic dynamical statistical model for the continuous double auction under the assumption of IID random order flow, and analyse it using simulation, dimensional analysis, and theoretical tools based on mean field approximations. The model makes testable predictions for basic properties of markets, such as price volatility, the depth of stored supply and demand versus price, the bid-ask spread, the price impact function, and the time and probability of filling orders. These predictions are based on properties of order flow and the limit order book, such as share volume of market and limit orders, cancellations, typical order size, and tick size. Because these quantities can all be measured directly there are no free parameters. We show that the order size, which can be cast as a non-dimensional granularity parameter, is in most cases a more significant determinant of market behaviour than tick size. We also provide an explanation for the observed highly concave nature of the price impact function. On a broader level, this work suggests how stochastic models based on zero intelligence agents may be useful to probe the structure of market institutions. Like the model of perfect rationality, a stochastic zero intelligence model can be used to make strong predictions based on a compact set of assumptions, even if these assumptions are not fully believable.

AB In marine environments, noise from human activities is increasing dramatically, causing animals to alter their behavior and forage less efficiently. These alterations incur energetic costs that can result in reproductive failure and death and may ultimately influence population viability, yet the link between population dynamics and individual energetics is poorly understood. We present an energy budget model for simulating effects of acoustic disturbance on populations. It accounts for environmental variability and individual state, while incorporating realistic animal movements. Using harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) as a case study, we evaluated population consequences of disturbance from seismic surveys and investigated underlying drivers of vulnerability. The framework reproduced empirical estimates of population structure and seasonal variations in energetics. The largest effects predicted for seismic surveys were in late summer and fall and were unrelated to local abundance, but instead were related to lactation costs, water temperature, and body fat. Our results demonstrate that consideration of temporal variation in individual energetics and their link to costs associated with disturbances is imperative when predicting disturbance impacts. These mechanisms are general to animal species, and the framework presented here can be used for gaining new insights into the spatiotemporal variability of animal movements and energetics that control population dynamics.

AB Water shutoff is a commonly used method to mitigate the early breakthrough in horizontal wells. Gel is frequently used as an effective water shutoff agent in mature fields, especially for horizontal wells in recent years. However, the relevant water shutoff prediction model lacks the accurate physical description of the gelation phenomenon. Using the conventional model, which simply accounts for the gelation mechanisms, does not allow us to predict the horizontal wells performance correctly. In this paper, a newly coupled reservoir-wellbore model for horizontal wells gel water shutoff prediction is presented. A conventional gel simulator is used to simulate the gel injection process in the reservoir and then modified to predict the horizontal well performance after the treatment. The time-varying residual resistance factor model and viscosity model is developed to simulate the gel degradation process. Especially, the wellbore pressure drop calculation takes account for the non-Newtonian behavior during and after the gel injection. An explicit modular coupled scheme, which consists of reservoir modular and wellbore modular, is adopted to numerically predict the horizontal wells performance. The newly presented method not only simulates the gel injection process but also predict the water shut off performance in horizontal wells. A field horizontal water shutoff case prediction shows that the coupled modeling method can give satisfactory results to guide the water shutoff treatment.

AB Opioid peptides can be converted by tyrosinase into melanin-like compounds, in which the peptide moiety is retained. Such pigments, named opio-melanins, exhibit a characteristic absorption spectrum with a maximum at about 330 nm and a different solubility behaviour with respect to dopa-melanin, being completely soluble in hydrophylic solvents at neutral and basic pH. Opio-melanins precipitate in aqueous solutions below pH 5.0, and show apparent pK(a) values of 3.1, 3.6 and 4.4 for Tyr-Gly-melanin, Tyr-Gly-Gly-melanin and leuenk-melanin, respectively. The concomitant oxidation of dopa and opioid peptides by tyrosinase produces mixed polymers, showing the distinctive absorption peak at 330 nm. In the dark, in the pH range 5.5-7.0 the pigments are completely stable, whereas H2O2 addition provokes a slight degradation. At higher pH values or under simulated solar illumination with or without hydrogen peroxide, bleaching occurs more rapidly than in dopa-melanin. Upon photoirradiation the absorption spectrum of opio-melanins undergoes a marked variation, the peak at 330 nm being replaced by a broad shoulder in the range 280-350 nm. The absorption spectra of native and bleached pigments and the extent of opio-melanins degradation by bleaching agents, confirm the hypothesis that the different initial structure of the precursors accounts for a final diverse polymeric architecture of these pigments with respect to dopa-melanin.

AB Background: The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the causative agent of COVID-19, consists of an assembly of proteins that determine its infectious and immunological behavior, as well as its response to therapeutics. Major structural biology efforts on these proteins have already provided essential insights into the mode of action of the virus, as well as avenues for structure-based drug design. However, not all of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, or regions thereof, have a well-defined three-dimensional structure, and as such might exhibit ambiguous, dynamic behaviour that is not evident from static structure representations, nor from molecular dynamics simulations using these structures.
   Main: We present a website (https://bio2byte.be/sars2/) that provides protein sequence-based predictions of the backbone and side-chain dynamics and conformational propensities of these proteins, as well as derived early folding, disorder, beta-sheet aggregation, protein-protein interaction and epitope propensities. These predictions attempt to capture the inherent biophysical propensities encoded in the sequence, rather than context-dependent behaviour such as the final folded state. In addition, we provide the biophysical variation that is observed in homologous proteins, which gives an indication of the limits of their functionally relevant biophysical behaviour.
   Conclusion: The https://bio2byte.be/sars2/ website provides a range of protein sequence-based predictions for 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, enabling researchers to form hypotheses about their possible functional modes of action.

AB Externally triggered thermogenic nanoparticles (NPs) are potential drug carriers and heating agents for drug delivery and hyperthermia. A good understanding of the transport and adhesion behaviors of NPs in microvessels is conducive to improving the efficiency of NP-mediated treatment. Given the thermogenesis of NPs and interactions of NP-blood flow, NP-NP, NP-red blood cell (RBC) and ligand-receptor, the movement of NPs in blood flow was modeled using a hybrid immersed boundary and coupled double-distribution-function lattice Boltzmann method. Results show that the margination probability of NPs toward the vessel wall was evidently increased by NP thermogenesis owing to the noticeable variation in blood flow velocity distribution, thereby enhancing their adhesion to the target region. NP-RBC collision can promote NP movement to the acellular layer in microvessels to increase the NP adhesion rate. The number of adhered smaller NPs was larger than that of the larger NPs having the same ligand density due to the enhancement of Brownian force although their adhesion was relatively less firm. Compared with the NPs with a regular shape, the irregularly shaped NPs can adhere to the vessel wall more readily and strongly as a result of the higher turbulence levels caused by NP-blood flow interaction and relatively higher ligand density, which led to a higher rate of NP adhesion.

AB The Upper Baker River Dam utilizes a combination of a floating surface collector (FSC) and a guide net to facilitate the downstream migration of anadromous juvenile fish. The FSC generates attraction currents by withdrawing water from the forebay, upstream of the guide net. The withdrawn water is discharged at the rear of the FSC by two pumps. A three-dimensional (3D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model of the forebay of the dam is presented in this paper. The objective was to investigate forebay hydrodynamics generated by the FSC and operation of the powerhouse. The CFD model, consisting of approximately one million computational cells, was validated against field data. Model results were analyzed, using a recently proposed strain-velocity-pressure (SVP) hypothesis, to identify hydrodynamic cues responsible for attracting juvenile fish to the FSC. The CFD model indicates that the FSC pumps generated high velocity jets dominate the circulation pattern downstream of the guide net. Upstream of the guide net, the velocities are weak, except in the region impacted by attraction currents. The sweeping and normal velocities on the guide net are smaller than those suggested by regulatory agencies for designing screens at juvenile fish collection facilities.

AB Organisms in nature are both proximate (operating by rules of thumb) and adapted (the rules influenced by natural selection). We introduce new methods that can be used to study in silico versions of organisms behaving according to proximate adapted rules. Our approach goes beyond neural networks and offers an alternative to optimization methods. It is based on the idea that organisms receive signals from the environment, that the signals are modified by internal (state-dependent) factors to create feelings (which we refer to as hedonic tones), and that behavioural processes (decisions) are a response to the hedonic tones. We illustrate these ideas through a model of a fish moving in a vertically structured environment, subject to predation and competition from conspecifics. The fish in our model responds to food, light, temperature and conspecifics, without any reference to current or future fitness. We use a combination of hedonic modelling to process the response, and genetic algorithms to modify the response via natural selection, according to internal needs and evolutionary history. We show that many different combinations of genes can lead to similar fitnesses, so that this approach generates genetic diversity. We compare our results with those of a variety of empirical studies and show that our approach can lead to new links between empirical and simulation studies.

AB Mosquito-borne diseases contribute significantly to the global disease burden. High-profile elimination campaigns are currently underway for many parasites, e.g., Plasmodium spp., the causal agent of malaria. Sustaining momentum near the end of elimination programs is often difficult to achieve and consequently quantitative tools that enable monitoring the effectiveness of elimination activities after the initial reduction of cases has occurred are needed. Documenting progress in vector-borne disease elimination is a potentially important application for the theory of critical transitions. Non-parametric approaches that are independent of model-fitting would advance infectious disease forecasting significantly. In this paper, we consider compartmental Ross-McDonald models that are slowly forced through a critical transition through gradually deployed control measures. We derive expressions for the behavior of candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, and coefficient of variation in the number of human cases during the approach to elimination. We conducted a simulation study to test the performance of each summary statistic as an early warning system of mosquito-borne disease elimination. Variance and coefficient of variation were highly predictive of elimination but autocorrelation performed poorly as an indicator in some control contexts. Our results suggest that tipping points (bifurcations) in mosquito-borne infectious disease systems may be foreshadowed by characteristic temporal patterns of disease prevalence.

DT Article
ID SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS
AB Integrating computer simulation with conventional wet-lab research has proven to have much potential in furthering the understanding of biological systems. Success requires the relationship between simulation and the real-world system to be established: substantial aspects of the biological system are typically unknown, and the abstract nature of simulation can complicate interpretation of in silico results in terms of the biology. Here we present spartan (Simulation Parameter Analysis R Toolkit ApplicatioN), a package of statistical techniques specifically designed to help researchers understand this relationship and provide novel biological insight. The tools comprising spartan help identify which simulation results can be attributed to the dynamics of the modelled biological system, rather than artefacts of biological uncertainty or parametrisation, or simulation stochasticity. Statistical analyses reveal the influence that pathways and components have on simulation behaviour, offering valuable biological insight into aspects of the system under study. We demonstrate the power of spartan in providing critical insight into aspects of lymphoid tissue development in the small intestine through simulation. Spartan is released under a GPLv2 license, implemented within the open source R statistical environment, and freely available from both the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and http://www.cs.york.ac.uk/spartan. The techniques within the package can be applied to traditional ordinary or partial differential equation simulations as well as agent-based implementations. Manuals, comprehensive tutorials, and example simulation data upon which spartan can be applied are available from the website.

TI Mechanistic Foam Flow Simulation in Heterogeneous and Multidimensional
   Porous Media
SO SPE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Gases typically display large flow mobilities in porous media relative to oil or water, thereby impairing their effectiveness as displacing fluids. Foamed gas, though, is a promising agent for achieving mobility control in porous media. Because reservoir-scale simulation is a vital component of the engineering and economic evaluation of any enhanced oil recovery (EOR) or aquifer remediation project, efficient application of foam as a displacement fluid requires a predictive numerical model. Unfortunately, no such model is currently available for foam injection in the field where flow is multidimensional and the porous medium is heterogeneous.
   We have incorporated a conservation equation for the number density of foam bubbles into a fully implicit, three-dimensional, compositional, and thermal reservoir simulator and created a fully functional, mechanistic foam simulator. Because foam mobility is a strong function of bubble texture, the bubble population balance is necessary to make accurate predictions of foam-flow behavior. Foam generation and destruction are included through rate expressions that depend on saturations and surfactant concentration. Gas relative permeability and effective viscosity are modified according to the texture of foam bubbles. In this paper, we explore foam flow in radial, layered, and heterogeneous porous media. Simulations in radial geometries indicate that foam can be formed deep within rock formations, but that the rate of propagation is slow. Foam proves effective in controlling gas mobility in layered porous media. Significant flow diversion and sweep improvement by foam are predicted, regardless of whether the layers are communicating or isolated.

ID DISEASES
AB In this paper an old model for the temporal and spatial evolution of orofecal transmitted disease is reexamined. It consists of a system of two coupled reaction-diffusion equations for the concentration of bacteria and infective humans, under the assumptions that the total population of humans is unaffected by the disease and only a small proportion of the population is affected at any one time. The force of infection on healthy humans is assumed to be a sigmoidal function of bacterial concentration tending to some finite limit, and with zero gradient at zero. (This last feature models an immune response to low concentrations of the infectious agent.) In practice the diffusion coefficient for infective humans is much smaller than that of bacteria and is therefore set to zero; a detailed analysis of the steady-state bifurcation pattern is then performed for the case of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions applied at the endpoints of a one-dimensional interval. Particular attention is paid to the limiting case of small bacterial diffusivity.
   A partial analysis of the dynamical behavior of the system, based on monotone techniques, is carried out. It is speculated that the system, subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, has saddle point structure in the natural function space of the problem, similar to the ODE case in which the diffusivity of bacteria is also set to zero. This conjecture is supported by some numerical simulation on both one- and two-dimensional space domains.

AB The behaviors of heterogeneous reactions during pulverized coal MILD combustion was quite different from that during conventional mode, which made an unclear effect on char burnout and NOx emissions. The present works aimed to numerically study the behaviors of pulverized coal combustion under different injection conditions, i.e., velocity and temperature. Results showed that, compared with preheating temperature, the effects of jet velocity on char combustion behaviors were more significant. As the jet velocity increased, the region of char burnout shrank and overall average burnout rate weakened, also the share of char consumed by O-2 gradually raised up and by gasified agents fell down. For all cases, char reacting with H2O and CO2 accounted for > 28%, and the peak values of Da(t) were below 0.65. The ranges of Da,(O2), Da,(CO2) and Da,(H2O) were 0.5-1.0, 0.002-0.012 and 0.0004-0.003 implying the diffusion/kinetics-controlled for char-O-2 reaction while diffusion-controlled for char-CO2 and char-H2O. The location of the inflection points that the kinetics effect shifted to diffusion effect moved toward upstream with the velocity and temperature increasing. Further low NOx emissions could be realized by enhancing gasification reaction that were depended on the operational conditions.

AB Schizophrenia is a complex disorder of thinking and behaviour (0.3-0.7% of the population is affected). The over-expression of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) enzyme may be a potential target for schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. Because 3D QSAR analysis is one of the most frequently used modelling techniques, in the present study, five different 3D QSAR tools, namely CoMFA, CoMSIA, kNN-MFA, Open3DQSAR and topomer CoMFA methods, were used on a dataset of pyrimidine-based PDE10A inhibitors. All developed models were validated internally and externally. The non-commercial Open3DQSAR produced the best statistical results amongst 3D QSAR tools. The structural interpretations obtained from different methods were thoroughly analysed and were justified on the basis of information obtained from the crystal structure. Information from one method was mostly validated by the results of other methods and vice versa. In the current work, the use of multiple tools in the same analysis revealed more complete information about the structural requirements of these compounds. On the basis of the observations of the 3D QSAR studies, 12 new compounds were designed for better PDE10A inhibitory activity. The current investigation may help in further designing new PDE10A inhibitors with promising activity.

AB Deep mixing and jet grouting with cement hardening agent are widely used techniques for soft ground stabilization. In a soil-cement column, however, the unconfined compressive strength is generally of significant heterogeneity. In this study, the heterogeneity is considered as two components: a deterministic mean trend and a zero-mean random field. Finite element analysis is used to model a soil-cement column subjected to axial compression, and spatially random values of strength parameters are assigned at the integration points to simulate this heterogeneity. The results of the analysis show that the overall strength of a soil-cement column is proportional to the volume-averaged unconfined compressive strength of the column. It is also observed that the volume-averaged unconfined compressive strength can be successfully predicted by the unconfined compressive strength at the distance of two-thirds of the radius within a soil-cement column. This prediction can mitigate the difficulty in determining the deterministic mean trend. On the other hand, the relationship between the statistical characteristics (e.g. average and variance) of the overall strength and those of the unconfined compressive strength is examined, whereby a simple procedure is proposed to estimate the former from the latter. This procedure is exemplified in the estimation of the specific strength of a cement-treated soil. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The study reported in this paper. explores the potential of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) metaheuristic for stacking sequence optimization of composite laminates. ACO is a recently proposed population-based search approach able to deal with a wide range of optimization problems, especially of a combinatorial nature, and inspired by the natural foraging behavior of ant colonies. ACO search processes, in which the activities of real ants are simulated by means of artificial agents that communicate and cooperate through the modification of the local environment, were implemented in a specifically developed numerical algorithm aimed at the lay-up optimization (based on a strain energy criterion) of laminated plates subject to in-plane and out-of-plane loads. Numerical analyses were conducted to investigate the quality and reliability of the metaheuristic search procedure under various load cases, geometry configurations and constraint conditions. The analyses indicated that the proposed ACO algorithm is able to achieve reasonably good solutions within very few iterations, and extremely high-quality solutions within a limited number of runs, with respect to the total number of possible solutions, for both uncostrained and constrained optimization lay-up problems. The results obtained during the investigation point out the robustness and effectiveness of the procedure and suggest the use of ACO-based search techniques as practical design tools for laminate lay-up configuration.

AB The cohesive zone of the blast furnace is one of the most important zones because it deeply relates to the furnace stability and efficiency. It is considered that the thickness of the cohesive zone increases with decreasing the reducing agent rate and increasing the usage of the low grade raw materials in future. The thickness of the cohesive zone should be decreased or permeability of the cohesive zone should be improved to keep the furnace stability and production efficiency. Heat transfer in the cohesive zone is a quite important issue to control the cohesive zone because it determines the temperature rise of this zone namely softening and melting rate of the burden materials. In this study, a mathematical simulation model for the fluid flow and heat transfer in the packed bed of the deforming particles was developed. This model combined the discrete element method for bed deformation and the computational fluid dynamics for the gas flow, Additionally, the inter-particle heat exchange in the deforming packed bed was newly formulated and linked with the discrete element analysis. This mathematical model successfully revealed the variation of the heat transfer mechanism with the deformation of the packed bed. The simulation results could give the useful information for designing the burden distribution under the low carbon and high low-grade material operation of the blast furnace.

AB Simple surfactants have proven to be some of the most effective agents to mitigate the deposition of asphaltenes on pipeline walls; however, the best practices for their application are often empirical, and the actual mechanisms of their action remain elusive. Here, inhibition of asphaltene adsorption as viscoelastic films on carbon steel by a surfactant, dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), was directly monitored using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation. Different protocols for application of the inhibitor were assessed, including treatment of the clean surface before adhesion and application by premixing and postprecipitation. Asphaltenes were found to form a tightly bound viscoelastic layer on the carbon steel surface, and administering DBSA on preadsorbed asphaltenes removes most (86.5%) of this adsorbate. Premixing of DBSA and asphaltenes to simulate the commonly used application method results in a very short contact time (similar to 35 s) before most of asphaltenes (86.0%) are desorbed from the surface. Pretreatment of the metal surface with DBSA was found to be particularly effective, and it results in nearly complete (98.5%) removal. The efficacy of DBSA in organic scale removal, mainly asphaltenes, over prolonged time by repeated treatment was also investigated. The results indicate that alternating application of toluene and DBSA is the most effective protocol that prevents the loosely bound toluene-soluble fraction of asphaltenes to act as a nucleation layer that triggers the onset of growth of the asphaltene layers.

AB Cooperation is one of the socio-economic issues that has received more attention from the physics community. The problem has been mostly considered by studying games such as the Prisoner's Dilemma or the Public Goods Game. Here, we take a step forward by studying cooperation in the context of crowd computing. We introduce a model loosely based on Principal-agent theory in which people (workers) contribute to the solution of a distributed problem by computing answers and reporting to the problem proposer (master). To go beyond classical approaches involving the concept of Nash equilibrium, we work on an evolutionary framework in which both the master and the workers update their behavior through reinforcement learning. Using a Markov chain approach, we show theoretically that under certain----not very restrictive-conditions, the master can ensure the reliability of the answer resulting of the process. Then, we study the model by numerical simulations, finding that convergence, meaning that the system reaches a point in which it always produces reliable answers, may in general be much faster than the upper bounds given by the theoretical calculation. We also discuss the effects of the master's level of tolerance to defectors, about which the theory does not provide information. The discussion shows that the system works even with very large tolerances. We conclude with a discussion of our results and possible directions to carry this research further.

AB The beta-phenylethylamines are known to act as ligands for the trace amine receptors, a novel family of G-protein-coupled receptors. The trace amines are stored and released along with various neurotransmitter agents such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine and thus work as neuromodulator or neurotransmitter agents. Trace amines are known to play an important role in the pathophysiology of major depression. In our earlier study, we have demonstrated the synthesis of various beta-substituted phenylethylamine molecules hypothesized to be effective in various central nervous system disorders. The present study is an attempt to evaluate one of such molecules, 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol, in animal models of depression. Various behavioral paradigms of despair such as forced swim and tail-suspension tests were used to assess the antidepressant-like activity. Further, an alteration in the levels of various neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) in the mouse brain following 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol administration was evaluated. The molecule (4-16 mg/kg., i.p.) dose-dependently inhibited the immobility period in mouse forced swim test, the effect comparable to venlafaxine. The ED50 values of 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol and venlafaxine in mouse forced swim test were found to be 5.27 [4.38-6.35] mg/kg., i.p and 4.66 [3.48-6.25] mg/kg., i.p., respectively. Further, 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol at 4-16 mg/kg., i.p. reversed the immobility period in mouse tail-suspension test. Additionally, the molecule at 8 mg/kg., i.p. reversed reserpine-induced behavioral despair in mouse forced swim test. When administered simultaneously, it (4 and 8 mg/kg., i.p) enhanced the antidepressant activity of sub-effective doses of imipramine (2 mg/kg., i.p.) or fluoxetine (2 mg/kg., i.p.) in the mouse forced swim test. Neurochemical analysis revealed that the molecule at 8 mg/kg., i.p. increased the levels of norepinephrine (21% increase) without affecting serotonin in the mouse brain. However, at higher dose (16 mg/kg., i.p.), it increased the levels of norepinephrine (13% increase), serotonin (37% increase), and dopamine (42% increase). The molecule enhanced the locomotor activity in mice only at higher doses. The molecule, unlike venlafaxine, which potentiated barbiturate-induced hypnosis, was devoid of any sedative activity. In conclusion, 1-(7-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-isoquinolin-4-yl)-cyclohexanol, possess antidepressant-like activity in animal models of depression by modulating the neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Such an activity might be due to the modulating action of this novel molecule on trace amine receptors. Such a molecule may be the future drugs of choice for the treatment of major depression.

AB This work consists of an epidemic model with vaccination coupled with an opinion dynamics. Our objective was to study how disease risk perception can influence opinions about vaccination and therefore the spreading of the disease. Differently from previous works we have considered continuous opinions. The epidemic spreading is governed by an SIS-like model with an extra vaccinated state. In our model individuals vaccinate with a probability proportional to their opinions. The opinions change due to peer influence in pairwise interactions. The epidemic feedback to the opinion dynamics acts as an external field increasing the vaccination probability. We performed Monte Carlo simulations in fully-connected populations. Interestingly we observed the emergence of a first-order phase transition, besides the usual active-absorbing phase transition presented in the SIS model. Our simulations also show that with a certain combination of parameters, an increment in the initial fraction of the population that is pro-vaccine has a twofold effect: it can lead to smaller epidemic outbreaks in the short term, but it also contributes to the survival of the chain of infections in the long term. Our results also suggest that it is possible that more effective vaccines can decrease the long-term vaccine coverage. This is a counterintuitive outcome, but it is in line with empirical observations that vaccines can become a victim of their own success.

AB Noon stomatal conductance of lethal-yellowing (LY) affected coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L. Atlantic Tall ecotype) decreased progressively as the disease developed. In the early stages of the disease and before leaf yellowing started, stomatal conductance decreased to a minimum in leaves at both the top, the middle and the base of the crown. Since altered stomatal behaviour might affect gas exchange and related processes in the plant, such as water movement and photosynthesis, these results support the hypothesis that LY-induced stomatal closure is central to the development of LY symptoms in coconut palms, and therefore to the mode of pathogenicity of the LY mycoplasma-like organism. Leaf yellowing occurred simultaneously with a decrease in photosynthetic rates and a decrease in protein, chlorophyll and carotenoid contents. Based on these biochemical changes a second hypothesis is proposed, that LY-associated leaf yellowing is part of a leaf senescence process. The concentration of abscisic acid in the leaves and the capacity of leaf tissue to form ethylene increased in diseased palms, suggesting that a hormonal imbalance occurs in LY-affected palms. Furthermore, treatment of symptomless palms with an ethylene-releasing agent (ethephon) resulted in symptoms that mimicked some of the LY symptoms. A third hypothesis is therefore proposed, that a hormonal imbalance might be related to LY symptom development, at least with respect to nutfall and leaf senescence.

AB Water reuse is currently considered an innovative way to addressing water shortage that can provide significant economic, social and environmental benefits, particularly-but not exclusively- in water deficient areas. The potential transmission of infectious diseases is the most common concern in relation to water reclamation. Cryptosporidium is an important genus of protozoan enteropathogens that infect a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including humans. The infective form (oocyst) is highly resistant to the environmental conditions and disinfection treatments. Consequently, Cryptosporidiwn is the most common etiological agent identified in waterborne outbreaks attributed to parasitic protozoa worldwide. The present study evaluates the efficacy of ultrasound disinfection, at three power levels (60, 80 and 100 W), pulsed at 50% or in continuous mode, for inactivating the waterborne protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum in simulated and real effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs). Overall interpretation of the results shows that the application of ultrasound irradiation at 80 W power in continuous mode for an exposure time of 10 min drastically reduced the viability of C. parvum. Thus, oocyst viabilities of 4.16 +/- 1.93%; 1.29 +/- 0.86%; 3.16 +/- 0.69%; and 3.15 +/- 0.87% were obtained in distilled water, simulated, real and filtered MWTP effluents, respectively (vs 98.57 +/- 0.01%, initial oocyst viability), as determined using inclusion/exclusion of the fluorogenic vital dye propidium iodide, an indicator of the integrity of the oocyst wall. Independently of the mode used (pulsed/continuous) and at 80 W power, higher level of oocyst inactivation was detected in MWTP effluents than in distilled water used as a control solution, may be due to the differences in the chemical composition of the samples. Comparison of the results obtained in both modes showed that use of the continuous mode yielded significantly lower oocyst viability. However, when the Dose parameter was considered (energy per volume unit), no statistically significant differences in oocyst viability were observed in relation to the type of mode used. The results demonstrate that ultrasound technology represents a promising alternative to the disinfection methods (ultraviolet irradiation and chlorine products) currently used in water reclamation as it drastically reduces the survival of Cryptosporidiwn oocysts, without changing the chemical composition of the water or producing toxic by-products.

AB Background
   Various methods of conscious sedation and analgesia have been used for pain relief during oocyte recovery in in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) procedures. The choice of agent has also been influenced by the quality of sedation and analgesia as well as by concerns about possible detrimental effects on reproductive outcomes.
   Objectives
   To assess the effectiveness and safety of different methods of conscious sedation and analgesia on pain relief and pregnancy outcomes in women undergoing transvaginal oocyte retrieval.
   Search methods
   We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL (from their inception to present); the National Research Register and Current Controlled Trials. We searched reference lists of included studies for relevant studies and contacted authors for information on unpublished and ongoing trials. There was no language restriction. The search was updated in July 2012.
   Selection criteria
   Only randomised controlled trials comparing different methods of conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during oocyte recovery were included.
   Data collection and analysis
   Quality assessment and data extraction were performed independently by two review authors. Interventions were classified and analysed under broad categories or strategies of sedation and pain relief to compare different methods and administrative protocols of conscious sedation and analgesia. Outcomes were extracted and the data were pooled when appropriate.
   Main results
   With this update, nine new studies were identified resulting in a total of 21 trials including 2974 women undergoing oocyte retrieval. These trials compared five different categories of conscious sedation and analgesia: 1) conscious sedation and analgesia versus placebo; 2) conscious sedation and analgesia versus other active interventions such as general and acupuncture anaesthesia; 3) conscious sedation and analgesia plus paracervical block versus other active interventions such as general, spinal and acupuncture anaesthesia; 4) patient-controlled conscious sedation and analgesia versus physician-administered conscious sedation and analgesia; and 5) conscious sedation and analgesia with different agents or dosage. Evidence was generally of low quality, mainly due to poor reporting of methods, small sample sizes and inconsistency between the trials.
   Conflicting results were shown for women's experience of pain. Compared to conscious sedation alone, more effective pain relief was reported when conscious sedation was combined with electro-acupuncture: intra-operative pain mean difference (MD) on 1 to 10 visual analogue scale (VAS) of 3.00 (95% CI 2.23 to 3.77); post-operative pain MD in VAS units of 2.10 (95% CI 1.40 to 2.80; N = 61, one trial, low quality evidence); or paracervical block (MD not calculable).
   The pooled data of four trials showed a significantly lower intra-operative pain score with conscious sedation plus paracervical block than with electro-acupuncture plus paracervical block (MD on 10-point VAS of -0.66; 95% CI -0.93 to -0.39; N = 781, 4 trials, low quality evidence) with significant statistical heterogeneity (I-2 = 76%). Patient-controlled sedation and analgesia was associated with more intra-operative pain than physician-administered sedation and analgesia (MD on 10-point VAS of 0.60; 95% CI 0.16 to 1.03; N = 379, 4 trials, low quality evidence) with high statistical heterogeneity (I-2 = 83%). Post-operative pain was reported in only nine studies. As different types and dosages of sedative and analgesic agents, as well as administrative protocols and assessment tools, were used in these trials the data should be interpreted with caution.
   There was no evidence of a significant difference in pregnancy rate in the 12 studies which assessed this outcome, and pooled data of four trials comparing electro-acupuncture combined with paracervical block with conscious sedation and analgesia plus paracervical block showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.29; N = 783, 4 trials) for pregnancy. High levels of women's satisfaction were reported for all modalities of conscious sedation and analgesia as assessed in 12 studies. Meta-analysis of all the studies was not attempted due to considerable heterogeneity.
   For the rest of the trials a descriptive summary of the outcomes was presented.
   Authors' conclusions
   The evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. The simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. The various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. As women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.

AB Background: In the era of escalating antimicrobial resistance, the choice of effective empiric antimicrobial therapy has become considerably more difficult. In an attempt to improve antimicrobial selection, pharmacodynamic modeling that considers the drug, dose, dosing interval, and duration of infusion is increasingly used as a tool to assist in the clinical decision-making process.
   Objective: The aim of the PASSPORT (Probability of target attainment of Antibacterial agents Studied for Susceptibility and Pharmacodynamic Optimization in Regional Trials) study was to compare the probabilities of achieving requisite pharmacodynamic exposure (eg, T>MIC, AUC/MIC) of common intravenous antibiotics against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
   Methods: Using a 5000-patient Monte Carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted for standard and high-dose, prolonged (ie, 3- to 4-hour) infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam in adult patients with normal renal function (>= 50 mL/min). MIC data were incorporated from the 2008 TRUST (Tracking Resistance in the United States Today)-12 surveillance program, a long-running resistance study in 56 participating US hospitals. The cumulative fraction of response (CFR) was determined for each regimen against each population of E coli, K pneumoniae, A baumannii, and P aeruginosa. Optimal CFR was defined a priori as 90%.
   Results: All of the B-lactam regimens had optimal CFRs against E coli, and all but piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g q6h had optimal CFRs against K pneumoniae. The fluoroquinolones had the lowest CFRs against all of the pathogen populations tested (73.2%-88.9% against E coli and K pneumoniae; 44.5%-61.9% against A baumannii and P aeruginosa). Optimal CFR against A baumannii was not achieved with any of the regimens. Against P aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged-infusion doripenem and meropenem had CFRs of 97.2% to 98.8%, followed by high-dose, prolonged-infusion ceftazidime (93.3%) and cefepime (93.2%). High-dose, prolonged-infusion regimens were associated with increased CFRs for all beta-lactams by similar to 10% over that of standard 0.5-hour infusion regimens against the nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli.
   Conclusions: Based on this model, standard doses of most intravenous B-lactam regimens had high probabilities of achieving optimal exposure against Enterobacteriaceae. For nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli such as A baumannii and P aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, doripenem, and meropenem had the highest probabilities of achieving bactericidal exposure.

AB Individual-based models (IBMs) can simulate the actions of individual animals as they interact with one another and the landscape in which they live. When used in spatially-explicit landscapes IBMs can show how populations change over time in response to management actions. For instance, IBMs are being used to design strategies of conservation and of the exploitation of fisheries, and for assessing the effects on populations of major construction projects and of novel agricultural chemicals. In such real world contexts, it becomes especially important to build IBMs in a principled fashion, and to approach calibration and evaluation systematically. We argue that insights from physiological and behavioural ecology offer a recipe for building realistic models, and that Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a promising technique for the calibration and evaluation of IBMs.
   IBMs are constructed primarily from knowledge about individuals. In ecological applications the relevant knowledge is found in physiological and behavioural ecology, and we approach these from an evolutionary perspective by taking into account how physiological and behavioural processes contribute to life histories, and how those life histories evolve. Evolutionary life history theory shows that, other things being equal, organisms should grow to sexual maturity as fast as possible, and then reproduce as fast as possible, while minimising per capita death rate. Physiological and behavioural ecology are largely built on these principles together with the laws of conservation of matter and energy. To complete construction of an IBM information is also needed on the effects of competitors, conspecifics and food scarcity; the maximum rates of ingestion, growth and reproduction, and life-history parameters.
   Using this knowledge about physiological and behavioural processes provides a principled way to build IBMs, but model parameters vary between species and are often difficult to measure. A common solution is to manually compare model outputs with observations from real landscapes and so to obtain parameters which produce acceptable fits of model to data. However, this procedure can be convoluted and lead to over-calibrated and thus inflexible models. Many formal statistical techniques are unsuitable for use with IBMs, but we argue that ABC offers a potential way forward. It can be used to calibrate and compare complex stochastic models and to assess the uncertainty in their predictions. We describe methods used to implement ABC in an accessible way and illustrate them with examples and discussion of recent studies. Although much progress has been made, theoretical issues remain, and some of these are outlined and discussed. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS
AB There is broad recognition within the pharmaceutical industry that the drug development process, especially the clinical part of it, needs considerable improvement to cope with rapid changes in research and health care environments. Modelling and simulation are mathematically founded techniques that have been used extensively and for a long time in other areas than the pharmaceutical industry (e.g. automobile, aerospace) to design and develop products more efficiently. Both modelling and simulation rely on the use of (mathematical and statistical) models which are essentially simplified descriptions of complex systems under investigation. It has been proposed to integrate pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) principles into drug development to make it more rational and efficient. There is evidence from a survey on 18 development projects that a PK/PD guided approach can contribute to streamline the drug development process. This approach extensively relies on PK/PD models describing the relationships among dose, concentration land more generally exposure), and responses such as surrogate markers, efficacy measures, adverse events. Well documented empirical and physiologically based PK/PD models are becoming available more and more, and there are ongoing efforts to integrate models for disease progression and patient behavior (e.g. compliance) as well.
   Other types of models which are becoming increasingly important are population PK/PD models which, in addition to the characterization of PK and PD, involve relationships between covariates (i.e. patient characteristics such as age, body weight) and PK/PD parameters. Population models allow to assess and to quantify potential sources of variability in exposure and response in the target population, even under sparse sampling conditions. As will be shown for an anticancer agent, implications of significant covariate effects can be evaluated by computer simulations using the population PK/PD model.
   Stochastic simulation is widely used as a tool for evaluation of statistical methodology including for example the evaluation of performance of measures for bioequivalence assessment. Recently, it was suggested to expand the use of simulations in support of clinical drug development for predicting outcomes of planned trials. The methodological basis for this approach is provided by (population) PK/PD models together with random sampling techniques. Models for disease progression and behavioral features like compliance, drop-out rates, adverse event dependent dose reductions, etc. have to be added to population PK/PD models in order to mimic the real situation. It will be shown that computer simulation helps to evaluate consequences of design features on safety and efficacy assessment of the drug, enabling identification of statistically valid and practically realisable study designs. For both modelling and simulation a guidance on 'best practices' is currently worked out by a panel of experts comprising representatives from academia, regulatory bodies and industry, thereby providing a necessary condition that model-based analysis and simulation will further contribute to streamlining pharmaceutical drug development processes.

AB Animals or human subjects receiving brain stimulation in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (dPAG) show sudden fear-suggestive behavioral reactions and physical signs of autonomic activation which are reminiscent of the symptom profile characterizing a panic attack. An experimental situation in rats measuring dPAG stimulation self-interruption thresholds has been validated as realistically simulating several aspects of panic anxiety with objective signs of symptomatic and predictive validity using established antipanic and panicogenic agents; it was utilized here to evaluate the effects of various cholecystokinin B receptor ligands. A dose-dependent increase in self-interruption thresholds (antipanic-like effect) was recorded following injection of L-365,260 (3.2, 10 and 32 mg/kg i.p.), a CCKB receptor antagonist with good brain penetration, whereas no significant changes in thresholds were recorded following CI-988 (3.2, 10 and 32 mg/kg i.p.), a dipeptoid CCKB receptor antagonist with poor brain penetration. Latencies for self-interruption were not modified, suggesting that motor functions remained intact. No significant changes in self-interruption thresholds were recorded following peripheral administration of the CCKB receptor agonists CCK4 (0.03 to 0.32 mg/kg i.v.; 0.01 to 3.2 mg/kg i.p.) or the metabolically stabilized analog Boc-CCK4 (0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.p.). Systemic administration of the panicogenic compounds caffeine and yohimbine enhance acute anxiety in this model. These data indicate that, in the dPAG simulation of panic anxiety, central CCKB receptor blockade by L-365,260 induces antiaversive effects analogous to those observed following benzodiazepine receptor activation by clonazepam or alprazolam. Potency and efficacy of L-365,260 were lower than those of clonazepam or alprazolam, suggesting modest, but nonetheless authentic, antiaversive properties for this CCKB receptor antagonist. Lack of effects observed following peripheral administration of the agonists CCK4 and Boc-CCK4 or of the dipeptoid antagonist CI-988 is likely to reflect restricted brain penetration of those compounds in rats; it furthermore excludes a contribution of peripheral gastrin and CCKA receptors to the antipanic-like properties of selective CCKB receptor antagonists such as L-365,260.

AB Potassium-rich lavas with K/Na of > 2 are common in orogenic and anorogenic intraplate magmatic provinces. However, in the primitive mantle, the concentration of Na exceeds that of K by 10 times. The source of K-rich lavas thus needs to be either K-enriched or Na-depleted to account for high K/Na ratios. The geochemical and isotopic compositions of high Sr-87/Sr-86 post-collisional lavas show that their mantle source contains a recycled crustal component. These highly K-enriched lavas with crustal like trace element patterns are termed "orogenic lamproites" and are compositionally distinct from K-rich "anorogenic lamproites" that show lower Sr-87/Sr-86 and a trace element pattern that resembles that of primary mantle melts. For both groups the processes of K-enrichment within their source are uncertain and are thought to be linked to melts of sedimentary rocks for "orogenic lamproites" and low-degree melts of ultramafic mantle rocks for "anorogenic lamproites". In both cases, metasomatism of the mantle lithosphere is the precursor to K-rich magmatism. In this study we experimentally determine the effects of mantle metasomatism by sediment- and hydrous mantle melts. The experiments simulate the interaction of refractory lithospheric mantle and metasomatizing melt in a 2-layer reaction experiment. The sediment/dunite reaction experiments lead to formation of a strongly K-enriched phlogopite pyroxenite layer sandwiched between the two starting materials. The low temperature of the sediment/dunite reaction runs at < 1000 degrees C simulates a fore-arc subduction environment, in which the melts of sediment are consumed during interaction with dunite as the temperature is below the solidus of the produced phlogopite pyroxenites. The hydrous mantle melt/dunite reaction run is simulated by reacting a hydrated basanite with dunite. Since the temperature of the reaction is higher than the solidus of the resulting phlogopite-pyroxenites (1200 degrees C), the hydrous melt is not consumed but flows further, increasing in K2O and K/Na as it reacts with the refractory peridotite. In both cases, melts are enriched in K and K/Na increases by crystallizing a low K and low K/Na eclogitic residue. Compositions of glass and phlogopite from both types of reactions are comparable to glasses and phlogopites found within post-collisional lavas. Since the enrichment of K within the reaction zone is strongly controlled by the formation of low K/Na and low-K residues, metasomatic enrichment of the mantle lithosphere in K does not need a highly K-enriched metasomatic agent.

AB In this study, a 100 m(2)steel tank was used to simulate transformer oil fires, with an aim of investigating the burning characteristics of a large-scale pool fire. To recover a real thermal state of transformer oil in operation, a heating system was employed to raise the initial fuel temperature. In total, three fire-extinguishing tests were performed using two delivery methods, i.e., a hand-held fire water branch (FWB) and fire water monitor (FWM) to understand their performance in fighting large-scale pool fires. The extinguishing activities using the FWB method were conducted by four trained firefighters, and the FWM was operated by a trained firefighter. Also, a sequence of bench-scale tests was conducted to investigate the impact of initial fuel temperature on the mass burning rate of transformer oil pool fires. This part is a supplement to the large-scale tests. The results demonstrated that the temperatures adjacent to the tank border were reduced as the vertical height increased. The growth rate of the flame height was enhanced in the development stage when the initial fuel temperature was pre-heated to a higher value. Meanwhile, it was found that the burning rate of transformer oil pool fire occurred a slight increase with the initial fuel temperature was grown according to the bench-scale data, while the impact of initial temperature was limited within the tested temperature range. In addition, it was shown that the FWB and FWM were both effective for fighting a large-scale transformer oil pool fire. However, their efficiency was influenced significantly by the concentration of the extinguishing agents and the application density of delivery. In contrast, the FWM might be a good choice when considering the safety of firefighters, because its delivery range is greater and extinguishing time is shorter as compared to the FWB. Here, it shall be noted that the FWM has also its flipsides. Sometimes, the application of a single FWM is not well to extinguish the corner fire or other fire types, in such cases, the FWM strategy should be to use two or more fire trucks in order to cover the whole accident pool.

AB Mexiletine (Mex) has been recently appointed as an orphan-drug in myotonic-syndromes, being a potent use-dependent blocker of skeletal-muscle sodium channels (Na(V)1.4). Available evidences about a potential anti-oxidant effect of Mex and its tetramethyl-pyrroline-derivatives in vivo, suggest the possibility to further enlarge the therapeutic potential of Mex-like compounds in myopathies in which alteration of excitation-contraction coupling is paralleled by oxidative stress. In line with this and based on our previous structure-activity-relationship studies, we synthesized new compounds with a tetramethyl-pyrroline-ring on the amino-group of both Mex (VM11) and of its potent use-dependent isopropyl-derivative (CI16). The compounds were tested for their ability to block native NaV1.4 and to exert cyto-protective effects against oxidative-stress injury in myoblasts. Voltage-clamp-recordings on adult myofibers were performed to assess the tonic and use-dependent block of peak sodium-currents (I-Na) by VM11 and CI16, as well as Mex, VM11 and CI16 were 3 and 6-fold more potent than Mex in producing a tonic-block of peak sodium-currents (I-Na), respectively. Interestingly, CI16 showed a 40-fold increase of potency with respect to Mex during high-frequency stimulation (10-Hz), resulting the strongest use-dependent Mex-like compound so far. The derivatives also behaved as inactivated channel blockers, however the voltage dependent block was modest. The experimental data fitted with the molecular-modeling simulation based on previously proposed interaction of main pharmacophores with Na(V)1.4 binding-site. CI16 and VM11 were then compared to Mex and its isopropyl derivative (Me5) for the ability to protect C2C12-cells from H2O2-cytotoxicity in the concentration range effective on Nav1.4. Mex and Me5 showed a moderate cyto-protective effect in the presence of H2O2, Importantly, CI16 and VM11 showed a remarkable cyto-protection at concentrations effective for use-dependent block of Na(V)1.4. This effect was comparable to that of selected anti-oxidant drugs proved to exert protective effect in preclinical models of progressive myopathies such as muscular dystrophies. Then, the tetramethyl-pyrroline compounds have increased therapeutic profile as sodium channel blockers and an interesting cyto-protective activity. The overall profile enlarges therapeutic potential from channelopathies to myopathies in which alteration of excitation-contraction coupling is paralleled by oxidative-stress, i.e., muscular dystrophies.

AB For mobile robots navigating on sidewalks, the ability to safely cross street intersections is essential. Most existing approaches rely on the recognition of the traffic light signal to make an informed crossing decision. Although these approaches have been crucial enablers for urban navigation, the capabilities of robots employing such approaches are still limited to navigating only on streets that contain signalized intersections. In this article, we address this challenge and propose a multimodal convolutional neural network framework to predict the safety of a street intersection for crossing. Our architecture consists of two subnetworks: an interaction-aware trajectory estimation stream (interaction-aware temporal convolutional neural network (IA-TCNN)), that predicts the future states of all observed traffic participants in the scene; and a traffic light recognition stream AtteNet. Our IA-TCNN utilizes dilated causal convolutions to model the behavior of all the observable dynamic agents in the scene without explicitly assigning priorities to the interactions among them, whereas AtteNet utilizes squeeze-excitation blocks to learn a content-aware mechanism for selecting the relevant features from the data, thereby improving the noise robustness. Learned representations from the traffic light recognition stream are fused with the estimated trajectories from the motion prediction stream to learn the crossing decision. Incorporating the uncertainty information from both modules enables our architecture to learn a likelihood function that is robust to noise and mispredictions from either subnetworks. Simultaneously, by learning to estimate motion trajectories of the surrounding traffic participants and incorporating knowledge of the traffic light signal, our network learns a robust crossing procedure that is invariant to the type of street intersection. Furthermore, we extend our previously introduced Freiburg Street Crossing dataset with sequences captured at multiple intersections of varying types, demonstrating complex interactions among the traffic participants as well as various lighting and weather conditions. We perform comprehensive experimental evaluations on public datasets as well as our Freiburg Street Crossing dataset, which demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance for each of the subtasks, as well as for the crossing safety prediction. Moreover, we deploy the proposed architectural framework on a robotic platform and conduct real-world experiments that demonstrate the suitability of the approach for real-time deployment and robustness to various environments.

   for plant conservation

DE Habitat fragmentation; Barrier; Connectivity; Plant dispersal; Semi-open
   corridor; Habitat management
AB Habitat fragmentation and isolation are considered important causes of biodiversity loss in cultural landscapes. To counter the negative effects of fragmentation such as reduced connectivity and increased risks of population extinction due to stochastic processes and genetic erosion, it has been proposed to establish linear ecological corridors to facilitate dispersal between isolated habitat patches. We summarise the current knowledge on the potential benefits and limitations of corridors for reducing the negative effects of habitat fragmentation on plant populations. We address the opportunities and problems that are associated with linear corridors and advocate the use of semi-open corridors as an alternative that might overcome some shortcomings of conventional corridors for plants. Observational and experimental studies have found that various types of linear corridors can increase plant dispersal. Other linear structures such as paths, roads, railways and streams may also function to a certain extent as corridors, although mostly for widespread species. Because plants are highly dependent on external agents such as animals or wind to reach new habitats, the effectivity of corridors is strongly influenced by their structural features and suitability for animal dispersers. However, many plant species can only use corridors for long-distance dispersal if they can also use them as stepping stone habitats where they can establish, grow, reproduce and then disperse further. This dispersal critically depends on suitable light conditions and disturbance regimes, and on a sufficient width of a corridor to reduce edge effects. Thus, hedgerows appear to be suitable corridors for some forest species but are too narrow for forest specialists from the interior of woodlands. Corridors do not only have positive effects but may also facilitate the spread of invasive species. Moreover, a potentially underestimated negative effect of linear corridors is that they may actually create new dispersal barriers when they intersect other habitats. For example, linear woodland corridors that intersect grasslands may successfully connect patches of woodland but simultaneously form strong barriers for grassland species and increase the fragmentation of their populations. As an alternative to linear corridors, we recommend ?semi-open corridors? that simultaneously connect patches of both open habitats and woodlands and promote the dispersal of species of both types of habitat. This idea is based on the various types of semi-open landscapes in Europe that have been formed by grazing with livestock, resulting in a mosaic of open habitats, groups of trees or shrubs and small woodland patches, and are characterised by a high diversity of environmental conditions on a small scale. Wide corridors of such semi-open habitats may avoid the strong edge and barrier effects associated with linear corridors and provide suitable stepping stone habitats for species with different habitat requirements.

AB Introduction: Despite considerable research efforts, the process of metastasis formation is still a subject of intense discussion, and even established models differ considerably in basic details and in the conclusions drawn from them. Mathematical and computational models add a new perspective to the research as they can quantitatively investigate the processes of metastasis and the effects of treatment. However, existing models look at only one treatment option at a time.
   Methods: We enhanced a previously developed computer model (called CaTSiT) that enables quantitative comparison of different metastasis formation models with clinical and experimental data, to include the effects of chemotherapy, external beam radiation, radioimmunotherapy and radioembolization. CaTSiT is based on a discrete event simulation procedure. The growth of the primary tumor and its metastases is modeled by a piecewise-defined growth function that describes the growth behavior of the primary tumor and metastases during various time intervals. The piecewise-defined growth function is composed of analytical functions describing the growth behavior of the tumor based on characteristics of the tumor, such as dormancy, or the effects of various therapies. The spreading of malignant cells into the blood is modeled by intravasation events, which are generated according to a rate function. Further events in the model describe the behavior of the released malignant cells until the formation of a new metastasis. The model is published under the GNU General Public License version 3.
   Results: To demonstrate the application of the computer model, a case of a patient with a hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple metastases in the liver was simulated. Besides the untreated case, different treatments were simulated at two time points: one directly after diagnosis of the primary tumor and the other several months later. Except for early applied radioimmunotherapy, no treatment strategy was able to eliminate all metastases. These results emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and of proceeding with treatment even if no clinically detectable metastases are present at the time of diagnosis of the primary tumor.
   Conclusion: CaTSiT could be a valuable tool for quantitative investigation of the process of tumor growth and metastasis formation, including the effects of various treatment options. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Clay minerals are used in variety of applications ranging from composites to electronic devices. For their efficient use in such areas, understanding the effect of surface-active agents on interfacial properties is essential. We investigated the role of surface ions in the adsorption of water molecules by using a muscovite mica surface populated with two different, He and K+, surface ions. A series of grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMG) simulations at various relative vapor pressures (p/p(0)) were performed to obtain the water structure and adsorption isotherm on the He-exposed mica (H-mica) surface. The obtained results were compared to the recent simulation data of water adsorption on the Kt-exposed mica (K-mica) surface reported by Malani and Ayyappa (Malani, A.; Ayappa, K. G. J. Phys. Chem. B 2009, 113, 1058-1067). Water molecules formed two prominent layers adjacent to the H-mica surface, whereas molecular layering was observed adjacent to the K-mica surface. The adsorption isotherm of water on the K-mica surface was characterized by three stages that corresponded to rapid adsorption in the initial regime below p/p(0) = 0.1, followed by a linear development regime for p/p(0) = 0.1-0.7 and rapid film thickening for p/p(0) >= 0.7, whereas only latter two regimes were observed in the H-mica system. In addition, the film thickness of adsorbed water molecules for p/p(0) < 0.7 was lower as compared to that for the K-mica surface and comparable beyond. The film thickness obtained from the MC simulations was in excellent agreement with the interferometry experimental data of Balmer et al. (Balmer, T. E.; Christenson, H. K.; Spencer, N. D.; Heuberger, M. Langmuir 2008, 24, 1566-1569). It was observed that the hydration behaviors of the two ions were completely different and depended on the size of their hydration shell and their ability to form hydrogen bonds. The behavior of water adsorption between these two cases was illustrated using the water density distribution, orientational distributions, hydrogen bonding, and isosteric heats of adsorption.

AB The effect of accelerated weathering on poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and PHBV-based nanocomposites with rutile titanium (IV) dioxide (PHBV/TiO2) was investigated. The accelerated weathering test applied consecutive steps of UV irradiation (at 340 nm and 0.76 W m(-2)irradiance) and moisture at 50 degrees C following the ASTM D4329 standard for up to 2000 h of exposure time. The morphology, chemical structure, crystallization, as well as the mechanical and thermal properties were studied. Samples were characterized after 500, 1000, and 2000 h of exposure time. Different degradation mechanisms were proposed to occur during the weathering exposure and were confirmed based on the experimental data. The PHBV surface revealed cracks and increasing roughness with the increasing exposure time, whereas the PHBV/TiO(2)nanocomposites showed surface changes only after 2000 h of accelerated weathering. The degradation of neat PHBV under moisture and UV exposure occurred preferentially in the amorphous phase. In contrast, the presence of TiO(2)in the nanocomposites retarded this process, but the degradation would occur simultaneously in both the amorphous and crystalline segments of the polymer after long exposure times. The thermal stability, as well as the temperature and rate of crystallization, decreased in the absence of TiO2. TiO(2)not only provided UV protection, but also restricted the physical mobility of the polymer chains, acting as a nucleating agent during the crystallization process. It also slowed down the decrease in mechanical properties. The mechanical properties were shown to gradually decrease for the PHBV/TiO(2)nanocomposites, whereas a sharp drop was observed for the neat PHBV after an accelerated weathering exposure. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), using the amplitude modulation-frequency modulation (AM-FM) tool, also confirmed the mechanical changes in the surface area of the PHBV and PHBV/TiO(2)samples after accelerated weathering exposure. The changes in the physical and chemical properties of PHBV/TiO(2)confirm the barrier activity of TiO(2)for weathering attack and its retardation of the degradation process.

AB The standard pharmacokinetic model for the analysis of MRI contrast reagent (CR) bolus-trackim, (B-T) data assumes that the mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (tau(i)) is effectively zero. This assertion is inconsistent with a considerable body of physiological measurements. Furthermore, theory and simulation show the B-T time-course shape to be very sensitive to the tau(i) magnitude in the physiological range (hundreds of milliseconds to several seconds). Consequently, this standard model aspect can cause significant underestimations (factors of 2 or 3) of the two parameters usually determined: K-trans, the vascular wall CR transfer rate constant, and v(e), the CR distribution volume (the extracellular, extravascular space fraction). Analyses of animal model data confirmed two predicted behaviors indicative of this standard model inadequacy: (1) a specific temporal pattern for the mismatch between the best-fitted curve and data; and (2) an inverse dependence of the curve's K-trans and v(e) magnitudes on the CR dose. These parameters should be CR close-independent. The most parsimonious analysis allowing for realistic tau(i) values is the 'shutter-speed' model. Its application to the experimental animal data essentially eliminated the two standard model signature inadequacies. This paper reports the first Survey for the extent of this 'shutter-speed effect' in human data. Retrospective analyses are made of clinical data chosen from a range of pathology (the active multiple sclerosis lesion, the invasive ductal carcinoma breast tumor, and osteosarcorna in the leg) that provides a wide variation, particularly of K-trans. The signature temporal mismatch of the standard model is observed in all cases, and is essentially eliminated by use of the shutter-speed model. Pixel-by-pixel maps show that parameter values from the shutter-speed analysis are increased by more than a factor of 3 for some lesion regions. This endows the lesions with very high contrast, and reveals heterogeneities that are often not seen in the standard model maps. Normal muscle regions in the leg allow validation of the shutter-speed model K-trans, v(e) and tau(i) magnitudes, by comparison with results Of previous careful rat leg studies not possible for human subjects.

AB The behavioural effects of several BZ (omega) receptor ligands were compared in mice using the light/dark choice task, an animal model of ''state'' anxiety, and the free-exploration test, which has been proposed as an experimental model of ''trait'' anxiety. The drugs used included non-selective full (alprazolam, clorazepate, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam), partial agonists (bretazenil, imidazenil and Ro 19-8022) and BZ-1 (omega 1) selective receptor ligands (abecarnil, CL 218,872 and zolpidem). In the light/dark choice task, non-selective full agonists elicited clear anxiolytic-like effects increasing time spent in the lit box and simultaneously reducing attempts at entry into the illuminated cage followed by withdrawal responses, a measure of risk assessment. With the exception of abecarnil, both non-selective partial agonists and BZ-1 (omega 1) selective receptor ligands displayed reduced efficacy compared to the full agonists as they decreased risk assessment responses without altering time in the lit box. In addition, the weak anxiolytic-like actions displayed by selective BZ-1 (omega 1) agents were evident only at doses which reduced locomotor activity, indicating that this effect may be non-specific. In the free-exploration test, non-selective BZ (omega) receptor agonists markedly increased the percentage of time spent in the novel compartment and reduced the number of attempts to enter, whereas selective BZ-1 (omega 1) receptor ligands displayed a weaker neophobia-reducing effect as they reduced risk assessment responses only. As was the case in the light/dark choice task, this latter effect was observed at locomotor depressant doses. These findings indicate that while both full and partial BZ (omega) receptor agonists are equally effective against ''trait'' anxiety, full agonists may be superior in reducing ''state'' anxiety. In addition, the lack of specific effects of selective BZ-1 (omega 1) receptor ligands in reducing both types of anxiety suggests that the BZ-1 (omega 1) receptor subtype cannot be considered as the primary target mediating the anxiolytic action of drugs interacting with the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex.

AB A traditional intumescent flame retardant (IFR) has very poor water resistance due to the existence of ammonium polyphosphate (APP). How to improve the water resistance of APP or IFR without sacrificing its flame retardancy is an important issue for the wide application of IFR. In this study, the coated APP with polysiloxane shell (Si-APP) was prepared by in situ polymerization, and was used to flame retard polypropylene (PP) together with charring agent (CA). The resulting Si-APP was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), transmission electron micrographs (TEM) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. The water solubility of Si-APP was also investigated. The thermal stability and combustion behaviors of PP/Si-APP/CA and PP/APP/CA composites were also investigated through TG, limiting oxygen index (LOI), vertical burning test (UL-94), and cone calorimeter (CC) test. The results showed that the coated APP with polysiloxane shell could significantly improve the flame retardancy of IFR PP systems. At a total flame retardant loading of 25 wt%, the LOI value of PP/Si-APP/CA was 34.0%, which was higher than 30.6% of PP/APP/CA, and the UL-94 rating of the former was V-0 in the case of the specimen thickness of 1.6 mm, while the later was V-2 rating. CC test results showed that the average value of heat release rate (HRR), the total heat release (THR), and the peak of smoke production rate (SPR) of PP/Si-APP/CA decreased in comparison with PP/APP/CA system, especially, THR decreased by 50.0%. Further, the char residue of the former increased significantly compared with the latter, greatly increased by 238.9%. In addition, the thermal stability and water resistance of IFR PP composites were also improved due to the modification of APP. The mechanism for the improvement of flame retardancy was also discussed based on the experimental results. All these results illustrate that the coating of APP with polysiloxane shell is an efficient method to improve the flame retardancy and water resistance of APP-containing IFR PP systems.

AB Background: Arsenic is an environmental pollutant, potent human toxicant, and oxidative stress agent with a multiplicity of health effects associated with both acute and chronic exposures. A semi-mechanistic cellular-level toxicokinetic (TK) model was developed in order to describe the uptake, biotransformation and clearance of arsenical species in human hepatocytes. Notable features of this model are the incorporation of arsenic-glutathione complex formation and a "switch-like" formulation to describe the antioxidant response of hepatocytes to arsenic exposure.
   Results: The cellular-level TK model applies mass action kinetics in order to predict the concentrations of trivalent and pentavalent arsenicals in hepatocytes. The model simulates uptake of arsenite (iAs(III)) via aquaporin isozymes 9 (AQP9s), glutathione (GSH) conjugation, methylation by arsenic methyltransferase (AS3MT), efflux through multidrug resistant proteins (MRPs) and the induced antioxidant response via thioredoxin reductase (TR) activity. The model was parameterized by optimization of model estimates for arsenite (iAs(III)), monomethylated (MMA) and dimethylated (DMA) arsenicals concentrations with time-course experimental data in human hepatocytes for a time span of 48 hours, and dose-response data at 24 hours for a range of arsenite concentrations from 0.1 to 10 mu M. Global sensitivity analysis of the model showed that at low doses the transport parameters had a dominant role, whereas at higher doses the biotransformation parameters were the most significant. A parametric comparison of the TK model with an analogous model developed for rat hepatocytes from the literature demonstrated that the biotransformation of arsenite (e. g. GSH conjugation) has a large role in explaining the variation in methylation between rats and humans.
   Conclusions: The cellular-level TK model captures the temporal modes of arsenical accumulation in human hepatocytes. It highlighted the key biological processes that influence arsenic metabolism by explicitly modelling the metabolic network of GSH-adducts formation. The parametric comparison with the TK model developed for rats suggests that the variability in GSH conjugation could have an important role in inter-species variability of arsenical methylation. The TK model can be incorporated into larger-scale physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) models of arsenic for improving the estimates of PBTK model parameters.

AB We model oil price dynamics in a general equilibrium production economy with two goods: a consumption good and oil. Production of the consumption good requires drawing from oil reserves at a fixed rate. Investment necessary to replenish oil reserves is costly and irreversible. We solve for the optimal consumption, production and oil reserves policy for a representative agent. We analyze the equilibrium price of oil, as well as the term structure of oil futures prices. Because investment in oil reserves is irreversible and costly, the optimal investment in new oil reserves is periodic and lumpy. Investment occurs when the crude oil is relatively scarce in the economy. This generates an equilibrium oil price process that has distinct behavior across two regions (characterized by the abundance/scarcity of oil). We undertake three empirical tests suggested by our model. First, we estimate key parameters using SMM to match moments of oil price futures as well as other macroeconomic properties of the data. Second, we estimate an affine regime switching model of the oil price, which captures the main features of our equilibrium model and preserves the tractability of reduced-form models. Lastly, we compare the risk premium in short-maturity oil futures implied by our model to the data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As functionality is added to an aging piece of software, its original design and structure will tend to erode. This can lead to high coupling, low cohesion and other undesirable effects associated with spaghetti architectures. The underlying forces that cause such degradation have been the 14 subject of much research. However, progress in this field is slow, as its complexity makes it difficult to isolate the causal flows leading to these effects. This is further complicated by the difficulty of generating enough empirical data, in sufficient quantity, and attributing such data to specific points in the causal chain. This article describes a framework for simulating the structural evolution of software. A complete simulation model is built by incrementally adding modules to the framework, each of which contributes an individual evolutionary effect. These effects are then combined to form a multifaceted simulation that evolves a fictitious code base in a manner approximating realworld behavior. We describe the underlying principles and structures of our framework from a theoretical and user perspective; a validation of a simple set of evolutionary parameters is then provided and three empirical software studies generated from open-source software (OSS) are used to support claims and generated results. The research illustrates how simulation can be used to investigate a complex and under-researched area of the development cycle. It also shows the value of incorporating certain human traits into a simulation-factors that, in real-world system development, can significantly influence evolutionary structures.

AB Past research at the nexus of motor control and perception investigated the role of perspective taking in many behavioral and neuroimaging studies. Some investigators addressed the issue of one's own vs. others' action imagination, but the possible effects of a front or a back view in imagining others' actions have so far been neglected. We report two 'single trial' experiments in which a total of 640 participants were asked to imagine a person performing a manual action - either in a front or in a back view - and then to indicate the and used by the imagined person during movement execution. In such a task, we assume the existence of two distinct biases: a perceptual-mnemonic bias due to subjects' visual experience of others' actions, encouraging them to imagine right-handed movements, and a motor bias due to subjects' experience of self-made actions, encouraging them to imagine movements performed with the same hand as their dominant hand. We hypothesized that a greater involvement of motor representations in the back view compared to the front view could result in an increased correspondence between one's own manual preference and the hand used by the imagined agent in the former condition. The results of both experiments were consistent with this hypothesis, suggesting that while imagining others' actions we employ motor simulations in different degrees according to the perspective adopted.

AB We address the problem of flight control in the presence of actuator anomalies. A supervisory control architecture that includes the actions of both a human pilot and an autopilot is proposed to ensure resilient tracking performance in the presence of anomalies. The pilot is tasked with supervisory, higher level decision-making tasks, such as anomaly detection, estimation, and command regulation. The autopilot is assigned a lower level task of accurate command following based on an adaptive control design. The main innovations in the proposed architecture are the use of human pilot in utilizing the concepts of capacity for maneuver (CfM) and graceful command degradation (GCD), both of which originate in cognitive sciences and a judicious combination of the pilot inputs and the autopilot control action. Together, they provide guidelines for a system to be resilient, which corresponds to the system's readiness to respond to unforeseen events. The supervisory control architecture is shown to be capable of achieving maximum CfM while allowing minimal GCD, as well as satisfactory command following postanomaly, resulting in resilient flight capabilities. The proposed controller is analyzed in a simulation study of a nonlinear F-16 aircraft model under actuator anomalies. It is shown through numerical studies that under suitable inputs from the pilot, the overall controller is able to deliver resilient flight.

AB Injection of plastics into blast furnaces as an alternative reducing agent has been carried out for the purpose of mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Several studies on the pyrolysis of plastic particles have been reported, however flow behavior of plastic particles or unburnt char in actual blast furnace is not clear.
   In this study, hotmodel experiments and thermogravimetry analysis were conducted for the modeling of gasification behavior of plastic particles, then flow behavior of plastic particle and unburnt char in a blast furnace was calculated by numerical simulation. According to the observation results of gasification experiment, volatile matter of plastics seems to be evolved at the surface of the particles. Regarding reaction of char derived from plastics, thermogravimetry analysis showed that rate of gasification of unburnt char depended on the rate of heating. Gasification rate in the case of rapid heating condition tended to increase.
   As the results of numerical simulations, initial diameter of plastics and char diameter determined the flow behavior in the blast furnace. When relatively small plastic was injected or diameter of unburnt char was small, unburnt char went upward along with gas flow and most of it might be consumed at the cohesive zone. On the other hand, when relatively coarse plastics was injected and diameter of unburnt char was relatively coarse, it was suggested that unburnt char accumulated around the deadman.
   Therefore, it is considered that fine plastics injection is desirable for the stable operation of blast furnace.

AB Quantifying both arterial cerebral blood volume (CBVa) changes and total cerebral blood volume (CBVt) changes during neural activation can provide critical information about vascular control mechanisms, and help to identify the origins of neurovascular responses in conventional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cerebral blood flow (CBF), CBVa, and CBVt were quantified by MRI at 9.4 T in isoflurane- anesthetized rats during 15-s duration forepaw stimulation. Cerebral blood flow and CBVa were simultaneously determined by modulation of tissue and vessel signals using arterial spin labeling, while CBVt was measured with a susceptibility-based contrast agent. Baseline versus stimulation values in a region centered over the somatosensory cortex were: CBF = 150 +/- 18 versus 182 +/- 20 mL/100g/min, CBVa=0.83 +/- 0.21 versus 1.17 +/- 0.30 mL/100 g, CBVt = 3.10 +/- 0.55 versus 3.41 +/- 0.61mL/100 g, and CBVa/CBVt =0.27 +/- 0.05 versus 0.34 +/- 0.06 (n= 7, mean +/- s.d.). Neural activity-induced absolute changes in CBVa and CBVt are statistically equivalent and independent of the spatial extent of regional analysis. Under our conditions, increased CBVt during neural activation originates mainly from arterial rather than venous blood volume changes, and therefore a critical implication is that venous blood volume changes may be negligible in BOLD fMRI.

AB The early-age cracking of concrete structures increases permeability and diffusivity and moreover accelerates the penetration of liquid, gas and aggressive agents. Consequently, the serviceability of these structures could be reduced drastically. Early-age cracking might be due to external loading, but also to the internal or external restraint resulting from autogenous, drying and thermal shrinkage. This study focuses more specifically on these latter phenomena.
   In the first part of this study (see effect of fibres on early-age cracking of concrete tunnel lining- Part I: Laboratory testing), ring tests were performed to investigate the sensitivity of concrete to cracking due to both shrinkage strain and type of fibre (two organic fibres and one steel fibre were studied).
   Ring test results were then used to validate the capacity of a chemo-thermo-viscoelastic damage model aimed at reproducing the complex behaviour of fibre-reinforced concrete subjected to restrained shrinkage through identifying the material parameters with standardised tests. The numerical simulations conducted on a real tunnel lining show that for the studied geometries and concrete mixtures, thermal shrinkage constitutes the major phenomenon capable of causing early-age transverse cracks and moreover crack opening is highly dependent on the type of reinforcement. Modifications to both fibre type and lining thickness may serve to avoid the onset of transverse cracks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Recent advances in AI technologies are dramatically changing the world and impacting our daily life. However, human users still essentially need to cooperate with AI systems to complete tasks as such technologies are never perfect. For optimal performance and safety in human-AI cooperation, human users must appropriately adjust their level of trust to the actual reliability of AI systems. Poorly calibrated trust can be a major cause of serious issues with safety and efficiency. Previous works on trust calibration have emphasized the importance of system transparency for avoiding trust miscalibration. Measuring and influencing trust are still challenging issues; consequently, not many studies have focused on how to detect improper trust calibration nor how to mitigate it. We approach these research challenges with a behavior-based approach to capture the status of calibration. A framework of adaptive trust calibration is proposed, including a formal definition of improper trust calibration called "a trust equation". It involves cognitive cues called "trust calibration cues (TCCs)" and a conceptual entity called "trust calibration AI" (TCAI), which supervises the status of trust calibration. We conducted empirical evaluations using a simulated drone environment with two types of cooperative tasks: a visual search task and a real-time navigation task. We designed trust changing scenarios and evaluated our framework. The results demonstrated that adaptively presenting a TCC could promote trust calibration more effectively than a traditional system transparency approach.

AB The use of porous concrete in structural elements subjected to compression cyclic loads is inevitable in those situations in which it is necessary to withstand, simultaneously, important amount of freeze-thaw cycles and cyclic loads. However, the presence of pores, which is essential to withstand freeze-thaw cycles, can drastically reduce the fatigue life of concrete in some cases.
   This paper analyses a total of 60 40-mm edge cubic specimens, belonging to 5 series, each of them with a different content of air entraining agent. The specimens were first scanned using computerized tomography scan in order to visualize the internal porosity of the specimens. Through the use of specific software, the morphological parameters of the porosity of each test was defined. Nine specimens of each series were tested at cyclic compression load until fatigue failure. The fatigue life of each specimen was obtained. Using these data, the characteristic fatigue life of each series were obtained.
   The comparison between the morphology of the porosity and its fatigue life provides interesting relationships, which allow to understand better how the porosity influences the response to compression fatigue of the concrete. Finally, empirical relationships between porosity morphological parameters and fatigue life were obtained. The correlations show that a greater porosity leads to a lower fatigue life. And also, concretes with a higher percentage of small pores show a better behaviour against fatigue.

AB The objective of this paper is to apply CLSVOF method to investigate the single bubble dynamics in acoustic travelling waves. The Naiver-Stokes equation considering the acoustic radiation force is proposed and validated to capture the bubble behaviors. And the CLSVOF method, which can capture the continuous geometric properties and satisfies mass conservation, is applied in present work. Firstly, the regime map, depending on the dimensionless acoustic pressure amplitude and acoustic wave number, is constructed to present different bubble behaviors. Then, the time evolution of the bubble oscillation is investigated and analyzed. Finally, the effect of the direction and the damping coefficient of acoustic wave propagation on the bubble behavior are also considered. The numerical results show that the bubble presents distinct oscillation types in acoustic travelling waves, namely, volume oscillation, shape oscillation, and splitting oscillation. For the splitting oscillation, the formation of jet, splitting of bubble, and the rebound of sub-bubbles may lead to substantial increase in pressure fluctuations on the boundary. For the shape oscillation, the nodes and antinodes of the acoustic pressure wave contribute to the formation of the "cross shape" of the bubble. It should be noted that the direction of the bubble translation and bubble jet are always towards the direction of wave propagation. In addition, the damping coefficient causes bubble in shape oscillation to be of asymmetry in shape and inequality in size, and delays the splitting process.

AB The determination of mercury simultaneously with other elements via inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) is still challenging due to the lack of accuracy for the low level mercury concentrations as a result of its volatility and tendency to adhere to the walls of the sample introduction system. This study investigated the effect of existing (gold and methionine) and new (lithium tetrathiafulvalene carboxylate (LiCTTF)) preservation agents in order to improve the determination of trace mercury in PM2.5 samples. Statistical analysis revealed that a concentration of 10 mu g mL(-1) of LiCTTF was sufficient to obtain highly accurate results with t values of 0.1044-1.1239 which are considerably less than the critical t value of 1.8 and apparent recoveries of 85-100%. An evaluation of the method revealed a spiked mercury recovery of 91% and a detection limit of 0.05 mu g mL(-1). The method was tested for the determination of trace metals in PM2.5 from atmospheric samples and led to the detection of low elemental concentrations in Singapore's atmosphere. The mechanism for the interaction of mercury with LiCTTF and tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) was studied by conducting in situ electrochemical studies. Cyclic voltammetry and square-wave voltammetry analyses of mercury, and mercury in presence of LiCTTF and TTF revealed complexation between the metal and sulfur-containing compounds.

AB Previous studies on house prices tend to focus on parameters such as location, size and view. Such studies ignored the influence of environmental aesthetics on house prices. Considering the scientific evidence that showed a significant effect of environmental aesthetic on people's environmental preference and behaviour, this study aims to investigate the influence of environmental aesthetic on estimated house prices. Twelve computer-simulated residential environments were created. Computer-simulated images vary on three categories to manipulate complexity and coherence along a street: (1) building location (attached, detached and both), (2) building height (same and different) and (3) building setback (same and different). Forty-seven university students viewed the computer-simulated environments and answered questions to evaluate aesthetic and economic values of each street. For the aesthetic value, participants evaluated the extent to which the environment is arousing, pleasant, exciting, relaxing, complex, coherent and safe. For the economic value, participants estimated market price (for sale and for rent) of a specific apartment on a computer simulation of a residential street. Results showed that estimated sale price was influenced by excitement, coherence and pleasantness; estimated rental price was influenced by complexity, arousal, coherence and pleasantness. This study aimed to pave the way for such studies by introducing an inspiring methodology and highlighting the importance of environmental aesthetics on house prices. Moreover, the findings have applied value for planners, urban designers and real estate agents.

ID LOOP; PROPOFOL; HYPNOSIS; SYSTEM; BIS
AB Objective: In this paper, we present an original decision support algorithm to assist the anesthesiologists delivery of drugs to maintain the optimal Depth of Anesthesia (DoA). Methods: Derived from a Transform Predictive State Representation algorithm (TPSR), our model learned by observing anesthesiologists in practice. This framework, known as apprenticeship learning, is particularly useful in the medical field as it is not based on an exploratory process - a prohibitive behavior in healthcare. The model only relied on the four commonly monitored variables: Heart Rate (HR), the Mean Blood Pressure (MBP), the Respiratory Rate (RR) and the concentration of anesthetic drug (AAFi). Results: Thirty-one patients have been included. The performances of the model is analyzed with metrics derived from the Hamming distance and cross entropy. They demonstrated that low rank dynamical system had the best performances on both predictions and simulations. Then, a confrontation of our agent to a panel of six real anesthesiologists demonstrated that 95.7% of the actions were valid. Conclusion: These results strongly support the hypothesis that TPSR based models convincingly embed the behavior of anesthesiologists including only four variables that are commonly assessed to predict the DoA. Significance: The proposed novel approach could be of great help for clinicians by improving the fine tuning of the DoA. Furthermore, the possibility to predict the evolutions of the variables would help preventing side effects such as low blood pressure. A tool that could autonomously help the anesthesiologist would thus improve safety-level in the surgical room.

AB Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) affects concrete and decreases its mechanical characteristics. However, for some reinforced concrete structures, the global mechanical behaviour can appear to be improved by ASR: for similar reinforcement, the first flexural cracking of reactive beams usually occurs for higher loading than in non-reactive beams. The flexural failures of two reinforced beams, one reactive and one non-reactive, are numerically simulated here in order to discuss the origins of the delay in cracking observed for the reactive beam. The por-omechanical model used considers the swelling anisotropy, and is able to differentiate ASR diffuse cracking from structural macrocracks and the coupling of both crack types with creep. According to the model results, the cracking delay is due to the chemical prestress in the concrete induced by the ASR swelling being restrained in the direction of the reinforcements; the concrete has to be decompressed before cracking. The mechanical modelling presented in the paper is able to reproduce the differences between the reactive beam and the reference one. The cracking delay obtained for the ASR beam in the flexural test seems interesting from the mechanical point of view. However, this performance could be counterbalanced by durability problems due to ASR diffuse cracking that is induced parallel to the reinforcements. In fact, these cracks, also evaluated by the present modelling, are privileged paths for the ingress of deleterious agents such as carbonates or chlorides.

AB Bioconvection is an important phenomenon in aquatic environments, affecting the spatial distribution of motile micro-organisms and enhancing mixing within the fluid. However, stratification arising from thermal or solutal gradients can play a pivotal role in suppressing the bioconvective flows, leading to the aggregation of micro-organisms and growth of their patchiness. We investigate the combined effects by considering gyrotactic motility where the up-swimming cells are directed by the balance of the viscous and gravitational torques. To study this system, we employ a continuum model consisting of Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation coupled with two conservation equations for the concentration of cells and stratification agent. We present a linear stability analysis to determine the onset of bioconvection for different flow parameters. Also, using large-scale numerical simulations, we explore different regimes of the flow by varying the corresponding boundary conditions and dimensionless variables such as Rayleigh number and Lewis number (Le) and we show that the cell distribution can be characterized using the ratio of the buoyancy forces as the determinant parameter when Le < 1 and the boundaries are insulated. But, in thermally stratified fluids corresponding to Le > 1, temperature gradients are demonstrated to have little impact on the bioconvective plumes provided that the walls are thermally insulated. In addition, we analyse the dynamical behaviour of the system in the case of persistent pycnoclines corresponding to constant salinity boundary conditions and we discuss the associated inhibition threshold of bioconvection in the light of the stability of linearized solutions.

AB 1. We used an agent-based model to test the hypothesis that diet complementation by frugivores can promote the persistence of rare plant species in communities (DCH).
   2. Models simulated bird movement, frugivory, seed dispersal and plant recruitment on landscapes that differed in their degree of fragmentation and in their degree of fruiting species mixing at the scale of frugivores' foraging decisions.
   3. Diet complementation promoted the dispersal of rare species without the need of a priori preference from birds. The effects of landscape structure on the dispersal of rare plants were small (<5%) compared to positive effects of diet complementation because birds tracked the nutrients contained in rare fruits to balance their diets. However, resource-tracking of rare fruits increased foraging costs up to 20% of net energy intakes.
   4. During postdispersal stages, density-dependent mortality only conferred advantages to rare plants when located within heterospecific plant patches. Still, thanks to rare-biased dispersal, rare plants showed the highest seed dispersal effectiveness irrespectively of landscape configuration.
   5. Our theoretical approach presents a behavioural mechanism by which fruit choice can act as a frequency-dependent mechanism conferring rare species advantages as important as classic postdispersal density-dependent processes.
   6. We hope that this study stimulates future work aimed at evaluating the importance of diet complementation in structuring the composition and spatial patterning of plant communities.

AB Several materials that are of interest in engineering present a yield stress and behave as viscoplastic fluids. This paper investigates numerically the motion of a Bingham fluid between two coaxial cylinders due to a periodic pressure gradient and/or to the periodic displacement of the internal cylinder. The constitutive equation presents a discontinuity at the zero shear rate. To overcome the difficulty, the rheologic law has been regularized using a smooth function based on the error function. The velocity fields have been calculated using an implicit finite difference method. The procedure has been validated, comparing the numerical results with the analytical solution of the same problem for a Newtonian fluid. The nonlinear behavior of the fluid is emphasized, comparing the effects due to the simultaneous action of the pressure gradient and the displacement of the internal wall with the sum of the effects due to the single actions. In all cases, the mean discharge in a period increases. The comparison between the effects of the forcing agents shows that if the dimensionless frequency is less than 10 the increases of the discharge obtained by applying the pulsatile pressure gradient or moving the internal wall are similar. At low frequencies the action of the gradient exceeds that of the moving wall, whereas for higher frequencies the effect of the moving wall increases rapidly because a fixed displacement of the internal cylinder leads to very great values for the velocity of the internal wall.

AB Potential damages to existing tunnels represent a major concern for constructing deep excavations in urban areas. The uncertainty of subsurface conditions and the nonlinear interactions between multiple agents (e.g., soils, excavation support structures, and tunnel structures) make the prediction of the response of tunnel induced by adjacent excavations a rather difficult and complex task. This paper proposes an initiative to solve this problem by using process-based modelling, where information generated from the interaction processes between soils, structures, and excavation activities is utilized to gradually reduce uncertainty related to soil properties and to learn the interaction patterns through machine learning techniques. To illustrate such a concept, this paper presents a simple process-based model consisting of artificial neural network (ANN) module, inverse modelling module, and mechanistic module. The ANN module is trained to learn and recognize the patterns of the complex interactions between excavation deformations, its geometries and support structures, and soil properties. The inverse modelling module enables a gradual reduction of uncertainty associated with soil characterizations by accumulating field observations during the construction processes. Based on the inputs provided by the former two modules, the mechanistic module computes the response of tunnel. The effectiveness of the proposed process-based model is evaluated against high-fidelity numerical simulations and field measurements. These evaluations suggest that the strategy of combining artificial intelligence techniques with information generated during interaction processes can represent a promising approach to solve complex engineering problems in conventional industries.

AB Certain animal species use the Earth's magnetic field (i.e. magnetoreception) in conjunction with other sensory modalities to navigate long distances. It is hypothesized that several animals use combinations of magnetic inclination and intensity as unique signatures for localization, enabling migration without a pre-surveyed map. However, it is unknown how animals use magnetic signatures to generate guidance commands, and the extent to which species-specific capabilities and environmental factors affect a given strategy's efficacy or deterioration. Understanding animal magnetoreception can aid in developing better engineered navigation systems that are less reliant on satellites, which are expensive and can become unreliable or unavailable under a variety of circumstances. Building on previous studies, we implement an agent-based computer simulation that uses two variants of a magnetic signature-based navigation strategy. The strategy can successfully migrate to eight specified goal points in an environment that resembles the northern Atlantic ocean. In particular, one variant reaches all goal points with faster ocean current velocities, while the other variant reaches all goal points with slower ocean current velocities. We also employ dynamic systems tools to examine the stability of the strategy as a proxy for whether it is guaranteed to succeed. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy and can help in the development of new navigation technologies that are less reliant on satellites and pre-surveyed maps.

AB While ranking systems, electronic word of mouth (eWOM) channels and recommendation systems might appear as three separate tools that influence consumer choice, consumers at online reading platforms are often exposed to all three simultaneously during a searching session of e-books. This study conducts an empirical analysis to examine the interaction effects of these three decision-supporting tools on online reading behavior. To do so, we collect a 25-week panel data set on Yuedu.163.com, which is one of the earliest online reading platforms in China. Our results indicate that informational cascades are particularly prominent on the online reading market. Under the influence of informational cascades, eWOM volume and valence have no impact on the clicks of e-books with high rankings, but have positive impact on the clicks of e-books with low rankings. Recommendation strength has a positive impact on popular e-books clicks, but has no impact on the clicks of less popular e-books. Moreover, we find that eWOM valence and recommendation strength have a substitute relationship in affecting the clicks of e-books with high rankings. However, eWOM and recommendation system have a complementary relationship in affecting the clicks of less popular e-books. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the interaction effects of information cascades, eWOM and recommendation systems on online user behavior. Our findings provide important theoretical contributions and managerial implications.

AB This article responds to calls in the literature for a major shift in approaches to explaining systemic risk. It applies insights from multiple disciplines, but departs from the monistic positivist research orientations of many previous contributions by taking a carefully argued pragmatic approach from management science to address non-linear intractability. A new operational behaviour paradigm of systemic failure is summarized, in which notions from evolutionary economics and complexity science are combined with an interpretation of entropy as risk uncertainty, to explain systemic risk in terms of catastrophic bifurcations simulated in the operational state-space of an agent-based computational model representing a highly simplified global financial system. Then the key features of a recent programme of theory development research based on this approach are described, in which the results of a simulation of Iceland's financial system collapse were validated with empirical data from annual reports over that period. Findings suggested that a lack of diversity in participation strategies among system participants may have been a key operational mechanism of catastrophic tensions over supply versus demand for financial services, confirming academic commentary on that event. In conclusion, the operational definition of systemic risk proposed in this research is argued to be a practical basis on which future research may be able to construct computational solutions capable of measuring systemic risk more accurately by predicting systemic failure of the global financial system in more detailed and realistic simulations for diverse applications such as financial system regulation and cyber-warfare impact analysis.

AB Discrete event simulations can be used to analyze natural and artificial phenomena. To this end, one provides models whose behaviors are characterized by discrete events in a discrete timeline. By running such a simulation, one can then observe its properties. This suggests the possibility of applying on-the-fly verification procedures during simulations. In this work we propose a method by which this can be accomplished. It consists of modeling the simulation as a transition system (implicitly), and the property to be verified as another transition system (explicitly). The latter we call a simulation purpose and it is used both to verify the success of the property and to guide the simulation. Algorithmically, this corresponds to building a synchronous product of these two transitions systems on-the-fly and using it to operate a simulator. By the end of such an algorithm, it may deliver either a conclusive or inconclusive verdict. If conclusive, it becomes known whether the simulation model satisfies the simulation purpose. If inconclusive, it is possible to adjust certain parameters and try again. The precise nature of simulation purposes, as well as the corresponding satisfiability relations and verification algorithms, are largely determined by methodological considerations important for the analysis of simulations, whose computational characteristics we compare with empirical scientific procedures. We provide a number of ways in which such a satisfiability relation can be defined formally, the related algorithms, and mathematical proofs of soundness, completeness and complexities. Two application examples are given to illustrate the approach.

AB Objective: The objective of the study was to examine pilots' automation monitoring strategies and performance on highly automated commercial flight decks. Background: A considerable body of research and operational experience has documented breakdowns in pilot-automation coordination on modern flight decks. These breakdowns are often considered symptoms of monitoring failures even though, to date, only limited and mostly anecdotal data exist concerning pilots' monitoring strategies and performance. Method: Twenty experienced B-747-400 airline pilots flew a 1-hr scenario involving challenging automation-related events on a full-mission simulator. Behavioral, mental model, and eye-tracking data were collected. Results: The findings from this study confirm that pilots monitor basic flight parameters to a much greater extent than visual indications of the automation configuration. More specifically, they frequently fail to verify manual mode selections or notice automatic mode changes. In other cases, they do not process mode annunciations in sufficient depth to understand their implications for aircraft behavior. Low system observability and gaps in pilots' understanding of complex automation modes were shown to contribute to these problems. Conclusion: Our findings describe and explain shortcomings in pilot's automation monitoring strategies and performance based on converging behavioral, eye-tracking, and mental model data. They confirm that monitoring failures are one major contributor to breakdowns in pilot-automation interaction. Application: The findings from this research can inform the design of improved training programs and automation interfaces that support more effective system monitoring.

AB The role of a floating elastic plate on the hydrodynamic instability of a gravity-driven flow down an inclined plane is examined in the linear and nonlinear regimes. Linear instability of the system with respect to infinitesimal disturbances is captured using normal-mode analysis. The critical conditions for instability are obtained analytically utilizing the small film aspect ratio. The bifurcation of the nonlinear evolution equation is analyzed using weakly nonlinear stability analysis. The time evolution of the surface elevation is analyzed using the nonlinear analysis. The Orr-Sommerfeld boundary value problem corresponding to the perturbed flow is derived, and it is solved numerically using the spectral collocation method. The behavior of the marginal stability curves and temporal growth of the unstable waves are portrayed for a range of dimensionless flow parameters. Moreover, the pressure acting on the surface are calculated and analyzed for various structural parameters, applicable to different flow configurations. The study reveals that the structural parameters such as rigidity and mass per unit length play a crucial role in suppressing and facilitating the unstable surface waves of the flow. However, the compressive force acting on the plate results in the flexural destabilization. Thus, the plate parameters are more efficient in damping the shorter wave disturbances. Numerical observations imply that the floating elastic plate assists in stabilizing the free-falling flow and dampens the high amplitude waves. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Raceway zone is one of the most important regions in blast furnace, since it governs efficiency and stability of the blast furnace process through combustions of coke and auxiliary reducing agent, burden descent, fines generation, and so on. Therefore, quantitative understanding of the raceway behavior is indispensable to dlesigning and realizing highly efficient operation of blast furnace. In the raceway, a cavity is formed and the coke particles circulate due to interaction between particles and high velocity blast gas, and consumption of coke. Thus, two-phase flow behavior is one of the key features of the raceway formation. In this study, the formation behavior of the raceway in the isothermal and non-reactive packed bed was numerically discussed from the viewpoint of two-phase flow. The mathematical model used in this study consisted of Lagrangean particle tracking method and Eulerian computational fluid dynamic technique, and these were combined through voidage distribution and momentum exchange. This model was applied to a small-scale cold-model condition. The simulation results revealed the raceway formation behavior such as variations of cavity size, particle motion, gas flow field, and contact force network. Furthermore, the effects of the initial packing structure on the raceway formation, the differences in the raceway formation behavior in the fixed bed and the moving bed and their mechanisms were clearly elucidated.

AB Mate choice includes three steps: (1) a choosing individual encounters potential mates, (2) assesses and processes information about them, and (3) makes a mate decision. During mate searching females can access only a sample of males in the mating pool and need to choose their mates based on limited information. Thus, mate sampling may influence sexual selection promoted by mate choice because it constrains female choice. Using individual-based simulations, we found that both female choosiness and mate sampling influenced the variance in mating success among males and thus the intensity of sexual selection. So that sexual selection is most intense when females are strongly choosy and can sample many males. Moreover, in evolutionary simulations, the rate of evolutionary change and the final size of male ornament increase with increasing mate sampling. However, under stronger natural selection, evolutionary change is slower and leads to smaller ornaments. Empirical data on the potential for sexual selection (I-s) for several animal species show a positive correlation between the intensity of sexual selection and an index of mate sampling based on behavioral and ecological traits. Based on the results of our simulations, we predict that males of highly mobile species with long-range sexual signal transmission, which allow females to assess many males, will show greater variance in mating success and will be more ornamented than their relatives not exhibiting these features.

AB Ironmaking technology is currently focused on the introduction of the decreased reducing agent operation of a blast furnace in order to decrease CO2 emissions. Because the coke ratio is reduced in this operation, causing a huge pressure drop, it has become increasingly important to understand the in-furnace phenomena using the non-empirical method. In this study, the DEM-CFD simulation was carried out to analyze the heat and mass transfer between the gaseous phase and the particles in a packed bed. In particular, the effect of recently proposed helical structure of coke and ore layers was compared with the traditional layer-by-layer structure. This comparison shows that the helical structure is effective for the smooth gas flow in the packed bed. It was found that the increase of the gas flow rate in a large grain size coke layer, would not affect the total permeability of the packed bed. Since the helical structure decreases the amount of inflow of the gaseous phase to the ore bed, the reduction rate of this ore tends to decrease the thickness of the layered structure, but this effect is relatively small. The helical structure becomes more permeable, if a thicker layer is maintained even under the decreased coke ratio condition. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Designing Traffic Signal Yellow and Change Intervals Considering Truck
   Impacts
SO TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD

DT Article
ID DRIVER BEHAVIOR; ONSET
AB This research quantifies the effect of heavy vehicles on the design of yellow and all-red intervals. With empirical data from previous studies and truck performance characteristics, models are developed to simulate driver perception reaction times and truck deceleration levels at signalized intersections. These models consider roadway surface and weather conditions (dry, fog, or rain); driver attributes (age and gender); roadway grade; approach speed; and time and distance to the intersection at the onset of the yellow indication. An agent-based approach is used to develop driver- and vehicle-specific yellow times. The yellow timings for light-duty and heavy-duty vehicles are then combined and consider different percentages of heavy vehicles in the traffic stream. Lookup tables are developed for grades, precipitation types and levels, and percentages of trucks to provide practical guidelines for the design of yellow and all-red signal timings. In general, the research demonstrates that adding trucks to the traffic stream increases yellow times by 2% to 20%, depending on approach speed, grade, and weather conditions, with the most significant increases occurring on dry roadways with high positive gradients at lower speeds. In absolute terms, the yellow time is increased from approximately 0.1 to 0.6 s when trucks constitute 5% of the traffic stream to 0.6 to 1.4 s when trucks are 30% of the traffic stream. The study also demonstrates a need to increase the all-red time by up to 0.5 s when trucks comprise 30% of the traffic stream.

AB The locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons is the major source of noradrenaline (NA) in the brain. Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm 'explore/exploit' task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level 'state-action' prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error-reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release-to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC that translates state-action prediction errors into an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.

ID STATISTICAL-MODEL
AB We study the problem of high-accuracy localization of mobile nodes in a multipath-rich environment where submeter accuracy values are required. We employ a peer-to-peer framework where nodes can get pairwise multipath-degraded ranging estimates in local neighborhoods, with the multipath noise correlated across time. The challenge is to enable high-accuracy positioning under severe multipath conditions when the fraction of received signals corrupted by multiple paths is significant. Our contributions are twofold. We provide a practical distributed localization algorithm by invoking an analytical graphical model framework based on particle filtering, and we validate its potential for high-accuracy localization through simulations. In a practical dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) mobile simulation setup, we show that the algorithm can achieve errors of < 1 m 90% of the time, even when the fraction of line-of-sight (LOS) signals is less than 35%. We also address design questions such as "how many anchors and what fraction of LOS measurements are needed to achieve a specified target accuracy?" by showing that the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for localization can be expressed as a product of two factors: a scalar function that depends only on the parameters of the noise distribution and a matrix that depends only on the geometry of node locations and the underlying connectivity graph. A simplified expression is obtained that provides an insightful understanding of the bound and that helps deduce the scaling behavior of the estimation error as a function of the number of agents and anchors in the network.

AB Purpose The supply chain management literature and agency theory suggest that preventing supplier non-conformance-a supplier's failure to conform to the requirements of the buyer-requires monitoring supplier behavior. However, case studies collected to explore how buyers monitored suppliers revealed an unexpected empirical phenomenon. Some buyers believed they could prevent non-conformance by either trusting their suppliers or relying on a third party, without monitoring their behavior. The purpose of this article is to examine conditions when buyers should monitor supplier behavior to prevent non-conformance. Design/methodology/approach This article employs a mixed-method design by formulating an agent-based simulation grounded in the case-study findings and agency theory to reconcile observed unexpected behaviors with scholarly suggestions. Findings The simulation results indicate that buyers facing severe consequences from non-conformance should opt to monitor supplier behavior. Sourcing from trusted suppliers should only be reserved for buyers that lack competence and have a small number of carefully selected suppliers. Moreover, buyers facing minor consequences from non-conformance should generally favor sourcing from trusted suppliers over monitoring their behavior. The results also suggest that having a third-party involved in monitoring suppliers is an effective path to preventing non-conformance. Originality/value By combining a simulation with qualitative case studies, this article examines whether buyers were making appropriate decisions, thereby offering contributions to theory and practice that would not have been possible using either methodological approach alone.

AB Background: When grown in three-dimensional (3D) cultures, epithelial cells typically form cystic organoids that recapitulate cardinal features of in vivo epithelial structures. Characterizing essential cell actions and their roles, which constitute the system's dynamic phenotype, is critical to gaining deeper insight into the cystogenesis phenomena.
   Methods: Starting with an earlier in silico epithelial analogue (ISEA1) that validated for several Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cell culture attributes, we built a revised analogue (ISEA2) to increase overlap between analogue and cell culture traits. Both analogues used agent-based, discrete event methods. A set of axioms determined ISEA behaviors; together, they specified the analogue's operating principles. A new experimentation framework enabled tracking relative axiom use and roles during simulated cystogenesis along with establishment of the consequences of their disruption.
   Results: ISEA2 consistently produced convex cystic structures in a simulated embedded culture. Axiom use measures provided detailed descriptions of the analogue's dynamic phenotype. Dysregulating key cell death and division axioms led to disorganized structures. Adhering to either axiom less than 80% of the time caused ISEA1 to form easily identified morphological changes. ISEA2 was more robust to identical dysregulation. Both dysregulated analogues exhibited characteristics that resembled those associated with an in vitro model of early glandular epithelial cancer.
   Conclusion: We documented the causal chains of events, and their relative roles, responsible for simulated cystogenesis. The results stand as an early hypothesis-a theory-of how individual MDCK cell actions give rise to consistently roundish, cystic organoids.

ID ADAPTATION; NETWORKS; ROBOTS
AB Evolution sculpts both the body plans and nervous systems of agents together over time. By contrast, in artificial intelligence and robotics, a robot's body plan is usually designed by hand, and control policies are then optimized for that fixed design. The task of simultaneously co-optimizing the morphology and controller of an embodied robot has remained a challenge. In psychology, the theory of embodied cognition posits that behaviour arises from a close coupling between body plan and sensorimotor control, which suggests why co-optimizing these two subsystems is so difficult: most evolutionary changes to morphology tend to adversely impact sensorimotor control, leading to an overall decrease in behavioural performance. Here, we further examine this hypothesis and demonstrate a technique for 'morphological innovation protection', which temporarily reduces selection pressure on recently morphologically changed individuals, thus enabling evolution some time to 'readapt' to the new morphology with subsequent control policy mutations. We show the potential for this method to avoid local optima and converge to similar highly fit morphologies across widely varying initial conditions, while sustaining fitness improvements further into optimization. While this technique is admittedly only the first of many steps that must be taken to achieve scalable optimization of embodied machines, we hope that theoretical insight into the cause of evolutionary stagnation in current methods will help to enable the automation of robot design and behavioural training-while simultaneously providing a test bed to investigate the theory of embodied cognition.

AB In the lyophilization process for injectable pharmaceuticals, the shelf of the lyophilizer is heated to the target temperature at a constant ramp rate during the primary drying process. Although the shelf temperature (T-s) and chamber pressure (P-c) have mainly been investigated to optimize the primary drying process, the impact of the ramp rate on the lyophilized cake properties is poorly understood. We evaluated the relationship between the ramp rate and cake properties using a model formulation containing 10% trehalose as a bulking agent. Elegant lyophilized cakes were obtained when lyophilization was conducted at a fast ramp rate. In contrast, the lyophilized cakes collapsed at slow ramp rate cycles. To identify the cause of collapse, the impact of the ramp rate on the collapse temperature (T-c) was evaluated by light transmission freeze-dry microscopy. The T-c decreased with the decrease in the ramp rate. Lower T-c and higher resistance of the dried matrix in the low sublimation state were hypothesized as the cause of the collapse. Numerous lyophilization runs were executed at different T-s and ramp rates. We confirmed that an increased ramp rate led to successful lyophilization at a higher T-s and that the drying time was significantly reduced. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A numerical model of glass-melt flow and bubble removal was applied in a pot melting space with a different character of melt flow. The linear-temperature gradients with a higher temperature either near the space wall or in the center of the melt level were put on the melt level to simulate the melt circulations, corresponding to melt heating through the pot wall and from the top, respectively. The removal times of the small bubbles have been calculated at different intensities of evoked melt circulations and compared with the values attained in the quiescent glass melt. The results have shown that the melt circulations increased the rising time of bubbles and consequently led to higher energy consumption and lower melting performance. The impact of melt circulations became stronger with the increasing intensity of the circulations and weakened with the increasing bubble growth rate. The removal times of critical bubbles were generally lower in the case of heating from the top and the relevant values obtained in the space at very low bubble growth rates and relatively high melt circulation velocities attained even lower values than in the quiescent melt. The low values of the bubble fining times were described by the characteristic shapes of the critical bubble trajectories. The case may be utilized for the fining of special glasses without addition of fining agents. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF HAEMATOLOGY

DT Article
ID INVIVO KINETICS; STORAGE
AB The precision and reproducibility of In-111 and Cr-51 platelet radiolabel agents for in vivo kinetic studies of stored platelet concentrates (PC) were investigated. The objective was to develop a precise method with concurrent labelling of two platelet populations using different isotopes, which would allow identification of small differences in in vivo platelet quality. Identical labelling procedures were used to investigate the effects of PC storage age, different methods of red cell (RBC) and white cell (WBC) contamination correction, and label elution correction on the results of In-111 and Cr-51 kinetic studies.
   In-111 and Cr-51 platelet survival curves from the same PC, even when uncorrected for elution and RBC contamination, exhibited excellent correlation, irrespective of the age of the concentrate and its viability. However, slightly higher, but statistically significant, post-infusion per cent recoveries with Cr-51 labelled platelets were found. Two factors were identified as the cause for this difference. There was a higher affinity of contaminating RBC/WBC in PC for Cr-51 than for In-111. With determination of RBC/WBC activity by centrifugation/density separation, RBC/WBC fractions from the injectate were found to contain 12.6 +/- 3.8% v 7.1 +/- 3-6% of total Cr-51 and In-111 activity, respectively, in 20 studies. In addition, there was a significantly higher In-111 activity in plasma immediately post-infusion than with Cr-51, 5.2 +/- 1.3% v 2.8 +/- 1-6%, respectively, suggesting more label elution or carryover. After correction for the activity of RBC/WBC and for elution or carryover, essentially identical Cr-51/In-111 platelet survival curves were found. In 31 stored PC studies, the absolute average difference between Cr-51 and In-111 per cent recoveries was only 4 +/- 3% in a group of donors whose platelet recoveries ranged from 10% to 80%. Similarly, the average difference between Cr-51 and In-111 survival was only 8 +/- 4 h within a range of survivals from 40 to 220 h.
   In conclusion, after correction for elution and contaminating RBC/WBC binding, these studies show that Cr-51 and In-111 may be used interchangeably for labelling of stored PC, and that small differences between test and control platelets could be reliably detected using concurrent labelling with simultaneous infusion.

AB Atmospheric aerosols modify the radiative budget of the Earth due to their optical, microphysical and chemical properties, and are considered one of the most uncertain climate forcing agents. In order to characterise the uncertainties associated with satellite and modelling approaches to represent aerosol optical properties, mainly aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE), their representation by different remote-sensing sensors and regional online coupled chemistry-climate models over Europe are evaluated. This work also characterises whether the inclusion of aerosolradiation (ARI) or/and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) help improve the skills of modelling outputs.
   Two case studies were selected within the EuMetChem COST Action ES1004 framework when important aerosol episodes in 2010 all over Europe took place: a Russian wild-fire episode and a Saharan desert dust outbreak that covered most of the Mediterranean Sea. The model data came from different regional air-quality-climate simulations performed by working group 2 of EuMetChem, which differed according to whether ARI or ACI was included or not. The remote-sensing data came from three different sensors: MODIS, OMI and SeaWIFS. The evaluation used classical statistical metrics to first compare satellite data versus the ground-based instrument network (AERONET) and then to evaluate model versus the observational data (both satellite and ground-based data).
   Regarding the uncertainty in the satellite representation of AOD, MODIS presented the best agreement with the AERONET observations compared to other satellite AOD observations. The differences found between remote-sensing sensors highlighted the uncertainty in the observations, which have to be taken into account when evaluating models. When modelling results were considered, a common trend for underestimating high AOD levels was observed. For the AE, models tended to underestimate its variability, except when considering a sectional approach in the aerosol representation. The modelling results showed better skills when ARI+ACI interactions were included; hence this improvement in the representation of AOD (above 30% in the model error) and AE (between 20 and 75 %) is important to provide a better description of aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions in regional climate models.

AB This study first employed micro-computed tomography technique for scanning the gas-fat coal sample; then, using Avizo software, coal's micro-pore structure model was established; finally, seepage behaviors of gas and water in the coal under a pressure of 3 MPa were simulated. Through comparison, it can be concluded that both gas pressure and water pressure decreased gradually along the seepage direction; at a same seepage length, water's maximum seepage pressure significantly exceeded that of gas; gas's velocity flow lines were overall fuller than water's flow lines; using a same pore model, gas's migration velocity far exceeded that of water; In terms of mass flow rate, water exceeded gas. The effluent mass flow rate at the outlet was smaller than the influent mass flow rate at the inlet. Overall, with the increase in the seepage length, gas and water's mean seepage pressures and mass flow rates all decreased gradually, while their mean seepage velocities fluctuated greatly. Since the pores at the different coal cross-sections were developed to different degrees, the heterogeneity of the coal structure meant that the cross-sectional area of the pore channel varied irregularly along the seepage direction. The fitting curve can be reduced to three classes: logistic linear regression curve, Boltzmann function curve, Exp Dec curve, or poly curve.

ID PRODUCTION INVENTORY SYSTEM; KANBAN CONTROL MECHANISMS
AB Heuristic production control policies such as CONWIP, kanban, and other hybrid policies have been in use for years as better alternatives to MRP-based push control policies. It is a fact that these policies, although efficient, are far from optimal. Our goal is to develop a methodology that, for a given system, finds a dynamic control policy via intelligent agents. Such a policy while achieving the productivity (i.e., demand service rate) goal of the system will optimize a cost/reward function based on the WIP inventory. To achieve this goal we applied a simulation-based optimization technique called Reinforcement Learning (RL) on a four-station serial line. The control policy attained by the application of a RL algorithm was compared with the other existing policies on the basis of total average WIP and average cost of WIP. We also develop a heuristic control policy in light of our experience gained from a close examination of the policies obtained by the RL algorithm. This heuristic policy named Behavior-Based Control (BBC), although placed second to the RL policy, proved to be a more efficient and leaner control policy than most of the existing policies in the literature. The performance of the BBC policy was found to be comparable to the Extended Kanban Control System (EKCS), which as per our experimentation, turned out to be the best of the existing policies. The numerical results used for comparison purposes were obtained from a four-station serial line with two different (constant and Poisson) demand arrival processes.

AB Background: Characterization of the blood labyrinth barrier (BLB) is extremely important to determine whether the BLB can be manipulated pharmacologically. However, experiments to investigate the BLB are technically difficult to perform. In this report, we demonstrated a unique method of controlling the BLB, and established the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin in perilymph, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood with and without mannitol.
   Study design: Controlled animal research project
   Methods: Permeability of the BLB and the blood brain barrier (BBB) to gentamicin with and without mannitol was studied by collecting 175 samples from 44 guinea pigs using concentrations relevant to human clinical situations. Samples were taken from two groups of 22 animals, with each animal undergoing sampling at a different time after administration of either 10 mg/ml gentamicin (4 mg/kg) (Gardena, CA) alone or gentamicin with 20% mannitol (250 mg/kg) (Mallinckrodt Inc., KY). The sample times varied from 0.5 to 17.5 h post-infusion. Samples were also taken from 4 animals as negative controls after administration of normal saline. Our goal was to simultaneously assess the pharmacokinetics of gentamicin in each of three different fluid samples in the same animal. Thus at the pre-determined post-infusion sampling time, each animal was sampled once for perilymph, CSF, and blood before being euthanized. Each animal contributed to a single time point on the subsequent pharmacokinetic curves with more than one animal per time point.
   Results: Mannitol increased the rate of entry and egress of gentamicin through BLB significantly (p = 0.0044) but the effects on the BBB did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.581). Mannitol did not alter renal clearance of gentamicin from the blood (p = 0.433). The concentration of gentamicin in perilymph and CSF was always significantly lower than in blood.
   Conclusions: Mannitol administration transiently increases the permeability of the BLB. Potential clinical benefits may accrue from selected timing of administration of osmotic agents such as mannitol augmenting the rate of entry and egress of compounds such as gentamicin into and out of perilymph.

TI Dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter
SO HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper presents a summary of the evidence review group (ERG) report on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dronedarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter based upon a review of the manufacturer's submission to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) as part of the single technology appraisal process. The population considered in the submission were adult clinically stable patients with a recent history of or current non-permanent AF. Comparators were the current available anti-arrhythmic drugs: class 1c agents (flecainide and propafenone), sotalol and amiodarone. Outcomes were AF recurrence, all-cause mortality, stroke, treatment discontinuations (due to any cause or due to adverse events) and serious adverse events. The main evidence came from four phase III randomised controlled trials, direct and indirect meta-analyses from a systematic review, and a synthesis of the direct and indirect evidence using a mixed-treatment comparison. Overall, the results from the different synthesis approaches showed that the odds of AF recurrence appeared statistically significantly lower with dronedarone and other anti-arrhythmic drugs than with non-active control, and that the odds of AF recurrence are statistically significantly higher for dronedarone than for amiodarone. However, the results for outcomes of all-cause mortality, stroke and treatment discontinuations and serious adverse events were all uncertain. A discrete event simulation model was used to evaluate dronedarone versus antiarrhythmic drugs and standard therapy alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of dronedarone was relatively robust and less than 20,000 pound per quality-adjusted life-year. Exploratory work undertaken by the ERG identified that the main drivers of cost-effectiveness were the benefits assigned to dronedarone for all-cause mortality and stroke. Dronedarone is not cost-effective relative to its comparators when the only effect of treatment is a reduction in AF recurrences. In conclusion, uncertainties remain in the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of dronedarone. In particular, the clinical evidence for the major drivers of cost-effectiveness (all-cause mortality and stroke), and consequently the additional benefits attributed in the economic model to dronedarone compared to other antiarrhythmic drugs are highly uncertain. The final guidance, issued by NICE on 25 August 2010, states that: Dronedarone is recommended as an option for the treatment of non-permanent atrial fibrillation only in people: whose atrial fibrillation is not controlled by first-line therapy (usually including beta-blockers), that is, as a second-line treatment option, and who have at least one of the following cardiovascular risk factors: - hypertension requiring drugs of at least two different classes, diabetes mellitus, previous transient ischaemic attack, stroke or systemic embolism, left atrial diameter of 50 mm or greater, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (noting that the summary of product characteristics [SPC] does not recommend dronedarone for people with left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35% because of limited experience of using it in this group) or age 70 years or older, and who do not have unstable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure.
   Furthermore, 'People who do not meet the criteria above who are currently receiving dronedarone should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinicians consider it appropriate to sop'.

AB Background: Various dosing strategies for cefepime have been developed in an effort to maximize pharmacodynamic exposure of this agent against gram-negative infections. An assessment of cefepime dosing strategies is warranted given recent reports of poorer treatment outcomes associated with cefepime compared with Other antibiotics, particularly In patients infected with gram-negative organisms with elevated MICs.
   Objectives: The aims of this study were to compare the efficacy of cefepime IV at a dose of 1 g q8h (adjusted based on renal function) with those of other appropriate antimicrobials in the treatment of gram-negative pulmonary and bloodstream Infections and to identify risk factors for treatment failure.
   Methods: This single-center, open-label, prospective, Observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center (Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri). Isolates from infections in adult patients with bacteremia Or pulmonary Infection Caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, or Citrobacter freundii were assessed in a noninterventional manner. Infections were identified using an electronic notification system. Patients receiving appropriate monotherapy against the studied isolate within 24 hours Of Culture attainment were stratified into 1 of 3 cohorts according to treatment Outcome, as follows: treatment success (resolution of initial fever or elevated white blood cell count to normal values Plus the presence of repeat negative cultures from the initial site or below the quantitative definition for infection), improvement (treatment success without repeat negative Cultures), or treatment failure (persistent or repeat positive cultures for the original organism at the infected site despite appropriate and adequate antimicrobial therapy, lack of resolution In fever or leukocytosis, switch to an alternative antibiotic, or the addition of another antibiotic with gram-negative coverage after >= 3 days of the initial regimen, relapse of infection within 14 days, or mortality attributable to the index infection). Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine risk factors associated with treatment failure.
   Results: Data from 120 patients (56.7%, male; mean age, 62.2 years) were analyzed. Treatment failure occurred in 48.6% (36/74) Of patients who , received cefepime versus 32.6% ( 15/46) of those who received other antibiotics; this difference was not statistically significant. The proportion of patients with markers of increased severity of Illness (Intensive care unit [P = 0.005] and mechanical ventilation [P = 0.002]) was significantly greater in the cefepime group compared with the group that received other antibiotics. Multivariate logistic regression identified infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.01-2.00]) and mechanical ventilation (AOR, 7.08 [95%, Cl, 1.80-31.3]) as being associated with treatment failure in patients who received cefepime. Mechanical ventilation (AOR, 3.97 [95% CI, 1.47-11.1]) and neutropenia (AOR, 5.26 [95% CI, 1.28-20.0]) were independent predictors of treatment failure among all patients studied.
   Conclusions: Based on these results in this small cohort, the efficacy of this cefepime dosing strategy (1 g q8h) appeared to be similar to that of other antimicrobials. (Clin Ther. 2009;31:299-310) (C) 2009 Excerpta Medica Inc.

AB The release of toxic airborne contaminants resulting from terrorist attacks on buildings can lead to disastrous consequences. To evaluate and reduce the effects of these emergencies, various methods and models have been developed in the past few years. Such work has provided effective tools for the building management system to do risk assessment of the contaminated areas. Although risk analysis methods to describe the contaminant dispersion scenarios made significant progress, these approaches did not generally consider the releasing scenario occurring in the ventilation system and the effect of human behavior during the developing process of an emergency event. Emergency strategies chosen by the decisionmaker are not always associated with the early-warning system, such as the sensor monitoring network and the source identification system inside the building. This study aims to provide a risk assessment model considering both the variation of contaminant concentration and occupant distribution after the release of toxic agents to obtain the exposure risk for people indoors. The contaminant dispersion is simulated using computational fluid dynamics. The evacuation process for people is modeled using Pathfinder, and the exposure risk for occupants under various emergency strategies is calculated using the efficiency factor of the contaminant source. The results of the exposure risk for 40 basic cases are discussed, and the optimal ventilation mode for these specific cases is recommended. Next, the impact of the variation of human behavior, contaminant detection time needed by sensors, and source identification time needed by inverse modeling on the exposure risk for people indoor is studied. The uncertainty and reproducibility of the numerical simulations are emphatically discussed in the Supporting Information.

AB In contemporary power systems, small-scale consumers account for up to 50% of a country's total electrical energy consumption. Nevertheless, not much has been achieved towards eliminating the problems caused by their inelastic consumption habits, namely the peaks in their daily power demand and the inability of energy suppliers to perform short-term forecasting and/or long-term portfolio management. Typical approaches applied in large-scale consumers, like providing targeted incentives for behavioral change, cannot be employed in this case due to the lack of models for everyday habits, activities and consumption patterns, as well as the inability to model consumer response based on personal comfort. Current work aspires to tackle these issues; it introduces a set of Small-scale consumer models that provide statistical descriptions of electrical consumption patterns, parameterized from the analysis of real-life consumption measurements. These models allow (i) bottom-up aggregation of appliance use up to the overall installation load, (ii) simulation of various energy efficiency scenarios that involve changes at appliance and/or activity level and (iii) the assessment of change in consumer habits, and therefore the power consumption, as a result of applying different pricing policies. Furthermore, an autonomous agent architecture is introduced that adopts the proposed consumer models to perform simulation and result analysis. The conducted experiments indicate that (i) the proposed approach leads to accurate prediction of small-scale consumption (in terms of energy consumption and consumption activities) and (ii) small shifts in appliance usage times are sufficient to achieve significant peak power reduction.

AB Gaze is an extremely powerful expressive signal that is used for many purposes, from expressing emotion to regulating human interaction. The use of gaze as a signal has been exploited to strong effect in hand-animated characters, greatly enhancing the believability of the character's simulated life. However, virtual humans animated in real-time have been less successful at using expressive gaze. One reason for this is that we lack a model of expressive gaze in virtual humans. A gaze shift towards any specific target can be performed in many different ways, using many different expressive manners of gaze, each of which can potentially imply a different emotional or cognitive internal state. However, there is currently no mapping that describes how a user will attribute these internal states to a virtual character performing a gaze shift in a particular manner. In this paper, we begin to address this by providing the results of an empirical study that explores the mapping between an observer's attribution of emotional state to gaze. The purpose of this mapping is to allow for an interactive virtual human to generate believable gaze shifts that a user will attribute a desired emotional state to. We have generated a set of animations by composing low-level gaze attributes culled from the nonverbal behavior literature. Then, subjects judged the animations displaying these attributes. While the results do not provide a complete mapping between gaze and emotion, they do provide a basis for a generative model of expressive gaze.

AB A series of simultaneous interpenetrating polymer networks, IPNs, based on a polyurethane and an unsaturated polyester resin is studied. The curing process was followed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The IPNs were seen to crosslink completely and the kinetics of the curing process were modified greatly, accelerating with respect to the pure homopolymers. The process of styrene-polyester copolymerization varies from an azeotropic copolymerization in the pure polyester state to alternating copolymerization in the IPNs. Miscibility, phase continuity and phase separation are studied by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA). In general, the IPNs obtained have a high degree of interpenetration and are semi-miscibles. Intermediate compositions are slightly less miscible than the outer ranges with a transition for the second component being apparent. The empirical loss modulus-composition curves are compared with those predicted by various theoretical models. In general, the IPNs follow the Budiansky model, which predicts a phase inversion at intermediate compositions. Compositions which are rich in a specific component show a continuous phase with the disperse minority component and the intermediate compositions show two co-continuous phases. It is also seen that these curves depend strongly on the temperature at which they are formed. The loss factor reveals strong synergism and the maximum of properties are found in a composition close to 40% in polyester. Comparison of simultaneous IPNs with sequential IPNs showed that the latter show a lesser tendency to phase separation in the systems studied. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The in vitro effect of magnesium (Mg) on platelet aggregation and platelet release function was evaluated in healthy volunteers, Platelet aggregation was induced with collagen, ADP, or thrombin after incubation of the sample with saline or increasing concentrations of magnesium sulphate (MgSO4) (0.5-8.0 mM). Mg showed a dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation in whole blood, platelet rich plasma and washed platelets, An antiaggregatory effect was also present with low Mg concentrations. Statistically significant inhibition of the mean aggregation response was obtained in 83% of the different media and agonists rested following the addition of 1.0 mM Mg, The remaining 17% were significantly inhibited with the addition of 2.0 mM Mg. The platelet synthesis of thromboxane A(2) and release of beta-thromboglobulin were also inhibited by Mg, in a dose-dependent manner. In order to evaluate if any of these effects were modified by conventional antithrombotic treatment with low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), volunteers were asked to meet on two consecutive days. On day 2 the participants were given 300 mg ASA orally, one hour prior to blood sampling. The Mg mediated effects were present independent of this pretreatment with ASA. Following stimulation with collagen a synergistic effect of Mg and ASA was demonstrated on platelet aggregation. The platelet inhibiting effect demonstrated in this study may in part explain the beneficial effect of Mg infusion in some patients with acute myocardial infarction, The effect of Mg infusion: given alone or administered simultaneously with ASA, should also be evaluated in other arterial thrombotic disease states.

TI A Decision Model Assessing the Owner and Contractor's Conflict Behaviors

SO ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID SUCCESS; FRAMEWORK
AB Considering the effects of the contractor's conflict behaviors on the project benefit, a decision model between the owner and contractor's conflict behaviors in construction projects was constructed using the principal-agent theory and game theory. The model was analyzed under nonconflicting and conflicting conditions, and a numerical simulation and example analysis were proposed to verify the constructed model's conclusion. The results showed that the effort levels of the owner and contractor not only relate to benefit-sharing coefficient and effort outcome coefficient but also depend on the contractor's ability of converting the conflict into benefit and the loss caused by conflict behaviors. A higher ability of converting conflicts into benefits and lower levels of the loss caused by conflict behaviors for the contractor lead to lower levels of the net benefit of the owner, conversely higher levels of the net benefit of the contractor. Balancing the contractor's ability of converting conflicts into benefits and the loss caused by conflict behaviors lead to a more reasonable risk allocation between the owner and contractor, improving the effort level and net benefit. To add value to the construction project, the owner should establish an impartial and reasonable benefit-sharing mechanism, optimize the owner and contractor's resource arrangement, maximize the positive effect of conflict on project benefits, and avoid the negative effect of conflict. Few studies to date have investigated the effects of conflict behaviors on project benefits in terms of modeling and simulation in construction projects. As such, this study bridges this gap and contributes significant theoretical and practical insights about managing conflict behaviors in an interorganizational context, thus enhancing performance in construction projects.

   BEHAVIOR; HEALTH; IMPACT; OPTIMIZATION; QUALITY
AB Computational models have gained popularity as a predictive tool for assessing proposed policy changes affecting dietary choice. Specifically, they have been used for modeling dietary changes in response to economic interventions, such as price and income changes. Herein, we present a novel addition to this type of model by incorporating habitual behaviors that drive individuals to maintain or conform to prior eating patterns. We examine our method in a simulated case study of food choice behaviors of low-income adults in the US. We use data from several national datasets, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the US Bureau of Labor Statistics and the USDA, to parameterize our model and develop predictive capabilities in 1) quantifying the influence of prior diet preferences when food budgets are increased and 2) simulating the income elasticities of demand for four food categories. Food budgets can increase because of greater affordability (due to food aid and other nutritional assistance programs), or because of higher income. Our model predictions indicate that low-income adults consume unhealthy diets when they have highly constrained budgets, but that even after budget constraints are relaxed, these unhealthy eating behaviors are maintained. Specifically, diets in this population, before and after changes in food budgets, are characterized by relatively low consumption of fruits and vegetables and high consumption of fat. The model results for income elasticities also show almost no change in consumption of fruit and fat in response to changes in income, which is in agreement with data from the World Bank's International Comparison Program (ICP). Hence, the proposed method can be used in assessing the influences of habitual dietary patterns on the effectiveness of food policies.

AB The aim of the presented work was to design, formulate and evaluate the properties of low-acyl gellan macro beads with the potential application as carriers for oral delivery of meloxicam (MLX) in the prophylaxis of colorectal cancer. The beads were obtained by means of ionotropic gelation technique. Calcium chloride (1.0%, 9.0 x 10(-2) M) was used as the cross-linking agent. Nine different polymer, drug and surfactant (Tween (R) 80) mixtures were used for production of the beads. The quantitative compositions of the mixtures were generated with the application of the Design of Experiments (DoE) modulus from the STATISTICA Software. The prepared formulations revealed 7.2-27.0% of drug loading and 29.2-50.7% drug encapsulation efficiency. It turned out that 0.5% amount of gellan gum in the mixtures was not sufficient to obtain spherical beads. The morphology and surface of the dried beads were analyzed by SEM. Raman spectra confirmed that MLX did not undergo structural changes during production of the beads. The swelling behavior and degradation of the beads were evaluated in three simulated gastrointestinal fluids at different pH (1.2; 4.5; 6.8). The MLX in vitro release studies were conducted on USP apparatus IV, working in the open loop mode. The obtained results showed that MLX release from the dried beads was pH-dependent. The formulations obtained from mixtures containing 1.0 and 1.5% of gellan may be considered as oral dosage forms for MLX, intended to omit the stomach and release the drug in the distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

AB This paper examines psycho-induced overconsumption in a dynamic stochastic context. As emphasized by well-established psychological results, these psycho-distortions derive from a decision making based on simple rules-of-thumb, not on analytically sounded optimizations. To our end, we therefore compare two New Keynesian models. The first is populated by optimizing Muth-rational agents and acts as the normative benchmark. The other is a "psycho-perturbed" version of the benchmark that allows for the potential presence of overoptimism and, hence, of overconsumption. The parameters of these models are estimated through a Bayesian-type procedure, and performances are evaluated by employing an entropy measure. Such methodologies are particularly appropriate here since they take in full consideration the complexity generated by the randomness of the considered systems. In particular, they let to derive a not negligible information on the size and on the cyclical properties of the biases. In line with cognitive psychology suggestions our evidence shows that the overoptimism/overconsumption is: widespread it is detected in nation-wide data; persistent it emerges in full-sample estimations; it moves according to the expected cyclical behavior larger in booms, and it disappears in crises. Moreover, by taking into account the effect of these psycho-biases, the model fits actual data better than the benchmark. All considered, then, enhancing the existing literature our findings: i) sustain the importance of inserting psychological distortions in macroeconomic models and ii) underline that system dynamics and psycho biases have statistically significant and economically important connections.

AB Background: Three-dimensional (3D) embedded cell cultures provide an appropriate physiological environment to reconstruct features of early glandular epithelial cancer. Although these are orders of magnitude simpler than tissues, they too are complex systems that have proven challenging to understand. We used agent-based, discrete event simulation modeling methods to build working hypotheses of mechanisms of epithelial 3D culture phenotype and early cancer progression. Starting with an earlier software analogue, we validated an improved in silico epithelial analogue (ISEA) for cardinal features of a normally developed MDCK cyst. A set of axiomatic operating principles defined simulated cell actions. We explored selective disruption of individual simulated cell actions. New framework features enabled recording detailed measures of ISEA cell activities and morphology.
   Results: Enabled by a small set of cell operating principles, ISEA cells multiplied and self-organized into cyst-like structures that mimicked those of MDCK cells in a 3D embedded cell culture. Selective disruption of "anoikis" or directional cell division caused the ISEA to develop phenotypic features resembling those of in vitro tumor reconstruction models and cancerous tissues in vivo. Disrupting either process, or both, altered cell activity patterns that resulted in morphologically similar outcomes. Increased disruption led to a prolonged presence of intraluminal cells.
   Conclusions: ISEA mechanisms, behaviors, and morphological properties may have biological counterparts. To the extent that in silico-to-in vitro mappings are valid, the results suggest plausible, additional mechanisms of in vitro cancer reconstruction or reversion, and raise potentially significant implications for early cancer diagnosis based on histology. Further ISEA development and use are expected to provide a viable platform to complement in vitro methods for unraveling the mechanistic basis of epithelial morphogenesis and cancer progression.

AB Researchers in judgment and decision making have long debunked the idea that we are economically rational optimizers. However, problematic assumptions of rationality remain common in studies of agricultural economics and climate change adaptation, especially those that involve quantitative models. Recent movement toward more complex agent-based modeling provides an opportunity to reconsider the empirical basis for farmer decision making. Here, we reconceptualize farmer decision making from the ground up, using an in situ mental models approach to analyze weather and climate risk management. We assess how large-scale commercial grain farmers in South Africa (n = 90) coordinate decisions about weather, climate variability, and climate change with those around other environmental, agronomic, economic, political, and personal risks that they manage every day. Contrary to common simplifying assumptions, we show that these farmers tend to satisfice rather than optimize as they face intractable and multifaceted uncertainty; they make imperfect use of limited information; they are differently averse to different risks; they make decisions on multiple time horizons; they are cautious in responding to changing conditions; and their diverse risk perceptions contribute to important differences in individual behaviors. We find that they use two important nonoptimizing strategies, which we call cognitive thresholds and hazy hedging, to make practical decisions under pervasive uncertainty. These strategies, evident in farmers' simultaneous use of conservation agriculture and livestock to manage weather risks, are the messy in situ performance of naturalistic decision-making techniques. These results may inform continued research on such behavioral tendencies in narrower lab- and modeling-based studies.

AB Mammals scent mark their territories to advertise occupancy and ownership. However, signaling with scent for territorial defense can have a negative effect by advertising an individual's presence and location to predators. In this study, we measured responses to a simulated territorial intrusion by conspecific adult male Eurasian beavers (Castor fiber) either in the localized presence or in the absence of odor of a predator to test the hypothesis that the territorial defense of free-living beavers would be disrupted by the presence of predation risk in their natural environment. We predicted that beavers would significantly reduce their willingness to countermark intruder's scent in the presence of the scent of predators (wolf [Canis lupus] and lynx [Lynx lynx]), compared with a control (no odor), as responses are in general stronger to predator scent marks than nonpredator scent. Therefore, we also predicted that the effects of nonpredatory mammal scent (neophobic control) (eland [Taurotragus oryx] and horse [Equus cabalus]) are to be expected somewhere in between the effects of the predator odor and a control. Our results suggest that both predator and nonpredator scents reduce beavers response to a simulated intruder's scent mounds and therefore disrupt their territorial defense. However, predator scent had a stronger effect than nonpredator scent. Beavers may therefore be at great risk on territories with predators present because of the trade-off between predator avoidance and territorial defense. Our study demonstrates the potential of predation risk as a powerful agent of counterselection on olfactory signaling behavior.

AB Little is known about optimal application and behavior of exposure propensity scores (EPS) in small studies. In a cohort of 103,133 elderly Medicaid beneficiaries in New Jersey, the effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug use on 1-year all-cause mortality was assessed (1995-1997) based on the assumption that there is no protective effect and that the preponderance of any observed effect would be confounded. To study the comparative behavior of EPS, disease risk scores, and "conventional" disease models, the authors randomly resampled 1,000 subcohorts of 10,000, 1,000, and 500 persons. The number of variables was limited in disease models, but not EPS and disease risk scores. Estimated EPS were used to adjust for confounding by matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting, stratification, and modeling. The crude rate ratio of death was 0.68 for users of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. "Conventional" adjustment resulted in a rate ratio of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.77, 0.84). The rate ratio closest to 1 (0.85) was achieved by inverse probability of treatment weighting (95% confidence interval: 0.82, 0.88). With decreasing study size, estimates remained further from the null value, which was most pronounced for inverse probability of treatment weighting (n = 500: rate ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.26, 1.68). In this setting, analytic strategies using EPS or disease risk scores were not generally superior to "conventional" models. Various ways to use EPS and disease risk scores behaved differently with smaller study size.

TI Adenosinergic modulation of rat basal forebrain neurons during sleep and

AB 1. The cholinergic system of the basal forebrain (BF) is hypothesized to play an important role in behavioural and electrocortical arousal. Adenosine has been proposed as a sleep-promoting substance that induces sleep by inhibiting cholinergic neurons of the BF and brainstem. However, adenosinergic influences on the activity of BF neurons in naturally awake and sleeping animals have not been demonstrated.
   2. We recorded the sleep-make discharge profile of BF neurons and simultaneously assessed adenosinergic influences on wake- and sleep-related activity of these neurons by delivering adenosinergic agents adjacent to the recorded neurons with a microdialysis probe. Discharge rates of BF neurons were recorded through two to three sleep-wake episodes during baseline (artificial cerebrospinal fluid perfusion), and after delivering an adenosine transport inhibitor (s-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine; NBTI), or exogenous adenosine, or a selective adenosine A1. receptor antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine; CPDX).
   3. NBTI and adenosine decreased the discharge rate of BF neurons during both waking and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In contrast, CPDX increased the discharge rate of BF neurons during both waking and NREM sleep. These results suggest that in naturally awake and sleeping animals, adenosine exerts tonic inhibitory influences on BF neurons, supporting the hypothesized role of adenosine in sleep regulation.
   4. However, in the presence of exogenous adenosine, NBTI or CPDX, BF neurons retained their wake- and sleep-related discharge patterns, i.e. still exhibited changes in discharge rate during transitions between waking and NREM sleep. This suggests that other neuro transmitters/neuromodulators also contribute to the sleep-wake discharge modulation of BF neurons.

AB Expansion joints in bridge superstructures are often difficult to maintain, leading to the problems associated with water leakage and debris accumulation. As a potential solution, link slabs can be placed at the expansion joints, providing a continuous deck system. Despite the promise of such a system, there have been standing questions on the materials of choice and structural configurations appropriate for link slabs, especially in their transition zone from the bridge deck to their debonded region. This motivated the current study to investigate various reinforcement alternatives using full-scale laboratory tests and numerical simulations. To achieve a satisfactory crack resistance, a fiber-reinforced concrete (FRC) mixture was developed for the tested link slabs. In addition, two rebar alternatives, i.e., steel and GFRP rebars, were evaluated to ensure a proper transfer of stresses induced by negative bending moments (due to continuity) and to limit the width of cracks on the top surface of the link slabs, where they are directly exposed to water and deleterious agents. The full-scale performance was examined under increasing vertical loads applied to the midpoint of two individual spans connected by a link slab. This included an investigation of various structural response measures, such as strains in the FRC and embedded rebars. The study was then extended by performing a set of finite-element simulations to understand the effects of reinforcement details. The outcome of this study provided holistic information on how flexible link slabs can be utilized for jointless bridge superstructures, addressing the concerns regarding their performance and durability.

AB The activities of this paper were focused on an in-situ fabrication process for producing two self-healing systems containing dicyclopentadiene and 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene monomers encapsulated in a urea-formaldehyde shell and integration methods applied in the epoxy matrix to analyse and compare the influences of their integration into the neat epoxy matrix. The self-healing systems were first synthesized according to a literature review, and subsequently, an optimization process was conducted for the fabrication process. Neat epoxy specimens were fabricated as reference specimens and subjected to flexural tests. Several integration methods for incorporating the self-healing systems into the epoxy resin were investigated. The optimal method presenting the best dispersion of the healing system was achieved by reducing the viscosity of the epoxy matrix with 10 vol % acetone solution, the addition of a microcapsule in the matrix, and homogenization at 60 degrees C at 100 rpm. Thermal analysis was performed in order to observe the mass loss obtained with an increasing temperature and phase changes for both poly-urea-formaldehyde (PUF)-dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and melamine-urea-formaldehyde (MUF)-5-ethylidene-2-norbornene (ENB) systems. The thermogravimetric analysis performed for the PUF-DCPD system indicates a total loss of mass in the range of 30-500 degrees C of 72.604% and for the MUF-ENB system, indicates a total mass loss in the range of 30-500 degrees C of 74.093%. Three-point bending tests showed higher mechanical properties for PUF-DCPD (80%) than MUF-ENB (40%) compared to the neat epoxy systems. Numerical simulations were performed to obtain a better understanding of the microcapsule behavior when embedded in an epoxy matrix.

AB Microtubules (MTs) are protein polymers that exhibit a unique type of behavior referred to as dynamic instability. That is, they undergo periods of growth (through the addition of GTPtubulin) and shortening (through the subtraction of GDP-tubulin). Shortening events are very fast, where this transition is referred to as a catastrophe. There are many processes that regulate MT dynamic instability, however, recent experiments show that MT dynamics may be highly regulated by a MTs age, where young MTs are less likely to undergo shortening events than older ones. In this paper, we develop a novel modeling approach to describe how the age of a MT affects its dynamic properties. In particular, we extend on a previously developed model that describes MT dynamics, by proposing a new concept for GTP-tubulin hydrolysis (the process by which newly incorporated GTP-tubulin is hydrolyzed to lower energy GDP-tubulin). In particular, we assume that hydrolysis is mainly vectorial, age-dependent and delayed according to the GTP-tubulin incorporation into the MT. Through numerical simulation, we are able to show how MT age affects certain properties that define MT dynamics. For example, simulations illustrate how the aging process leads to an increase in the rate of GTP-tubulin hydrolysis for older MTs, as well as increases in catastrophe frequency. Also, since it has been found that MT dynamic instability is affected by chemotherapy microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs), we highlight the fact that our model can be used to investigate the action of MTAs on MT dynamics by varying certain model parameters.

AB An escape response is a rapid manoeuvre used by prey to evade predators. Performing this manoeuvre at greater speed, in a favourable direction, or from a longer distance have been hypothesized to enhance the survival of prey, but these ideas are difficult to test experimentally. We examined how prey survival depends on escape kinematics through a novel combination of experimentation and mathematical modelling. This approach focused on zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae under predation by adults and juveniles of the same species. High-speed three-dimensional kinematics were used to track the body position of prey and predator and to determine the probability of behavioural actions by both fish. These measurements provided the basis for an agent-based probabilistic model that simulated the trajectories of the animals. Predictions of survivorship by this model were found by Monte Carlo simulations to agree with our observations and we examined how these predictions varied by changing individual model parameters. Contrary to expectation, we found that survival may not be improved by increasing the speed or altering the direction of the escape. Rather, zebrafish larvae operate with sufficiently high locomotor performance due to the relatively slow approach and limited range of suction feeding by fish predators. We did find that survival was enhanced when prey responded from a greater distance. This is an ability that depends on the capacity of the visual and lateral line systems to detect a looming threat. Therefore, performance in sensing, and not locomotion, is decisive for improving the survival of larval fish prey. These results offer a framework for understanding the evolution of predator-prey strategy that may inform prey survival in a broad diversity of animals.

AB The generally accepted Moolgavkar's theory of carcinogenesis assumes that all cancers are clonal, i.e. that they arise from progressive genetic deregulation in a cell pedigree originating from a single ancestral cell.(18) However, recently the clonal theory has been challenged by the field theory of carcinogenesis, which admits the possibility of simultaneous changes in tissue subject to carcinogenic agents, such as tobacco smoke in lung cancer. Axelrod et al.(1) formulated a more detailed framework, in which partially transformed cells depend in a mutualistic way on growth factors they produce, in this way enabling these cells to proliferate and undergo further transformations. On the other hand, the field theory assumes spatial distribution of precancerous cells and indeed there exists evidence that early-stage precancerous lesions in lung cancer progress along linear, tubular, or irregular surface structures. This seems to be the case for the atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH),(10) a likely precursor of adenocarcinoma of the lung. In this paper we explore the consequences of linking the model of spatial growth of precancerous cells,(12) with the mutualistic hypothesis. We investigate the solutions of the model using analytical and computational techniques. The picture emerging from our modelling indicates that production of growth factors by cells considered may lead to diffusion-driven instability, which in turn may lead either to decay of both population, or to emergence of local growth foci, represented by spike-like solutions. Mutualism may, in some situations, increase the stability of solutions. One important conclusion is that models of field carcinogenesis, which include spatial effects, generally have very different behaviour compared to ODE models.

AB Purpose This study aims to examine the links between office types (cellular, shared-room, small and medium-sized open-plan) and employees' subjective well-being regarding cognitive and affective evaluations and the role perceived noise levels at work has on the aforementioned associations. Design/methodology/approach A survey with measures of office types, perceived noise levels at work and the investigated facets of subjective well-being (cognitive vs affective) was distributed to employees working as real estate agents in Sweden. In total, 271 useable surveys were returned and were analyzed using analyses of variance (ANOVAs) and a regression-based model mirroring a test of moderated mediation. Findings A significant difference was found between office types on the well-being dimension related to cognitive, but not affective, evaluations. Employees working in cellular and shared-room offices reported significantly higher ratings on this dimension than employees working in open-plan offices, and employees in medium-sized open-plan offices reported significantly lower cognitive evaluation scores than employees working in all other office types. This pattern of results was mediated by perceived noise levels at work, with employees in open-plan (vs cellular and shared-room) offices reporting less satisfactory noise perceptions and, in turn, lower well-being scores, especially regarding the cognitive (vs affective) dimension. Originality/value This is one of the first studies to compare the relative impact of office types on both cognitive and affective well-being dimensions while simultaneously testing and providing empirical support for the presumed process explaining the link between such aspects.

AB Effective targeted delivery of nanoparticle agents may enhance the remediation of soils and site characterization efforts. Nanoparticles coated with Pluronic, an amphiphilic block co-polymer, demonstrated targeted binding behaviour toward light non-aqueous phase liquids such as heavy crude oil. Various factors including coating concentration, oil concentration, oil type, temperature, and pH were assessed to determine their effect on nanoparticle binding to heavy crude oil-impacted sandy aquifer material. Nanoparticle binding was increased by decreasing the coating concentration, increasing oil concentration, using heavier oil types, and increasing temperature, while pH over the range of 5-9 was found to have no effect. Nanoparticle transport and binding in columns packed with clean and oily porous media demonstrated the ability for efficient nanoparticle targeted binding. For the conditions explored, the attachment rate coefficient in columns packed with clean sand was 2.10 +/- 0.66 x 10(-4) s(-1); however, for columns packed with oil-impacted sand a minimum attachment rate coefficient of 8.86 +/- 0.43 x 10(-4) s(-1) was estimated. The higher attachment rate for the oil-impacted sand system indicates that nanoparticles may preferentially accumulate to oil-impacted zones present at heterogeneous impacted sites. Simulations were used to demonstrate this hypothesis using the set of parameters generated in this effort. This work contributes to our understanding of the application conditions that are required for efficient targeted binding of nanoparticles to crude-oil impacted porous media. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An immense technological challenge of polypropylene-based composites is in optimising the effect of multicomponent fractions on their mechanical properties. Hence the main aim of the present study is to carry out a systematic statistical approach to investigate the impact of multicomponent fractions on the mechanical properties of Polypropylene (PP)/Talc/ Polyolefin Elastomer (POE) and maleic-anhydride-grafted Polypropylene (PPMA) composites. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Central Composite Design (CCD) has been implemented as the design of experiment technique. With respect to CCD and three different weight percentages of Talc (0, 15, 30 wt%), POE (0, 10, 20 wt%), and PPMA (0, 2.5, 5 wt%), 17 experiments were designed and prepared via a conventional melt blending technique. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) with diagnostic figures has been proposed to derive mathematical models to predict the mechanical properties of the utilised PP based composite. The findings showed that the concentration of POE, particularly at a lower amount, play a significant role and can predominantly affect the properties of the composites. The results also revealed that in spite of Talc and PPMA, adding of POE caused a noticeable rise in ductility and toughness of composite and a reduction in the stiffness. It was also found that all the assessed properties can be maximized simultaneously, providing the content of Talc, POE, and PPMA set to be 30%, 6.228%, and 2.514%, respectively. The findings are found to be aligned with the scanning electron microscopy micrographs and the DSC analysis data.

AB The study of relations between cities has long been a major focus in urban research. For decades, this field has grown integrating contributions from many disciplines. But today, the field appears rather fragmented. This study analyses the body of literature that has developed over the last 23 years to identify schools of thought on interurban relationships and to see to what extent these interact with each other. It does so by innovatively employing bibliometric analysis to the study of systems of cities, which allows a bottom-up identification of five schools of thought: one predominantly focusing on the regional or intra-metropolitan scale and centred on concepts of polycentricity; one addressing the global scale with a focus on world city networks; one employing simulation and complexity theories to understand behaviour of agents building the urban system bottom-up; one rooted in (new) economic geography and focusing on growth and decline in the urban system; and, one seeking regularities with respect to city size distributions. The conceptual, methodological and empirical aspects of these different schools are discussed by means of a 'semantic map' derived from the vocabulary of titles and abstracts of papers. The coupling of the semantic map with the citation networks of these schools of thought confirms the increasing fragmentation of the field over the last decades. However, in the most recent years, the different schools of thought start to interact slightly more. The desirability and feasibility of a move from multidisciplinarity to interdisciplinarity in urban systems research needs further exploration.

AB The coarsening of emulsion droplets by Ostwald ripening is studied by means of numerical simulations in which time-dependent (elastic) interfacial behaviour is taken into account. Theoretical calculations on the dissolution of a single emulsion droplet in an infinite medium at saturated conditions show that the dissolution process can be stopped only when the interfacial tension goes to zero. When interfacial stress relaxation is included, which prevents a continuous zero interfacial tension, no stabilisation of the dissolution process is observed and the droplet dissolves completely. In the case of an ensemble of droplets, numerical calculations on the coarsening of emulsion droplets with finite interfacial elasticity show that a stable situation occurs at finite interfacial tensions of the droplets. This applies for a closed system with the same assumptions as those made in the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner (LSW) theory. The coarsening behaviour strongly depends on the saturation of the dispersed phase in the continuous phase. If the system is in contact with atmosphere, saturation will finally go to unity and stabilisation will only occur for zero interfacial tension of the droplets. For an ensemble of droplets in a closed system, the calculations show that stress-relaxation of the interface causes the Ostwald-ripening process to continue, so no stable situation is reached. Stabilisation can only be accomplished by adding insoluble species to the dispersed phase, by using particles as stabilisers or by micro-encapsulation of the emulsion droplets by thick insoluble interfacial layers, which have a thickness that is in the order of the radius of the droplet.

AB Background: The movement patterns of wild animals depend crucially on the spatial and temporal availability of resources in their habitat. To date, most attempts to model this relationship were forced to rely on simplified assumptions about the spatiotemporal distribution of food resources. Here we demonstrate how advances in statistics permit the combination of sparse ground sampling with remote sensing imagery to generate biological relevant, spatially and temporally explicit distributions of food resources. We illustrate our procedure by creating a detailed simulation model of fruit production patterns for Dipteryx oleifera, a keystone tree species, on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panama.
   Methodology and Principal Findings: Aerial photographs providing GPS positions for large, canopy trees, the complete census of a 50-ha and 25-ha area, diameter at breast height data from haphazardly sampled trees and long-term phenology data from six trees were used to fit 1) a point process model of tree spatial distribution and 2) a generalized linear mixed-effect model of temporal variation of fruit production. The fitted parameters from these models are then used to create a stochastic simulation model which incorporates spatio-temporal variations of D. oleifera fruit availability on BCI.
   Conclusions and Significance: We present a framework that can provide a statistical characterization of the habitat that can be included in agent-based models of animal movements. When environmental heterogeneity cannot be exhaustively mapped, this approach can be a powerful alternative. The results of our model on the spatio-temporal variation in D. oleifera fruit availability will be used to understand behavioral and movement patterns of several species on BCI.

AB The increasing availability of spatial micro data offers new potential for understanding the micro foundations of urban spatial dynamics. However, because urban systems are complex, induction alone is insufficient. Nonlinearities and path dependence imply that qualitatively new dynamics can emerge due to stochastic shocks or threshold effects. Given the policy needs for managing urban growth and decline and the growing desire for sustainable urban forms, models must be able not only to explain empirical regularities, but also characterize system-level dynamics and assess the plausible range of outcomes under alternative scenarios. Towards this end, we discuss a comprehensive modeling approach that is comprised of bottom-up and top-down models in which both inductive and deductive approaches are used to describe and explain urban spatial dynamics. We propose that this comprehensive modeling approach consists of three iterative tasks: (1) identify empirical regularities in the spatial pattern dynamics of key meso and macro variables; (2) explain these regularities with process-based micro models that link individual behavior to the emergence of meso and macro dynamics; and (3) determine the systems dynamical equations that characterize the relationships between micro processes and meso and macro pattern dynamics. Along the way, we also clarify types of complexity (input and output) and discuss dimensions of complexity (spatial, temporal, and behavioral). While no one to date has achieved this kind of comprehensive modeling, meaningful progress has been made in characterizing and explaining urban spatial dynamics. We highlight examples of this work from the recent literature and conclude with a discussion of key challenges.

AB With the rapid progress in the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the observed patterns in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) encephalitis has changed, allowing herpesvirus (HV) infection to be controlled. HAART was first administered to HIV patients in Cuba in 2001. Consequently with the aim of investigate the behavior of the HVs causing neurological disorders in this population in the post-HAART era, the authors perform a clinical evaluation by a multiplex nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for simultaneous detection of human HVs - herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicellazoster virus (VZV), cytornegalovirus (CMV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The authors studied 241 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) received at the Sexually Transmitted Diseases Laboratory between 2001 and 2005 inclusive. Of the 241 CSF studied, 10.4% resulted positive for HV infections. Of these, 92% of patients were acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) individuals at the C3 stage. CMV (44%), EBV (28%), and dual-HV (16%) infections were the most important agents identified. The principal clinical manifestations were fever, headache, vomiting, and focal abnormalities; the latter being associated with an increased risk of death. A statistically significant result was observed when central nervous system (CNS) disease evolution was compared between patients who were under HAART against those who were not, before they developed encephalitis. It was therefore concluded that it is more likely that HIV individuals receiving HAART have a better recovery of CNS infections than those who are not receiving it.

AB The problem of the asymptotic dynamics of a quarantine/isolation model with time delay is considered, subject to two incidence functions, namely standard incidence and the Holling type II (saturated) incidence function. Rigorous qualitative analysis of the model shows that it exhibits essentially the same (equilibrium) dynamics regardless of which of the two incidence functions is used. In particular, for each of the two incidence functions, the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction threshold quantity is less than unity. Further, it has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. For the case with the Holling type II incidence function, it is shown that the unique endemic equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable for a special case. The permanence of the disease is also established for the model with the Holling type II incidence function. Furthermore, it is shown that adding time delay to and/or replacing the standard incidence function with the Holling type II incidence function in the corresponding autonomous quarantine/isolation model with standard incidence (considered in Safi and Gumel (2010)1101) does not alter the qualitative dynamics of the autonomous system (with respect to the elimination or persistence of the disease). Finally, numerical simulations of the model with standard incidence show that the disease burden decreases with increasing time delay (incubation period). Furthermore, models with time delay seem to be more suitable for modeling the 2003 SARS outbreaks than those without time delay. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB All organisms engage in parasitic relations, as either parasites or hosts. Some species may even play both roles simultaneously. Among flowering plants, the most widespread form of parasitism is characterized by the development of an intrusive organ called the haustorium, which absorbs water and nutrients from the host. Despite this functionally unifying feature of parasitic plants, haustoria are not homologous structures; they have evolved 12 times independently. These plants represent ca. 1% of all extant flowering species and show a wide diversity of life histories. A great variety of plants may also serve as hosts, including other parasitic plants. This phenomenon of parasitic exploitation of another parasite, broadly known as hyper- or epiparasitism, is well described among bacteria, fungi, and animals, but remains poorly understood among plants. Here, we review empirical evidence of plant hyperparasitism, including variations of self-parasitism, discuss the diversity and ecological importance of these interactions, and suggest possible evolutionary mechanisms. Hyperparasitism may provide benefits in terms of improved nutrition and enhanced host-parasite compatibility if partners are related. Different forms of self-parasitism may facilitate nutrient sharing among and within parasitic plant individuals, while also offering potential for the evolution of hyperparasitism. Cases of hyperparasitic interactions between parasitic plants may affect the ecology of individual species and modulate their ecosystem impacts. Parasitic plant phenology and disperser feeding behavior are considered to play a major role in the occurrence of hyperparasitism, especially among mistletoes. There is also potential for hyperparasites to act as biological control agents of invasive primary parasitic host species.

AB The increasing prevalence of Lyme disease and the emergence of other tick-associated human diseases in the United States have become a major public health concern. A wide variety of personal protection measures and tick control strategies have been used or investigated to reduce contact between ticks and humans, reduce tick abundance, or lower the prevalence of tick-borne agents in the ticks. These methods have generally been applied or evaluated as single interventions and other than some early computer model simulations, studies applying integrated tick management approaches are few. In this paper, we review surveyed human behaviors and risks for exposure to ticks, concepts pertinent to integrated pest management for ticks, simulation models, various tick control strategies, integrated tick management studies, and highlight what is needed going forward. Increased education and communication between physicians and veterinarians is essential to address tick-associated diseases in a 'one health' approach and unify the animal and human branches of medicine to identify, treat, and implement preventive measures. Novel simulation models using more recent empirical data on tick population dynamics, hosts, efficacy of various combinations of interventions, human exposure elements, and utilization of personal and environmental measures will help us better understand the interactions of integrated strategies for tick population management. Many questions remain related to the ecology of ticks and tick-borne pathogens, observed and modeled efficacy of various integrated interventions, human behavior and exposure to tick bite and disease risk, comparative cost of interventions, and the acceptance and use of prevention and tick control tools.

AB The paper presents a technical introduction to psychological theories of emotions. It highlights a usable idea implemented in a number of recently developed computational systems of emotions, and the hypothesis that emotion can play the role of a scheduling variable in controlling autonomous robots. In the main part of this study, we outline our own computational system of emotion - xEmotion - designed as a key structural element in the developed target device, being an Intelligent System of Decision-making (ISD) for autonomous and robotic units.
   The ISD system has a cognitive architecture based on the principles of human psychology. The main purpose of building such a system is to prepare a framework for autonomous units used in system engineering (Kowalczuk and Czubenko, 2011; Czubenko et al., 2015). In particular, ISD is based on the concepts of cognitive psychology (in information processing) and motivation theory, which includes the system of needs (for decision-making). The xEmotion subsystem, however, focuses on modeling an alternative approach based on emotion. The xEmotion implementation covers aspects of somatic, appraisal and evolutionary theories of emotions using fuzzy sets.
   In this article, we also illustrate the core emotional behavior of the ISD system using simulation. The first application is a user interface for identifying emotions and predicting human behavior. The second is an eSailor simulation, which illustrates the possible behavior of the xEmotion subsystem. The last is an xDriver simulation experiment, which is to prove the validity of the concept of using emotion-based systems, according to the SVC principle. In summary, we also discuss other possible applications of the xEmotion system.

AB Individual-based modelling has contributed substantially to the understanding of fish schooling behaviour. Schooling is considered to grant several advantages, such as increased defense against predators and increased foraging success. Whereas the former has been well studied with empirical investigations and different modelling approaches, the latter has not received as much attention. Foraging success is considerably influenced by the emergent property of schools to locate and exploit heterogeneously distributed resources more efficiently than solitary fish. However, successful resource exploitation depends on individual fish properties as well as properties of the school in relation to patch size and spatial distribution of resources. Thus, schooling will be favourable in specific environmental conditions and less efficient in others.
   We use an individual-based model to assess the foraging efficiency of schooling compared to individual food search under different spatio-temporal distributions of food resources in a dynamic environment. Allowing agents' behaviour to evolve either towards schooling or towards individualism, we demonstrate the adaptation of population characteristics to a particular spatial and temporal distribution of food patches.
   With our model we show that the environmental configuration of food patches is crucial for schooling fish to be more efficient in foraging. Moreover, patch size must be considerably larger than the extent of the school but small enough for patch boundaries to take effect. The model contributes to a better understanding of the relationships among spatial dynamics and the driving forces behind behavioural adaptation of trophic strategies in schooling fish.

AB Neuronal firing responses in visual cortex reflect the statistics of visual input and emerge from the interaction with endogenous network dynamics. Artificial visual stimuli presented to animals in which the network dynamics were constrained by anesthetic agents or trained behavioral tasks have provided fundamental understanding of how individual neurons in primary visual cortex respond to input. In contrast, very little is known about the mesoscale network dynamics and their relationship to microscopic spiking activity in the awake animal during free viewing of naturalistic visual input. To address this gap in knowledge, we recorded local field potential (LFP) and multiunit activity (MUA) simultaneously in all layers of primary visual cortex (V1) of awake, freely viewing ferrets presented with naturalistic visual input (nature movie clips). We found that naturalistic visual stimuli modulated the entire oscillation spectrum; low frequency oscillations were mostly suppressed whereas higher frequency oscillations were enhanced. In average across all cortical layers, stimulus-induced change in delta and alpha power negatively correlated with the MUA responses, whereas sensory-evoked increases in gamma power positively correlated with MUA responses. The time-course of the band-limited power in these frequency bands provided evidence for a model in which naturalistic visual input switched V1 between two distinct, endogenously present activity states defined by the power of low (delta, alpha) and high (gamma) frequency oscillatory activity. Therefore, the two mesoscale activity states delineated in this study may define the degree of engagement of the circuit with the processing of sensory input. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The study reported in this paper is the first meta-analysis aimed at obtaining statistical models for the fresh state behavior of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mixes which effectively reproduce the complex relationships between mix design and fresh state performance. A database compiled with data from more than 120 different sources was analyzed. This study proves that SCC fresh state performance is determined by three fundamental, uncorrelated properties: flow time, flow spread, and resistance to segregation, which constitute a robust mathematical framework for the optimization of SCC mixes. The models obtained for these fundamental properties have proved consistent and reproduce very well the general trends and interactions implicit in SCC mix design recommendations, which in effect constitute the mathematical validation of recommendations well sanctioned by practice. It has been proved that, if no supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) are used, there is a remarkably narrow margin in which the three fundamental properties of fresh SCC mixes can be simultaneously optimized. The most stable mixes were found to be associated with sand-to-coarse aggregate ratios of at least 1.1. The flowability of SCC mixes in terms of both flow times and flow spread can be optimized when the following conditions concur: w/c ratio of 0.45, SCMs content below 100 kg/m(3), and sand content not lower than 750 kg/m(3). Furthermore, it was also proved that, in general, it is best to keep the dosages of super-plasticizers (HRWRs) and viscosity-modifying agents (VMAs) below 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively, subject of course to variation across the different types of products available.

AB The possibility of recycling polypropylene (PP)-based automobile parts is among the most important strategies to restrict the environmental impact of vehicles after their life cycle. However, current recycling conditions often lead to changes in the structure and properties of PP. In this work, the hypothesis that whiskers derived from chitin could be used to recover the dynamic mechanical properties of re-processed PP to its original values was tested. PP was subjected to multiple extrusion cycles to simulate recycling conditions. Chitin whiskers were prepared by an acid treatment of chitin and were dispersed in both neat and re-processed PP. The obtained whiskers and nanocomposites were characterized using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, dynamic scanning calorimetry, transmission electron, scanning electron and atomic force microscopies and dynamic mechanical analysis. Results indicated that oxidation of PP has occurred during re-processing. Moreover, chitin whiskers were synthesized and successfully incorporated in PP and re-processed PP. The nanocomposites showed lower values of crystallinity than neat and re-processed pure PP. Dynamic mechanical analysis showed that the behavior of storage elastic modulus as well as the loss tangent as a function of temperature of nanocomposites containing 1 wt% chitin whiskers in re-processed PP was similar to the one displayed by neat PP. The capability of the chitin whiskers to interact better with oxidized PP chains and to restrict crystallization would be responsible for their observed potential in recovering the dynamic mechanical behavior of re-processed PP to its original behavior.

AB The iron carrier human serum transferrin (sTf) is known to transport other metals, including some actinides (An). Radiotoxic An are routinely involved in the nuclear fuel cycle and the possibility of their accidental exposure cannot be ruled out. Understanding An interaction with sTf assumes a greater significance for the development of safe and efficacious chelators for their removal from the blood stream. Here we report several 100 ns equilibrium MD simulations of Cm(III)- and Th(IV)-loaded sTf at various protonation states of the protein to explore the possibility of the two An ions release and speciation. The results demonstrate variation in protonation state of dilysine pair (K206 and K296) and the tyrosine (Y188) residue is necessary for the opening of Cm(III)-bound protein and the release of the ion. For the tetravalent thorium, protonation of dilysine pair suffices to cause conformational changes of protein. However, in none of the protonation states, Th(IV) releases from sTf because of its strong electrostatic interaction with D63 in the first shell of the sTf binding cleft. Analysis of hydrogen bond, water bridge, and the evaluation of potential of mean forces of the An ions' release from sTf, substantiate the differential behavior of Cm(III) and Th(IV) at endosomal pH. The results provide insight in the regulation of Cm(III) and Th(IV) bioavailability that may prove useful for effective design of their decorporating agents and as well may help the future design of radiotherapy based on tetravalent ions.

AB Mycoplasma pneumoniae type 2a strain 309 is a simplest known bacterium and is the primary cause of community acquired pneumonia in the children. It mainly causes severe atypical pneumonia as well as several other non-pulmonary manifestations such as neurological, hepatic, hemolytic anemia, cardiac diseases and polyarthritis. The size of M. pneumoniae genome (Accession number: NC_016807.1) is relatively smaller as compared to other bacteria and contains 707 functional proteins, in which 204 are classified as hypothetical proteins (HPs) because of the unavailability of experimentally validated functions. The functions of the HPs were predicted by integrating a variety of protein classification systems, motif discovery tools as well as methods that are based on characteristic features obtained from the protein sequence and metabolic pathways. The probable functions of 83HPs were predicted successfully. The accuracy of the diverse tools used in the adopted pipeline was evaluated on the basis of statistical techniques of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), which indicated the reliability of the functional predictions. Furthermore, the virulent HPs present in the set of 83 functionally annotated proteins were predicted by using the Bioinformatics tools and the conformational behaviours of the proteins with highest virulence scores were studied by using the molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study will facilitate in the better understanding of various drug resistance and pathogenesis mechanisms present in the M. pneumoniae and can be utilized in designing of better therapeutic agents.

AB Injection of plastics into blast furnaces as an alternative reducing agent has been carried out for the purpose of mitigation of carbon dioxide emissions. Several studies on the pyrolysis of plastic particles have been reported, however flow behavior of plastic particles or unburnt char in actual blast furnace is not clear.
   In this study, hotmodel experiments and thermogravimetry analysis were conducted for the modeling of gasification and combustion behavior of plastic particles, then flow behavior of plastic particle and unburnt char in a blast furnace was calculated by numerical simulation. According to the observation results of combustion experiment, volatile matter of plastics seems to be evolved at the surface of the particles. Regarding reaction of char derived from plastics, thermogravimetry analysis showed that rate of gasification of unburnt char depended on the rate of heating. Gasification rate in the case of rapid heating condition tended to increase.
   As the results of numerical simulations, initial diameter of plastics and char diameter determined the flow behavior in the blast furnace. When relatively small plastic was injected or diameter of unburnt char was small, unburnt char went upward along with gas flow and most of it might be consumed at the cohesive zone. On the other hand, when relatively coarse plastics was injected and diameter of unburnt char was relatively coarse, it was suggested that unburnt char accumulated around the deadman.
   Therefore, it is considered that fine plastics injection is desirable for the stable operation of blast furnace.

   SOLUTION BEHAVIOR
AB Polymer micelles with hydrophobic polystyrene (PS) core and ionic amphiphilic corona from charged N-ethyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide (EVP) and uncharged 4-vinylpyridine (4VP) units spontaneously self-assembled from PS-block-poly(4VP-stat-EVP) macromolecules in mixed dimethylformamide/methanol/water solvent. The fraction of statistically distributed EVP units in corona-forming block is beta = [EVP]/([EVP]+[4VP]) = 0.3-1. Micelles were transferred into water via dialysis technique, and pH was adjusted to 9, where 4VP is insoluble. Structural characteristics of micelles were investigated both experimentally and theoretically as a function of corona composition beta. Methods of dynamic and static light scattering, electrophoretic mobility measurements, sedimentation velocity, transmission electron microscopy, and UV spectrophotometry were applied. All micelles possessed spherical morphology. The aggregation number, structure, and electrophoretic: mobility of micelles changed in a jumplike manner near beta similar to 0.6-0.75. Below and above this region, micelle characteristics were constant or insignificantly changed upon beta. Theoretical dependencies for micelle aggregation number, corona dimensions, and fraction of small counterions outside corona versus beta were derived via minimization the micelle free energy, taking into account surface, volume, electrostatic, and elastic contributions of chain units and translational entropy of mobile counterions. Theoretical estimations also point onto a sharp structural transition at a certain corona composition. The abrupt reorganization of micelle structure at beta similar to 0.6-0.75 entails dramatic changes in micelle dispersion stability in the presence of NaCl or in the presence of oppositely charged polymeric (sodium polymethacrylate) or amphiphilic (sodium dodecyl sulfate) complexing agents.

AB Silane-treated TiO2/high-density polyethylene (silane-TiO2/HDPE) is a potential bone substitute material with good bioactivity and mechanical properties. In this composite, 40 vol.% TiO2 particles were connected chemically with HDPE (high-density polyethylene) by silane-coupling agent. The intensive silane connection was believed to play very important role in compressive creep behavior of silane-TiO2/HDPE in our previous study. In order to deeply understand the relationship between the special structure and creep behavior, both a viscoelastic creep model named Burgers, and an empirical model called Findley power law were applied to simulate and predict the creep curves obtained in both air and saline solution. The results showed that Burgers model succeeded in simulating the creep curves but failed in long-term prediction for all dry samples, while Findley power law failed in simulating the creep curves in air but succeeded in saline solution. By analyzing the parameters obtained from Burgers model, it was believed that the structure of intense connection by silane chains resulted in the very big and gradually increased permanent viscous flow of this material with creep time. The big permanent viscous flow brought on the failure in simulating creep curves using Findley power law, and the improved permanent viscous flow during creep conduced to the positive deviation between the prediction and practical creep curve using Burgers model. The effect of saline solution around sample could not only decrease the permanent viscous flow but also stabilize it gradually, which resulted in the success in the prediction and simulation of creep curve in saline solution by the two models.

   PENETRATION; CULTURE
AB A phenomenological model of biocide action against microbial biofilms was derived. Processes incorporated in the model include bulk flow in and out of a well-mixed reactor, transport of dissolved species into the biofilm, substrate consumption by bacterial metabolism, bacterial growth, advection of cell mass within the biofilm, cell detachment from the biofilm, cell death, and biocide concentration-dependent disinfection. Simulations were performed to analyze the general behavior of the model and to perform preliminary sensitivity analysis to identify key input parameters. The model captured several general features of antimicrobial agent action against biofilms that have been observed widely by experimenters and practitioners. These included (1) rapid disinfection followed by biofilm regrowth, (2) slower detachment than disinfection, and (3) reduced susceptibility of microorganisms in biofilms. The results support the plausibility of a mechanism of biofilm resistance in which the biocide is neutralized by reaction with biofilm constituents, leading to a reduction in the bulk biocide concentration and, more significantly, biocide concentration gradients within the biofilm. Sensitivity experiments and analyses identified which input parameters influence key response variables. Each of three response variables was sensitive to each of the five input parameters, but they were most sensitive to the initial biofilm thickness and next most sensitive to the biocide disinfection rate coefficient. Statistical regression modeling produced simple equations for approximating the response variables for situations within the range of conditions covered by the sensitivity experiment. The model should be useful as a tool for studying alternative biocide control strategies. For example, the simulations suggested that a good; interval between pulses of biocide is the time to minimum thickness. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Building energy consumption is influenced evidently by solar radiation. To achieve a stable indoor temperature by minimizing the heat fluctuations resulted from solar radiation, latent heat thermal energy storage systems with phase change materials (PCMs) in building envelope have been studied. Though inorganic PCMs have promising potential applications among all kinds of PCMs, the supercooling and segregation are the major issues which have restricted their practical applications. The purpose of this study is to lessen the supercooling degree of an industrial grade PCM (CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O) by using a nucleating agent - flake graphite. A super absorbent polymer (SAP) was also used as a thickener to prevent segregation of CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O during phase transition. The combined method of thermogravimetric analysis/differential thermal analysis (TGA-DTA) was firstly proposed to evaluate the segregation of inorganic PCM innovatively. The results showed that using 0.5 wt% flake graphite not only eliminated the supercooling of CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O, but also improved its thermal conductivity for better thermal performance. The results of Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that the flake graphite did play an important role on the crystallization of CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O. Numerical simulation demonstrated that using modified CaCl2 center dot 6H(2)O within walls of buildings in Hong Kong and Changsha are economically feasible with the payback periods of 18.3 years and 8.4 years respectively.

AB A low coke rate operation in blast furnace is desired to decrease the carbon input and mitigate global warming problem. However, low coke rate operation tends to cause the gas permeability to deteriorate. The mixing of small-size coke (nut coke) including high reactivity coke in ore layer is considered to be a promising way to improve permeability and increase reaction efficiency in a blast furnace. Although adding a nut coke mixing to an ore layer is predicted to be empirically effective in low coke rate operation, there is little actual data on microscopic phenomena of each particle in the packed bed. In the present study, an Euler-Lagrange approach was introduced to precisely understand the influence of the packed bed structure on the reaction behavior of each particle in the three-dimensional particle arrangement.
   It was observed that the heterogeneity on the reaction rate and temperature distribution was influenced by the particle arrangement. When high-reactivity coke was used at approximately 1 273 K, although CO gas fraction increased, the gaseous phase temperature decreased due to the active solution loss reaction rate of the nut coke in the mixed layer. As a result, the ore reduction rate decreased. The contribution of high-reactivity coke to the ore reduction rate depends on the particle arrangement through the heat transfer and reaction heat. Accordingly, in the case of the mixed charge of the high reactivity nut coke in the ore layer, the design of the packed bed structure is important.

AB We study a simultaneous, complete-information game played by p = 1, ... ,P agents. Each p has an ordinal decision variable Y-p epsilon A(p) = {0, 1, ... ,M-p}, where Mp can be unbounded, Ap is p's action space, and each element in Ap is an action, that is, a potential value for Yp. The collective action space is the Cartesian product A = Pi(p)(p=1) A(p). A profile of actions y epsilon A is a Nash equilibrium (NE) profile if y is played with positive probability in some existing NE. Assuming that we observe NE behavior in the data, we characterize bounds for the probability that a prespecified y in A is a NE profile. Comparing the resulting upper bound with Pr[ Y = y] (where Y is the observed outcome of the game), we also obtain a lower bound for the probability that the underlying equilibrium selection mechanism ME chooses a NE where y is played given that such a NE exists. Our bounds are nonparametric, and they rely on shape restrictions on payoff functions and on the assumption that the researcher has ex ante knowledge about the direction of strategic interaction (e. g., that for q not equal p, higher values of Y-q reduce p's payoffs). Our results allow us to investigate whether certain action profiles in A are scarcely observed as outcomes in the data because they are rarely NE profiles or because M epsilon rarely selects such NE. Our empirical illustration is a multiple entry game played by Home Depot and Lowe's.

AB The microbubbles; destruction/replenishment technique has been previously applied to estimating blood flow in the microcirculation. The rate of increase of the time-intensity curve (TIC) due to microbubbles flowing into the region of interest (ROI), as measured from B-mode images, closely reflects the flow velocity. In previous studies, we proposed a new approach called the time-Nakagami-parameter curve (TNC) obtained from Nakagami images to monitor microbubble replenishment for quantifying the microvascular flow velocity. This study aimed to further explore some effects that may affect the TNC to estimate the microflow, including microbubble concentration, ultrasound transmitting energy, attenuation, intrinsic noise, and tissue clutter. In order to well control each effect production, we applied a typical simulation method to investigate the TIC and TNC. The rates of increase of the TIC and TNC were expressed by the rate constants beta(1) and beta(N), respectively, of a monoexponential model. The results show that beta(N) quantifies the microvascular flow velocity similarly to the conventional beta(I). Moreover, the measures of beta(I) and beta(N) are not influenced by microbubble concentration, transducer excitation energy, and attenuation effect. Although the effect of intrinsic signals contributed by noise and blood would influence the TNC behavior, the TNC method has a better tolerance of tissue clutter than the TIC does, allowing the presence of some clutter components in the ROI. The results suggest that the TNC method can be used as a complementary tool for the conventional TIC to reduce the wall filter requirements for blood flow measurement in the microcirculation.

ID MAXIMUM CAUSAL ENTROPY
AB Reinforcement learning is one of the most promising machine learning techniques to get intelligent behaviors for embodied agents in simulations. The output of the classic Temporal Difference family of Reinforcement Learning algorithms adopts the form of a value function expressed as a numeric table or a function approximator. The learned behavior is then derived using a greedy policy with respect to this value function. Nevertheless, sometimes the learned policy does not meet expectations, and the task of authoring is difficult and unsafe because the modification of one value or parameter in the learned value function has unpredictable consequences in the space of the policies it represents. This invalidates direct manipulation of the learned value function as a method to modify the derived behaviors. In this paper, we propose the use of Inverse Reinforcement Learning to incorporate real behavior traces in the learning process to shape the learned behaviors, thus increasing their trustworthiness (in terms of conformance to reality). To do so, we adapt the Inverse Reinforcement Learning framework to the navigation problem domain. Specifically, we use Soft Q-learning, an algorithm based on the maximum causal entropy principle, with MARL-Ped (a Reinforcement Learning-based pedestrian simulator) to include information from trajectories of real pedestrians in the process of learning how to navigate inside a virtual 3D space that represents the real environment. A comparison with the behaviors learned using a Reinforcement Learning classic algorithm (Sarsa(lambda)) shows that the Inverse Reinforcement Learning behaviors adjust significantly better to the real trajectories.

AB Spatial behavioural types (SBTs) arise from between-individual differences in behavioural traits that foster spatial behavioural patterns that are consistent over time and ecological contexts. Fish stocks are regularly assessed using catch per unit effort (CPUE) as input data that may non-linearly co-vary with the underlying abundance (N) of the exploited stock when SBT affect catchability. We hypothesized that SBT promote characteristic changes in catchability within harvesting seasons that affect catch rates and in turn catch-based fish stock assessments. To test this hypothesis, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based simulation where we measured encounters between fish and fishers and estimated the shape of the CPUE-N relationship. We ran the simulation in a prototypical fish-fisher encounter-leads-to-catch-type fishery and systematically studied outcomes in the presence or absence of SBTs. It was revealed that the existence of SBTs leads to CPUE inevitably declining faster than N (a process known as hyperdepletion) when compared with a simulation lacking SBTs. This finding was consistent in a wide range of fishing effort scenarios. The emergent hyperdepletion of catch rates was caused by fast and behavioural-selective exploitation of vulnerable SBT that encompassed the mobile component of the fish stock. The theoretical predictions received support from field data from a coastal recreational fishery. Our work suggests that the consideration of SBT when interpreting trends in CPUE data may notably improve stock assessments by providing a more reliable CPUE-N relationship.

AB The static response of coated microbubbles is investigated with a novel approach employed for modeling contact between a microbubble and the cantilever of an atomic force microscope. Elastic tensions and moments are described via appropriate constitutive laws. The encapsulated gas is assumed to undergo isothermal variations. Due to the hydrophilic nature of the cantilever, an ultrathin aqueous film is formed, which transfers the force onto the shell. An interaction potential describes the local pressure applied on the shell. The problem is solved in axisymmetric form with the finite element method. The response is governed by the dimensionless bending, (k) over cap (b) = k(b)/(chi R-0(2)), pressure, (P) over cap (A) = (PAR0) /chi, and interaction potential, (W) over cap = w(0)/chi. Hard polymeric shells have negligible resistance to gas compression, while for the softer lipid shells gas compressibility is comparable with shell elasticity. As the external force increases, numerical simulations reveal that the force versus deformation (f vs d) curve of polymeric shells exhibits a transition from the linear O(d) (Reissner) regime, marked by flattened shapes around the contact region, to a non-linear O(d(1/2)) (Pogorelov) regime dominated by shapes exhibiting crater formation due to buckling. When lipid shells are tested, buckling is bypassed as the external force increases and flattened shapes prevail in an initially linear f vs d curve. Transition to a curved upwards regime is observed as the force increases, where gas compression and area dilatation form the dominant balance providing a nonlinear regime with an O(d(3)) dependence. Asymptotic analysis recovers the above patterns and facilitates estimation of the shell mechanical properties. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB Innovative remediation studies were conducted between 1994 and 2004 at sites contaminated by nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs) at Hill and Dover AFB, and included technologies that mobilize, solubilize, and volatilize NAPL: air sparging (AS), surfactant flushing, cosolvent flooding, and flushing with a complexing-sugar solution. The experiments proved that aggressive remedial efforts tailored to the contaminant can remove more than 90% of the NAPL-phase contaminant mass. Site-characterization methods were tested as part of these field efforts, including partitioning tracer tests, biotracer tests, and mass-flux measurements. A significant reduction in the groundwater contaminant mass flux was achieved despite incomplete removal of the source. The effectiveness of soil, groundwater, and tracer based characterization methods may be site and technology specific. Employing multiple methods can improve characterization. The studies elucidated the importance of small-scale heterogeneities on remediation effectiveness, and fomented research on enhanced-delivery methods. Most contaminant removal occurs in hydraulically accessible zones, and complete removal is limited by contaminant mass stored in inaccessible zones. These studies illustrated the importance of understanding the fluid dynamics and interfacial behavior of injected fluids on remediation design and implementation. The importance of understanding the dynamics of NAPL-mixture dissolution and removal was highlighted. The results from these studies helped researchers better understand what processes and scales are most important to include in mathematical models used for design and data analysis. Finally, the work at these sites emphasized the importance and feasibility of recycling and reusing chemical agents, and enabled the implementation and success of follow-on full-scale efforts.

AB Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant that appears to be a potent and specific panicogenic agent. It also elicits an abnormal ventilatory response in patients with panic. A replication study confirmed these findings and demonstrated that behavioral and ventilatory responses to doxapram were significantly modified by a psychological intervention designed to cognitively block panic. The replication study provided an opportunity to simultaneously investigate the neuroendocrine effects of the illness, the drug, the drug-induced panic attacks, and the cognitive intervention. Epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), growth hormone (GH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and cortisol were studied in patients with panic and control subjects given placebo and doxapram injections after receiving either standard instructions or a brief cognitive intervention. Patients with panic had elevated levels of EPI, ACTH, and cortisol throughout the study. Doxapram had little or no detectable effects on plasma NE, GH, ACTH, and cortisol. Doxapram-induced panic attacks were not associated with elevations in NE, GH, ACTH, or cortisol. Doxapram led to a rapid and very brief rise in plasma EPI, which was small in subjects who did not panic and pronounced in patients who did panic. The cognitive intervention attenuated the EPI response to doxapram, perhaps through its effect on panic, and modified the temporal pattern of ACTH and cortisol secretion. These results suggest that: (1) further study of catecholamine responses within the first few minutes after panic induction is needed; (2) intense panic can occur without significant activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; and (3) cognitive factors can modulate neuroendocrine activity in laboratory studies of patients with panic.

AB bcl-2 is the first member of a new class of protooncogenes the products of which inhibit programmed cell death (PCD) or apoptosis. We have previously determined that Bcl-2 is expressed in a significant percentage of untreated primary neuroblastoma (NBL) tumors. In these specimens Bcl-2 expression correlated with other markers of poor prognosis suggesting a role for Bcl-2 in the malignant behavior of NBL tumor cells. To investigate this possibility, a Bcl-2-negative human NBL cell line (Shep-1) was transfected with a beta expression vector (pSFFVneo-bcl-2). Multiple unique clones were isolated which showed variable levels of Bcl-2 protein by quantitative immunoprecipitation. Vector-transfected controls were generated simultaneously. Clones expressing high levels of Bcl-2 were resistant to cisplatin- and etoposide-induced cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis of propidium iodide-stained nuclei by flow cytometry after cisplatin or etoposide treatment revealed marked DNA degradation in vector-transfected controls whereas bcl-2 transfectants showed a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA degradation. Analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed relatively large fragment DNA degradation (similar to 50 kilobases) in the absence of internucleosomal degradation in vector-transfected control cells treated with either cisplatin or etoposide. In contrast, Bcl-2-expressing cells showed significantly less DNA degradation at all time points. These single gene transfection experiments have revealed that expression of Bcl-2 renders specific NBL cells resistant to chemotherapy-induced PCD and support the hypothesis that Bcl-2 enhances the malignant phenotype of NBL by promoting tumor resistance to chemotherapy agents.

AB Colonies of Pheidole ambigua ants excavate soil and drop it outside the nest entrance. The deposition of thousands of loads leads to the formation of regular ring-shaped piles. How is this pattern generated? This study investigated soil pile formation on level and sloping surfaces, both empirically and using an agent-based model. We found that ants drop soil preferentially in the direction in which the slope is least steeply uphill from the nest entrance, both when adding to an existing pile and when starting a new pile. Ants respond to cues from local slope to choose downhill directions. Ants walking on a slope increase the frequency and magnitude of changes in direction, and more of these changes of direction take them downhill than uphill. Also, ants carrying soil on a slope wait longer before dropping their soil compared to ants on a level plane. These mechanisms combine to focus soil dropping in the downhill direction, without the necessity of a direct relationship between slope and probability of dropping soil. These empirically determined rules were used to simulate soil disposal. The slight preference for turning downhill measured empirically was shown in the model to be sufficient to generate biologically realistic patterns of soil dumping when combined with memory of the direction of previous trips. From simple rules governing individual behaviour an overall pattern emerges, which is appropriate to the environment and allows a rapid response to changes.

AB This paper attempts to further the research by Odland and Ellis (1992) in applying event history methodology to the analysis of spatial point patterns (that is, event patterns). Its empirical focus is the event pattern derived from the adoption of an agricultural innovation, the Harvestore, in southern. Ontario, Canada, from 1963 to 1986. Event history analysis involves the use of discrete-state, continuous-time stochastic models to investigate a tempos-al longitudinal record on discrete variables. Event history models are usually concerned with durations of time between events and the effects of intertemporal time dependencies on future event occurrences. As such, they are often referred to as duration models. Many of the methods used in event history analysis allow the use of other nonnegative interval measurements in place of standard temporal intervals to investigate a series of events. In particular, spatial intervals (or durations) of distances between events may also be accommodated by event history models. Our analysis extends the previous research of Odland and Ellis (1992) by using a wider range of parametric models to explore duration dependence, investigating the role of spatial censoring, and using a more extensive set of explanatory variables. In addition, simulation experiments and graphical tests are used to evaluate the empirical event pattern against one generated from Complete Spatial Randomness. Results indicate that the event pattern formed by the Harvestore adopter farms is clustered (that is, is described by positive duration dependency), the sales agent is a significant factor ist the distribution of adopters, and that contrasting results are obtained from the analysis using censored data versus uncensored data.

AB Patients with chronic pain often report being sensitive to pain at night before falling asleep, a time when the synchronization of cortical activity is initiated. However, how cortical activity relates to pain sensitivity is still unclear. Because sleep is characterized by enhanced cortical delta power, we hypothesized that enhanced cortical delta power may be an indicator of intensified pain. To test this hypothesis, we used pain thresholds tests, EEG/electromyogram recordings, c-Fos staining, and chemogenetic and pharmacological techniques in mice. We found that sleep deprivation or pharmacologic enhancement of EEG delta power by reserpine and scopolamine dramatically decreased mechanical pain thresholds, but not thermal withdrawal latency, in a partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain mice. On the contrary, suppression of EEG delta power using a wake-promoting agent modafinil significantly attenuated mechanical allodynia. Moreover, when EEG delta power was enhanced, c-Fos expression decreased in most regions of the cortex, except the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where c-Fos was increased in the somatostatin- and parvalbumin-positive GABAergic neurons. Chemogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in ACC enhanced EEG delta power and lowered mechanical pain thresholds simultaneously in naive mice. However, chemogenetic inhibition of ACC GABAergic neurons could not block mechanical allodynia. These results provided compelling evidence that elevated EEG delta power is accompanied with aggravated neuropathic pain, whereas decreased delta power attenuated it, suggesting that enhanced delta power can be a specific marker of rising chronic neuropathic pain and that wake-promoting compounds could be used as analgesics in the clinic.
