AB The use of agent-based models (ABMs) has increased in the last years to simulate social systems and, in particular, financial markets. ABMs of financial markets are usually validated by checking the ability of the model to reproduce a set of empirical stylised facts. However, other common-sense evidence is available which is often not taken into account, ending with models which are valid but not sensible. In this paper we present an ABM of a stock market which incorporates this type of common-sense evidence and implements realistic trading strategies based on practitioners literature. We next validate the model using a comprehensive approach consisting of four steps: assessment of face validity, sensitivity analysis, calibration and validation of model outputs.

AB We study a stochastic model where the distribution of opinions in a population of agents coevolves with their interaction network. Interaction between agents is enhanced or penalized according to whether they succeed at reaching an agreement or not. The system evolves towards a state where the network's structure and the opinion distribution is frozen, and the population is divided into disconnected communities. The structural properties of the population in the final state vary considerably with the control parameters. By means of numerical simulations, we give a detailed account of such properties, as well as of the final opinion distribution. We also provide approximate analytical results which explain some of the numerical results and clarify their origin. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Caffeine is the world's most popular psychoactive drug and is also an active adulterant found in many drugs of abuse, including seized cocaine samples. Despite several studies which examine the effects of caffeine or cocaine administered as single agents, little data are available for these agents when given in combination. The purpose of the present study was to determine if combined intake of both psychostimulants can lead to maladaptive changes in striatal function. Mice were injected with a binge regimen (intermittent treatment for 13 days) of caffeine (3 x 5 mg/kg), cocaine (3 x 10 mg/kg), or combined administration. We found that chronic caffeine potentiated locomotion induced by cocaine and that both caffeine-treated groups showed sensitization. Striatal tissue was obtained 24 h and 7 days after last injection (withdrawal) for immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression. Our results show that combined intake of both psychostimulants can increase GFAP immunoreactivity in the striatum at both times post treatment. Gene expression analysis, targeted at dopamine, adenosine, and glutamate receptor subunit genes, revealed significant transcript down-regulation in the dorsal striatum of AMPA, NMDA, D1 and D2 receptor subunit mRNA expression in the group that received combined treatment, but not after individual administration. At withdrawal, we found increased D1 receptor mRNA expression along with increased A1, AMPA, NMDA, and metabotropic subunit expression. A2A mRNA showed decreased expression after both times in all experimental groups. Our study provides evidence that there are striatal alterations mediated by combined caffeine and cocaine administration, and highlights negative outcomes of chronic intake of both psychostimulants.

ID WORD-OF-MOUTH; SIMULATION; CONSUMERS; PROGRAMS; TWITTER
AB Social network sites such as Twitter have madeeasier the exchange of information about products amongconsumers that are users of these networks. Thereby, marketersare using word of mouth marketing campaigns to engage users ofthese social networks in spreading the word about their products.The choice of consumers who participate in these campaigns is keyin their success. However, it is not clear which type of consumersand its combination are the most effective in reaching this aim.Unfortunately, the difficulty in getting useful data due to its noiseor non-public availability do not allow researchers toappropriately apply traditional methodologies like statistics.Hence, this paper proposes an agent-based model to simulate theinformation diffusion through Twitter when some types ofconsumers participate in word of mouth marketing campaigns.This model was implemented in Java and its results show that,although hubs (users with many contacts) are better connectedthan opinion leaders, the latter ones reach higher informationdiffusion because of its influence; in addition, the use of both typesof consumers in the same campaign achieves as diffusion as usingjust opinion leaders. Apart from results, this paper gives to futureresearchers a guideline to develop ABMs that simulate differentbehaviors of Twitter's users.

AB AIM: Nicotine is a well-known agent among 4000 chemicals in cigarettes. About 70 to 80% of nicotine is converted to cotinine, a major metabolite. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of cotinine on neural tube development in a chick embryo model.
   MATERIAL and METHODS: Sixty fertile, specific pathogen free eggs were divided into 6 groups for this study. In the first group, a fixed cotinine concentration for each egg was calculated just to simulate the concentration of a smoker's blood level. A second experimental group was designed at a higher cotinine concentration. Embryos that succeeded to reach Hamburger-Hamilton stage 12 from each group were then embedded into paraffin for permanent sections. These two groups were compared with eggs subjected to vehicle (standard alcohol and ten times more alcohol concentration) and control groups (saline and sham groups).
   RESULTS: Embryos of the cotinine (regular dose), vehicle and control groups were normal, but embryos Subjected to higher cotinine concentrations were malformed at the cranial part of the thoracic neural tube.
   CONCLUSION: Association of cotinine with neural tube defects was demonstrated in the present study. Cigarette smoking may induce hazardous effects on neural tube development.

AB This paper presents results from an experimental computer simulated stock market. In this market artificial intelligence algorithms take on the role of traders. They make predictions about the future, and buy and sell stock as indicated by their expectations of future risk and return. Prices are set endogenously to clear the market. Time series from this market are analyzed from the standpoint of well-known empirical features in real markets. The simulated market is able to replicate several of these phenomenon, including fundamental and technical predictability, volatility persistence, and leptokurtosis. Moreover, agent behavior is shown to be consistent with these features, in that they condition on the variables that are found to be significant in the time series tests. Agents are also able to collectively learn a homogeneous rational expectations equilibrium for certain parameters giving both time series and individual forecast values consistent with the equilibrium parameter values.

AB In this paper, we examine both stability and sustainability of a network-based model of natural resource consumption. Stability is studied from a dynamical systems perspective, though we argue that sustainability is a fundamentally different notion from stability in social- ecological systems. Accordingly, we also present a criterion for sustainability that is guided by the existing literature on sustainable development. Assuming a generic social network of consuming agents' interactions, we derive sufficient conditions for both the stability and sustainability of the model as constraints on the network structure itself. We complement these analytical results with numerical simulations and discuss the implications of our findings for policy-making for sustainable resource governance.

AB The evolution of cultural diversity in some social systems can be observed as the oppositional patterns in different levels, namely, the directions of the trends of diversity in different levels are opposite. In this paper, we propose a payoff-driven metapopulation modeling framework to investigate the origin of the oppositional patterns in the trends of cultural diversity. This model considers the mobile agents in multiple communities, and the cultural characteristics of an agent are represented by a vector. The diffusion of cultural characteristics is driven by two opposite effects: the communication cost positively depending on cultural difference between agents, and the cultural attractiveness single-peak-functional correlating on cultural difference. In the numerical simulations of the model, the polarization is observed in the case with the homophily principle, and two types of the oppositional patterns can emerge in the case with time-varying mobility of agents. These findings efficiently explain the emergence of the oppositional patterns and help to understand the evolution of diversity under the dynamics of both synchronization and variation.

AB Objective: To compare changes in enamel microhardness adjacent to orthodontic brackets after using bonding agents containing various compositions of bioactive glass compared to a traditional resin adhesive following a simulated caries challenge.
   Materials and Methods: Extracted human third molars (n = 10 per group) had orthodontic brackets bonded using one of four novel bioactive glass (BAG)-containing orthodontic bonding agents (BAG-Bonds) or commercially available Transbond-XT. The four new adhesives contained BAG in varying percentages incorporated into a traditional resin monomer mixture. Teeth were cycled through low-pH demineralizing and physiologic-pH remineralizing solutions once each day over 14 days. Microhardness was measured on longitudinal sections of the teeth 100, 200, and 300 gm from the bracket edge and beneath the brackets, at depths of 25 to 200 gm from the enamel surface. Normalized hardness values were compared using three-way analysis of variance.
   Results: Significantly less reduction in enamel microhardness was found with the experimental adhesives at depths of 25 and 50 gm at all distances from the bracket edge. In all groups, there were no significant changes in enamel microhardness past 125-mu m depth. Results varied with the different BAG-Bonds, with 81 BAG-Bond showing the smallest decrease in enamel microhardness.
   Conclusions: The BAG-Bonds tested in this study showed a reduction in the amount of superficial enamel softening surrounding orthodontic brackets compared to a traditional bonding agent. The results indicate that clinically, BAG-Bonds may aid in maintaining enamel surface hardness, therefore helping prevent white spot lesions adjacent to orthodontic brackets.

TI Ulinastatin attenuates lung ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats by

SO TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS

DT Article
ID TRANSPLANTATION
AB Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury may influence graft function following transplantation. Ulinastatin, a urinary trypsin inhibitor has been shown to attenuate I/R injury in various organs such as intestine, heart, and kidney in animals. The present experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of pretreatment with ulinastatin on I/R-induced lung injury.
   Methods. After establishing a constant left lung warm ischemia-reperfusion model in rats, 45 animals were randomly divided into three experimental groups: sham group (11 15), IR group (n = 15), and ulinastatin (5000 U/kg pre-ischemia) + IR group (11 = 15). The lung injury was evaluated by tissue myeloperoxidase activity, with simultaneous estimation of the serum concentration of TNF alpha.
   Results. The ulinastatin-pretreated animals exhibited markedly decreased lung tissue myeloperoxidase activity (P <.05). Blood gas analysis demonstrated, that the treated animals had significantly ameliorated pulmonary oxygenation (P <.05). The serum concentration of TNF-alpha in the ulinastatin-pretreated group was markedly decreased compared with that of the I/R group (P <.05).
   Conclusions. Ulinastatin attenuated I/R-induced lung injury. This function is partly related to the capacity of the agent to inhibit myeoloperoxidase activity in lung tissue and decrease systemic expression to TNF-alpha.

ID RISK-ASSESSMENT; THRESHOLD; PERSPECTIVE
AB Hormesis refers to a nonmonotonic (biphasic) dose-response relationship in toxicology, environmental science, and related fields. In the presence of hormesis, a low dose of a toxic agent may have a lower risk than the risk at the control dose, and the risk may increase at high doses. When the sample size is small due to practical, logistic, and ethical considerations, a parametric model may provide an efficient approach to hypothesis testing at the cost of adopting a strong assumption, which is not guaranteed to be true. In this article, we first consider alternative parameterizations based on the traditional three-parameter logistic regression. The new parameterizations attempt to provide robustness to model misspecification by allowing an unspecified dose-response relationship between the control dose and the first nonzero experimental dose. We then consider experimental designs including the uniform design (the same sample size per dose group) and thec-optimal design (minimizing the standard error of an estimator for a parameter of interest). Our simulation studies showed that (1) thec-optimal design under the traditional three-parameter logistic regression does not help reducing an inflated Type I error rate due to model misspecification, (2) it is helpful under the new parameterization with three parameters (Type I error rate is close to a fixed significance level), and (3) the new parameterization with four parameters and thec-optimal design does not reduce statistical power much while preserving the Type I error rate at a fixed significance level.

AB A co-evolutionary model of both network and mixed strategy is proposed in this study. The assigned strategy s(i) of agent i is defined by a real number ranging from 0 to 1, which probabilistically ordains a subsequent action of either cooperation or defection as the agent's offer. We assume a network dynamic to support or hamper the enhancement of cooperation, where an agent severs a link with the neighbor who has the most disassortative strategy. This means that an agent tends to maintain interactions only with neighbors that resemble the agent. A series of numerical simulations reveal that our "assortative grouping" framework enhances cooperation. Interestingly, when a low network adaptation speed and a certain degree of strategy copy error are presumed, phenomenal network heterogeneity evolves, one that realizes more significant cooperation as compared to error-free cases.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) are computational models used to simulate the actions and interactions of agents within a system. Usually, each agent has a relatively simple set of rules for how he or she responds to his or her environment and to other agents. These models are used to gain insight into the emergent behavior of complex systems with many agents, in which the emergent behavior depends upon themicro-level behavior of the individuals. ABMs are widely used in many fields, and this article reviews some of those applications. However, as relatively little work has been done on statistical inference for such models, this article also points out some of those gaps and recent strategies to address them.

AB Previously, our work was focused on the experimental details of the controlled thermally decrosslinking behavior of a polymer system that contained sterically hindered urea linkages. Such systems are of interest because they introduce rework capabilities into the polymeric material. The focus of this paper is to study these controllable decrosslinking systems from a theoretical perspective. In this study, computational methods were used to study the 2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate-isophorone diisocyanate-2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate polymer system that has been shown to undergo controlled thermal network disassembly. The following two aspects are the focus of this investigation. First, computational methods were used to suggest other structures within this family of compounds that might also be reworkable. Based on the simulation data likely candidates are suggested and the thermal decrosslinking properties are hypothesized compared with the real system that was experimentally studied. Second, heat of reaction data was determined from simulations of the decrosslinking reactions. These data were then compared with the experimental data and a predictive model was developed to estimate the decrosslinking temperature of the polymer network when exposed to a particular severing agent.

AB Resource-allocation systems are ubiquitous in the human society. But how external fields affect the state of such systems remains poorly explored due to the lack of a suitable model. Because the behavior of spins pursuing energy minimization required by physical laws is similar to that of humans chasing payoff maximization studied in game theory, here we combine the Ising model with the market-directed resource-allocation game, yielding an Ising game. Based on the Ising game, we show theoretical, simulative and experimental evidences for a formula, which offers a clear expression of nonequilibrium steady states (NESSs). Interestingly, the formula also reveals a convertible relationship between the external field (exogenous factor) and resource ratio (endogenous factor), and a class of saturation as the external field exceeds certain limits. This work suggests that the Ising game could be a suitable model for studying external-field effects on resource-allocation systems, and it could provide guidance both for seeking more relations between NESSs and equilibrium states and for regulating human systems by choosing NESSs appropriately.

AB To compare the effects of different chelating agents on the push-out bond strength of calcium silicate-based cements to the simulated root-end cavities. Root-end cavities were prepared on the roots of fifty extracted maxillary anterior teeth. The specimens were then randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 10) based on the final irrigation regimen: Group 1: 17% EDTA, Group 2: 7% maleic acid, Group 3: QMix, Group 4: 2.25% peracetic acid (PAA), Group 5: 0.9% saline. Then, the samples from each group were subdivided into two groups (n = 5) based on the apical filling material. In group 1, root-end cavities of all samples were filled with Biodentine and in group 2, with MTA. Each sample was horizontally sectioned to produce two discs of similar to 1 mm thick per specimen. The maximum load required for the dislodgement of 100 retrofillings was recorded. The specimens were examined under scanning electron microscope after debonding to assess the type of bond failure. Data were statistically analyzed using Kruskal Wallis and Mann Whitney U tests. Irrigation with saline resulted in higher bond strength compared to the other irrigants in the retrograde cavities obturated with MTA or Biodentine (p <. 05). In MTA group, there was no significant difference between the test irrigants (p >. 05). EDTA and PAA groups showed higher dislodgement resistance values than the other test irrigants, when Biodentine was used as a filling. The type of irrigation solution influences the bond strength of the root-end fillings.

AB A fundamental issue in understanding human diversity is whether or not there are regular patterns and processes involved in cultural change. Theoretical and mathematical models of cultural evolution have been developed and are increasingly being used and assessed in empirical analyses. Here, we test the hypothesis that the rates of change of features of human socio-cultural organization are governed by general rules. One prediction of this hypothesis is that different cultural traits will tend to evolve at similar relative rates in different world regions, despite the unique historical backgrounds of groups inhabiting these regions. We used phylogenetic comparative methods and systematic cross-cultural data to assess how different socio-cultural traits changed in (i) island southeast Asia and the Pacific, and (ii) sub-Saharan Africa. The relative rates of change in these two regions are significantly correlated. Furthermore, cultural traits that are more directly related to external environmental conditions evolve more slowly than traits related to social structures. This is consistent with the idea that a form of purifying selection is acting with greater strength on these more environmentally linked traits. These results suggest that despite contingent historical events and the role of humans as active agents in the historical process, culture does indeed evolve in ways that can be predicted from general principles

AB A decentralized adaptive scheme is proposed in this article for protection coordination for microgrids with topological and operational uncertainties. This protection coordination scheme is performed in two stages. In the first stage, a traditional fault protection is deployed to clear the fault. If the fault is isolated successfully, the protection system returns to the regular fault-free state. If the fault is not cleared due to operational uncertainties in the protection system, the second stage of protection coordination is initiated. In this stage, based on a federation structure, a set of agents around the fault location negotiate to reach the best protection coordination strategy upon the occurrence of a single or multiple fault(s). Considering the operational uncertainties of the respective circuit breakers and communication links, the best fault clearance strategy is determined by analyzing the probability of correct operation of all proposed strategies and considering the least number of probable load outages. Two major factors impacting the probability of correct operation are fault currents flowing through the respective circuit breakers and the latency of the communication links. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by comparing the simulation results with their experimental counterparts and those obtained using the conventional centralized and decentralized adaptive methods.

AB Animal decision making in frequency-dependent situations, where the payoff of an action depends on the actions of others, has gained prominence in behavioural ecology and in social foraging in particular. One such situation involves cases where an animal can search for a new resource (produce) or join what others have already found (scrounge). A number of game-theoretic models have been proposed to predict the equilibrium combination of producer and scrounger strategists based on the evolutionarily stable strategy. However, each game model can only handle a few environmental parameters at a time and none address the flexible use of tactics that allows individuals to respond quickly and adaptively to changes in payoffs. In this study we propose an agent-based model using a linear operator learning rule as the decision mechanism. The model provides a unified framework from which to predict the effects on the expected equilibrium of producers and scroungers of group size, metabolic requirement, finder's advantage, food intake rate, cost of searching, cost of joining, patch encounter probability and patch richness. The simulation results replicate almost every producer-scrounger prediction and experimental result published to date such that the simulation provides a more general tool than any single game-theoretic model to predict behaviour under frequency-dependent conditions. The model furthermore allows us to develop a novel prediction about foraging behaviour in a more realistic environment of variable patch richness. By modelling the operation of a plausible decision rule, we can explore the validity of the behavioural gambit, the assumption that the unspecified decision mechanisms of game-theoretic models faithfully reproduce outcomes expected of natural selection operating over generations on fixed alternatives. We suggest that this simulation model can provide a tool for others to explore and predict the effect of more complex and hence realistic foraging conditions on individual levels of producer and scrounger use.

AB We have developed a spatially explicit individual-based model that imitates the population dynamics of the Arctic fox on Mednyi Island. In the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, the Mednyi Arctic fox is listed as an endangered species. The model developed is based on data collected over 19 years of fieldwork. Annual marking of cubs in the study area allowed us to identify up to 80% of animals individually and to collect their life-history data. As a result, we identified the mortality rates of males and females of all age groups, the probabilities of breeding, litter sizes, the sex ratios of animals in different age groups, social structures, dispersion distances, and the patterns of making decisions in the selection of social partners and habitat patches. The model is spatially explicit, i.e., the heterogeneity of the habitat patches is defined in explicit form. The model works with a time step of one year. In simulations, demographic parameters such as population dynamics, population age structure, sex ratio in different age groups, and the structure and size of families conformed to the empirical data. An analysis of the model sensitivity to variations in mortality rates in different age groups showed that the sensitivity to shifts in cub mortality is much higher compared to adults of all age groups. Through increasing the cub mortality rate to 95% over a period of one to five years, we simulated the effect of the otodectic mange epizootic, which was observed in a real population of the Mednyi Arctic fox. The population recovery time after the end of the impact in the simulation was significantly longer compared to field data. We suggest that, in reality, with a low population size, the productivity of the population increases. This feedback that accelerates population recovery has not yet been introduced into the model. In conclusion, we discuss advantages of the individual-based modeling based on long-term field studies.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model (ABM) for residential end-users, which is part of a larger, interdisciplinary co-simulation framework that helps to investigate the performance of future power distribution grids (i.e., smart grid scenarios). Different modes of governance (strong, soft and self-organization) as well as end-users' heterogeneous behavior represent key influential factors. Feedback was implemented as a measure to foster grid-beneficial behavior, which encompasses a range of monetary and non-monetary incentives (e.g., via social comparison). The model of frame selection (MFS) serves as theoretical background for modelling end-users' decision-making. Additionally, we conducted an online survey to ground the end-user sub-model on empirical data. Despite these empirical and theoretical foundations, the model presented should be viewed as a conceptual framework, which requires further data collection. Using an example scenario, representing a lowly populated residential area (167 households) with a high share of photovoltaic systems (30%), different modes of governance were compared with regard to their suitability for improving system stability (measured in cumulated load). Both soft and strong control were able to decrease overall fluctuations as well as the mean cumulated load (by approx. 10%, based on weekly observation). However, we argue that soft control could be sufficient and more societally desirable.

AB This article reports a study on modeling covert visual attention as a parallel process that unfolds in synergy with the embodied agent's action selection process. The parallel nature of the proposed model is according to the multiple covert attention hypothesis and thus suitable for the concurrent search for multiple objects in the embodied agent's visual field. In line with the active vision approach, the interaction with the action selection process is exploited by the model to deploy visual attention in a by-need way. Additionally, the multiple focuses of attention considered in the proposed model interact in a way that their collective behavior robustly self-organizes for a proper handling of the speed-accuracy trade-off inherent to visual search tasks. Besides the self-organization of a global spatiotemporal visual attention policy, the model also produces parallel, sparse, and active spatial working memories, that is, local maps of the environment. The underlying mechanisms of the model are based on the well known formalism that describes the self-organization of collective foraging strategies in social insects. This metaphor is particularly interesting because of its similarities with the problem tackled in this article, that is, the one of parallel visual attention. This claim is validated by experimental results on a simulated robot performing local navigation, where the ability of the model to generate accurate visual attention and spatial memories in a parsimonious and robust way is shown.

AB Agent-based approaches enable simulation driven analysis and discovery of system-level properties using descriptive models of known behaviors of the entities constituting the system. Accordingly, a spatially explicit agent-based ecological modeling, parallel simulation, and analysis environment called SEARUMS has been developed. However, the conservatively synchronized parallel simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS did not scale effectively. Furthermore, the initial multithreaded shared-memory design prevented utilization of resources on multiple compute nodes of a distributed memory cluster.
   Consequently, the simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS was redesigned to operate as a Time Warp synchronized parallel and distributed discrete event simulation (PDES) on modern distributed-memory supercomputing platforms. The new PDES environment is called SEARUMS++. The spatially-explicit nature of the models posed several challenges in achieving scalable and efficient PDES, necessitating new approaches in SEARUMS++ for: (1) modeling spatial interactions and initial partitioning of agents, (2) logical migration of an agent during simulation using proxy agents to reflect migratory characteristics, and (3) ghosting of agents using multiple proxy agents to handle boundary cases that occur during logical migration of agents.
   This article presents our optimization efforts involving new methods to address aforementioned challenges. The design of SEARUMS++ and experimental evaluation of various alternatives that were explored to achieve scalable and efficient PDES are also discussed. Our experiments indicate that SEARUMS++ provides 200% performance improvement and maintains scalability to a larger number of processors, thus enabling efficient parallel simulation of spatially-explicit agent-based epidemiological models.

AB Polarization modulation-infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) was employed to detect the chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulant triethyl phosphate (TEP) on gold, as well as on US military paint, i.e., chemical agent resistant coating (CARC). The targeted CWAs (G and V-series nerve agents) are characterized by phosphoric group vibrations present in the 1200 cm(-1) region. TEP displays two prominent peaks at 1268 cm(-1) and 1036 cm(-1) corresponding to P=O and (P)-O-C vibrations, respectively. A droplet of TEP solution in cyclohexane was deposited on gold and CARC substrates and after solvent evaporation PM-IRRAS spectra were collected in the 1200 cm(-1) region. The integrated peak area of the P=O and (P)-O-C vibrations was used to construct calibration curves and to determine the experimental limit of detection (LoD). In the case of gold as the substrate the estimated LoD of similar to 0.48 mu g and 1.23 mu g was obtained for the P=O and (P)-O-C vibrations, respectively. In the case of CARC, a LoD of 24 mu g was determined. These detection limits are at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than the typical lethal dose of G and V-series nerve agents, demonstrating potential of PM-IRRAS for non-contact detection of these CWAs.

AB Studies related to crowds of pedestrians, both those of theoretical nature and application oriented ones, have generally focused on either the analysis or the synthesis of the phenomena related to the interplay between individual pedestrians, each characterised by goals, preferences and potentially relevant relationships with others, and the environment in which they are situated. The cases in which these activities have been systematically integrated for a mutual benefit are still very few compared to the corpus of crowd related literature. This paper presents a case study of an integrated approach to the definition of an innovative model for pedestrian and crowd simulation ( on the side of synthesis) that was actually motivated and supported by the analyses of empirical data acquired from both experimental settings and observations in real world scenarios. In particular, we will introduce a model for the adaptive behaviour of pedestrians that are also members of groups, that strive to maintain their cohesion even in difficult ( e. g., high density) situations. The paper will show how the synthesis phase also provided inputs to the analysis of empirical data, in a virtuous circle. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We develop a behavioral model for liquidity and volatility based on empirical regularities in trading order flow in the London Stock Exchange. This can be viewed as a very simple agent-based model in which all components of the model are validated against real data. Our empirical studies of order flow uncover several interesting regularities in the way trading orders are placed and cancelled. The resulting simple model of order flow is used to simulate price formation under a continuous double auction, and the statistical properties of the resulting simulated sequence of prices are compared to those of real data. The model is constructed using one stock (AZN) and tested on 24 other stocks. For low volatility, small tick size stocks (called Group I) the predictions are very good, but for stocks outside Group I they are not good. For Group I, the model predicts the correct magnitude and functional form of the distribution of the volatility and the bid-ask spread, without adjusting any parameters based on prices. This suggests that at least for Group I stocks, the volatility and heavy tails of prices are related to market microstructure effects, and supports the hypothesis that, at least on short time scales, the large fluctuations of absolute returns vertical bar r vertical bar are well described by a power law of the form P(vertical bar r vertical bar > R)similar to R-alpha r, with a value of alpha(r) that varies from stock to stock.

AB The aim of the present study was to assess the shear bond strength between a heat-polymerized denture base resin and acrylic resin teeth after immersion in different denture cleansers by simulating a 180-day use. Two acrylic teeth (Biotone, Biotone IPN, Dentsply Ind. e Corn., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil) were chosen for bonding to a heat-polymerized denture base resin (Lucitone 550- Dentsply Ind. e Com., Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil). Eighty specimens were produced and divided into eight groups (n = 10) according to their experimental condition (distilled water, 2% chlorhexidine digluconate, 1% sodium hypochlorite and Corega Tabs). Shear bond strength tests (MPa) were performed with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student-Newman-Keuls' multiple comparisons post hoc analysis (alpha = .05). The shear bond strength results revealed statistically significant differences between the groups. For the Biotone IPN tooth, significantly lower shear bond strength values were found for the group immersed in sodium-perborate solution (4.48 +/- 2.18 MPa) than for the group immersed in distilled water (control group) (10.83 +/- 1.84 MPa). For Biotone, significantly higher bond strength values (10.04 +/- 3.28 MPa) were found for the group immersed in Corega Tabs than for the control group (5.45 +/- 2.93 MPa). The immersion in denture cleanser solutions was more detrimental to the conventional acrylic denture tooth (Biotone) than to the highly cross-linked denture tooth (Biotone IPN). However, this effect was not observed for the groups immersed in Corega Tabs solution, regardless of the type of denture tooth. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents the econometric approach to causal modelling. It is motivated by policy problems. New causal parameters are defined and identified to address specific policy problems. Economists embrace a scientific approach to causality and model the preferences and choices of agents to infer subjective (agent) evaluations as well as objective outcomes. Anticipated and realized subjective and objective outcomes are distinguished. Models for simultaneous causality are developed. The paper contrasts the Neyman-Rubin model of causality with the econometric approach.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly popular in experimental molecular imaging and clinical radiology because it,is non-invasive and capable of producing three-dimensional representations of opaque organisms with high spatial and temporal resolution. Approximately 35% of all clinical MR scans utilize contrast media, however a primary limitation of MR imaging is the sensitivity of contrast agents that require high concentrations (0.1-0.6 mM).(1)
   A number of strategies have been employed to amplify the observed in vivo signal of MR contrast agents. Approaches include attachment of Gd(III) chelates to polymers, proteins and particles, encapsulation into micelles and caged structures, and targeting to receptors. While each of these approaches has yielded significant increases in the relaxivity of MR contrast agents (and therefore sensitivity), all of these classes of complexes possess intrinsic background signal and function solely as anatomical reporters.
   In order to reduce the background signal and simultaneously create probes that are modulated by biochemical processes, caged complexes were designed to coordinatively saturate the paramagnetic ion. Coupled with amplification strategies, these agents represent a means to selectively modulate the observed MR signal and function as in vivo biochemical reporters. For example, to create an in vivo MR assay of enzymatic activities and secondary messengers, agents have been designed and synthesized with removable protection groups that largely prevent access of water to a paramagnetic center. By limiting the access of bulk water (q-modulation) the unprocessed agent is designed to be an ineffective contrast agent, and hence serves as a reliable marker for regions of enzyme activity or the presence of secondary messengers.
   Further, we have focused on designing multimodal contrast agents that are simultaneously detectable by more than one imaging technique. For example, attaching an optical probe to a MR contrast agent provides the means to detect the probe in a whole animal and subsequently validate the results by histological methods. Finally, we describe strategies for signal amplification, and cell delivery vehicles attached to imaging probes for in vivo long-term fate mapping experiments.

AB One of the problems in service-oriented environments is the existence of deceptive agents and their intentional or unintentional malicious behaviour. A more complex challenge is unpredictable changes that some agents make to their behaviour, which is a cause of performance decrease in trust systems. Many trust models have been developed based on feedback mechanisms, but most of them are unable to detect inaccurate information that a deceptive agent may generate; therefore, the trust systems face difficulties in separating the fair from the unfair agents. In this paper, we used learning automata to separate fair from deceptive agents based on an aggregation of their feedback from the votes on each service attribute. The main contribution of this work was a new scheme for separating fair from unfair agents and for estimating the quality of services. We took a more detailed view of service attributes by decomposing a service to its qualitative elements to reach a better match between recommended service characteristics and user preferences. The experimental simulations showed that the new method outperformed other existing models, especially within open environments, in terms of convergence time, accuracy of trust values for unknown agents, user demand modelling, service selection performance and scalability.

AB Agent-based network modeling (ABNM) simulates each person at the individual-level as agents of the simulation, and uses network generation algorithms to generate the network of contacts between individuals. ABNM are suitable for simulating individual-level dynamics of infectious diseases, especially for diseases such as HIV that spread through close contacts within intricate contact networks. However, as ABNM simulates a scaled-version of the full population, consisting of all infected and susceptible persons, they are computationally infeasible for studying certain questions in low prevalence diseases such as HIV. We present a new simulation technique, agent-based evolving network modeling (ABENM), which includes a new network generation algorithm, Evolving Contact Network Algorithm (ECNA), for generating scale-free networks. ABENM simulates only infected persons and their immediate contacts at the individual-level as agents of the simulation, and uses the ECNA for generating the contact structures between these individuals. All other susceptible persons are modeled using a compartmental modeling structure. Thus, ABENM has a hybrid agent-based and compartmental modeling structure. The ECNA uses concepts from graph theory for generating scale-free networks. Multiple social networks, including sexual partnership networks and needle sharing networks among injecting drug-users, are known to follow a scale-free network structure. Numerical results comparing ABENM with ABNM estimations for disease trajectories of hypothetical diseases transmitted on scale-free contact networks are promising for application to low prevalence diseases.

AB We present an agent-based model for studying the societal implications of attitude change theories. Various psychological theories of persuasive communication at the individual level are implemented as simulation experiments. The model allows us to investigate the effects of contagion and assimilation, motivated cognition, polarity, source credibility, and idiosyncratic attitude formation. Simulations show that different theories produce different characteristic macrolevel patterns. Contagion and assimilation are central mechanisms for generating consensus, however, contagion generates a radicalized consensus. Motivated cognition causes societal polarization or the fragmentation of attitudes. Polarity and source credibility have comparatively little effect on the societal distribution of attitudes. We discuss how the simulations provide a bridge between microlevel psychological theories and the aggregated macrolevel studied by sociology. This approach enables new types of evidence for evaluating psychological theory to complement experimental approaches, thus answering calls to enhance the role of coherent and formalized theory in psychological science.

AB This paper empirically identifies social learning and neighborhood effects in schooling investments in a new technology regime. Social learning implies that learning is most efficient when observed heterogeneity in schooling is greatest. The estimates of learning-investment rule, from farm household panel data at the onset of the Green Revolution in India, show that (i) agents learn about schooling returns from income realizations of their neighbors, and (ii) the speed of learning is high when the variation of schooling is large. Thus, schooling distribution of the parents' generation in a community has externalities to schooling investments in children. Simulations show that the variations in schooling within and across communities generate variations in child enrollment rate and average household income. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reasoned action approach, although ubiquitous in health behavior theory (e. g., Theory of Reasoned Action/Planned Behavior), does not adequately address two key dynamical aspects of health behavior: learning and the effect of immediate social context (i.e., social influence). To remedy this, we put forth a computational implementation of the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) using artificial-neural networks. Our model re-conceptualized behavioral intention as arising from a dynamic constraint satisfaction mechanism among a set of beliefs. In two simulations, we show that constraint satisfaction can simultaneously incorporate the effects of past experience (via learning) with the effects of immediate social context to yield behavioral intention, i.e., intention is dynamically constructed from both an individual's pre-existing belief structure and the beliefs of others in the individual's social context. In a third simulation, we illustrate the predictive ability of the model with respect to empirically derived behavioral intention. As the first known computational model of health behavior, it represents a significant advance in theory towards understanding the dynamics of health behavior. Furthermore, our approach may inform the development of population-level agent-based models of health behavior that aim to incorporate psychological theory into models of population dynamics.

AB Trust is very essential to secure and high quality interactions on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we introduce a trust model, which incorporates pairwise trust ratings and reliable factors of acquaintances and constructs an edge-weighted graph to calculate trust values. We interpret trust in two dimensions to better deal with it. We apply the theory in social network field to calculate trust and simulate the trust relationships between humans. We also take advantage of formulas in probability and statistics to analyze the similarities between agents. The algorithm of the trust model aims to be simple, efficient and flexible.

AB Background Recent experimental data have :shown that the combined exposure of rodent hearts to high acoustic pressure and ultrasound contrast agents can induce vascular injury and cell damage. The aim of the present work was to test whether similar effects can be observed in humans.
   Methods and results Twenty patients underwent simultaneous arterial and coronary sinus blood sampling during contrast-enhanced echocardiography using Perfluorocarbon-enhanced Sonicated Dextrose Albumin. Control subjects were compared to groups of patients exposed to either high mechanical index (MI = 1.5) triggered second harmonic (1.3-2.6 MHz) imaging or low mechanical index (MI = 0.2) real-time power modulation imaging for 15 min. No significant changes arterio-venous differences in lactate, total creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin occurred over time in the three groups. Similarly, the arterio-venous difference in CK-MB and troponin I remained stable over time in control and low-MI patients. By contrast, these two parameters progressively increased over time in the high-MI group (P < 0.05 vs. baseline and vs. controls).
   Conclusion Our data suggest that high-MI contrast-enhanced echocardiography can cause subclinical release of cardiac bio-markers in humans, while low-MI real-time imaging appears to be safer.

AB Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may benefit not only the person who uses it but also their uninfected sexual risk contacts. We developed an agent-based model using a novel trial emulation approach to quantify disseminated effects of PrEP use among men who have sex with men in Atlanta, Georgia, from 2015 to 2017. Model components (subsets of agents connected through partnerships in a sexual network but not sharing partnerships with any other agents) were first randomized to an intervention coverage level or the control group; then, within intervention components, eligible agents were randomized to receive or not receive PrEP. We calculated direct and disseminated (indirect) effects using randomization-based estimators and report corresponding 95% simulation intervals across scenarios ranging from 10% coverage in the intervention components to 90% coverage. A population of 11,245 agents was simulated, with an average of 1,551 components identified. When comparing agents randomized to no PrEP in 70% coverage components with control agents, there was a 15% disseminated risk reduction in HIV incidence (risk ratio = 0.85, 95% simulation interval: 0.65, 1.05). Persons not on PrEP may receive a protective benefit by being in a sexual network with higher PrEP coverage. Agent-based models are useful for evaluating possible direct and disseminated effects of HIV prevention modalities in sexual networks.

AB Recent progress in molecular modelling and in experimental techniques, that allow direct observation of molecular structures, lead to an interpretation of physicochemical properties of solutions from the standpoint of microscopic details. Quantum chemistry provides a route to the intermolecular forces and statistical mechanics establishes the connection between the molecular domain and the macroscopic properties of solutions. A strategy combining experiment and theory improves the understanding of fundamental aspects underlying solubility, phase behaviour and many other thermodynamic properties of increasingly complex systems. For example, these developments contribute to the research of new therapeutic compounds such as fluorinated fluids used as in vivo gas carriers or as ultrasound contrast agents.

AB OBJECTIVE. It is mandatory to teach antiseptic skills to staff who use contrast agent injectors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate in an experimental setting and in clinical routine the risk of microbiologic contamination of the syringes of injectors used to administer contrast agent and saline solution for MDCT.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS. Microbiologic contamination of CT injector syringes over multiple uses for several injections was investigated in an experimental setup simulating the clinical setting. Each refill and injection operation was performed by the same technician, who processed a contrast agent for administration in a neighboring room as in clinical CT routine. Multiple administrations of nutritive medium and a chaser bolus were performed with the injection syringes. Simultaneously with each syringe replacement and filling operation, the filling and injection operation was simulated with a separate injection system under normal clinical conditions. Hygienic conditions in the CT department also were evaluated. For microbiologic analysis of devices and of palms of staff, imprints were obtained during clinical routine at the beginning of the study and at follow-up. Throughout the study, the staff participated in continuing education on hygienic behavior, such as hand disinfection and wearing of sterile gloves. In addition, clinical injector syringes were checked for microbiologic contamination.
   RESULTS. In the experimental setup, the first four samples of each simulation experiment were sterile, and the subsequent probes were found to be contaminated with typical dermal bacteria, such as staphylococci. In the CT department, contamination with skin and oral flora was found on surfaces of devices and on palms. No imprint of surfaces or palms was contaminated with nosocomial or fecal pathogens.
   CONCLUSION. Because even optimization of environments does not prevent contamination of syringes, multiple uses of syringes for more than one patient should be prohibited owing to the risk of septic complications.

AB PurposeChemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) NMR or MRI experiments allow detection of low concentrated molecules with enhanced sensitivity via their proton exchange with the abundant water pool. Be it endogenous metabolites or exogenous contrast agents, an exact quantification of the actual exchange rate is required to design optimal pulse sequences and/or specific sensitive agents.
   MethodsRefined analytical expressions allow deeper insight and improvement of accuracy for common quantification techniques. The accuracy of standard quantification methodologies, such as quantification of exchange rate using varying saturation power or varying saturation time, is improved especially for the case of nonequilibrium initial conditions and weak labeling conditions, meaning the saturation amplitude is smaller than the exchange rate (B-1<k).
   ResultsThe improved analytical quantification of exchange rate using varying saturation power/time' (QUESP/QUEST) equations allow for more accurate exchange rate determination, and provide clear insights on the general principles to execute the experiments and to perform numerical evaluation. The proposed methodology was evaluated on the large-shift regime of paramagnetic chemical-exchange-saturation-transfer agents using simulated data and data of the paramagnetic Eu(III) complex of DOTA-tetraglycineamide.
   ConclusionsThe refined formulas yield improved exchange rate estimation. General convergence intervals of the methods that would apply for smaller shift agents are also discussed. Magn Reson Med 79:1708-1721, 2018. (c) 2017 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

AB Objective: Contrast agent enhanced computed tomography (CECT) may be used to detect depletion of superficial proteoglycans in articular cartilage. In principle, computed tomography can also be used to diagnose the state of subchondral bone. Because osteoarthritis affects both cartilage and bone, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the CECT to simultaneously assess the state of these tissues. Further, we studied the spatial variation of contrast agent content in the CECT, properties of subchondral bone and the mechanical stiffness of articular cartilage across the bovine medial tibial plateau.
   Methods: Osteochondral samples (n = 10) were prepared from fresh and visually intact bovine medial tibial plateaus. The dynamic mechanical modulus of the samples was measured using an arthroscopic indentation device. Subsequently, the samples were scanned with a peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) device prior to and after 35.5 h of immersion in an anionic iodinated contrast agent, (ioxaglate) solution. The thickness of the cartilage was measured with ultrasound and pQCT.
   Results: In the medial tibial plateau, the site-dependent variation in the dynamic modulus, thickness of the cartilage, thickness of the subchondral plate and contrast agent content in the superficial cartilage was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The linear correlation between the superficial contrast agent content and the dynamic modulus was p = -0.80 (P < 0.01).
   Discussion: The CECT enabled simultaneous analysis of the contrast agent penetration into cartilage, cartilage thickness and subchondral bone density and thickness. The contrast agent content in cartilage depends on the composition and structure of the tissue. Thereby the CECT also provided indirect information on the mechanical properties of the tissue, analogously to the dGEMRIC. Thus, the CECT may provide means to diagnose simultaneously the integrity of cartilage and subchondral bone in vivo. (C) 2009 Osteoarthritis Research Society International. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper introduces a method to extract driving behaviors from a human expert driver which are applied to an autonomous agent to reproduce proactive driving behaviors. Deep learning techniques were used to extract latent features from the collected data. Extracted features were clustered into behaviors and used to create velocity profiles allowing an autonomous driving agent could drive in a human-like manner. By using proactive driving behaviors, the agent could limit potential sources of discomfort such as jerk and uncomfortable velocities. Additionally, we proposed a method to compare trajectories where not only the geometric similarity is considered, but also velocity, acceleration and jerk. Experimental results in a simulator implemented in ROS show that the autonomous agent built with the driving behaviors was capable of driving similarly to expert human drivers.

TI Multiple Histology Phase II Trials
SO CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
ID CLINICAL-TRIALS; DESIGNS
AB Purpose: Testing agents in cancers with multiple disease subtypes, in which the activity of a new treatment may vary between subtypes, presents statistical and logistical challenges. We propose a flexible phase II strategy which includes both analyses for each histology or stratum and a combined analysis which borrows information from all the patients in the study. Sequential futility analyses are conducted once each subgroup or the overall group reaches a specified minimum accrual.
   Experimental Design: Examples based on a soft tissue sarcoma phase II trial, which includes multiple histologies and simulation studies, are used to assess the statistical properties of the proposed strategy.
   Results: The combined analyses in one phase II trial lead to smaller expected sample sizes when the drug is broadly inactive, and to greater statistical power if there is modest activity across multiple strata as compared with conducting several smaller phase II studies. In addition, by retaining the stratum-specific tests, the design allows the identification of subgroups for which the agents are most active.
   Conclusion: To consider phase II testing with multiple biological subtypes, a strategy which combines both the individual subgroup tests and overall combined tests has promising statistical properties. Our results support the appropriate use of statistical borrowing of information in phase II studies in this setting. More broadly, this work fits the paradigm that phase II studies should include as broad a group of patients as scientifically reasonable, but incorporate design considerations for subsets of patients with potentially differing responses to therapy.

ID MELTING BEHAVIOR
AB Ash fusion temperature (AFT) is an important index for coal gasification. A blend of fluxing agent with coal can decrease the AFT to meet the requirements of specific gasification process. Effect of alkaline oxide and silica alumina ratio on decreasing AFT is focused in this study. Simulation ash was used to investigate the effect of alkaline oxide on AFT. The experimental results showed that AFT of simulation ash significantly decreased by adding single or composite fluxing agent of Fe2O3, CaO, Na2O into it and the silica alumina ratio has specific effect on the AFT. The single or composite fluxing agent was also added to three coals with high AFT, consistent results were obtained. Biomass was blended to adjust the silica alumina ratio of high AFT coal and the AFT was evidently decreased.

AB Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) connect physical sensors that are distributed in the environment. In many applications, the statistical pattern recognition methods, such as decision tree (DT) algorithms, are used to recognize the patterns of the sensor readings. To enable the decision tree classification (DTC) in WSNs, a new distributed decision tree classification (DDTC) algorithm based on mobile agent is proposed in this paper. We organize the conjunctive sets of linear classifiers in DT into groups of operations on attributes. Each group of operations is allocated to a single sensor node. If a mobile agent visits these sensor nodes serially, the recognition result can be acquired step by step. Thus the sensor nodes do not need to transmit all the sensor data to a centralized node where all the data processing is carried out in traditional DTC. In DDTC, if not all the attributes are needed for operation, classification of one instance can finish halfway. Two public data sets are used to evaluate the performance of DTC and DDTC on energy consumption. The simulation results indicate that, compared with the centralized DTC, the DDTC algorithm decreases the number of transmissions, balances the power consumption and computation among sensor nodes, and prolongs the lifetime of the network.

ID SURFACE TREATMENTS; RESIN; DEGRADATION; AGENTS; ANTERIOR
AB Purpose: This study evaluated repair protocols of a non-aged and aged bulk-fill composite in terms of bond strength and leakage.
   Materials and Methods: Ninety-six bulk-fill resin specimens were constructed; half were submitted to thermocycling. Specimens were divided into six groups (n = 16) according to the repair treatments: CG: no repair (control group); Ad: adhesive; DbAd: abrasion with diamond bur + adhesive; SbAd: sandblasting + adhesive; DbSiAd: abrasion with diamond bur + silane + adhesive: and SbSiAd: sandblasting + silane + adhesive. Resin blocks were bonded to the treated surfaces to simulate repair, and the specimens were submitted to microtensile bond strength testing. The failure area was evaluated under a stereomicroscope (40X magnification), and leakage after specimen immersion in silver nitrate solution for 24 h was evaluated under a microscope (200X magnification). Three-way ANOVA (surface treatment, chemical agent, aging) and Tukey's test were performed.
   Results: Ad and DbAd groups showed the lowest bond strengths, while Ad was the only group negatively influenced by aging. The other groups were statistically similar to the CG in both conditions. All groups exhibited leakage, but groups without silane presented a greater percentage of leakage. mainly when diamond burs were used. Thermocycling did not influence leakage, nor did surface treatment in groups with silane.
   Conclusion: For composite repair. the use of silane is recommended, mainly when diamond burs are used as a mechanical surface treatment.

TI Opinion Formation by Social Influence: From Experiments to Modeling
SO PLOS ONE
LA English

ID CONVERGENCE; EVOLUTION; DECISION; DYNAMICS; PHYSICS
AB Predicting different forms of collective behavior in human populations, as the outcome of individual attitudes and their mutual influence, is a question of major interest in social sciences. In particular, processes of opinion formation have been theoretically modeled on the basis of a formal similarity with the dynamics of certain physical systems, giving rise to an extensive collection of mathematical models amenable to numerical simulation or even to exact solution. Empirical ground for these models is however largely missing, which confine them to the level of mere metaphors of the real phenomena they aim at explaining. In this paper we present results of an experiment which quantifies the change in the opinions given by a subject on a set of specific matters under the influence of others. The setup is a variant of a recently proposed experiment, where the subject's confidence on his or her opinion was evaluated as well. In our realization, which records the quantitative answers of 85 subjects to 20 questions before and after an influence event, the focus is put on characterizing the change in answers and confidence induced by such influence. Similarities and differences with the previous version of the experiment are highlighted. We find that confidence changes are to a large extent independent of any other recorded quantity, while opinion changes are strongly modulated by the original confidence. On the other hand, opinion changes are not influenced by the initial difference with the reference opinion. The typical time scales on which opinion varies are moreover substantially longer than those of confidence change. Experimental results are then used to estimate parameters for a dynamical agent-based model of opinion formation in a large population. In the context of the model, we study the convergence to full consensus and the effect of opinion leaders on the collective distribution of opinions.

AB We study a model for continuous-opinion dynamics under bounded confidence. In particular, we analyze the importance of the initial distribution of opinions in determining the asymptotic configuration. Thus, we sketch the structure of attractors of the dynamical system, by means of the numerical computation of the time evolution of the agents density. We show that, for a given bound of confidence, a consensus can be encouraged or prevented by certain initial conditions. Furthermore, a noisy perturbation is added to the system with the purpose of modeling the free will of the agents. As a consequence, the importance of the initial condition is partially replaced by that of the statistical distribution of the noise. Nevertheless, we still find evidence of the influence of the initial state upon the final configuration for a short range of the bound of confidence parameter.

AB Complex systems are modular entities which can collectively generate sophisticated emergent solutions through interactions based on simple, local rules. In this study, I use an agent-based model to elucidate how numerous individual-level components contribute to the collective decision process during house hunting in a mass-recruiting ant species. Myrmecina nipponica combines the use of pheromone trails with a quorum decision rule in collective decisions among nest sites when searching for a new home. The model employed only individual-level rules but accurately emulated group-level properties observed in empirical studies. Simulations suggest that in this system i) both social and private information are necessary for effective decision making, ii) decision making was effective even with very low numbers of 'discriminating' individuals, iii) individual acceptance thresholds were more influential than quorum thresholds in tuning decisions to emphasise speed or accuracy, and iv) acceptance thresholds could also help tune decisions to suit environmental complexity. Similar findings in species using one-to-one recruitment suggest that some individual parameters, such as acceptance thresholds, may hold key functions in collective decision making regardless of the form of recruitment.

AB Substitution of food products will be key to realising widespread adoption of sustainable diets. We present an agent-based model of decision-making and influences on food choice, and apply it to historically observed trends of British whole and skimmed (including semi) milk consumption from 1974 to 2005. We aim to give a plausible representation of milk choice substitution, and test different mechanisms of choice consideration. Agents are consumers that perceive information regarding the two milk choices, and hold values that inform their position on the health and environmental impact of those choices. Habit, social influence and post-decision evaluation are modelled. Representative survey data on human values and long-running public concerns empirically inform the model. An experiment was run to compare two model variants by how they perform in reproducing these trends. This was measured by recording mean weekly milk consumption per person. The variants differed in how agents became disposed to consider alternative milk choices. One followed a threshold approach, the other was probability based. All other model aspects remained unchanged. An optimisation exercise via an evolutionary algorithm was used to calibrate the model variants independently to observed data. Following calibration, uncertainty and global variance-based temporal sensitivity analysis were conducted. Both model variants were able to reproduce the general pattern of historical milk consumption, however, the probability-based approach gave a closer fit to the observed data, but over a wider range of uncertainty. This responds to, and further highlights, the need for research that looks at, and compares, different models of human decision-making in agent-based and simulation models. This study is the first to present an agent-based modelling of food choice substitution in the context of British milk consumption. It can serve as a valuable pre-curser to the modelling of dietary shift and sustainable product substitution to plant-based alternatives in Britain.

AB Populations of simulated agents controlled by dynamical neural networks are trained by artificial evolution to access linguistic instructions and to execute them by indicating, touching, or moving specific target objects. During training the agent experiences only a subset of all object/action pairs. During postevaluation, some of the successful agents proved to be able to access and execute also linguistic instructions not experienced during training. This owes to the development of a semantic space, grounded in the sensory motor capability of the agent and organized in a systematized way in order to facilitate linguistic compositionality and behavioral generalization. Compositionality seems to be underpinned by a capability of the agents to access and execute the instructions by temporally decomposing their linguistic and behavioral aspects into their constituent parts (i.e., finding the target object and executing the required action). The comparison between two experimental conditions, in one of which the agents are required to ignore rather than to indicate objects, shows that the composition of the behavioral set significantly influences the development of compositional semantic structures.

AB So far, research into pubic goods games has been limited to studying the effects of leadership in an experimental works. The results found differ according to the population studied, the number of participants and the country chosen, which makes ideas imprecise when it comes to understanding how cooperation evolves. In this article we try to generalize these works by introducing an agent-based model to simulate interactions in public goods games on a graph, and study the impact of leadership by example on the evolution of cooperation among selfish individuals in a scale-free network. Consistent with recent experimental studies, our results show that leading by example leads to a significant increase in the overall contribution and the group's welfare, as compared to the situation without leadership. We have demonstrated also that strong leaders have an important role in promoting optimal cooperation in public goods games and consequently they bring more welfare to their groups.

AB This article proposes a novel ultralarge-scale crowd monitoring system, namely, the ULCM system. The ULCM system enables advanced sensing and networking technologies aimed at collecting and processing multimodal, multiperspective, and real-time crowding data relevant to crowd management. This data will be further analyzed to provide a global realization of evolving events over a large geographical area as they occur in real time. The ULCM is the infrastructure component of an intelligent platform that is being developed by our research group to provide crowd intelligence to decision makers through an interactive digitized visual environment. In order to achieve a full comprehensive scene overview, the ULCM deployment utilizes a multiplicity of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) agents in different operational scenarios. The aerial deployment and control are realized by custom multiple UAV networks and airborne LiDAR sensors. The deployment and control on the ground sensory agents are based on multiple subnetworks, including closed-circuit television (CCTV) and infrared gas and ultrasonic sensors networks. Eventually, ULCM employs the software-defined network (SDN) and edge cloud technologies to optimize the networking and data analytics performance from the perspective of infrastructure.

AB A new model for polymer silylation is proposed that takes into account three mechanisms: The relaxation of the polymer during silylation, a diffusivity of the silylating agent which increases with resist matrix expansion, as well as a local reaction rate retardation due to stress induced by resist swelling. These mechanisms capture changes in profile shape during silylation. The resulting nonlinear differential equations are solved two-dimensional (2D) using the finite element method and the influence of the main parameters is studied as a function of feature size and feature type, illustrating the effects of initial aerial image and processing conditions on the final resist image. The simulation profiles reproduce the silylation depth reduction with feature size and abrupt encroachment heretofore unexplained in various experimental studies. (C) 1997 American Vacuum Society.

AB A new approach to controlling the ensemble behavior of many identical agents is presented in this paper, inspired by motor recruitment in skeletal muscles. A group of finite state agents responds randomly to broadcast commands, each producing a state-dependent output that is measured in aggregate. Despite the lack of feedback signal and initial state information, this control architecture allows a single central controller to direct the aggregate output of the ensemble toward a desired value. First, the system is modeled as an ensemble of statistically independent, identically distributed, binary-state Markov processes with state transition probabilities designated by a central controller. Second, steady-state behavior, convergence rate, and variance of the aggregate output, i.e., the total number of recruited agents, are analyzed, and design trade-offs in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and the number of spurious transitions are made. Third, a limited feedback signal, only detecting if the output has reached a goal, is added to the system, and the recruitment controller is designed as a stochastic shortest path problem. Optimal convergence rate and associated transition probabilities are obtained. Finally, the theoretical results are verified and demonstrated with both numerical simulation and control of an artificial muscle actuator made up of 60 binary shape memory alloy motor units.

AB Reducing risky behaviour and/or avoiding sites where the risk of infection is perceived as higher (by social and/or spatial distancing) represent the two main forms of non-pharmaceutical behavioural responses of humans to the threats of infectious diseases. Here we investigate, within a reaction-diffusion setting, a family of new models for an endemic SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) infectious disease for which no vaccine is available and individuals' responses to the infection threat are entirely based on changes either in their social behaviour or in their mobility behaviour, that is avoiding to visit sites with a large infection prevalence.
   First, we derive general conditions for the onset of Turing patterns for a general family of spatially inhomogeneous SIR models with a prevalence-dependent contact rate and constant recruitment. Then, we characterize our main family of models where the behavioural response also includes a spatial component, and show the condition bringing to the mitigation, or even the destruction, of Turing patterns. The same conditions can allow the transition from Turing-Hopf spatio-temporal patterns to pure Hopf temporal patterns. The same is also done for two SIS models. These results bring an inference of interest: the reduction of spatial clustering typically observed during the course of an epidemics might be related to a combination of agents' spontaneous social and spatial distancing. To validate our theoretical results and further explore other spatio-temporal effects of the proposed spatial behavioural responses, numerical simulations of a specific instance of the above-mentioned family of SIR models have been performed.

SO JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY

DT Article
ID EFFECTIVE CHOICE; SIMULATION
AB We report on a series of computer simulation experiments regarding the management of a common resource. We were particularly interested in the effects of uncertainty and satisfaction on the harvesting behaviour of simulated agents. The experimental study of long-term dynamics of threatened resources can hardly be carried out using human subjects. We therefore experimented with simulated consumers, the so-called consumats, whose properties are derived from a comprehensive, multitheoretical model of consumer behaviour. A consumat is equipped with needs and abilities, and may engage in different cognitive processes, such as deliberation, social comparison, imitation, and repetition of previous behaviour. In a first simulation experiment we show as to how uncertainty may stimulate an imitation effect that promotes over-harvesting. In two subsequent series of experiments, we show that increased uncertainty results in an increased 'optimism' of consumats regarding future outcomes, an increased likelihood of imitative behaviour, and a lesser adaptation of harvesting behaviour during resource depletion. These 'process-effects' promote higher levels of harvesting from a collective resource. The main experimental conclusions and the issue of validating simulation results are discussed.

AB A new CYP26A1 homology model was built based on the crystal structure of cyanobacterial CYP120A1. The model quality was examined for stereochemical accuracy, folding reliability, and absolute quality using a variety of different bioinformatics tools. Furthermore, the docking capabilities of the model were assessed by docking of the natural substrate all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), and a group of known azole- and tetralone-based CYP26A1 inhibitors. The preferred binding pose of atRA suggests the (4S)-OH-atRA metabolite production, in agreement with recently available experimental data. The distances between the ligands and the heme group iron of the enzyme are in agreement with corresponding distances obtained for substrates and azole inhibitors for other cytochrome systems. The calculated theoretical binding energies agree with recently reported experimental data and show that the model is capable of discriminating between natural substrate, strong inhibitors (R116010 and R115866), and weak inhibitors (liarozole, fluconazole, tetralone derivatives).

AB Purpose: To test the hypothesis that simulation of an intrapulpal pressure during the application of dentin bonding systems influences hybrid layer formation in vitro. Materials and Methods: 180 teeth and three different bonding agents were used for shear bond strength measurements and for confocal laser scanning microscopy studies on the dentin-composite interface. The bonding agents (30 teeth each material) were applied without (90 teeth, Group A) and with intrapulpal pressure simulation of 34 cm H2O with water (90 teeth, Group B). 45 specimens from each group were sheared in a testing machine, and 45 teeth from each group were used for CLSM studies after labeling the primer components of the bonding agents with a fluorescent dye. Results: After simulation of pulpal pressure the bond strengths decreased significantly in all groups (Syntac [without/with]: 16.0 +/- 4.5/8.0 +/- 3.7, P = 0.001; Gluma: 13.3 +/- 4.6/8.4 +/- 4.4, P = 0.008; Prime & Bond NT: 14.8 +/- 5.8/8.7 +/- 5.7, P = 0.007; n = 15 each; U-tests). There were no significant differences between the hybrid layer thickness without/with simulation of pulpal pressure (Syntac: 3.6 +/- 0.6/4.1 +/- 1.2, P = 0.35; Gluma: 3.5 +/- 0.6/3.7 +/- 0.9, P = 0.49; Prime & Bond NT: 3.5 +/- 0.9/3.8 +/- 0.8, P = 0.44; n = 15 each; U-tests). In the case of simulation of an intrapulpal pressure, CLSM examination revealed a distinctly shallower penetration of the adhesives into dentin compared to the samples treated without intrapulpal pressure.

AB Complex behaviour in many systems arises from the stochastic interactions of spatially distributed particles or agents. Stochastic reaction-diffusion processes are widely used to model such behaviour in disciplines ranging from biology to the social sciences, yet they are notoriously difficult to simulate and calibrate to observational data. Here we use ideas from statistical physics and machine learning to provide a solution to the inverse problem of learning a stochastic reaction-diffusion process from data. Our solution relies on a non-trivial connection between stochastic reaction-diffusion processes and spatio-temporal Cox processes, a well-studied class of models from computational statistics. This connection leads to an efficient and flexible algorithm for parameter inference and model selection. Our approach shows excellent accuracy on numeric and real data examples from systems biology and epidemiology. Our work provides both insights into spatio-temporal stochastic systems, and a practical solution to a long-standing problem in computational modelling.

AB In this paper, we develop an interdisciplinary agent-based framework for studying the provision of forest ecosystem goods and services (ES) at the landscape level. It combines forest owner types and their behavioral models with forest decision support systems (DSS). For this, we draw on mainstream decision-making theories in social sciences and relevant empirical evidence from Europe and beyond to suggest how economic, sociological and psychological rationalities can be combined to build a typology and behavioral models of forest owner decision-making including responsiveness to policy and socioeconomic changes. We then discuss how the theory-driven and evidence-based behavioral models in combination with forest owner and forest management insights can be used to analyze forest management behavior and responsiveness to policy and socioeconomic developments. By comparing standard forest DSS modeling results to exemplary results using the agent-based framework in terms of long-term simulations of timber production and biodiversity conservation in a case study in Sweden, we illustrate how the framework accounts for more differentiated and more realistic forest management practices at the forest landscape level. We discuss how the agent-based framework also helps explore and explain the impacts of future policy and socioeconomic changes on the provision of forest ES. We then suggest directions for future research that can further develop the framework and its use in forest modeling and DSS to better analyze the impact of future developments on forest management and the provision of forest ES at the landscape level.

TI Epidemic spreading by objective traveling
SO EPL
LA English
DT Article
AB A fundamental feature of agent traveling in social networks is that traveling is usually not a random walk but with a specific destination and goes through the shortest path from starting to destination. A serious consequence of the objective traveling is that it may result in a fast epidemic spreading, such as SARS etc. In this letter we present a reaction-traveling model to study how the objective traveling influences the epidemic spreading. We consider a random scale-free meta-population network with sub-population at each node. Through a SIS model we theoretically prove that near the threshold of epidemic outbreak, the objective traveling can significantly enhance the final infected population and the infected fraction at a node is proportional to its betweenness for the traveling agents and approximately proportional to its degree for the non-traveling agents. Numerical simulations have confirmed the theoretical predictions. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2009

AB A mathematical model for analyzing the double layer (dl) effect on pulse plating in the presence of additives is presented. Numerical simulations are employed to predict the influence of additives with various inclusion rates and capacities on current and potential response and mass transfer. It is shown that capacitive current density will not only increase in the presence of additives due to the increase in overpotential but also will increase with increasing dl capacity. Then, the variation of surface concentrations of additives and metal ions will even out as a result of the charging and discharging of the dl. The predicted results are compared with the experimental overpotential response on a copper rotating disk electrode in a bath containing 0.348 M CuSO4 and 2.06 M H2SO4 with and without 100 ppm polyethylene glycol. Good agreement between them is found. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

AB We elected to examine the efficacy of the topically applied immunosuppressive agent FK506 (Prograf(R)) in the treatment of alopecia areata (AA) using the Dundee experimental bald rat (DEER) model, Thirty lesional DEER rats were allocated to five groups of six, Group I rats received 0.1 mL of a 0.25% solution of FK506 within a 2 x 2 cm marked area on one bald flank twice a week (125 mu g FK506/cm(2) per week) for 8 weeks, while the contralateral flank was left untreated, In group II, 0.05 mL of a 0.1% solution of FK506 was applied 5 days per week on one flank (62.5 mu g FK506/cm(2) per week) and control vehicle to the opposite flank for 8 weeks. Group III rats were treated as in group II except that drug and vehicle were applied twice a week (25 mu g FK506/cm(2) per week) for 4 weeks. A positive control group received orally administered cyclosporin A (CsA) (10 mg/kg daily) for 8 weeks and a further group was left untreated, Rats were regularly examined and photographed with skin biopsies taken from groups II and III. All FK506-treated rats regrew hair at the site of drug application within 14-21 days. Growth continued for 3 weeks beyond termination of treatment after which gradual hair loss was observed, No hair growth was seen as a result of vehicle application and hair loss continued on untreated areas and in the untreated control group, Immunohistology revealed a drastic reduction in the follicular inflammatory infiltrate at the site of the FK506 application, The oral CsA group responded by simultaneous regrowth of hair over the whole body. Our findings suggest that FK506 may have considerable potential as a topical treatment for AA.

SO LAND USE POLICY

ID LAND-USE CHANGES; DRIVING FORCES; GROWTH; CALIBRATION
AB Several methods for modeling urban expansion are available. Most of them are based on a statistical, a cellular automaton (CA) and/or an agent-based (AB) approach. Statistical and CA approaches are based on the implicit assumption that peoples behavior is not likely to change over the considered time horizon. Such assumption limits the ability to simulate long-term predictions as people's behavior changes over time. An approach to consider people's behavior is the use of an AB system, in which the decision-making process of agents needs to be parameterized. Most existing studies, which make use of empirical data to define the agents' decision-making criteria, rely on intensive data collection efforts. The considerable data requirements limit the AB-system's ability to model a large study area, as the number of agents for which data on decision-making criteria is required, increases with the size of the study area. This paper presents a hybrid urban expansion model (HUEM) that integrates logistic regression (Logit), CA and AB approaches to simulate future urban development. A key feature of HUEM lies in its ability to address various people behaviors that are variable over time through AB relying on a sample approach that combines Logit and CA. Three agent sets are defined; developer agents, farmer agents and planning permission authority agent. The agents' decision-making process is parameterized using CA and Logit models. The interactions of the agents are simulated through a series of rules. To assess HUEM performance, it is calibrated for Wallonia (Belgium) to simulate urban expansion between 1990 and 2000. Calibration results are then assessed by comparing the 2000 simulated map and the actual 2000 land-use map. Furthermore, the performance of HUEM is compared to a number of typical spatial urban expansion models, i.e. Logit model, CA model and CA-Logit to assess the added-value of HUEM. The comparison shows the performance of HUEM is better than other models in terms of allocation ability.

AB In order to numerically simulate the foaming behavior of mastic sealer containing the blowing agent, a foaming and driving force model are needed which incorporate the foaming characteristics. Also, the elastic stress model is required to represent the material behavior of co-existing phase of liquid state and the cured polymer. It is important to determine the thermal properties such as thermal conductivity and specific heat because foaming behavior is heavily influenced by temperature change. In this study, three models are proposed to explain the foaming process and material behavior during and after the process. To obtain the material parameters in each model, following experiments and the numerical simulations are performed: thermal test, simple shear test and foaming test. The error functions are defined as differences between the experimental measurements and the numerical simulation results, and then the parameters are determined by minimizing the error functions. To ensure the validity of the obtained parameters, the confirmation simulation for each model is conducted by applying the determined parameters. The cross-verification is performed by measuring the foaming/shrinkage force. The results of cross-verification tended to follow the experimental results. Interestingly, it was possible to estimate the micro-deformation occurring in automobile roof surface by applying the proposed model to oven process analysis. The application of developed analysis technique will contribute to the design with minimized micro-deformation.

AB A detailed investigation of addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) in the free-radical polymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the presence of methyl alpha-(bromomethyl)acrylate (MBMA) was carried out to elucidate mechanistic details with efficient macromonomer synthesis as an underlying goal. Advanced modeling techniques were used in connection with the experimental work. Curve fitting of simulated and experimental molecular weight distributions with respect to the rate coefficient for addition of propagating radicals to MBMA (k(add)) over 60-120 degreesC resulted in E-add = 21.7 kJ mol(-1) and A(add) = 2.18 x 10(6) M-1 s(-1) and a very weak temperature adds dependence of the chain-transfer constant (E-add approximate to E-p). The rate coefficient for fragmentation of adduct radicals at 60 degreesC was estimated as k(f) approximate to 39 s(-1) on the basis of experimental data of the MMA conversion and the concentration of 2-carbomethoxy-2propenyl end groups. The approach developed is generic and can be applied to any AFCT system in which copolymerization does not occur and in which the resulting unsaturated end groups do not undergo further reactions.

   ACCULTURATION
AB Context: Complex systems approaches can help to elucidate mechanisms that shape population-level patterns in diet and inform policy approaches. This study reports results of a structured review of key design elements and methods used by existing complex systems models of diet.
   Evidence acquisition: The authors conducted systematic searches of the PubMed, Web of Science, and LILACS databases between May and September 2018 to identify peer-reviewed manuscripts that used agent-based models or system dynamics models to explore diet. Searches occurred between November 2017 and May 2018. The authors extracted relevant data regarding each study's diet and nutrition outcomes; use of data for parameterization, calibration, and validation; results; and generated insights. The literature search adhered to PRISMA guidelines.
   Evidence synthesis: Twenty-two agent-based model studies and five system dynamics model studies met the inclusion criteria. Mechanistic studies explored neighborhood- (e.g., residential segregation), interpersonal- (e.g., social influence) and individual-level (e.g., heuristics that guide food purchasing decisions) mechanisms that influence diet. Policy-oriented studies examined policies related to food pricing, the food environment, advertising, nutrition labels, and social norms. Most studies used empirical data to inform values of key parameters; studies varied in their approaches to calibration and validation.
   Conclusions: Opportunities remain to advance the state of the science of complex systems approaches to diet and nutrition. These include using models to better understand mechanisms driving population-level diet, increasing use of models for policy decision support, and leveraging the wide availability of epidemiologic and policy evaluation data to improve model validation.

AB Volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane have been shown to offer anti-inflammatory effects during experimental endotoxemia whereas the a-adrenergic vasopressor norepinephrine exhibits proinflammatory properties on systemic cytokine release under the same conditions. However, during major surgery and in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome or sepsis both agents are frequently administered concurrently. We therefore aimed to investigate the influence of preexisting i.v. administration of noradrenaline or vasopressin on the anti-inflammatory effects of isoflurane during experimental endotoxemia. Anesthetized, ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats (n=7 per group) were randomly treated. In the LPS-only group, animals received lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 5 mg/kg, i.v.) with no further specific treatment. In the LPS-isoflurane group, isoflurane inhalation at I MAC was initiated simultaneously with induction of endotoxemia (LPS 5 mg/kg, i.v.). Animals in the LPS-isoflurane-norepinephrine group received norepinephrine infusion at 50 mu g/kg/h 10 min prior to injection of LPS and inhalation of isoflurane. In the LPS-isoflurane-vasopressin group, vasopressin was administered at 0.5 IE/kg/h 10 min prior to LPS and isoflurane. In the LPS-norepinephrine and the LPS-vasopressin groups the infusion of each vasopressor was started prior to LPS injection without any application of isoflurane. A Sham group served as the control. After 4 It of endotoxemia, plasma levels of TNF alpha, IL-1B and IL-10 were measured. Alveolar macrophages (AM) were cultured ex vivo for nitrite assay. Induction of endotoxemia resulted in a significant rise in measured plasma cytokines and nitrite production from cultured AM. Inhalation of isoflurane significantly attenuated plasma levels of TNFa (-65%) and IL-1 beta (-53%) compared to the LPS-only group whereas it had no effect on nitrite production from cultured AM. Preexisting infusions of norepinephrine or vasopressin abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of isoflurane. The data demonstrate that the administration of norepinephrine or vasopressin both counteracted the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled isoflurane on proinflammatory cytokine release during experimental endotoxemia in rats.

AB Objectives The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the anticaries activity of a nanoemulsion composed of soybean oil, water, Triton X-100 and cetylpyridinium chloride
   Methods Tooth blocks (3 mm length x 3 mm width x 2 mm thickness) were cut from smooth surfaces of selected molar teeth using a water-cooled diamond wire saw The blocks were randomly assigned to three experimental groups (A) nanoemulsion, (B) 0 12% chlorhexidine gluconate, and (C) no treatment The formation of dental canes in human tooth enamel was tested using a continuous flow dual-organism (Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei), biofilm model, which acts as an artificial mouth and simulates the biological and physiological activities observed within the oral environment Experimental groups A and B were treated with their respective solutions once daily for 30 s on each occasion, while group C received no treatment 10% sucrose was supplied every 6 h for 6 min to simulate meals and pH cycling The experiment lasted for 5 days, and the tooth blocks were harvested and processed for demineralization assessment using transverse microradiography (TMR).
   Results For both lesion depth and mineral loss, statistical analysis indicated that Emulsion was significantly lower than Control and Chlorhexidine, and Chlorhexidine was significantly lower than Control
   Conclusions We conclude that cetylpyrichnium-containing nanoemulsions appear to present a feasible means of preventing the occurrence of early caries (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

DE Microshear bond strength; Luting resins; Porcelain
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare microshear bond strength of three different luting resins using a new microshear method closely simulating clinical condition.
   Methods: Thirty 1-mm-thick slices of intact human first molars and thirty 0.8-mm-diameter feldspathic porcelain rods were etched by 37% phosphoric acid for enamels and 9.5% hydrofluoric acid for porcelains. Adhesive (Margin bond) was applied on both silaned porcelain and enamel surfaces. Three luting agents were used as follows: (1) dual polymerized cement (DP) (Variolink II refill), (2) light polymerized cement (LP) (Variolink II base), and (3) flow composite (FC) (Tetrick flow). Porcelain rods were attached to flat enamel surfaces followed by cementation. The specimens were thermal cycled for 500 cycles between 5 and 55 degrees C, and microshear test was then performed with wire and loop method using Dillon Quantrol. Modes of failure were identified by stereomicroscope, and one sample of each group was observed with SEM. finally collected data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA (P < .05).
   Results: The mean microshear bond strengths were 21.48 (DP), 23.92 (LP) and 24.57 (FC) in MPa units. Most cohesive failures occurred in groups LP and FC, whereas most adhesive failures were observed in group DP.
   Conclusion: Bond strength of feldspathic porcelain to enamel with studied luting resins were not significantly different among the groups based on current method (P < .05). (C) 2010 Japan Prosthodontic Society. Published by Elsevier Ireland. All rights reserved.

ID ECONOMICS
AB We propose a Nelson-Winter model with an explicitly defined landscape to study the formation of high-tech industrial clusters such as those in Silicon Valley. The existing literature treats clusters as the result of location choices and focuses on how firms may benefit from locating in a cluster. We deviate from this tradition by emphasizing that high-tech industrial clusters are characterized by concentrated entrepreneurship. We argue that the emergence of clusters can be explained by the social effect through which the appearance of one or a few entrepreneurs inspire many followers locally. Agent-based simulation is employed to show the dynamics of the model. Data from the simulation and the properties of the model are discussed in light of empirical regularities. Variations of the model are simulated to study policies that are favorable to the high-tech economy.

AB Two categories of models have been developed to describe the mass transfer process in emulsion liquid membrane extraction of phenols/amines from waste water. In the first the reaction between the transferred solutes and the trapping agent in the internal phase is assumed to be irreversible while in the second a reversible reaction is involved. Generally the various authors have tested the proposed models against their own experimental data. The present study is an attempt to investigate the efficacy of the reversible reaction model of Bunge and Noble, which is simpler to use and requires input of less parameters to predict the experimental data reported by different authors. It is shown that by introducing a shape factor into the model for the effective diffusivity of solute within the macrodrop, it is possible to use this model to simulate experimental data of other groups reasonably well.

AB Besides the heterogeneity of agents' beliefs, we perceive that, contrary to the constant short-term risk attitude of fundamentalists, the risk attitude for chartists varies over time due to psychological factors such as prospect theory's reflection effect, which refers to the reversing of risk aversion/risk loving in the case of gains/losses. Thus, this paper assumes that complicated dynamics in recent asset markets are attributed to the significant effects of time-varying and heterogeneous risk attitudes as well as agents' herd behavior, and generalizes an adaptive beliefs system in order to characterize them. This paper also analyzes the existence of stable steady states of the generalized adaptive beliefs system, providing a new psychological insight into excessive and asymmetric volatility. Given the dynamic system, numerical simulations find that, when the chartists are less risk averse than the fundamentalists and their herding propensity increases, time variation in risk attitudes gives rise to large amplitude changes in proportion to agent groups and expand price fluctuations through chaotic dynamics. Along these lines, this paper highlights that psychological factors serve as decisive source of asymmetry in volatility as well as excess volatility, which are observed in the return data.

AB The utilization of CO2 for enhancing oil recovery is an environmentally friendly way to dispose the industrial CO2 emissions. CO2 utilization ratio is defined as the volume ratio of produced oil to injected CO2. CO2 huff and puff technology can further improve oil recovery in high water cut reservoirs. However, as the huff and puff cycle increase, gas channeling is easy to happen and the utilization ratio of CO2 is reduced. Organic fiber composite gel is an effective plugging agent for gas channel. The major objective of this paper is to study the mechanisms of increasing CO2 utilization by injecting organic composite gel as the plugging agent. A large scale (40 cm*40 cm*3 cm) natural rock model with grooves is used to simulate the experimental conditions such as channeling channel and horizontal well. Two groups of experiments of direct CO2 huff and plugging agent assisted CO2 huff and puff were conducted. By comparing the pressure changes during the experiments, the mechanism of blocking the channel, balancing the CO2 displacement front and improving the utilization ratio of CO2 were analyzed. The experimental process was fitted by reservoir numerical simulation, and the remaining oil distribution, plugging agent distribution and CO2 distribution in CO2 huff and puff under different conditions were further demonstrated. Results show that compared with direct CO2 stimulation, the distribution of remaining oil saturation and reservoir pressure become more uniform and the utilization ratio of CO2 is greatly increased after injecting organic fiber composite gel. It is mainly due to the fact that the injected plugging agents flow preferentially into high water saturation region along the high permeability channels. Then, they can generate the organic fiber composite gel and remain in the channeling paths. As a result, the following injected CO2 will be forced to flow towards oil-rich regions radially and uniformly. Thereby, more CO2 can contact and react with the in-situ oil, resulting much higher oil recovery. In other words, the utilization ratio of CO2 is greatly improved. Taking Jidong oilfield as an example, it has been injected 19.2 x 10(4) t CO2 with the total oil production by 21.1 x 10(4) t. The utilization ratio of CO2 is calculated as high as 1.09. The observations of this study provide the theoretical basis for future application of organic fiber composite gel before CO2 flooding in the water channeling reservoirs.

AB In placebo-controlled trials, the placebo component of treatments is usually assessed by simulating a therapy through the administration of a dummy treatment (placebo) in order to eliminate the specific effects of the therapy. Recently, a radically different approach to the analysis of placebo responses has been implemented in which placebo responses are assessed without placebo groups. To do this, the placebo (psychological) component is eliminated by conducting hidden (unexpected) administrations of the active treatment. Compelling experimental evidence now shows that when the psychological component is eliminated through the administration of therapies unbeknownst to the patient, the effects of a variety of treatments are significantly reduced. Overall, the experimental data show that the action of different pharmacological agents can be modulated by cognitive and affective factors that can increase or decrease the effects of drugs. This experimental approach is thus a window into the complex interactions between psychology and pharmacodynamics.

AB Spatial simulations are a valuable tool in understanding dynamic spatial processes. In developing these simulations, it is often required to make decisions about how to represent features in the environment and how events unfold in time. These spatial and temporal choices have been shown to significantly alter model outcomes, yet their interaction is less well understood. In this paper, we make use of a simple group foraging model and systematically vary how features are represented (cell size of the landscape) as well as how events unfold in time (order in which foragers take action) to better understand their interaction. Our results show similar nonlinear responses to changes in spatial representation found in the literature, and an effect of the order in which agents were processed. There was also a clear interaction between how features are represented and how events unfold in time, where, under certain environmental representations results were found to be more sensitive to the order in which individuals were processed. Furthermore, the effects of feature representation, scheduling of agents, and their interaction were all found to be influenced by the heterogeneity of the spatial surface (food), suggesting that the statistical properties of the underlying spatial variable will additionally play a role. We suggest that navigating these interactions can be facilitated through a better understanding of how these choices affect the decision landscape(s) on which agents operate. Specifically, how changes to representation affect aggregation and resolution of the decision surface, and thereby the degree to which agents interact directly or indirectly. We suggest that the challenges of dealing with spatial representation, scheduling, and their interaction, while building models could also present an opportunity. As explicitly including alternate representations and scheduling choices during model selection can aid in identifying optimal agent-environment representations. Potentially leading to improved insights into the relationships between spatial processes and the environments in which they occur.

AB The purpose of this study is to obtain multiple effects on cellulose materials treated with a compound resulted after the interaction between a flame retardant agent (Aflammit KWB), a melamine derivate selected as modifier and a natural polymer, chitosan, using H3PO4 as catalyst. The resulted compound was applied to the fabric by pad-dry-cure technology. We studied the influence of chitosan concentration, as anti-creasing agent, and Tubifix MF100 concentration, a flame retardant synergic system, on the behaviour of the system based on Aflammit KWB as agent, with known flame retardant characteristics. The experimental data used in this study were determined using the qualitative method (FT-IR) and quantitative methods.

AB Background: All surgical procedures are associated with a degree of pain. The experience of uncontrolled post-operative pain can have significant implications on health care costs. Recent studies have demonstrated that intravenous (IV) ibuprofen is an effective, safe, well-tolerated analgesic when administered for both abdominal hysterectomy and orthopedic surgery. The use of ibuprofen leads to a reduction in pain severity at rest and with movement and also decreases narcotic consumption. IV acetaminophen has also been shown to be effective in alleviating pain for surgical procedures. Given the established safety and efficacy of IV ibuprofen and IV acetaminophen for perioperative pain, we were interested in determining if any potential synergies are afforded by the simultaneous administration of both medications in orthopedic surgery patients.
   Objectives: Compare the safety and efficacy of the perioperative administration of IV ibuprofen alone and in combination with IV acetaminophen in total knee or hip arthroplasty.
   Study Design: Randomized, single center, trial.
   Setting: Tertiary care center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.
   Methods: Seventy-eight patients undergoing elective knee or hip arthroplasty were randomized into 2 groups. Group 1 received 800 mg of IV ibuprofen at induction, and 800 mg of IV ibuprofen every 6 hours until discharge or for up to 5 days. Group 2 received 800 mg IV ibuprofen at induction and 1000 mg IV acetaminophen at closure, and 800 mg IV ibuprofen plus 1000 mg IV acetaminophen every 6 hours until discharge for up to 5 days. The primary endpoint was demonstrated using the visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores. Secondary endpoints included opioid requirements, quality of recovery scale (QoR), length of post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) stay, antiemetic consumption, opioid consumption, and opioid related adverse events.
   Results: Patients in Group 2 had lower VAS scores (P < 0.002) by day 3 only. Opioid requirements and adverse events were significantly less in Group 2 which was also statistically significant. Time to discharge from the PACU for Group 1 on average was 55 minutes and 38 minutes for Group 2 (P = 0.178) which was not statistically significant although may have clinical significance. Length of hospital stay was also evaluated; however, no statistical significance was noted between the 2 groups (P = 0.138). There was no significant difference in QoR scores which were 177 (SD = 15.44) for Group 1 (n = 35) and 179.5 (SD = 16.30) for Group 2 (n = 39).
   Limitations: The study is a single center study with the attendant risk of convenience bias. The total number of patients is also small and may call into question the reproducibility of the results. No cost analysis was undertaken as part of this study. Further research should aim at prospectively designed multi-center double blinded randomized control trials with an analysis of the pharmacoeconomics of the use of these agents.
   Conclusion: IV ibuprofen combined with IV acetaminophen demonstrated additional benefit in terms of improved pain scores on post-operative day 3 only, fewer potential adverse events related to opioid use, and decreased use of opioids when compared to IV ibuprofen alone.

AB Background: A characteristic feature of atherosclerosis is its diffuse involvement of arteries across the entire human body. Bone marrow cells (BMC) can be simultaneously transferred with therapeutic genes and magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents prior to their transplantation. Via systemic transplantation, these dual-transferred BMCs can circulate through the entire body and thus function as vehicles to carry genes/contrast agents to multiple atherosclerosis. This study was to evaluate the feasibility of using in vivo MR imaging (MRI) to monitor BMC-mediated interleukin-10 (IL-10) gene therapy of atherosclerosis.
   Methodology: For in vitro confirmation, donor mouse BMCs were transduced by IL-10/lentivirus, and then labeled with a T2-MR contrast agent (Feridex). For in vivo validation, atherosclerotic apoE 2/2 mice were intravenously transplanted with IL-10/Feridex-BMCs (Group I, n = 5) and Feridex-BMCs (Group II, n = 5), compared to controls without BMC transplantation (Group III, n = 5). The cell migration to aortic atherosclerotic lesions was monitored in vivo using 3.0T MRI with subsequent histology correlation. To evaluate the therapeutic effect of BMC-mediated IL-10 gene therapy, we statistically compared the normalized wall indexes (NWI) of ascending aortas amongst different mouse groups with various treatments.
   Principal Findings: Of in vitro experiments, simultaneous IL-10 transduction and Feridex labeling of BMCs were successfully achieved, with high cell viability and cell labeling efficiency, as well as IL-10 expression efficiency (>= 90%). Of in vivo experiments, MRI of animal groups I and II showed signal voids within the aortic walls due to Feridex-created artifacts from the migrated BMCs in the atherosclerotic plaques, which were confirmed by histology. Histological quantification showed that the mean NWI of group I was significantly lower than those of group II and group III (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: This study has confirmed the possibility of using MRI to track, in vivo, IL-10/Feridex-BMCs recruited to atherosclerotic lesions, where IL-10 genes function to prevent the progression of atherosclerosis.

AB The overall performance of emission trading (ET), a market-based emission regulation tool, strongly relies on participants' participation and responses. In order to improve market design, it is important for policy makers to understand the participants' trading behaviors in different market environments. However, human behaviors cannot be easily modeled with conventional analytical methods due to its "bounded rationality" characteristics. In this paper, based on the complementary features between experimental and agent-based computational methods, a hybrid interactive simulation methodology is proposed to solve human behaviors related problems. Human-subjected experiment based on European Union Emissions Trading System price data in 2006 is conducted, the results show that there is no fixed emission trading interval for generation companies, and the strategic behaviors of market participants are observed. Major driving factors of emission trading are categorized into emission price, emission quantity and time related factors, which are in accordance with empirical analysis results on EU ETS 2005-2006 transaction dataset. Furthermore, more human-subjected experiments are conducted under different emission price scenarios to obtain samples for quantitative analysis. Based on thousands of samples obtained, the joint influences of driving factors on emission trading behaviors are analyzed. The quantitative analysis results obtained can reflect the trading patterns of human participants, which provide basis for constructing computer agents that can act as useful substitutes for human participants.

AB The dynamics of wealth distribution plays a critical role in the economic market, hence an understanding of its nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is of great importance to human society. For this aim, a simple and efficient one-dimensional (1D) lattice gas automaton (LGA) is presented for wealth distribution of agents with or without saving propensity. The LGA comprises two stages, i.e., random propagation and economic transaction. During the former phase, an agent either remains motionless or travels to one of its neighboring empty sites with a certain probability. In the subsequent procedure, an economic transaction takes place between a pair of neighboring agents randomly. It requires at least 4 neighbors to present correct simulation results. The LGA reduces to the simplest model with only random economic transaction if all agents are neighbors and no empty sites exist. The 1D-LGA has a higher computational efficiency than the 2D-LGA and the famous Chakraborti-Chakrabarti economic model. Finally, the LGA is validated with two benchmarks, i.e., the wealth distributions of individual agents and dual-earner families. With the increasing saving fraction, both the Gini coefficient and Kolkata index (for individual agents or two-earner families) reduce, while the deviation degree (defined to measure the difference between the probability distributions with and without saving propensities) increases. It is demonstrated that the wealth distribution is changed significantly by the saving propensity which alleviates wealth inequality. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE

DE correlated binary data; randomization schemes; Pitman efficiency
AB In this article, we consider the efficiency of three experimental designs for comparing two treatments with correlated binary outcomes. This work is motivated in large part by the use of toxicological bioassays with laboratory animals used to identify agents capable of causing adverse health effects in humans, but has much broader research design implications. From the toxicological perspective, the completely randomized (CR), litter-matched (LM) and nested (NE) designs correspond to the random assignment of individual animals, littermates, or entire litters to either a control or test group. The randomization schemes underlying these three designs provide a framework for the construction of exact randomization tests for comparing the two treatment groups, and for the development of the asymptotic properties of these tests. The computed Pitman asymptotic relative efficiencies demonstrate that the LM design is the most powerful in the presence of positive intra-litter correlation, followed by the CR and NE designs, respectively. The relevance of these asymptotic results for the finite sample case is confirmed by computer simulation, The more detailed results presented in this paper will be of value in informing the design of experiments with two treatment groups involving correlated binary outcomes.

AB Recently, using in situ self-assembly-induced fluorescence quenching (i.e., intermolecular quenching denoted herein) of a photothermal agent (PTA) to enhance its photothermal efficiency has proven to be a successful photothermal therapy (PTT) strategy. But to the best of current knowledge, using simultaneous intra- and intermolecular fluorescence quenching of a PTA to additionally increase its photothermal efficacy has not been reported. Herein, employing a click condensation reaction and a rationally designed PTA Biotin-Cystamine-Cys-Lys(Cypate)-CBT (1), a "smart" strategy is developed of intracellular simultaneous intra- and intermolecular fluorescence quenching and applied it to largely increase the photothermal efficacy of the agent both in vitro and in vivo. After being internalized by biotin receptor-overexpressing cancer cells, 1 is reduced by intracellular glutathione to initiate a CBT-Cys condensation reaction (intramolecular quenching) and self-assembly (intermolecular quenching) to form the nanoparticles 1-NPs (simultaneous intra- and intermolecular fluorescence quenching). Experimental results indicate that 1-NPs have higher fluorescence quenching efficiency than the control PTAs [Thiazole-Lys(Cypate)-Benzothiazole](2) (1-Dimer, intramolecular quenching), and nanoparticles of Cystamine-Cys(Fmoc)-Lys(Cypate)-CBT (1-Fmoc-NPs, intermolecular quenching). It is envisioned that, by replacing the biotin group on 1 with other targeting warheads, the "smart" strategy is ready to increase the photothermal therapeutic efficiency of their corresponding diseases.

AB This paper examines the reification and problemization of 'race' in Psychological research in both influential studies in the field and in my empirical work. The main argument is that we need to examine how representations of 'race' are assumed, produced and contested in research practice. This argument is made by (a) showing how research in the area adopts everyday representations of 'race' as essentialized and (b) with an illustration of the construction of 'race' within my study. This study explores how children in a predominantly white setting accept and contest representations that race. twenty two children from a range of cultural backgrounds volunteered to discuss their views and experiences of 'race' and racism in a naturalistic research activity. The analysis reveals that racialized difference is something that is constructed as both 'real' - in that it can be seen, touched and even caught from 'the other' and simultaneously something that is constructed, imposed and damaging. This highlights the possibilities for racialized others to take up positions as agents and not (only) as objects of the racializing and racist gaze, and so presents the case for thinking, debating and researching beyond reifying representations of 'race'. This has important lessons for social psychology: namely, we cannot continue to take racial categorization as a naturalistic or self-evident aspect of the social worlds that our discipline plays an important role in constructing and defending.

AB In this paper, a biomechanical crowd-structure interaction model is proposed and calibrated in order to take into account the change of the modal properties of footbridges in lateral direction induced by the pedestrian walking action. The model involves two submodels, namely, (a) the pedestrian-structure interaction and (b) the crowd submodels. In the first submodel, a single degree of freedom system, which simulates the behaviour of each pedestrian, is projected on the vibration modes of the structure. Herein, the parameters of the first submodel are estimated experimentally from the results of several pedestrian tests conducted on a real footbridge. For the second submodel, the crowd behaviour is modelled via a multiagent method. The performance of the overall model has been assessed successfully via the correlation between the change of the first experimental lateral natural frequency of another footbridge during a pedestrian test and the numerical predictions provided by the proposed model. Therefore, this model becomes a valuable tool to analyse numerically the change of the modal parameters of footbridges due to the pedestrian-structure interaction.

AB Solid propellant is the key energetic composite material for weapons. Nitrate ester plasticized polyether (NEPE) propellant has shown the best energetic property among all propellants practically used at present, and neutral polymeric bonding agent (NPBA) is usually applied to improve its mechanical properties. However, the complex composition of propellant and explosive properties of nitrate plasticizers make the in-depth study of the cooling phase separation behavior and bonding performance of NPBA very challenging. In the present study, the phase separation behaviors of NPBA in different solution systems were studied by the turbidity method, and its adhesion degree onto solid filler caused by the phase separation was evaluated. The results show that high contents of AN in NPBA, high contents of inert solvents and high concentrations of NPBA are conducive to the phase separation. Based on the experimental results, a molecular dynamics simulation model for the cooling phase separation of NPBA in inert solvents is established, and applied to the phase separation of NPBA in the explosive nitrate plasticizer solution systems. The influences of the ratio of nitrate plasticizers, the ratio between plasticizer and binder, the concentration and molecular weight of NPBA, and the terpolymer composition of NPBA on the cooling phase separation were determined by the molecular dynamics simulation and verified with the experimental application of NPBA in the actual NEPE propellant system. Our work has provided a new strategy for the structural design and bonding performance evaluation of NPBA as the bonding agent for NEPE propellants, and constructed a novel structure-activity model to further guide its application study.

AB We developed an agent-based model to simulate a signaling cascade which allowed us to focus on the behavior of each class of agents independently of the other classes except when they were in physical contact. A critical piece was the ratio of the populations of agents that interact with one another, not their absolute values. This ratio reflects the effects of the density of each agent in the biological cascade as well as their size and velocity. Although the system can be used for any signaling cascade in any cell type, to validate the system we modeled Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in two very different types of cells; tumor cells and white blood cells. The iterative process of using experimental data to improve a computational model, and using predictions from the model to design additional experiments strengthened our understanding of how TLR signaling differs between normal white blood cells and tumor cells. The model and experimental data showed that some of the differences between the tumor cells and normal white blood cells were related to NF kappa B and TAB3 levels, and also suggested that tumor cells lacked IRAKM-dependent feedback inhibition as a negative regulator of TLR signaling. Finally, we found that these different cell types had distinctly different responses when exposed to two signals indicating that a more biologically relevant model and experimental system should address activation of multiple interconnected signaling cascades, the complexity of which further reinforces the need for a combined computational and molecular approach.

AB Solar photovoltaic (PV) is becoming one of the most significant renewable sources for positive energy district (PED) in Sweden. The lack of innovative business models and financing mechanisms are the main constraints for PV's deployment installed in local communities. This paper therefore proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) business model for 48 individual building prosumers with PV installed in a Swedish community. It considers energy use behaviour, electricity/financial flows, ownerships and trading rules in a local electricity market. Different local electricity markets are designed and studied using agent-based modelling technique, with different energy demands, cost-benefit schemes and financial hypotheses for an optimal evaluation. This paper provides an early insight into a vast research space, i.e., the operation of an energy system through the constrained interaction of its constituting agents. The agents (48 households) show varying abilities in exploiting the common PV resource, as they achieve very heterogeneous self-sufficiency levels (from ca. 15% to 30%). The lack of demand side management suggests that social and lifestyle differences generate huge impacts on the ability to be self-sufficient with a shared, limited PV resource. Despite the differences in self-sufficiency, the sheer energy amount obtained from the shared PV correlates mainly with annual cumulative demand.

AB Investigations of the open system behavior of reversible dead-end inhibitors were carried out by means of computer simulations and experimental studies. The results from both approaches indicate that substrate-competitive inhibition may often be an inappropriate basis for design of potential therapeutic agents. The use of uncompetitive (also called anticompetitive) inhibitors in this role is likely to be far more effective. Chemical analogs of pathogen-specific enzymic reaction products rather than analogs of substrates provide a promising basis for the systematic design of such uncompetitive inhibitors.

AB The effect of interface property on the mechanical behavior of silica-polybutadiene composites is systematically investigated via combined experimental and dynamics simulation. In experiment, the interface property is controlled by SiO2 particle size, silane coupling agents, and silane grafting density. The effects of these control parameters on the vulcanization kinetics, tensile strength, and dynamic mechanic properties are investigated and discussed. Both the experimental and simulation studies reveal the pivot role of filler-polymer interface on the mechanical reinforcement. Simulation study reveals that the constrained polymer layer (approximate to 12 nm) surrounding the silica particles shows increased stress from 30 to 230 MPa, which is identified as the major reason for the overall enhancement of 100% modulus from 0.8 to 1.6 MPa. The molecular mechanics of interface from simulation is well correlated to the experimental results in this study, which provides a molecular level understanding of the relationship between interfacial interaction and mechanical reinforcement.

AB Bidders often feel challenged when looking for the best bidding strategies to excel in the competitive environment of multiple and simultaneous online auctions for same or similar items. Bidders face complicated issues for deciding which auction to participate in, whether to bid early or late, and how much to bid. In this paper, we present the design of bidding strategies, which aim to forecast the bid amounts for buyers at a particular moment in time based on their bidding behavior and their valuation of an auctioned item. The agent develops a comprehensive methodology for final price estimation, which designs bidding strategies to address buyers' different bidding behaviors using two approaches: Mamdani method with regression analysis and negotiation decision functions. The experimental results show that the agents who follow fuzzy reasoning with a regression approach outperform other existing agents in most settings in terms of their success rate and expected utility.

AB Although there are many antiviral drugs available for the treatment of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, still the synthesis of new anti-HSV candidates is an important strategy to be pursued, due to the emergency of resistant HSV strains mainly in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infected patients. Some 1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinolines, such as PNU-183792 ((1) under bar), show a broad spectrum antiviral activity against human herpes viruses, inhibiting the viral DNA polymerase (POL) without affecting the human POLs. Thus, on an ongoing antiviral research project, our group has synthesized ribonucleosides containing the 1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinoline (quinolone) heterocyclic moiety, such as the 6-Cl derivative ((2) under bar), which is a dual antiviral agent (HSV-1 and HIV-1). Molecular dynamics simulations of the complexes of (1) under bar and (2) under bar with the HSV-1 POL suggest that structural modifications of (2) under bar should increase its experimental anti-HSV-1 activity, since its ribosyl and carboxyl groups are highly hydrophilic to interact with a hydrophobic pocket of this enzyme. Therefore, in this work, comparative molecular docking simulations of (1) under bar and three new synthesized oxoquinoline-acylhydrazone HIV-1 inhibitors ((3) under bar-(5) under bar), which do not contain those hydrophilic groups, were carried out, in order to access these modifications in the proposition of new potential anti-HSV-1 agents, but maintaining the anti-HIV-1 activity. Among the docked compounds, the oxoquinoline-acylhydrazone (3) under bar is the best candidate for an anti-HSV-1 agent, and, in addition, it showed anti-HIV-1 activity (EC50 = 3.4 +/- 0.3 mu M). Compounds (2) under bar and (3) under bar were used as templates in the design of four new oxoquinoline-acylhydrazones ((6) under bar-(9) under bar) as potential anti-HSV-1 agents to increase the antiviral activity of (2) under bar. Among the docked compounds, oxoquinoline-acylhydrazone (7) under bar was selected as the best candidate for further development of dual anti-HIV/HSV activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB The boundary of a distributed denial of service attack, one of the most threatening attacks in a wired network, now extends to wireless mobile networks, following the appearance of a DDoS attack tool targeted at mobile phones. Many protocols and architectures for mobile networks were designed without regard to the possibility of a DDoS attack. Moreover, the existing defense mechanisms against such attacks in a wired network are not effective in a wireless mobile network, because of differences in their characteristics. In this paper, we propose a fast defense mechanism against IP spoofing traffic for mobile networks. IP spoofing is one of the features of a DDoS attack against which it is most difficult to defend. Among the various mobile networks, we focus on the Network Mobility standard that is being established by the NEMO Working Group in the IETF. Our defense consists of the following five processes: speedy detection, filtering of attack packets, identification of attack agents, isolation of attack agents, and notification of neighboring routers. We simulated and analyzed the effects on normal traffic of moving attack agents, and the results of applying our defense to a mobile network. Our experimental results show that our mechanism provides a robust defense.

AB The idea that large-scale generating units will operate at marginal cost when given the ability to offer their power for sale in a uniform price auction is at best wishful thinking. In fact, both real and experimental data show that the more uncertainty a supplier faces (e.g., load uncertainty, uncertainty of other suppliers, etc.), the more they will hedge their profits through higher than marginal cost offers and through withholding units if permitted. This makes predicting unit commitment and dispatch ahead of time difficult. This paper explores characteristics of software agents that were designed based on the outcome of human subject experiments on a uniform price auction with stochastic load. The agent behavior is compared to the behavior of the subjects. Both subject and agent behavior is classified based on the data. Differences and similarities are noted and explained. Based on the result of the simulation, a model was suggested to explain an offer submitted in deregulated markets based on double layer diffusion. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Combinatorial optimization; Heuristic; Social influence
ID OPINION DYNAMICS
AB In this work we introduce an evolutionary strategy to solve combinatorial optimization tasks, i.e. problems characterized by a discrete search space. In particular, we focus on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), i.e. a famous problem whose search space grows exponentially, increasing the number of cities, up to becoming NP-hard. The solutions of the TSP can be codified by arrays of cities, and can be evaluated by fitness, computed according to a cost function (e.g. the length of a path). Our method is based on the evolution of an agent population by means of an imitative mechanism, we define 'partial imitation'. In particular, agents receive a random solution and then, interacting among themselves, may imitate the solutions of agents with a higher fitness. Since the imitation mechanism is only partial, agents copy only one entry (randomly chosen) of another array (i.e. solution). In doing so, the population converges towards a shared solution, behaving like a spin system undergoing a cooling process, i.e. driven towards an ordered phase. We highlight that the adopted 'partial imitation' mechanism allows the population to generate solutions over time, before reaching the final equilibrium. Results of numerical simulations show that our method is able to find, in a finite time, both optimal and suboptimal solutions, depending on the size of the considered search space.

AB People interpret behavior by making inferences about agents' intentionality, mind, and personality. Past research studied such inferences I at a time; in real life, people make these inferences simultaneously. The present studies therefore examined whether 4 major inferences (intentionality, desire, belief, and personality), elicited simultaneously in response to an observed behavior, might be ordered in a hierarchy of likelihood and speed. To achieve generalizability, the studies included a wide range of stimulus behaviors, presented them verbally and as dynamic videos, and assessed inferences both in a retrieval paradigm (measuring the likelihood and speed of accessing inferences immediately after they were made) and in an online processing paradigm (measuring the speed of forming inferences during behavior observation). Five studies provide evidence for a hierarchy of social inferences from intentionality and desire to belief to personality that is stable across verbal and visual presentations and that parallels the order found in developmental and primate research.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of atomoxetine (ATX) and osmotic release oral system-methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) therapies on executive functions, activities, treatment response time, and adverse effects based on discernible clinical effects in children with combined type attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: The study sample consisted of 43 children 7-12 years of age, who presented to the outpatient clinic with inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity for the first time, and were diagnosed as having combined type ADHD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM-IV) criteria but had not previously used any medication for ADHD. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Stroop Test TBAG Form (STP), and Visual Auditory Digit Span B (VADS B) were applied to all the patients included. Neuropsychological tests were repeated in 33 patients with good clinical recovery based on the Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement (CGI-I) scale (CGI-I 2) at the week in which clinical recovery was observed. The time limit for treatment response was set as 20 weeks. Results: It was found that there was significantly increased performance in executive functions with ATX and OROS-MPH in both groups. It was seen that although significantly increased performance was achieved in both perseveration and conceptual learning and reasoning domains by both agents, there was increased performance in more domains by the OROS-MPH group in WSCT. Mean doses were 1.310.37mg/kg/day in the ATX group and 0.90 +/- 0.29mg/kg/day in the OROS-MPH group. Comparable effectiveness (76.19% for ATX vs. 77.27% for OROS-MPH) and adverse effects (57.14% for ATX vs. 54.54% for OROS-MPH) were detected in both groups, whereas there was a significant difference in clinical response times between the groups (13 weeks for ATX vs. 7 weeks for OROS-MPH, p <0.001). Conclusions: At the end of the study, it was seen that clinical recovery achieved by ATX and OROS-MPH therapy was associated with improved cognitive processes, and that these agents do not only lead to behavioral changes but also to an improvement in cognitive processes. In addition, improvements in cognitive processes occurred simultaneously with behavioral recovery. Behavior is the result of neurocognitive processes, and further studies on the domains that these drugs affect, or the way in which these agents exert their effects, are needed.

AB In this paper, distributed discrete-time coupled harmonic oscillators are studied. Convergence conditions for synchronisation of the discrete-time coupled harmonic oscillators are given. The distributed discrete-time coupled harmonic oscillators are then used to design a control strategy for symmetric formations. The purpose of the control strategy is for groups of mobile robots to move in a synchronised manner with local interaction. Both simulation and experimental results on networked mobile robots are presented. Based on the results of both simulation and experimentation, this strategy is an effective method for synchronising the motions of multiple mobile robots.

AB Learning plays a vital role in the development of autonomous agents.  In this paper, we explore the use of reinforcement learning to ''shape'' a robot to perform a predefined target behavior.  We connect both simulated and real robots to Alecsys, a parallel implementation of a learning classifier system with an extended genetic algorithm.  After classifying different kinds of Animat-like behaviors, we explore the effects on learning of different types of agent's architecture and training strategies.  We show that the best results are achieved when both the agent's architecture and the training strategy match the structure of the behavior pattern to be learned.  We report the results of a number of experiments carried out both in simulated and in real environments, and show that the results of simulations carry smoothly to physical robots.  While most of our experiments deal with simple reactive behavior, in one of them we demonstrate the use of a simple and general memory mechanism.  As a whole, our experimental activity demonstrates that classifier systems with genetic algorithms can be practically employed to develop autonomous agents.

AB Micron- to nanometer-sized ultrasound agents, like encapsulated microbubbles and echogenic liposomes, are being developed for diagnostic imaging and ultrasound mediated drug/gene delivery. This review provides an overview of the current state of the art of the mathematical models of the acoustic behavior of ultrasound contrast microbubbles. We also present a review of the in vitro experimental characterization of the acoustic properties of microbubble based contrast agents undertaken in our laboratory. The hierarchical two-pronged approach of modeling contrast agents we developed is demonstrated for a lipid coated (Sonazoid and a polymer shelled (poly D-L-lactic acid) contrast microbubbles. The acoustic and drug release properties of the newly developed echogenic liposomes are discussed for their use as simultaneous imaging and drug/gene delivery agents. Although echogenicity is conclusively demonstrated in experiments, its physical mechanisms remain uncertain. Addressing questions raised here will accelerate further development and eventual clinical approval of these novel technologies.

AB The goal of this work was to assess the shear bond strength (SBS) and fracture mode of a self-adhering flowable composite when used after thermocycling for lingual retainer bonding.
   A total of 80 human mandibular incisor teeth were categorized into four equal groups: group 1: Vertise (TM) Flow (VF) without acid etching; group 2: VF with acid etching; group 3: VF with a self-etching bonding agent accompanied by an additional acid etching; group 4: Transbond LR control. Either VF or Transbond LR was applied to the lingual surface of the teeth by packing the material into cylindrical plastic matrices to simulate the lingual retainer bonding area. After all teeth were thermocycled (5000 cycles, 5 and 55 A degrees C), fracture modes were examined under x20 magnification. The SBS data were assessed via analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's tests. Fracture modes were analyzed by the chi(2) test at a significance level of 0.05.
   Statistically significant differences in SBS values between groups (p < 0.001) were observed. Group 4 exhibited the highest (14.63 +/- 1.36 MPa) and group 1 the lowest SBS (2.67 +/- 1.35 MPa) values. Statistically significant differences were noted in fracture modes between groups 1, 3, and 4 (p < 0.001). In all the self-adhering flowable composite groups, the adhesive type (tooth-composite interface) fracture occurred more frequently than cohesive and mixed-type fractures.
   When applied to bond lingual retainers to unetched enamel or with self-etching bonding agent accompanied by an additional acid etching, Vertise (TM) Flow resulted in a significant decrease in bond strength.

AB The tremendous impact that cardiovascular diseases have in modern society is motivating the research of novel imaging techniques that would make possible early diagnosis and, therefore, efficient treatments. Cardiovascular optical coherence tomography (CV-OCT) emerged as a result of such a demand, and it has already been used at the clinical level. Full utilization of CV-OCT requires the development of novel contrast molecular agents characterized by a large scattering efficiency in the infrared (800-1400 nm). Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) seem to be the best candidates, but their scattering properties in the infrared are hardly known. In most of the cases, scattering properties are extracted from numerical simulations. This knowledge gap here is covered by providing an experimental evaluation of the infrared scattering properties of different GNPs (nanoshells, nanostars, and nanorods). These GNPs display remarkable extinction coefficients in the first and second biological windows, including the particular CV-OCT wavelength. We use a unique combination of techniques (thermal loading experiments, infrared optical coherence tomography, infrared dark field microscopy, and optoacoustic spectroscopy) to experimentally determine the scattering efficiency at three different near-infrared wavelengths (808 nm, 980 nm, and 1280 nm), lying in the first and second biological windows. Consequently, this work determines experimentally the influence of particle morphology on the infrared scattering efficiency of GNPs and evidences the existence of remarkable discrepancies between experimental data and numerical simulations.

AB Agent based models (ABMs) simulate actions and interactions of autonomous agents/groups and their effect on systems as a whole, accounting for learning without assuming perfect rationality or complete knowledge. ABMs are an increasingly popular approach to studying complex, spatially distributed socio-environmental systems, but have still to become an established approach in the sense of being one that is expected by those wanting to explore scenarios in such systems. Partly, this is an issue of awareness - ABM is still new enough that many people have not heard of it; partly, it is an issue of confidence - ABM has more to do to prove itself if it is to become a preferred method. This paper will identify advances in the craft and deployment of ABM needed if ABM is to become an accepted part of mainstream science for policy or stakeholders. The conduct of ABM has, over the last decade, seen a transition from using abstracted representations of systems (supporting theory-led thought experiments) to more accessible representations derived empirically (to deliver more applied analysis). This has enhanced the perception of potential users of ABM outputs that the latter are salient and credible. Empirical ABM is not, however, a panacea, as it demands more computing and data resources, limiting applications to domains where data exist along with suitable environmental models where these are required. Further, empirical ABM is still facing serious questions of validation and the ontology used to describe the system in the first place. Using Geoffrey A. Moore's Crossing the Chasm as a lens, we argue that the way ahead for ABM lies in identifying the niches in which it can best demonstrate its advantages, working with collaborators to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. This leads us to identify several areas where work is needed.

AB This paper demonstrates the use of an agent-based model (ABM) to investigate factors that can speed the diffusion of eco-innovations, namely alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs). The ABM provides the opportunity to consider the interdependencies inherent between key participants in the automotive industry: manufacturers, consumers, and governmental agencies. Agent-based models allow for tackling these interdependencies in a very elegant way. Because ABMs allow convenient modeling of the interactions between multiple agents, each with unique optimization goals, it provides a method for understanding consumer and manufacturer response to diverse environmental changes. Grounding the agent-based model on empirical data further improves the validity of the model results. We use choice-based conjoint data of more than 7,000 respondents to elicit heterogeneous consumer preferences. Further, information about manufacturers' cost structure is available from an established vehicle design tool, AVCEM. In three experiments, mechanisms are considered for speeding the adoption of AFVs: technology push, market pull, and regulatory push. Simulation results support the idea that technology push can be an important mechanism for speeding the diffusion of AFVs. Market pull, that is, word of mouth, also has a positive impact on the diffusion of AFVs and increases the social good by decreasing the preference for fuel-inefficient vehicles. Furthermore, word of mouth leads to a higher willingness to pay for AFVs, which indicates that the perceived value of AFVs increases with word of mouth. In contrast, a governmental push that focuses on the manufacturers (fuel economy mandates) leads to a decrease in the social good (air pollution improvement) because market share for fuel-inefficient vehicles increases. This article provides insights into how to set up an ABM to evaluate factors that influence the diffusion of alternative fuel vehicles. These insights can be applied to other types of eco-innovations.

AB This paper proposes a method for reducing the time to complete the boarding of a two-door airplane when its passengers are transported from the airport terminal to the airplane using two apron buses. In contrast to other methods that assign passengers to apron buses, our method considers groups of passengers traveling together (e.g. families). In particular, we propose a mixed integer programming (MIP) model that assigns each group of passengers (including each single-passenger group) to one of the two apron buses based on their seating assignments. We assume that all seats on the apron buses and the two-door airplane are occupied. We conduct stochastic simulation experiments with the proposed MIP-based method and with a baseline method that assigns groups of passengers with seats furthest from one of the airplane doors to the first apron bus and assigns remaining groups to the second apron bus. Numerical results indicate that the proposed MIP-based method reduces the boarding time by up to 27.31% when compared with the baseline approach.

AB Objectives: This in vitro study investigated the effect of selected luting media on the fracture resistance of a flame-sprayed all-ceramic crown.
   Methods: Three groups of 10 human upper premolar teeth were prepared for crowning using a standardised technique. Flame sprayed crowns were fabricated and cemented onto the preparations using zinc phosphate (ZPC), glass polyalkenoate (GPC) or composite luting cement (CLC). During crown seating, a pressure perfusion system simulated pulpal fluid outflow equivalent to 300 mm. of H2O. Compressive fracture resistance was determined for each group using a Universal Testing Machine with a crosshead speed of 1 mna min A group of unrestored teeth acted as a control.
   Results: The fracture resistance of the groups ranked as follows: ZPC > CLC much greater than GPC = unrestored teeth. The difference between the fracture resistance of ZPC and CLC groups and the control group was statistically significant. The mode of fracture between the luted crowns and natural crowns was markedly different.
   Conclusions: When tested in compression, a new, flame-sprayed all-ceramic crown, when luted in place using ZPC, GPC or CLC, could produce strengths comparable to or greater than natural unrestored teeth. The luting agent used significantly affected the recorded fracture loads. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A 2 x 2 game model implemented by co-evolution of both networks and strategies is established. An existing link between two agents is killed through network adaptation, which then establishes a new link to replace it. Strategy is defined as an offer of "cooperation" (C) or "defection" (D) by an agent. Both networks and strategies are synchronously renovated in each simulation time step. After killing the link with the most disadvantageous neighbor, we consider network adaptations that involve rewiring to (1) a randomly selected agent, (2) a proportionally selected agent (through a roulette selection process based on the degrees of respective agents), (3) an agent randomly selected among a set of neighbors of the neighbors, excluding the most disadvantageous neighbor. Several numerical experiments considering various 2 x 2 game classes, including Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), Chicken, Leader, and Hero, reveal that the proposed co-evolution mechanism can solve dilemmas in the PD game class. The result of solving a dilemma is the development of mutual-cooperation reciprocity (R reciprocity), which arises through the emergence of several cooperative hub agents, which have many links in a heterogeneous and assortative social network. However, the co-evolution mechanism seems counterproductive in the case of the Leader and Hero game classes, where alternating reciprocity (ST reciprocity) is more demanding. It is also suggested that the assortative and cluster coefficients of a network affect the emergence of cooperation for R reciprocity. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the relative position coordinated control problem for a group of formation flying spacecraft under a directed communication network and resource constraints. An event-based coordinated control scheme without resorting to neighbors' velocity information is proposed to achieve the formation-keeping maneuvers. Considering expensive communication cost in spacecraft formation, a novel event-triggered mechanism is developed, where the information transmission among spacecraft is established only when the defined triggering threshold is exceeded; moreover, each spacecraft only needs to compute its own control command at triggering time instants, thus ameliorating the issue of computation limitation inherent in the space-qualified microprocessor. Apart from the above, an explicit positive lower bound on the inter-event time internals is rigorously guaranteed such that no Zeno behavior exhibits. By resorting to the input-to-state practical stability and Lyapunov theory, a sufficient criterion on parameters selection is derived to ensure that the overall closed-loop system is uniformly ultimately bounded stable. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

AB This paper is devoted to apply agent based models to real opinion interactions in a bulletin board system (BBS) community. By analyzing a real BBS community, we reveal some empirical features of opinion interactions on the Web. Then, we propose a simple opinion model that bears both general characteristics of traditional opinion models, and some real interacting rules on the Web. The model simulates a group of agents representing Web users participating to a discussion. Simulation results show some dynamical regimes consistent with empirical facts, and offer some possible explanations for the emergence of some real features. Our work implies the possibility of building simple agent based models to simulate computer-mediated interactions on the Web.

AB This paper deals with the viability of using starch (ST) and styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) as an additive in stone matrix asphalt (SMA) mixtures. A 5% of ST and SBS by weight of bitumen were blended with (70/100)-paving grade asphalt. Unmodified and modified bitumen were Subjected to physiochemical tests. The performance tests including, Marshall stability, tensile strength, tensile strength ratio and resilient modulus were carried out on unmodified and modified SMA mixtures. A mechanistic-empirical design approach was used for estimating the improvement in service life of the pavement or reduction in thickness of SMA and base layer for the same service life due to modification the SMA mixtures. The analyses of test results show that the moisture damage and temperature susceptibility can be reduced by the inclusion of ST and SBS in the asphalt mixture. The results also revealed that ST-modifier can be used as anti-stripping agent, and reduced plant emissions and energy consumption by 30%, as well as it shows resistant to fuels, most common chemicals and solvents. The results of multi-layer elastic analysis presented herein indicate that the pavement consisting of ST and SBS-modified SMA as a surface layer is beneficial in reducing the construction materials. In addition, the safe pavement design criteria of unmodified and modified SMA mixtures based on the anisotropic elasticity analysis through finite-element simulation were obtained and reported herein.

DE Agent modeling; experimental approach; pedestrians; physiological data
ID PERSONALITY; SIMULATION; STRESS; VALENCE; AROUSAL
AB The modeling of a new generation of agent-based simulation systems supporting pedestrian and crowd management taking into account affective states represents a new research frontier. Pedestrian behaviour involves human perception processes, based on subjective and psychological aspects. Following the concept of pedestrian environmental awareness, each walker adapts his/her crossing behaviour according to environmental conditions and his/her perception of safety. Different pedestrian behaviours can be related to subjective mobility and readiness to respond, and these factors are strongly dependent on the subjective interaction with the environment. Having additional inputs about pedestrian behaviour related to their perception processes could be useful in order to develop a more representative pedestrian dynamic model. In particular, the subjective perception of the safeness of crossing should be taken into consideration. In order to focus on the pedestrians' perception of safe road crossing and walking, an experiment in an uncontrolled urban scenario has been carried out. Besides more conventional self-assessment questionnaires, physiological responses have been considered to evaluate the affective state of pedestrians during the interaction with the urban environment. Results from the analysis of the collected data show that physiological responses are reliable indicators of safety perception while road crossing and interacting with real urban environment, suggesting the design of agent-based models for pedestrian dynamics simulations taking in account the representation of affective states.

   similarity preference; Agent-based modeling; Racial parity
AB Objective
   In the environmental justice literature, uncertainty exists about the underlying causes of environmental risk disparities, especially as they relate to residential choices. To simplify, the two dominant views are racism/discrimination versus inevitable market dynamics. In this article, we move aside from these to examine the potential role of various residential choice constraints on environmental injustice and how they may be interrelated.
   Methods
   Using an agent-based simulation model, we examine the interaction of race-based constraints with other experimental conditions that can affect minorities' residential choice sets.
   Results
   Simulation experiments demonstrate that if the minority holds relatively lower similarity preferences, the environmental quality gap declines when other conditions are held constant. However, racial parity in communities also decreases the environmental quality gap, as do slower population growth and larger geographies.
   Conclusion
   These results enable us to look at the problem of race-based environmental injustice more holistically, and begin to think about holistic solutions that may finally address what has heretofore been an intractable social problem.

AB The quantity of data and processes used in modeling projects has been dramatically increasing in recent years due to the progress in computation capability and to the popularity of new approaches such as open data. Modelers face an increasing difficulty in analyzing and modeling complex systems that consist of many heterogeneous entities. Adapting existing models is relevant to avoid dealing with the complexity of writing and studying a new model from scratch. ODD (Overview, Design concepts, Details) protocol has emerged as a solution to document Agent-Based Models (ABMs). It appears to be a convenient solution to address significant problems such as comprehension, replication, and dissemination. However, it lacks a standard that formalizes the use of data in empirical models. This paper tackles this issue by proposing a set of rules that outline the use of empirical data inside an ABM. We call this new protocol ODD+2D (ODD+Decision + Data). ODD+2D integrates a mapping diagramcalled DAMap (Data to Agent Mapping). This mapping model formalizes howdata are processed and mapped to agent-based models. In this paper, we focus on the architecture of ODD+2D, and we illustrate it with a residential mobility model in Marrakesh.

AB Spatial simulation models of seed dispersal have been constructed at the landscape level under the assumption of ubiquitous or uniform dispersibility. The anisotropic nature of vegetation distribution caused by different dispersal agents such as wind, gravity, water and animals were ignored. We propose a prototype of a GIS-based spatially explicit model of dispersal agent behavior (SEMODAR) to simulate the seed dispersal process by considering the unique behavioral characteristics of each seed dispersal agent. As a result, the influence of dispersal agent behavior on the species coexistence in competitive communities with and without habitat destruction could be explored. The model consists of four module components: dispersal rules, species competition, species colonization, and habitat destruction. An experimental simulation was conducted using three hypothetical species with differing competitive and migration abilities in both intact and disturbed conditions for 250 years. The findings of this study support the theoretical expectation that inferior competitors can coexist with superior competitors given that the inferior competitors have efficient colonization ability. The simulation also reveals the important role of agent behavior in the seed dispersal process and the biased impact of environment fragmentation on superior competitors that are not superior dispersers.

AB Objectives. This study aimed at evaluating the therapeutic bioactive effects on the bond strength of three experimental bonding agents containing modified Portland cement-based micro-fillers applied to acid-etched dentin and submitted to aging in simulated body fluid solution (SBS). Confocal laser (CLSM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also performed.
   Methods. A type-I ordinary Portland cement was tailored using different compounds such as sodium-calcium-aluminum-magnesium silicate hydroxide (HOPC), aluminum-magnesium-carbonate hydroxide hydrates (HCPMM) and titanium oxide (HPCTO) to create three bioactive micro-fillers. A resin blend mainly constituted by Bis-GMA, PMDM and HEMA was used as control (RES-Ctr) or mixed with each micro-filler to create three experimental bonding agents: (i) Res-HOPC, (ii) Res-HCPMM and (iii) Res-HPCTO. The bonding agents were applied onto 37% H3PO4-etched dentin and light-cured for 30s. After build-ups, they were prepared for micro-tensile bond strength (mu TBS) and tested after 24 h or 6 months of SBS storage. SEM analysis was performed after de-bonding, while CLSM was used to evaluate the ultra-morphology/nanoleakage and the mineral deposition at the resin-dentin interface.
   Results. High mu TBS values were achieved in all groups after 24 h. Only Res-HOPC and Res-HCPMM showed stable mu TBS after SBS storage (6 months). All the resin-dentin interfaces created using the bonding agents containing the bioactive micro-fillers tested in this study showed an evident reduction of nanoleakage and mineral deposition after SBS storage.
   Conclusion. Resin bonding systems containing specifically tailored Portland cement micro-fillers may promote a therapeutic mineral deposition within the hybrid layer and increase the durability of the resin-dentin bond.

AB The decomposition behaviours of composites made of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) and sisal were assessed in terms of thermal stability and decomposition kinetics, under inert and oxidative conditions, by means of multi-rate linear non-isothermal thermogravimetric experiments. A statistical design of experiments was applied to study the influence of the addition of sisal (0-10-20-30%wt), the presence coupling agent (Yes/No) and the applied conditions of work (inert or oxidative). An improvement of the thermal and thermo-oxidative stability of PHBV with the addition of sisal was observed for all cases. An accurate methodology based on isoconversional methods was applied to simulate the potential of thermal recovery technologies, such as pyrolysis and controlled combustion, to use these biocomposites after the end of their service life. The mathematical descriptions of both thermo-chemical reactions were helpful in the evaluation of the eventual optimal operational conditions to carry out a suitable energetic valorisation. A minimum of 240 degrees C and 137 kJ/mol of activation energy in inert conditions and 236 degrees C and 118 kJ/mol in oxidative conditions ensured the feasibility of the reactions regardless the composition of the PHBV/sisal biocomposites, which may ease the operability of further energy valorisation with the aim to turn biowaste into new fuels.

AB The following study was performed to delineate the possible differences in the onset, recovery and ''train of four'' (TOF) fade characteristics of pancuronium (Pan) and pipecuronium (Pip). Eighty adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I and II surgical patients were studied with institutional approval. After premedication, general anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium i.v. followed by N-2/O-2 halothane and fentanyl. The lungs were ventilated. Normocarbia and normothermia were maintained. Two groups of 40 patients received pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) or pipecuronium (0.07 mg/g i.v.). Neuromuscular block (NMB) was measured simultaneously by mechanomyography (MMG) and electromyographically (EMG) on the thumb adductor muscle. Supramaximal (TOF) stimuli were applied to the ulnar nerve every 20 seconds. The onset of neuromuscular blocking action, duration of action (to 25% recovery of twitch response), TOF fade during onset and up to 25% T-1 response recovery, hemodynamic changes following induction of anesthesia and after the muscle relaxant and subsequent oral intubation were determined. Mean values and the differences in the two treatments groups were statistically analyzed. The onset of action of the two agents were similar: 3.62+/-0.02 minutes (MMG) and 4.94+/-0.05 minutes (EMG, Pan) and 3.74+/-0.02 minutes (MMG) and 4.36+/-0.012 minutes (EMG, Pip). TOF fade ratios during the onset phase were similar. TOF fade at the 25% twitch responses recovery level was 100% with the MMG responses and (96% (Pan) and 94.8% (Pip) with the EMG responses at the 25% twitch response recovery level. Hemodynamic changes were similar after the single dose adminstration of the bolus administration of the two NMB agents. The only difference between the two treatment groups was in the degree of tachycardia in response to endotracheal intubation which was marginally more significant with Pan than with Pip (p=0.1>0.05). The clinical NMB onset of action and TOF fade characteristics of equipotent doses of Pan and Pip are identical. The duration of action of Pip was about 10% (p=<0.01) shorter than that of Pan, (The probable cause of this difference may be due to a differing influence of halothane anesthesia on the duration of NMB of otherwise equipotent NMB doses of these agents). Essentially no difference was observed in the hemodynamic data between the two treatment groups during the periods of induction of anesthesia.

AB The escape panic version of the Social Force Model (SFM) is a suitable model for describing emergency evacuations. In this research, we analyze a real-life video, recorded at the opening of a store during a Black Friday event, which resembles an emergency evacuation (November 2017, South Africa). We measure the flow of pedestrians entering the store and found a higher value (< J > = 6.7 +/- 0.8 p/s) than the usually reported in "laboratory" conditions. We performed numerical simulations to recreate this event. The empirical measurements were compared against simulated evacuation curves corresponding to different sets of parameters currently in use in the literature. The results obtained suggest that the set of parameters corresponding to calibrations from laboratory experiments (involving pedestrians in which the safety of the participants is of major concern) or situations where the physical contact is negligible, produce simulations in which the agents evacuate faster than in the empirical scenario. To conclude the paper, we optimize two parameters of the model: the friction coefficient k(t) and the body force coefficient k(n). The best fit we found could replicate the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the empirical evacuation curve. We also found that many different combinations in the parameter space can produce similar results in terms of the goodness of fit. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ACID PHENETHYL ESTER; HEPATIC-INJURY
AB Aim: To investigate a toxic effect of Isoniazide on the myocardial tissue and protective role of the caffeic acid phenyl ester (CAPE).
   Material and methods: Animals: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four experimental groups, with ten animals in each group; Control, INH-treated group, CAPE treated group and INH plus CAPE-treated group.
   Biochemical analyses: Superoxide dismutase activity was measured according to the method described by Fridovich. Lipid peroxidation level in the myocardium was expressed as malondy-aldehyde (MDA). It was measured according to procedure of Ohkawa et al. The total antioxidant capacity of supernatant fractions was evaluated by using a novel automated and colorimetric measurement method developed by Erel (13).
   Histopathological analyses: Myocardial tissue specimens were fixed in 10% formaldehyde, dehydrated in alcohol solution and were embedded in paraffin for 24 hours and used for histopathological examination. Four micrometer (mu m) thick sections were cut, deparaffinized, hydrated and stained with hematoxyline and eosin (H&E) under a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse 80i, JAPAN).
   Results: In the INH group, malondialdehyde and total oxidant status levels were significantly higher than those of the control group in the myocardial tissues (p<0.05). In the INH group myocardial TAC levels, activities of SOD and PON-1 decreased compared with control group (p<0.05). CAPE plus INH treatment caused a significant decrease in MDA and TOS generation in the myocardium (p<0.05). Also, CAPE plus INH caused a significant an increase in TAC levels, SOD and PON-1 activities (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: We have shown that experimental administration of INH is accompanied by in-creased lipid peroxidation and oxidants in myocardial tissues of rats. Therefore, we suggest that oxidative stress is a cause of INH induced cardiotoxicity. Simultaneously, CAPE is a protective agent in this toxicity by overcoming the inactivation of antioxidant enzyme systems by INH. Thereby CAPE may play a role in preventing INH induced cardiotoxicity.

AB We explore a model of an antigenically diverse infection whose otherwise identical strains compete through cross-immunity. We assume that individuals may produce upon infection different numbers of antibody types, each of which matches the antigenic configuration of a particular epitope, and that one matching antibody type grants total immunity against a challenging strain. In order to reduce the number of equations involved in the analytic description of the dynamics, we follow the strategy proposed by Kryazhimskiy et al. (2007) and apply a low-order closure reminiscent of a pair approximation. Using this approximation, we go beyond the numerical studies of Kryazhimskiy et al. (2007) and explore the analytic properties of the ensuing model in the absence of mutation. We characterize its endemic equilibrium, comparing with the results of agent based simulations of the full model to assess the performance of the closure assumption. We show that a particular choice of immune response leads to a degenerate endemic equilibrium, where different strain prevalences may exist, breaking the symmetry of the model. Finally we study the behavior of the system under the injection of mutant strains. We find that the build up of diversity from a single founding strain is extremely unlikely for different choices of the population's immune response. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rural settlement patterns in North-Western Europe in 800 CE were scattered and impermanent. By 1200 they had become much more concentrated and enduring. Although this phenomenon occurred in all regions, settlement concentration and hierarchy differed widely. In this paper, we seek to better understand how the processes influencing the concentration and hierarchy of rural settlement patterns might act in different ways. To do this, we build an agent-based model entitled SimFeodal that simulates their combined effects on the relocation of peasant households from 800 to 1200. Our research objective is to determine how certain social and demographic variables interacted with the processes modelled to produce different regional settlement patterns. We simulate a series of 15 scenarios with SimFeodal on the basis of data available for the diocese of Tours (France). The results show that demographic growth was not the primary cause of increasing settlement hierarchy. However, introducing demographic growth into the simulated scenarios yields simulation results that better match the empirical data. Interestingly, the size of villages and small towns in 800, the proportion of peasant households relocating only locally and the power of village communities do not seem to influence concentration and hierarchy in the simulated patterns.

AB In seawater sea-sand concrete (SSSC), to avoid steel corrosion, the use of fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars as reinforcement has been proposed. However, FRP bars do not have strong ribs for bonding, and thus, may have weaker bonds compared to steel reinforcing bars. To overcome this problem, the addition of fibres and expansive agent to concrete to induce gripping stresses on FRP bars may be a feasible solution. In this research, the effects of glass fibres and expansive agent on the bond behaviour of glass/basalt FRP bars cast in SSSC were studied by conducting pull-out tests with varying fibre content, fibre length, and expansive agent content. The results revealed that although the addition of glass fibres and/or the expansive agent significantly increases the bond stiffness, it only marginally increases the bond strength of the FRP bars. Overall, the addition of both fibres and the expansive agent offers certain synergistic effects; however, improving the bond strength is still difficult owing to the premature failure of the FRP bars. Finally, constitutive models to simulate the bond behaviour of FRP bars in SSSC were proposed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among the polymers, one of the most important groups are epoxy resins, whose popularity stems from a combination of excellent mechanical and chemical properties. At the same time, the characteristics of epoxy resins are strongly dependent on the type and quantity of curing agent. The article presents the results of research on epoxy mortar modified with PET glycolisate, hardened by using three different amine curing agents. Characteristics such as flexural and compressive strength and water absorption were determined. The results were subjected to statistical analysis and compared, indicating the curing agent that allows the obtainment of a composite that is characterized by the highest values of the tested parameters.

AB Antibiotic resistance exerts a metabolic cost on bacteria and presumably a fitness disadvantage in the absence of antibiotics. However, several studies have shown that bacteria can evolve to eliminate this cost. Escherichia coli can adapt to the plasmid pBR322 carrying the tetA tetracycline-resistance gene (codes for the TetA efflux pump) by a chromosome mutation, which requires an intact tetA gene on the plasmid. The TetA pump can mediate potassium uptake. Here, the hypothesis that TetA replaces the endogenous K+ uptake system Trk is explored using a multi-level modeling approach that explicitly resolves relevant intracellular processes (e.g., metabolism and K+ uptake) and simulates individual bacteria in competition. The general behavior of the model is consistent with observations from the literature (e.g., growth rate and K+ limitation). In competition experiments without tetracycline, the model correctly predicts the fitness advantage of naive susceptible over naive resistant, evolved resistant over naive resistant and evolved resistant over evolved susceptible strains. Trk takes up about 10 times the K+ required, which costs energy. TetA takes up less K+, which is more efficient and leads to the evolution of the Trk mutant. The evolved Trk mutant relies on TetA to take up K+, and thus, carrying the plasmid is advantageous even in the absence of the antibiotic.

AB We study multiagent logit-rule-driven evolutionary games on a square lattice whose pair interactions are composed of a maximal number of nonoverlapping elementary coordination games describing Ising-type interactions between just two of the available strategies. Using Monte Carlo simulations we investigate the macroscopic noise-level-dependent behavior of the two- and three-pair games and the critical properties of the continuous phase transtitions these systems exhibit. The four-strategy game is shown to be equivalent to a system that consists of two independent and identical Ising models.

AB Curing and thermal transition behavior of two epoxy resins i.e. 2,2'-dimethyl-4,4'-diaminobiphenyl (MTB)-4,5-epoxycyclohexyl-1,2-diglycidyl diformate (TDE85) and 2,2'-bis(trifluoromethyl)-4,4'-diamino biphenyl (TFMB)-4,5-epoxycyclohexyl-1,2-diglycidyl diformate (TDE85) with different chemical structures were experimentally and theoretically investigated via molecular simulations to establish the structure-property relationships. The slight modification in the diamine structure resulted in significant changes in the curing and glass transition behavior of epoxy resin. As the side group of the diamine was changed from methyl to trifluoromethyl, the reactivity of the diamine toward epoxy decreased and the glass transition temperature increased from about 164 degrees C to about 191 degrees C. These phenomena can be illustrated by the change of the reaction energy barrier, flexibility of chains and the cohesive energy density in the molecular simulation of the curing process. The simulated values show good agreement with experimental data, and can be used to predict the related material characteristics for the different amine curing agent-epoxy systems.

AB A current evolutionary hypothesis predicts that the most extreme forms of animal weaponry arise in systems where combatants fight each other one-to-one, in duels. It has also been suggested that arms races in human interstate conflicts are more likely to escalate in cases where there are only two opponents. However, directly testing whether duels matter for weapon investment is difficult in animals and impossible in interstate conflicts. Here, we test whether superior combatants experience a disproportionate advantage in duels, as compared with multi-combatant skirmishes, in a system analogous to both animal and military contests: the battles fought by artificial intelligence agents in a computer war game. We found that combatants with experimentally improved fighting power had a large advantage in duels, but that this advantage deteriorated as the complexity of the battlefield was increased by the addition of further combatants. This pattern remained under the two different forms of the advantage granted to our focal artificial intelligence (AI) combatants, and became reversed when we switched the roles to feature a weak focal AI among strong opponents. Our results suggest that one-on-one combat may trigger arms races in diverse systems. These results corroborate the outcomes of studies of both animal and interstate contests, and suggest that elements of animal contest theory may be widely applicable to arms races generally.

AB Swarm robotic search aims at searching targets using a large number of collaborating simple mobile robots, with applications to search and rescue and hazard localization. In this regard, decentralized swarm systems are touted for their coverage scalability, time efficiency, and fault tolerance. To guide the behavior of such swarm systems, two broad classes of approaches are available, namely, nature-inspired swarm heuristics and multi-robotic search methods. However, the ability to simultaneously achieve efficient scalability and provide fundamental insights into the exhibited behavior (as opposed to exhibiting a black-box behavior) remains an open problem. To address this problem, this paper extends the underlying search approach in batch-Bayesian optimization to perform search with embodied swarm agents operating in a (simulated) physical 2D arena. Key contributions lie in (1) designing an acquisition function that not only balances exploration and exploitation across the swarm but also allows modeling knowledge extraction over trajectories and (2) developing its distributed implementation to allow asynchronous task inference and path planning by the swarm robots. The resulting collective informative path planning approach is tested on target-search case studies of varying complexity, where the target produces a spatially varying (measurable) signal. Notably, superior performance, in terms of mission completion efficiency, is observed compared to exhaustive search and random walk baselines as well as a swarm optimization-based state-of-the-art method. Favorable scalability characteristics are also demonstrated.

Difficulties in designing empirical studies of criminal network recovery, however, have problematized research into network responses to disruption. In this study, we evaluate criminal network resilience by examining network recovery from disruption in an array of different criminal networks and across different disruption strategies. We use an agent-based model to evaluate how criminal networks recover from disruption. Our results reveal the vulnerabilities and time to recovery of numerous criminal organizations, and through them, we identify which disruption strategies are most effective at damaging various criminal networks.

AB To interact successfully, individuals must not only recognize one another as intentional agents driven primarily by internal mental states, but also possess a system for making reliable and useful inferences about the nature of those beliefs, feelings, goals, and dispositions. The ability to make such mental state inferences (i.e., to mentalize or mindread) is the central accomplishment of human social cognition. The present article suggests that our understanding of how humans go about making mental state inferences will benefit from treating social cognition primarily as an information processing system that comprises a set of mechanisms for elaborating more basic social information into an understanding of another's mind. Following Marr's [Marr, D., 1982. Vision. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA] framework for the study of such information processing systems, I suggest that questions about social cognition might profitably be asked at three levels computation, algorithm, and implementation - and outline a number of ways in which a description of social cognition at the middle level (i.e., the step-by-step processes that give rise to mental state inferences) can be informed by analysis at the other two.

ID KINETIC-MODEL; BEHAVIOR; DYNAMICS; MARKETS; ECONOMY
AB This paper deals with a class of integro-differential equations modeling the dynamics of a market where agents estimate the value of a given traded good. Two basic mechanisms are assumed to concur in value estimation: interactions between agents and sources of public information and herding phenomena. A general well-posedness result is established for the initial value problem linked to the model and the asymptotic behavior in time of the related solution is characterized for some general parameter settings, which mimic different economic scenarios. Analytical results are illustrated by means of numerical simulations and lead us to conclude that, in spite of its oversimplified nature, this model is able to reproduce some emerging behaviors proper of the system under consideration. In particular, consistently with experimental evidence, the obtained results suggest that if agents are highly confident in the product, imitative and scarcely rational behaviors may lead to an over-exponential rise of the value estimated by the market, paving the way to the formation of economic bubbles.

Pareto's power-law distribution (1897) of wealth is demonstrated with power factor in agreement with that of US or Japan. Moreover, the agent's personal wealth is proportional to its number of contacts (connectivity), and this leads to the phenomenon that the rich gets richer and the poor gets relatively poorer, which agrees with the Matthew Effect.

DE Spatial games; migration; pattern formation; agent-based simulation;
   cooperation
ID EVOLUTIONARY GAMES; PUNISHMENT; TRAGEDY
AB A unified approach is proposed, which integrates game-theoretical models with models of directed motion. Specifically, strategic interactions in space and imitation of more successful neighboring strategies, as studied by spatial games, are combined with success-driven migration based on "test interactions" or wealth-related "neighborhood tagging." It turns out that such directed migration allows cooperators to evade defectors and (in constrast to purely diffusive motion) also to find other cooperators in order to form clusters ("islands of cooperation"). This can increase the cooperation to a great extent. Moreover, success-driven motion leads to interesting spatiotemporal pattern-formation phenomena, which are clearly different from those produced by previously studied spatial games. Despite the simplicity of the model, the forming patterns appear to realistically represent many stylized facts of social interactions, particularly phenomena such as social networking, urban aggregation, social segregation or turn-taking. Furthermore, migration games offer a game-theoretical explanation of social attraction and repulsion, based on payoff-related mobility, and they display a larger variety than conventional games, as their behavior is not invariant to shifting all payoffs by a constant amount. In summary, the combination of strategic interactions and imitation with models of directed motion has high potential for understanding empirical observations in the social, biological and economic sciences from a game-theoretical point of view. Finally, the breakdown of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma at high values of temptation is explained by configurational analysis.

AB This study summarizes molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experiments using four ester-based cement shrinkage reducing agents in pure water and simulated cement pore solution. The esters were found to completely dissociate in the alkaline pore solution to form acid and alcohol analogue compounds. The alcohol analogues were further found to be entirely responsible for the surface tension reduction capacity of the parent compounds. In addition, the surface tension reduction capacity of the alcohol analogues are not affected by relevant counterions present in the pore solution. The MD-based analysis show that water molecules form stable hydrogen bonds with head groups of the alcohol analogues and that relevant dissolved ions, K+ and Na+, have virtually no effect on hydrogen bond stability. Furthermore, the higher the self-diffusion coefficient of water molecules in the neighborhood of the head groups the lower the resulting surface tension at the air-water interface.

AB Early randomized Phase II cancer chemoprevention trials which assess short-term biological activity are critical to the decision process to advance to late Phase II/Phase III trials. We have adapted published Bayesian interim analysis methods (Spiegelhalter et al., J. R. Statist. Soc A, 1994; 157: 357-416) which give greater flexibility and simplicity of inference to the monitoring of randomized controlled Phase II trials using intermediate endpoints. The Bayesian stopping rule is designed to stop the trial more quickly when the evidence suggests ineffectiveness rather than when it suggests biological activity, thus allowing resources to be concentrated on those agents that show the most promise in this early stage of testing. We investigate frequentist performance characteristics of the proposed method through simulation of randomized placebo controlled trials with a growth factor intermediate end-point using mean and variance values derived from the literature. Simulation results show expected error rates and trial size similar to other commonly used group sequential methods for this setting. These results suggest that the Bayesian approach to interim analysis is well suited for monitoring small randomized controlled Phase II chemoprevention trials fur early detection of either inactive or promising agents.

AB Intertemporal labour-leisure choice models typically assume agents have a very low degree of impatience. Yet there is a lot of empirical evidence indicating a high degree of impatience. Using a life-cycle model of consumption-saving and labour-leisure choice, we show that even if an agent displays a relatively moderate degree of impatience, his labour supply choice delivers highly counterfactual patterns. We resolve this counterfactual finding by augmenting the standard model with a time-dependent marginal utility of leisure assumption that is consistent with some recent evidences from leisure studies. We also introduce various extensions and discuss their relative importance and associated challenges.

AB In this paper, marginal cost-pricing rules are applied to an agent-based model. User-specific optimal bus fares are estimated by simulating user interactions at a microscopic level. We consider external effects of prolonged in-vehicle and waiting times (including the effect of full buses on boarding denials) induced by passengers boarding vehicles. We give a new-look to the relationship between optimal fare and travel distance, which is found to depend crucially on the type of external cost that is considered when calculating fares. Conditions for optimal bus fares that increase or decrease as a function of trip length are numerically found.

AB A semi-empirical model of the bubble growth and dissolution in glasses with a fining agent has been derived This model applies the experimental data from bubble observation at melting and fining temperatures. The experimental data needed for the model involved the temperature dependences of the average growth rate of the bubble radius and the average concentration of the fining gas in the bubbles. Both sets of values were measured in the laboratory in the glass of the float type and applied in the model. The measurements of the solubilities and diffusion coefficients of the gases present in the glass needed for the analytical model of multicomponent bubbles were thus avoided The course of the partial bubble absorption with the temperature decreasing was simulated by means of two factors modifying the experimental values of the bubble growth rates at constant temperature. The temperature dependence of the resulting bubble growth rate qualitatively corresponded to the experimental observations in the soda-lime-silica glass, but a more detailed experimental and comparative study has yet to be performed. Such a study is being prepared

AB We develop profitable stock market forecasts for a number of financial instruments and portfolios using a special adaptive form of the Strongly Typed Genetic Programming (STGP)-based trading algorithm. The STGP-based trading algorithm produces one-day-ahead return forecasts for groups of artificial traders with different levels of intelligence and different group sizes. The performance of the algorithm is compared with a number of benchmark forecasts and these comparisons clearly demonstrate the short-term superiority of the STGP-based method in many circumstances. Subsequently we provide detailed analysis of the impact of trader cognitive abilities and trader numbers on the accuracy of forecasting rules which allows us to conduct new experimental tests of the Marginal Trader and the Hayek Hypotheses. We find little support for the Marginal Trader Hypothesis but some evidence for the Hayek Hypothesis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A series of title compounds has been synthesized and evaluated by the cytotoxicity assays conducted in vitro in seven human tumor cell lines, initially in MT-4 and H-9, followed by U-937, PM-I, MCF-7, Hep-3B, and K-562. These compounds were simultaneously compared with the existing clinical drug, busulfan and also with an experimental drug, hepsulfam. IC50 values of these agents in T-cell lymphoma and leukemic cell lines indicate that two of these agents hexsulfamyl and octsulfamyl (compounds 3 and 4) were significantly more potent than busulfan and were comparable in antileukemic activity with hepsulfam. In order to determine the effect of these agents on normal proliferating cells, the toxicity of 3 and 4 was also determined in vitro against human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and against murine bone marrow progenitor cells. PBMC assay data indicate that these agents were generally less toxic than hepsulfam. The results of the colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) assays, however, indicate that these agents were more toxic than hepsulfam to erythroid progenitor cells than to granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. The toxicity of octsulfamyl was further assessed in vivo in normal Swiss mice by measuring drug-induced changes in hematological parameters, femoral bone marrow cellularity and splenic cellularity as well as hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity on day 7 and 14 following drug treatment at the dose of 1.0 mg/kg body weight from days 1 to 5. The results indicate that the compound did not adversely affect hematopoiesis. Marginal bone marrow suppression was observed on day 7, which gradually tends to reach normalcy on day 14. The other parameters were within normal limit. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: This study evaluated the fracture strength and mode of failure of structurally compromised teeth with flared root canals restored using composite resin with four different systems.
   Methods: Sixty endodontically treated bovine teeth were uniformly shaped to simulate human mandibular premolars with flared root canals. The roots were divided into four groups of 15 specimens each based on the type of restoration: composite resin core only (control), glass fiber post, cylindroid glass fiber ribbons, and glass fiber post and ribbons. All specimens were loaded until fracture occurred using a universal testing machine. Average fracture loads were compared with a one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD test (alpha =.05). The modes of failure were observed and the Fisher exact test and Bonferroni correction were used for statistical analysis.
   Results: The fiber post and ribbon group (1035.70 N) and the fiber ribbon group (881.77 N) showed significantly higher fracture strength than the controls (567.97 N) (p <.05). The fiber post and ribbon group also showed significantly higher fracture strength than the fiber post group (769.40 N). Almost all specimens showed unrestorable root fractures (p <.008). The control group had a significantly higher ratio of core sectional fractures (p <.017).
   Conclusions: Cylindroid glass fiber ribbons significantly increased the fracture strength of the composite resin post and cores in the case of the dentin within the thin root canal wall. Based on the results, this study recommends the combined use of glass fiber post and ribbons. (c) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Japan Prosthodontic Society.

AB Background/aims: Dose-finding trials can be conducted such that patients are first stratified into multiple risk groups before doses are allocated. The risk groups are often completely ordered in that, for a fixed dose, the probability of toxicity is monotonically increasing across groups. In some trials, the groups are only partially ordered. For example, one of several groups in a trial may be known to have the least risk of toxicity for a given dose, but the ordering of the risk among the remaining groups may not be known. The aim of the article is to introduce a method for designing dose-finding trials of cytotoxic agents in completely or partially ordered groups of patients.
   Methods: This article presents a method for dose-finding that combines previously proposed mathematical models, augmented with results using order restricted inference. The resulting method is computationally convenient and allows for dose-finding in trials with completely or partially ordered groups. Extensive simulations are done to evaluate the performance of the method, using randomly generated dose-toxicity curves where, within each group, the risk of toxicity is an increasing function of dose.
   Results: Our simulations show that the hybrid method, in which order-restricted estimation is applied to parameters of a parsimonious mathematical model, gives results that are similar to previously proposed methods for completely ordered groups. Our method generalizes to a wide range of partial orders among the groups.
   Conclusion: The problem of dose-finding in partially ordered groups has not been extensively studied in the statistical literature. The proposed method is computationally feasible, and provides a potential solution to the design of dose-finding studies in completely or partially ordered groups.

AB Humans possess an unusual combination of traits, including our cognition, life history, demographics and geographical distribution. Many theories propose that these traits have coevolved. Such hypotheses have been explored both theoretically and empirically, with experiments examining whether human behaviour meets theoretical expectations. However, theory must make assumptions about the human mind, creating a potentially problematic gap between models and reality. Here, we employ a series of 'experimental evolutionary simulations' to reduce this gap and to explore the coevolution of learning, memory and childhood. The approach combines aspects of theory and experiment by inserting human participants as agents within an evolutionary simulation. Across experiments, we find that human behaviour supports the coevolution of learning, memory and childhood, but that this is dampened by rapid environmental change. We conclude by discussing both the implications of these findings for theories of human evolution and the utility of experimental evolutionary simulations more generally.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Life history and learning: how childhood, caregiving and old age shape cognition and culture in humans and other animals'.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) provide a number of advantages relative to traditional continuum modeling approaches, permitting incorporation of great detail and realism into simulations, allowing in silico tracking of single-cell behaviors and correlation of these with emergent effects at the macroscopic level. In this study we, present BSim 2.0, a radically new version of BSim, a computational ABM framework for modeling dynamics of bacteria in typical experimental environments including microfluidic chemostats. This is facilitated through the implementation of new methods including cells capsular geometry that are able to physically and chemically interact with one another, a realistic model of cellular growth, a delay differential-equation solver, and realistic environmental geometries.

   IMPLEMENTATION
AB This study demonstrates that modeling a wastewater system as a system of systems (SoS) rather than a monolithic system constitutes a useful methodological approach to dealing with the complexity derived from multiple influential factors in urban wastewater management. In particular, different models were adapted and integrated, including urban dynamics, water consumption, technological and opinion diffusion, financial, and pipe prioritization models, in an agent-based system dynamic model. The result is a computational environment that enables simulating and comparing various funding and rehabilitation scenarios for the wastewater system under population and water demand uncertainty. The model was parameterized for the wastewater network of the city of Sahib in Jordan. The model indicates the influence of considering the interactions between different subsystems (i.e., physical, social, and financial) on the behavior of the wastewater system as a whole. Conclusions drawn in this manner would have been difficult to obtain using other approaches, such as conventional forecasting methods, given the need to integrate different socioeconomic, technique, and geographic aspects in a single model. The proposed model was verified and validated using scenario analysis and subject-matter experts. Additionally, the model results were statistically compared to those of other state-of-the-art studies for external validation. The results illustrate that the described methodology can complement conventional approaches and provides descriptive and formal additional insights into wastewater system management.

AB Objective: Dentine hypersensitivity is a type of clinical oral disease, which is highly prevalent worldwide. Although there are many materials to treat dentine hypersensitivity, their long-term therapeutic effects are not satisfactory. Therefore, the aim of this research was to observe and identify the biological mineralization of the generation 4.0 polyamidoamine dendrimer on the demineralized dentinal tubules at different time points.
   Design: 2 mm-thick slices were obtained from the cemento-enamel junction of 36 third molar teeth that simulated the condition of sensitivity with acid etching. Slices were treated with generation 4.0 polyamidoamine dendrimer and peptide bond condensing agent, while no treatment was applied on the slices of the control group. Following immersion in artificial saliva for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks respectively, the mineralization condition of dentine slices was observed using the scanning electron microscope (SEM). In addition, the differences in the samples of dental slices between the 2 groups were also detected using the microhardness test.
   Results: SEM results showed that the average diameter and density of the dentinal tubules in the experimental group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.001). The microhardness test exhibited a similar result, which suggested that the microhardness of the experimental group was significantly higher than the control group (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Generation 4.0 polyamidoamine dendrimer promotes the biomineralization of demineralized dentinal tubules. Moreover, this result also suggests that the 4.0th generation polyamidoamine dendrimer has the potential value for dentine hypersensitivity treatment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Physical, technological, and social networks are often at risk of intentional attack. Despite the wide-spanning importance of network vulnerability, very little is known about how criminal networks respond to attacks or whether intentional attacks affect criminal activity in the long-run. To assess criminal network responsiveness, we designed an empirically-grounded agent-based simulation using population-level network data on 16,847 illicit drug exchanges between 7,295 users of an active darknet drug market and statistical methods for simulation analysis. We consider three attack strategies: targeted attacks that delete structurally integral vertices, weak link attacks that delete large numbers of weakly connected vertices, and signal attacks that saturate the network with noisy signals. Results reveal that, while targeted attacks are effective when conducted at a large-scale, weak link and signal attacks deter more potential drug transactions and buyers when only a small portion of the network is attacked. We also find that intentional attacks affect network behavior. When networks are attacked, actors grow more cautious about forging ties, connecting less frequently and only to trustworthy alters. Operating in tandem, these two processes undermine long-term network robustness and increase network vulnerability to future attacks.

AB In "Skating on Thin Ice", Frohlich and Oppenheimer (2006) describe a phenomenon they observed in public goods experiments that is rarely discussed in the literature: individual contributions to the public good are often inconsistent over time, appearing to fluctuate between two distinct contribution levels. Although they conjecture that individuals have complex context-dependent preferences, they did not develop a full specification of the theory. Using an agent-based simulation model, we explore the likelihood of these psychological conjectures, and thereby provide a possible specification of a theory of complex context-dependent preferences. We consider two main theories: first, that inconsistent contributions arise from a deterministic avoidance of exploitation and second, that inconsistent contributions arise from a probabilistic response to exploitation. We show the former theory clearly fails and the latter theory, under specifiable conditions, does produce the observed pattern of contributions. Two simple alternative theories are also considered, that of a highly-stylized "probabilistic guilt" and of goal-oriented but non-utility maximizing behavior (with stable preferences). Both alternatives, under certain conditions, are also able to generate the observed pattern. We develop an analysis of situations in which the predictions of these theories diverge and suggest that one could discriminate between them in laboratory settings. Finally, we consider a possibly fruitful relationship between simulation and experimentation to consider the implications of one's models and conjectures: this research can be seen as one step in an iterative process of theory development, vetting and testing, generating an empirically grounded theory of individual behavior in VCM games.

DE Norms; Norm-aware agents; Normative MAS; MDPs
AB In this paper, we show how the impact of norms on the sequential decision making of agents can be formally modeled, computationally determined and quantitatively assessed. For this purpose, we put forward the Normative Markov Decision Process (NMDP) framework - an extension of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). NMDPs provide an explicit declarative representation of obligation and prohibition as penalties associated to states and conditions on the accessibility of states. Furthermore, NMDPs make an explicit representation of the probability that whoever is responsible for enforcing the norms detects a violation, thus modeling enforcement effectiveness and cost. Then, we approach the problem of reasoning with the NMDP framework by proposing two types of agent: norm-compliant and self-interested. Using these agents, this paper shows how this framework may be employed to study the impact of norms on agent behavior by providing a quantitative measure of the cost of norm abidance and, by the same token, to what extent norms affect reasoning complexity. In particular, we illustrate the use of the NMDP framework through experimental analysis in a simulated environment where the chances of norm violation being detected and penalties are varied.

AB Controlled natural language (CNL) has great potential to support human-machine interaction (HMI) because it provides an information representation that is both human readable and machine processable. We investigated the effectiveness of a CNL-based conversational interface forHMIin a behavioral experiment called simple human experiment regarding locally observed collective knowledge (SHERLOCK). In SHERLOCK, individuals acted in groups to discover and report information to the machine using natural language (NL), which the machine then processed into CNL. The machine fused responses from different users to form a common operating picture, a dashboard showing the level of agreement for distinct information. To obtain information to add to this dashboard, users explored the real world in a simulated crowd-sourced sensing scenario. This scenario represented a simplified controlled analog for tactical intelligence (i.e., direct intelligence of the environment), which is key for rapidly planning military, law enforcement, and emergency operations. Overall, despite close to zero training, 74% of the users inputted NL that was machine interpretable and addressed the assigned tasks. An experimental manipulation aimed to increase user-machine interaction, however, did not improve performance as hypothesized. Nevertheless, results indicate that the conversational interface may be effective in assisting humans with collection and fusion of information in a crowdsourcing context.

AB Most work studying micro-processes of integration - i.e., how agents develop identities and decision-making behaviours within a particular institution - offers explanations based on either instrumental rationality or socialization. This article proposes a two-dimensional framework that allows analysing under which conditions both logics of social action co-exist. Our empirical analysis employs a unique dataset from a 2011 survey of all 1,098 currently active Seconded National Experts (SNEs) in the European Commission. We find that (1) instrumental cost-benefit calculation and cognitive role-playing (as semi-reflexive socialization) often simultaneously influence SNEs' (perceptions of their) behaviour, and (2) this joint presence of both logics of social action depends on certain scope conditions (i.e., SNEs' education, length of prior embeddedness and noviceness).

AB It has been known that altruistic punishments solve the free rider problem in public goods games. Considering spatial structure and considering pure strategies significant advances have been made in understanding the evolution of altruistic punishments. However, these models have not considered key behavior regularities observed in experimental and field settings, where the individuals behave like conditional cooperators who are more willing to donate and are also more willing to punish free riders. Considering these behavioral regularities, without imposing a spatial structure on the population, I propose an evolutionary agent-based model in which agents behave like conditional cooperators, each agent's donation conditional on the difference between the number of donations in the past and the threshold value and the propensity value of the agent. Altruistic punishment depends on the difference between the threshold value of the focal agent and the randomly matched another agent. The simulations show that, for certain inflicted costs of punishments, generous altruistic punishments evolve and stabilize cooperation. The results show that, unlike previous models, it is not necessary to punish all free riders equally; it is necessary to do so in the case of the selfish free riders but not in the case of negative reciprocators.

AB In this work, based on behavioural and dynamical evidence, a study of simulated agents with the capacity to change feedback from their bodies to accomplish a one-legged walking task is proposed to understand the emergence of coupled dynamics for robust behaviour. Agents evolve with evolutionary-defined biases that modify incoming body signals (sensory offsets). Analyses on whether these agents show further dependence to their environmental coupled dynamics than others with no feedback control is described in this article. The ability to sustain behaviours is tested during lifetime experiments with mutational and sensory perturbations after evolution. Using dynamical systems analysis, this work identifies conditions for the emergence of dynamical mechanisms that remain functional despite sensory perturbations. Results indicate that evolved agents with evolvable sensory offset depends not only on where in neural space the state of the neural system operates, but also on the transients to which the inner-system was being driven by sensory signals from its interactions with the environment, controller, and agent body. Experimental evidence here leads discussions on a dynamical systems perspective on behavioural robustness that goes beyond attractors of controller phase space. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Amino-silane coupling agents are used to improve adhesion to polyamide-based composites. This paper aims to study the influence of polyamide 6 moisture content on the interfacial strength between the polyamide and amino-silane-coated aluminum. A coupled experimental and simulative approach is applied that enables the interfacial strength to be taken separately from the moisture-dependent mechanical behavior of polyamide 6. Lap joints of polyamide 6 and aluminum, functionalized by 3-(2-aminoethylamino)propyl trimethoxy silane, are tested at three different polyamide moisture conditions. Afterwards, numerical simulations of the lap shear experiments are carried out to identify the parameters for a mechanical model of the interface. Subsequently, the dependence of polymer's properties on the moisture content is investigated by different sets of parameters of an applied inelastic material model. Finally, an analysis of the interfacial parameters proves and characterizes the dependence of the joint strength on polyamide moisture content. It is found that the lower the moisture content of the polyamide, the higher the interfacial strength.

AB The topic of this study is two-fold and two models are presented. For the first part, I propose a non-linear learning algorithm that takes into account both proximity of opinions and network effects. Agents reach consensus of a final opinion that can be estimated given initial conditions under star and small-world networks. However, when the network structure is scale-free, simulation results show rather chaotic patterns. In the second half of this paper, a two-stage endogenous network formation mechanism is introduced. Opinion closeness is critical in establishing links. Existing neighbors also play an important role in connecting to new neighbors, which, combined with a growing population, contributes to a power-law degree distribution with coefficients that fit empirical findings extremely well. The correlation between opinion and degree is illustrated and formalized as well.

AB Agent-based models for dynamic traffic assignment simulate the behaviour of individual, or group of, agents, and then the simulation outcomes are observed on the scale of the system. As large-scale simulations require substantial computational power and have long run times, most often a sample of the full population and downscaled road capacities are used as simulation inputs, and then the simulation outcomes are scaled up. Using a massively parallelized mobility model on a large-scale test case of the whole of Switzerland, which includes 3.5 million private vehicles and 1.7 million users of public transit, we have systematically quantified, from 6 105 simulations of a weekday, the impacts of scaled input data on simulation outputs. We show, from simulations with population samples ranging from 1% to 100% of the full population and corresponding scaling of the traffic network, that the simulated traffic dynamics are driven primarily by the flow capacity, rather than the spatial properties, of the traffic network. Using a new measure of traffic similarity, that is based on the chi-squared test statistic, it is shown that the dynamics of the vehicular traffic and the occupancy of the public transit are adversely impacted when population samples less than 30% of the full population are used. Moreover, we present evidence that the adverse impact of population sampling is determined mostly by the patterns of the agents' behaviour rather than by the traffic model.

AB Efferson et al. use models to examine the reversal of traditions such as female genital cutting. They find that interventions should avoid targeting agents amenable to change and should disrupt any link between cultural identity and traditional practice.
   For a policy-maker promoting the end of a harmful tradition, conformist social influence is a compelling mechanism. If an intervention convinces enough people to abandon the tradition, this can spill over and induce others to follow. A key objective is thus to activate such spillovers and amplify an intervention's effects. With female genital cutting as a motivating example, we develop empirically informed analytical and simulation models to examine this idea. Even if conformity pervades decision-making, spillovers can range from irrelevant to indispensable. Our analysis highlights three considerations. First, ordinary forms of individual heterogeneity can severely limit spillovers, and understanding the heterogeneity in a population is essential. Second, although interventions often target samples of the population biased towards ending the harmful tradition, targeting a representative sample is a more robust way to achieve spillovers. Finally, if the harmful tradition contributes to group identity, the success of spillovers can depend critically on disrupting the link between identity and tradition.

AB We study the impact of settlement sizes on network connectivity in a spatial setting. First, we develop a model of geometric urban networks that posits a positive relationship between connectivity and size. Empirical evidence is then presented validating the model prediction that local links exhibit super-linear scaling with the exponent greater than 1, while long-range connections scale linearly with the unit exponent The scaling exponents thus suggest that the impact of population size on connectivity is stronger within cities than between cities. We next combine the geometric framework with a computational model of interacting agents to generate a realistic settlement distribution and urban networks from the bottom-up. Calibrated simulation results demonstrate the consistency between hierarchical rank-size distribution and scale-free connectivity. Finally, coupling the spatial network with a tipping diffusion model allows us to consolidate the evolution of network connectivity, city sizes, and social practices in a unified computational framework.

TI The evolution of political intelligence: Simulation results
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Several bodies of theory develop the idea that the intelligence of highly social animals - most interestingly, humans - is significantly organized around the adaptive problems posed by their sociality. By this 'political intelligence' hypothesis, sociality selects for, among other attributes, capacities for 'manipulating' information others can gather about one's own future behaviour, and for 'mindreading' such manipulations by others. Yet we have little theory about how diverse parameters of the games that social animals play select for political intelligence. We begin to address that with an evolutionary simulation in which agents choose between playing Prisoner's Dilemma and Hawk-Dove games on the basis of the information they can retrieve about each other given four broad information processing capacities. We show that political intelligence operationally, the aggregate of those four capacities - evolves to its highest levels when co-operative games are generally more attractive than conflictual ones, but when conflictual games are at least sometimes also attractive.

AB Microcapsules encapsulated within epoxy as a curing agent have been successfully applied in self-healing materials, in which the healing performance significantly depends on the binding behaviour of the epoxy curing agent with the cement matrix. In this paper, the binding energy was investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, which could overcome the shortcomings of traditional microscopic experimental methods. In addition to the construction of different molecular models of epoxy, curing agents, and dilutants, seven models were established to investigate the effects of chain length, curing agent, and epoxy resin chain direction on the interfacial binding energy. The results showed that an increase of chain length exhibited had limited effect on the binding energy, while the curing agent and the direction of the epoxy significantly affected the interfacial binding energy. Among different factors, the curing agent tetrethylenepentamine exhibited the highest value of interfacial binding energy by an increment of 31.03 kcal/mol, indicating a better binding ability of the microcapsule core and the cement matrix. This study provides a microscopic insight into the interface behaviour between the microcapsule core and the cement matrix.

AB Unlike other species, humans cooperate in large, distantly related groups, a fact that has long presented a puzzle to biologists. The pathway by which adaptations for large-scale cooperation among nonkin evolved in humans remains a subject of vigorous debate. Results from theoretical analyses and agent-based simulations suggest that evolutionary dynamics need not yield homogeneous populations, but can instead generate a polymorphic population that consists of individuals who vary in their degree of cooperativeness. These results resonate with the recent increasing emphasis on the importance of individual differences in understanding and modeling behavior and dynamics in experimental games and decision problems. Here, we report the results of laboratory experiments that complement both theory and simulation results. We find that our subjects fall into three types, an individual's type is stable, and a group's cooperative outcomes can be remarkably well predicted if one knows its type composition. Reciprocal types, who contribute to the public good as a positive function of their beliefs about others' contributions, constitute the majority (63%) of players; cooperators and free-riders are also present in our subject population. Despite substantial behavioral differences, earnings among types are statistically identical. Our results support the view that our human subject population is in a stable, polymorphic equilibrium of types.

AB To explore the flow characteristics of healing agent leaving a vascular network and infusing a damage site within a fibre reinforced polymer composite, a numerical model of healing agent flow from an orifice has been developed using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. As an initial validation the discharge coefficient for low Reynolds number flow from a cylindrical tank is calculated numerically, using two different viscosity formulations, and compared to existing experimental data. Results of this comparison are very favourable; the model is able to reproduce experimental results for the discharge coefficient in the high Reynolds number limit, together with the power-law behaviour for low Reynolds numbers. Results are also presented for a representative delamination geometry showing healing fluid behaviour and fraction filled inside the delamination for a variety of fluid viscosities. This work provides the foundations for the vascular self-healing community in calculating not only the flow rate through the network, but also, by simulating a representative damage site, the final location of the healing fluid within the damage site in order to assess the improvement in local and global mechanical properties and thus healing efficiency.

AB Kinetic simulations of polymer chain propagation in an aqueous medium in an initial stage of emulsifier-free, emulsion organotellurium-mediated living radical polymerization (emulsion TERP) of styrene with sodium poly(methacrylic acid)-methyltellanyl (PMAA-TeMe) as a control agent and 4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid) as a water-soluble azo-initiator at various polymerization temperatures, which is carried out experimentally at pH > 9 in a previous article, is performed using PREDICI software from CiTGmbH. The approach based on alpha-chain end-separated kinetic simulation leads us to get important aspects of individual polymer chain growths from both alpha-end groups, i.e., initiator and PMAA end groups. The larger number percentage of polystyrene (PS) chain having PMAA end group relative to all PS chains is generated at lower polymerization temperature. In addition, the PS chain growth is also pronounced at lower temperature. In other words, the self-assembly nucleation, in which the control agents are contained, predominantly occurs at the lower polymerization temperature than the homogeneous nucleation, in which they are not contained. This indicates that the emulsion TERP effectively proceeds at lower temperature, which is well accorded with the experimental result in the previous article.

AB Modeling techniques such as molecular dynamics are often complicated and computationally expensive. This paper discusses agent-based modeling (ABM) as an alternative modeling approach that allows for any level of modeling complexity at a reasonable computational effort. The ABM framework is generally applicable for modeling complex systems. More specifically, ABM makes it possible to impose simple behaviors on individual agents which interact to produce an overall complex system behavior, thus facilitating the modeling of complex systems. To demonstrate the feasibility of ABM, we apply the approach to two problems: gas separation in an inorganic-organic membrane and hydrogen capture in a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF). The data collected from the models is consistent with experimental data suggesting that ABM is an effective modeling tool. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The new in vivo experimental model provides possibility for the exact measurement of the quantity of the penetrated drug through the living mouse skin. Two gel formulations containing ibuprofen were investigated with or without penetration enhancer. The applied penetration enhancer was Transcutol (R). The effect of the penetration enhancer was clearly detected in both models. The in vitro diffused amount of ibuprofen was significantly higher than the one permeated through the living skin. The presence of the active agent in the plasma was also determined after the observation period. It was possible to monitor the penetration and absorption of topical formulations simultaneously.

AB This article introduces a formalization of the dynamics between sensorimotor interaction and homeostasis, integrated in a single architecture to learn object affordances of consummatory behaviors. We also describe the principles necessary to learn grounded knowledge in the context of an agent and its surrounding environment, which we use to investigate the constraints imposed by the agent's internal dynamics and the environment. This is tested with an embodied, situated robot, in a simulated environment, yielding results that support this formalization. Furthermore, we show that this methodology allows learned affordances to be dynamically redefined, depending on object similarity, resource availability, and the rhythms of the agent's internal physiology. For example, if a resource becomes increasingly scarce, the value assigned by the agent to its related effect increases accordingly, encouraging a more active behavioral strategy to maintain physiological stability. Experimental results also suggest that a combination of motivation-driven and affordance learning in a single architecture should simplify its overall complexity while increasing its adaptivity.

ID ELECTRON-SPIN-RESONANCE; LIQUID-CRYSTALLINE SOLVENTS; RELAXATION
AB Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of model magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents vanadyl ethylenediaminetetraacetate and vanadyl diethylenetriaminepentaacetate in 46% w/v sucrose solutions have been acquired from near physiological temperature to near freezing to study their rotational dynamics in a viscous environment. The sucrose solution simulates environments that may arise in vivo and also when the contrast agents are bound either covalently or noncovalently (e.g., via hydrogen bonds) to another molecule either by chance or by design to improve the relaxivity and the specificity. We report that an isotropic Brownian model, which described the rotational dynamics of these agents in water, does not fully portray the rotational dynamics in this environment, especially in the intermediate or slow tumbling regime. However, an axial anisotropic rotational model simulated the experimental spectra well and can account for the trends exhibited by the data. The dynamics results suggest that the motion deviates substantially from Stokes-Einstein behavior, and possible physical models to account for the behavior are discussed.

AB Medical ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) have evolved from straight image enhancers to pathophysiological markers and drug delivery vehicles. However, the exact dynamic behavior of the encapsulated bubbles composing UCAs is still not entirely known. In this article, we propose to characterize full populations of UCAs, by looking at the translational effects of ultrasound radiation force on each bubble in a diluted population. The setup involves a sensitive, fully programmable transmitter/receiver and two unconventional, real-time display modes. Such display modes are used to measure the displacements produced by irradiation at frequencies in the range 2-8 MHz and pressures between 150 kPa and 1.5 MPa. The behavior of individual bubbles freely moving in a water tank is clearly observed, and it is shown that it depends on the bubble physical dimensions as well as on the viscoelastic properties of the encapsulation. A new method also is distilled that estimates the viscoelastic properties of bubble encapsulation by fitting the experimental bubble velocities to values simulated by a numerical model based on the modified Herring equation and the Bierknes force. The fit results are a shear modulus of 18 MPa and a viscosity of 0.23 Pas for a thermoplastic PVC-AN shell. Phospholipid shell elasticity and friction parameter of the experimental contrast agent are estimated as 0.8 N/m and 1 10(-7) kg/s, respectively (shear modulus of 32 MPa and viscosity of 0.19 Pas, assuming 4nm shell thickness).

AB The paper studies the behavior of ceramic porous tungsten alloy with reinforcing agents under the shock-wave loading conditions. Penetrating capacity of tungsten kinetic energy projectiles is calculated and experimentally investigated during their high-speed impacts on steel plates. It is shown that the increased penetration depth of tungsten projectiles exceeds that of the prototype with relevant weight and size, made of tungsten-nickel-iron cast alloy. A mathematical model is developed together with the design technique of the behavior of tungstennickel-iron-cobalt metal foams alloyed with boron carbide, tungsten titanium carbide and tungsten carbide during the high-speed impact interaction. The composite ceramic material is described here as a porous medium. The matrix of this medium is a homogeneous two-phase mixture of the tungsten-nickel-iron-cobalt system and reinforcing agents added in the required proportions.

AB Template release during nanoimprint lithography was simulated and the detailed steps of this process were described. Template release was shown to start with the separation of the residual layer, which propagated along the sidewall of the template. After template separation, the template lifted up and release was completed. The maximum template releases force related to the stretching of the resist before separation of the template from the residual resist layer. The results of the simulation were supported by experimental analysis. Moreover, induced inner strain in the resist during release was estimated to investigate the factors responsible for the formation of resist defects for various release methods; such as lift-off, peeling; and roll-to-roll release.

AB We study opinion dynamics over multiplex networks where agents interact with bounded confidence. Namely, two neighbouring individuals exchange opinions and compromise if their opinions do not differ by more than a given threshold. In literature, agents are generally assumed to have a homogeneous confidence bound. Here, we study analytically and numerically opinion evolution over structured networks characterised by multiple layers with respective confidence thresholds and general initial opinion distributions. Through rigorous probability analysis, we show analytically the critical thresholds at which a phase transition takes place in the long-term consensus behaviour, over multiplex networks with some regularity conditions. Our results reveal the quantitative relation between the critical threshold and initial distribution. Further, our numerical simulations illustrate the consensus behaviour of the agents in network topologies including lattices and, small-world and scale-free networks, as well as for structure-dependent convergence parameters accommodating node heterogeneity. We find that the critical thresholds for consensus tend to agree with the predicted upper bounds in Theorems 4 and 5 in this paper. Finally, our results indicate that multiplexity hinders consensus formation when the initial opinion configuration is within a bounded range and, provide insight into information diffusion and social dynamics in multiplex systems modeled by networks.

AB Chemotherapy is 1 method for the treatment of cancer, but serious side effects can sometimes limit the dosage given. Mild fever and diarrhea are common side effects of cancer chemotherapy. Gastrointestinal injury induced by chemotherapeutic agents may result in bacterial/endotoxin translocation from the gut into the systemic circulation. An experimental study was therefore conducted to clarify the effect of systemic chemotherapeutic agents on gastrointestinal barrier function. Male Wistar rats were divided into a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) group (100 mg/kg/day for 4 days; n = 27) and a control group (n = 5). All rats were fasted and central venous catheterization was performed for total parenteral nutrition and blood sampling. Intestinal tissue was also sampled for pathological examination. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were determined by ELISA, bacterial translocation was quantified by lymph node culture and plasma endotoxin content of portal blood was measured by the Limulus-amebocyte-lysate test. In the 5-FU group on day 4, a proportion of rats exhibited severe watery diarrhea (73.9%) and occasional vomiting (86.2%). The levels of plasma TNFalpha and IL-6 were seen to increase, peaking at day 6 (IL-6, 350.0 +/- 67.8 pg/ml; TNFalpha, 26.1 +/- 3.2 pg/ml). The pathological findings also changed on day 4. On day 6, 90% of the rats in the 5-FU group showed dramatic sepsis-like manifestations, whereas the control group did not. Within the 5-FU group, only at day 6 was bacterial translocation in the rat mesenteric lymph nodes or significantly elevated levels of endotoxin evident. These results suggest that bacterial/endotoxin translocation might cause sepsis-like manifestations after systemic chemotherapy. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Collaboration and its promotion by funders continue to accelerate. Although research has identified significant transaction costs associated with collaboration, little empirical work has examined the broader, societal-level economic outcomes of a resource-sharing environment. Does an environment that encourages collaboration shift our focus toward certain types of social objectives and away from others? This paper uses agent-based Monte Carlo simulation to demonstrate that collaboration is particularly useful when resources are rare but a social objective is commonly held. However, collaboration can lead to bad outcomes when the objective is not commonly shared; in such cases, markets outperform collaborative arrangements. These findings suggest that encouraging a resource-sharing environment can lead to inefficiencies even worse than market failure. We also demonstrate that failure to account for transaction costs when prescribing collaboration can result in quantifiably lower outcome levels than expected.

AB Crime in urban environment is a major social problem nowadays. As such, many efforts have been made to develop mathematical models for this type of crime. The pioneering work [M. B. Short, M. R. D'Orsogna, V. B. Pasour, G. E. Tita, P. J. Brantingham, A. L. Bertozzi and L. B. Chayes, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 18, (2008), pp. 1249-1267] establishes an agent-based human-environment interaction model of criminal behavior for residential burglary, where aggregate pattern formation of "hotspots" is quantitatively studied for the first time. Potential offenders are assumed to interact with environment according to well-known criminology and sociology notions. However long-term simulations for the coupled dynamics are computationally costly due to all components evolving on slow time scales. In this paper, we introduce a new-generation criminal behavior model with separated spatiotemporal scales for the agent actions and the environment parameter reactions. The computational cost is reduced significantly, while the essential stochastic features of the pioneering model are preserved. Moreover, the separation of scales brings the model into the theoretical framework of piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). A martingale approach is applicable which will be useful to analyze both stochastic and statistical features of the model in subsequent studies.

AB We introduce a new family of highly efficient polarizing agents for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)-enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) applications, composed of asymmetric bis-nitroxides, in which a piperidine-based radical and a pyrrolinoxyl or a proxyl radical are linked together. The design of the AsymPol family was guided by the use of advanced simulations that allow computation of the impact of the radical structure on DNP efficiency. These simulations suggested the use of a relatively short linker with the intention to generate a sizable intramolecular electron dipolar coupling/J-exchange interaction, while avoiding parallel nitroxide orientations. The characteristics of AsymPol were further tuned, for instance with the addition of a conjugated carbon-carbon double bond in the 5-membered ring to improve the rigidity and provide a favorable relative orientation, the replacement of methyls by spirocyclohexanolyl groups to slow the electron spin relaxation, and the introduction of phosphate groups to yield highly water-soluble dopants. An in-depth experimental and theoretical study for two members of the family, AsymPol and AsymPolPOK, is presented here. We report substantial sensitivity gains at both 9.4 and 18.8 T. The robust efficiency of this new family is further demonstrated through high-resolution surface characterization of an important industrial catalyst using fast sample spinning at 18.8 T. This work highlights a new direction for polarizing agent design and the critical importance of computations in this process.

AB Vitamin B-6 has shown to be a potentially effective antioxidant agent, and dietary antioxidants are also frequently valuable inhibitors of clastogenesis and carcinogenesis. The purpose of the present work was to study the clastogenicity of different doses of vitamin B6 and to examine the possible modulating effect of this vitamin on chromosomal damage induced by the antitumor agent doxorubicin in Wistar rats. Experimental groups were set up for pre-and simultaneous treatment with vitamin B6 alone or in combination with DXR. The data obtained from administering diVerent doses of vitamin B-6 (12.5-100 mg/kg b. w.) showed no signigicant increase in total chromosomal aberrations when compared with the negative control. The administration of two doses of 25 mg/kg b. w. or one dose of 50 mg/kg b. w. of vitamin B6 before doxorubicin injection seemed equally effective in protecting cells against doxorubicin clastogenicity. The anticlastogenic effect of vitamin B-6 on DXR-induced chromosomal damage could be ascribed to its antioxidant properties. Vitamin B6 was not clastogenic or cytotoxic in rat bone marrow cells and it plays a role in inhibiting the clastogenicity induced by DXR.

AB We apply terahertz time-domain spectroscopy for the quantitative non-invasive assessment of the water content in biological samples, such as Carpinus caroliniana tree leaves and pork muscles. The developed experimental terahertz time-domain spectroscopy system operates both in transmission and reflection modes. The Landau-Looyenga-Lifshitz-based model is used for the calculation of the water concentration within the samples. The results of the water concentration measurements are compared with the results of the gravimetric measurements. The obtained results show that the water content in biological samples can be measured non-invasively, with a high accuracy, utilizing terahertz waves in transmission and reflection modes.

AB Biogeomorphology adds the element "biological dynamic" (of populations or communities) to chemical and physical geomorphic factors and thus complicates the framework of geomorphic processes. Such biological complications of the animal-induced transport of solids in streams should be particularly important in crayfish, as crayfish affect this transport through their overall activity and intraspecific aggression levels, which could be modified by shelter availability or the establishment of dominance hierarchies among individuals not knowing each other. Using experimental streams, we tested these hypotheses by measuring bow shelter availability or residential crayfish group invasion by unknown individuals affected the impact of the crayfish Orconectes limosus on the (i) transport of gravel at baseflow (during 12 experimental days); (ii) sediment surface characteristics (after 12 days); and (iii) critical shear stress causing incipient gravel motion during simulated floods (after 12 days). The two potentially important factors shelter availability or residential group invasion negligibly affected the crayfish impact on gravel sediments, suggesting that habitat unfamiliarity (a third potentially important factor affecting crayfish activity) should increase the crayfish-induced sediment transport. Because habitat unfamiliarity is associated with sporadic long-distance migrations of a few crayfish individuals, this third factor should play a minor role in real streams, where crayfish biomass should be a key factor in relations with crayfish effects on sediments. Therefore, we combined the results of this study with those of previous crayfish experiments to assess how crayfish biomass could serve in modelling the gravel transport. Crayfish biomass explained 47% of the variability in the baseflow gravel transport and, in combination with the coefficient of variation of the bed elevation and algal cover, 72% of the variability in the critical gravel shear stress. These results encourage more research on the topic, as an increasing number of eliminations of abiotic and biotic factors that could complicate the animal-induced sediment transport in streams would facilitate the use of biological variables (e.g., bioturbator biomass) in future modelling of the transport of solids.

AB In this paper, the evolution of a tumour cord after treatment is investigated by extensive numerical simulations on the basis of a mathematical model developed by Bertuzzi et al. (submitted). The model is formulated in cylindrical symmetry adopting the continuum approach, and takes into account the influence of oxygen level on the proliferation and death rate of cells, the volume reduction due to disgregation of dead cells, and the cell killing effects of radiation and drugs. Some extensions of the model are proposed to represent more accurately the radioresistance of hypoxic cells and the cytotoxic action of anticancer drugs. The steady state of the cord, and the cord evolution from the steady state after the delivery of a single dose of an anticancer agent, are computed for various combinations of model parameters and for different choices of the functions describing the effects of treatments. The results of the numerical computations show that, in spite of its many simplifications, the model behaviour appears to be reasonable in view of the available experimental observations. The model allows having a better insight into some complex treatment-related events, such as cell reoxygenation and repopulation. (C) 2003 Society for Mathematical Biology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose This study was designed to evaluate the antitumorigenic efficiency of Endostar (an antiangiogenic agent) arterially administrated combined with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) on liver tumor, and validation of perfusion CT for quantitative measurements of the results.
   Experimental Design Thirty rabbits bearing VX2 liver tumors were randomly and equally distributed into three groups. One of the following treatment protocols was performed in each group: 1) group 1 was treated with TACE and simultaneously arterially administrated Endostar; 2) group 2 with TACE alone, and 3) a control group that had saline injected through hepatic artery. Routine CT scan was performed before treatment, and perfusion CT imaging was performed 2 weeks after treatment. Immunohistochemical biomarkers of microvascular density (MVD) and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were measured for assessments of angiogenesis.
   Results We observed a statistically significant reduction from the control in the volume, growth rate, and size of the tumor 2 weeks after treatment with both TACE plus Endostar and with TACE alone (P < 0.01). Although there was no statistically significant difference in tumor size between the group with TACE plus Endostar and the group with TACE alone (P > 0.05), MVD and VEGF were significantly less expressed in the TACE plus Endostar group than both groups with TACE alone and the control group (P < 0.01). Blood flow (BF), blood volume (BV), and permeability-surface area products (PS) in the group with TACE plus Endostar on perfusion CT were significantly higher than other two groups (P < 0.05), which were positively correlated with the MVD and VEGF values (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions TACE with arterial administration of Endostar simultaneously significantly inhibited the angiogenesis biomarkers associated with TACE in a rabbit model bearing VX2 liver tumor, which indicates that the combined treatment protocol may have potential synergistic effects on liver cancer. It also is suggested that perfusion CT may be useful for monitoring antiangiogenic/antivascular treatment in the liver tumors.

AB This Letter reports the use of an ultrahigh resolution optical microangiography (OMAG) system for simultaneous 3D imaging of microstructure and lymphatic and blood vessels without the use of an exogenous contrast agent. An automatic algorithm is developed to segment the lymphatic vessels from the microstructural images based on the fact that the lymph fluid is optically transparent. An OMAG system is developed that utilizes a broadband super-continuum light source, providing an axial resolution of 2.3 mu m and lateral resolution of 5.8 mu m, capable of resolving the capillary vasculature and lymphatic vessels innervating microcirculatory tissue beds. Experimental demonstration is performed by showing detailed 3D lymphatic and blood vessel maps, coupled with morphology, within mouse ears in vivo. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America

AB The coinjection of carbon dioxide (CO2) and a CO2-foaming agent to form stable CO2 foam has been found to improve the sweep efficiency during CO2-foam processes in carbonate reservoirs However, only a few studies of CO2-foam transport in fractured rock have been reported In fractured chalk reservoirs with low matrix permeability, the aqueous CO2-foaming-agent solution will flow mainly through the fractures. The total retention of the CO2-foaming agent in the reservoir will depend on how much of the matrix is contacted by the CO2-foaming-agent solution during the project period and. therefore, on its transport rate into the matrix
   This paper presents results front a series of static and flow-through experiments carried out to investigate the transport and retention phenomena of CO2-foaming agents in fractured chalk models at 55 degrees C Fractured chalk models with 100% water-saturation and residual-oil saturation after waterflooding were used In the static experiments, the fractured model was created by transferring core plugs with different diameters into steel cells with an annulus space around the plugs The fracture volume was filled with foaming-agent solutions with different initial concentrations The experiments were carried out in parallel, with liquid samples regularly taken out from the fracture above the plugs and analyzed for the foaming-agent concentration The experiments were monitored until the concentrations in the fractures reached a plateau
   At specific and constant concentrations of the foaming agent in the fractures, the plugs were demounted and samples drilled out along the whole lengths of the plugs from the outer. middle. and center portions These samples were analyzed for foaming-agent concentration to determine how much of it had penetrated the matrix
   Results indicate that the transport of the foaming-agent decreases toward the center of the plugs with 100% water-saturation and residual-oil saturation after waterflooding Modeling of the static experiments using the Computer Modelling Group (CMG)'s commercial reservoir simulator STARS was also carried out to determine the transport rate for the foaming agent A good history match between experimental and modeling results was obtained In the flow-through experiments, the fractured model was created by drilling a concentric hole through the center of the plug. The hole, simulating an artificial fracture, was filled with glass beads of different dimensions Fractured models with different effective permeability were flooded with equal volumes of the foaming-agent solution Results show that the transport of CO2-foaming agent into the matrix is slower in the fractured models than in the homogeneous models with viscous flooding of the rock

AB New approaches are vital for efficiently evaluating human health risk of thousands of chemicals in commerce. In vitro models offer a high-throughput approach for assaying chemical-induced molecular and cellular changes; however, bridging these perturbations to in vivo effects across chemicals, dose, time, and species remains challenging. Technological advances in multiresolution imaging and multiscale simulation are making it feasible to reconstruct tissues in silico. In toxicology, these "virtual" tissues (VT) aim to predict histopathological outcomes from alterations of cellular phenotypes that are controlled by chemical-induced perturbations in molecular pathways. The behaviors of thousands of heterogeneous cells in tissues are simulated discretely using agent-based modeling (ABM), in which computational "agents" mimic cell interactions and cellular responses to the microenvironment. The behavior of agents is constrained by physical laws and biological rules derived from experimental evidence. VT extend compartmental physiologic models to simulate both acute insults as well as the chronic effects of low-dose exposure. Furthermore, agent behavior can encode the logic of signaling and genetic regulatory networks to evaluate the role of different pathways in chemical-induced injury. To extrapolate toxicity across species, chemicals, and doses, VT require four main components: (a) organization of prior knowledge on physiologic events to define the mechanistic rules for agent behavior, (b) knowledge on key chemical-induced molecular effects, including activation of stress sensors and changes in molecular pathways that alter the cellular phenotype, (c) multiresolution quantitative and qualitative analysis of histologic data to characterize and measure chemical-, dose-, and time-dependent physiologic events, and (d) multiscale, spatiotemporal simulation frameworks to effectively calibrate and evaluate VT using experimental data. This investigation presents the motivation, implementation, and application of VT with examples from hepatotoxicity and carcinogenesis.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the amount of residual cement (ECL) around the margins of zirconia crown copings after careful luting and cleaning procedures and to investigate these factors in relation to two tested luting materials. Materials and Methods: An experimental model of a maxillary arch was selected for this in vitro study. The maxillary first molar was prepared to receive an all-ceramic, single, full-crown restoration with a finish line located 1 mm below the artificial gingiva. After scanning of the prepared tooth, 20 paired zirconia coping-abutment assemblies were CAD/CAM fabricated. A slot in the model allowed for insertion and removal of the assemblies for each new test. Specimens were divided into two groups according to the cementation procedure: half (n = 10) were luted using a resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) (Ketac-Cem Plus) (GI group), and the other half with a dual-curing self-adhesive resin agent (RelyX Unicem 2) (UN group). The substructures were loaded with cement, and a customized preseating device was adopted for preliminary reduction of excess. The zirconia copings were finally seated on their respective abutments located on the simulation model. A blinded investigator attempted to remove all excess cement with clinically available instruments. The amount of excess cement left in situ after cleaning procedures was weighed in grams. Dislodging forces of luted coping-abutment assemblies were obtained by using pull-off tests in a universal testing machine (crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/minute) after 24 hours of water storage. Means and standard deviations were calculated for ECL and for retention force values, and Mann-Whitney and ANOVA tests were carried out to detect significant differences (alpha = .05) among groups. Results: Cement remnants were found in all specimens despite the cleaning procedures, with a typical distribution in interproximal areas. Mean ECL values for the GI and UN groups were 0.0079 +/- 0.0060 and 0.0107 +/- 0.0081, respectively. No statistically significant differences were found between tested cements (P = .3284). Removal stress values (MPa) were significantly higher (P= .0313) for the UN group (12.4 +/- 6.5) than for the GI group (6.57 +/- 4.69). Conclusion: Similar amounts of undetected cement remnants were discovered around the esthetic margins of zirconia crown copings regardless of cement type. The luting procedure using the self-adhesive resin cement provided significantly higher early retention values than the RMGI material.

AB The effects of submicron core-shell rubber (CSR) particles, nanoclay fillers, and molding parameters on the mechanical properties and cell structure of injection-molded microcellular polyamide-6 (PA6) composites were studied. The experimental results of PA6 nanocomposites with 5.0 and 7.5 wt% nanoclay loadings and of CSR-modified PA6 composites with 0.5 and 3.1 wt% CSR loadings were compared to their neat resin counterparts. This study found that nanoclay was more efficient in promoting a smaller cell size, larger cell density, and higher tensile strength for microcellular injection molding parts. A higher nanoclay loading led to more brittle behavior for microcellular parts. It was found that a proper amount of CSR particles could be added to the microcellular injection-molded PA6 to reduce the cell size, increase the cell density, and enhance the toughness of the molded part. However, CSR particles were less effective cell nucleation agents as compared to nanoclay for producing desirable cell structures, and a higher CSR loading was found to have diminishing effects on the process and on the properties of the parts.

AB Situation awareness modelling is popularly used in the command and control domain for situation assessment and decision support. However, situation models in real-world applications are typically complex and not easy to use. This paper presents a Context-aware Decision Support (CaDS) system, which consists of a situation model for shared situation awareness modelling and a group of entity agents, one for each individual user, for focused and customized decision support. By incorporating a rule-based inference engine, the entity agents provide functions including event classification, action recommendation, and proactive decision making. The implementation and the performance of the proposed system are demonstrated through a case study on a simulated command and control application. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Nerve agents (NAs) pose a great threat to society because they are easy to produce and are deadly in nature, which makes developing methods to detect, adsorb, and destroy them crucial. To enable the development of these methods, we report the use of first principles electronic structure calculations to understand the binding properties of NAs and NA simulants on metal salt surfaces. We report calculated Gibbs free binding energies (G(BE)) for four NAs (tabun (GA), sarin (GB), soman (GD), and venomous X (VX)) and five NA simulants (dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), dimethyl chlorophosphate (DMCP), trimethyl phosphate (TMP), methyl dichlorophosphate (MDCP), and di-isopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP)) on metal perthlorate and metal nitrate salts using density functional theory. Our results indicate a general trend in the binding strength of NAs and NA simulants to metal salt surfaces: MDCP < DMCP < GA < GD approximate to GB < TMP < VX approximate to DMMP < DIMP. Based on their binding properties on salt surfaces, we identify the most effective simulant for each of the studied NAs as follows: DMCP for GA, TMP for GB and GD, and DMMP for VX. To illustrate the utility of the binding energies calculated in our study, we address the design of NA sensors based on the competitive binding of NAs and liquid crystalline compounds on metal salts. We compare our results with previous experimental findings and provide a list of promising combinations of liquid crystal and metal salt systems to selectively and sensitively detect NAs. Our study highlights the great value of computational chemistry for designing selective and sensitive NA sensors while minimizing the number of very dangerous experiments involving NAs.

AB Rapid destruction of stockpiles of sarin and other chemical weapon agents (CWA) requires understanding and quantitative description of the relevant chemical reactions. Rapid reactions at elevated temperatures are of particular interest for prompt agent defeat scenarios. Diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) is a sarin surrogate particularly well suited to model sarin thermal decomposition and is often used in experiments. This article is a review of different experimental methods addressing decomposition of gasified DIMP, respective results and their interpretations. Major early decomposition products are propene, methylphosphonic acid, methyl(oxo)phosphoniumolate, and isopropanol. Early computational work using available kinetic data for fluorine and the phosphorus -fluorine bond predicted the decomposition under incineration conditions. Experiments using an isothermal flow reactor operated at 700-800 K were used to model DIMP decomposition as unimolecular reaction with results that were consistent with the earlier theoretical work. Decomposition in dynamic environments was studied using DIMP supported on rapidly heated substrates. The results showed different decomposition products and product sequences forming at different heating rates, suggesting the need for revised reaction kinetics. However, species quantification in such experiments is difficult because of inherent large temperature gradients. Plasma produced in a corona discharge was also reported to lead to rapid DIMP decomposition at low temperatures. Decomposition products were distinct from those observed at high temperatures. Shock tube experiments may be well suited to study decomposition of organophosphorus compounds like DIMP following their rapid heating in diverse environments. However, presently, only sarin surrogates other than DIMP have been investigated, and no intermediate reaction products, important for developing a validated mechanism, could be detected.

AB Background: For complex financial systems, the negative and positive return-volatility correlations, i.e., the so-called leverage and anti-leverage effects, are particularly important for the understanding of the price dynamics. However, the microscopic origination of the leverage and anti-leverage effects is still not understood, and how to produce these effects in agent-based modeling remains open. On the other hand, in constructing microscopic models, it is a promising conception to determine model parameters from empirical data rather than from statistical fitting of the results.
   Methods: To study the microscopic origination of the return-volatility correlation in financial systems, we take into account the individual and collective behaviors of investors in real markets, and construct an agent-based model. The agents are linked with each other and trade in groups, and particularly, two novel microscopic mechanisms, i.e., investors' asymmetric trading and herding in bull and bear markets, are introduced. Further, we propose effective methods to determine the key parameters in our model from historical market data.
   Results: With the model parameters determined for six representative stock-market indices in the world, respectively, we obtain the corresponding leverage or anti-leverage effect from the simulation, and the effect is in agreement with the empirical one on amplitude and duration. At the same time, our model produces other features of the real markets, such as the fat-tail distribution of returns and the long-term correlation of volatilities.
   Conclusions: We reveal that for the leverage and anti-leverage effects, both the investors' asymmetric trading and herding are essential generation mechanisms. Among the six markets, however, the investors' trading is approximately symmetric for the five markets which exhibit the leverage effect, thus contributing very little. These two microscopic mechanisms and the methods for the determination of the key parameters can be applied to other complex systems with similar asymmetries.

AB This study investigates cooperative guidance problems for multiple missiles with fixed and switching directed communication topologies. A two-step guidance strategy is proposed to realize the simultaneous attack. In the first step, a distributed cooperative guidance law is designed using local neighboring information for multiple missiles to achieve consensus on range-to-go and leading angle. The second step begins when the consensus of multiple missiles is realized. During the second step, multiple missiles disconnect from each other and hit the target using the proportional navigation guidance law. First, based on the local neighboring communications, a sufficient condition for multiple missiles to realize simultaneous attack with a fixed communication topology is presented, where the topology is only required to have a directed spanning tree. Then, the results are extended to the case of switching communication topologies. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to validate the theoretical results.

AB Population growth and unrestricted development policies are driving low-density urbanization and fragmentation of peri-urban landscapes across North America. While private individuals own most undeveloped land, little is known about how their decision-making processes shape landscape-scale patterns of urbanization over time. We introduce a hybrid agent-based modeling (ABM) cellular automata (CA) modeling approach, developed for analyzing dynamic feedbacks between landowners' decisions to sell their land for development, and resulting patterns of landscape fragmentation. Our modeling approach builds on existing conceptual frameworks in land systems modeling by integrating an ABM into an established grid-based land-change model FUTURES. The decision-making process within the ABM involves landowner agents whose decision to sell their land to developers is a function of heterogeneous preferences and peer-influences (i.e., spatial neighborhood relationships). Simulating landowners' decision to sell allows an operational link between the ABM and the CA module. To test our hybrid ABM-CA approach, we used empirical data for a rapidly growing region in North Carolina for parameterization. We conducted a sensitivity analysis focusing on the two most relevant parameters spatial actor distribution and peer-influence intensity and evaluated the dynamic behavior of the model simulations. The simulation results indicate different peer-influence intensities lead to variable landscape fragmentation patterns, suggesting patterns of spatial interaction among landowners indirectly affect landscape-scale patterns of urbanization and the fragmentation of undeveloped forest and farmland.

AB The simultaneous effects of a range of additives and associated interactions on melt processing stability, processing discoloration, and long-term stability of a blown film-grade metallocene LLDPE (mLLDPE) were investigated by using a two-level factorial experimental design. The additives investigated were a phenolic antioxidant, a phosphite processing stabilizer, a calcium stearate antacid, a synthetic silica antiblocking agent, and an erucamide slip additive. A multiple extrusion experiment was carried out to assess processing stability. Melt stabilization performance was monitored by melt flow rate (MFR) measurements, and color development was determined using yellowness index (YI) measurements. Long-term thermal stability was assessed by monitoring the rate of formation of the non-volatile carbonyl oxidation products using FTIR. Results were quite consistent with the literature. Therefore, the two-level factorial experimental design proved to be a very useful tool for screening the simultaneous effects of each additive and the possible interactions between additives present in the stabilizer system investigated.

AB This paper focuses on the synchronization of trading behavior caused by interactions among traders. The study begins with an agent-based model in which most agents make investment decisions based on three types of information (neighbor, public and private information) according to their heterogeneous personal preferences. Considering the influence of the social relationship network in reality, traders in our model are connected by a complex network. We use four different types of networks. The simulated results of this model reproduce several stylized facts about the asset market. Simulated results show that when preference of traders for neighbor information increases, the level of trust among traders will gradually increase and then there will be a "leap" at a certain point. The mutual trust among traders is achieved through coupling effect in the network. Moreover, with the frequent synchronization of traders' behavior, extreme phenomena in financial markets will emerge. In addition, our numerical simulations show that when the average degree of network is higher, behavioral synchronization will emerge at a lower level of dependence on neighbor information. The degree distribution of the network will also have a significant influence on the convergence processes of behavioral synchronization. The more heterogeneous the degree distribution is, the easier the behavioral synchronization process will occur. In our simulations, the mode of agent behavior expectation will also enhance the effect of network structure to behavioral synchronization. Finally, this paper affirms the important role of public information and learning mechanism (expectation formation mode) in the process of behavioral synchronization.

AB Gold nanoshells are concentric spherical constructs that possess highly desirable optical responses in the near infrared. Gold nanoshells consist of a thin outer gold shell and a silica core and can be used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes by tuning the optical response through changing the core-shell ratio as well as the overall size. Although optical properties of gold nanoshells have already been well documented, the reflectance characteristics are not well understood and have not yet been elucidated by experimental measurements. Yet, in order to use gold nanoshells as an optical contrast agent for scattering-based optical methods such as reflectance spectroscopy, it is critical to characterize the reflectance behavior. With this in mind, we used a fiber-optic-based spectrometer to measure diffuse reflectance of gold nanoshell suspensions from 500 nm to 900 nm. Experimental results show that gold nanoshells cause a significant increase in the measured reflectance. Spectral features associated with scattering from large angles (similar to 180 degrees) were observed at low nanoshell concentrations. Monte Carlo modeling of gold nanoshells reflectance demonstrated the efficacy of using such methods to predict diffuse reflectance. Our studies suggest that gold nanoshells are an excellent candidate as optical contrast agents and that Monte Carlo methods are a useful tool for optimizing nanoshells best suited for scattering-based optical methods.

AB Rheumatoid arthritis is a complex multifactorial disease, whose pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Biologic agents have revolutionized RA treatment, but a significant percentage of patients does not obtain an adequate response to the therapy. Most of the biologic agents do better if combined with conventional immunosuppressive DMARDs and they show a similar efficacy profile: most of the responders achieve the minimum desirable level of response (ACR20) and only few patients obtain a worthwhile clinical improvement (ACR70 or better). We need to identify new strategies of treatment, able to comply the non satisfied needs of RA patients. Taking inspiration from other medical fields, we could hypothesize a combined regimen in which biologic agents are administered simultaneously at a low or ultra-low dosage, targeting several pathogenetic mechanisms but avoiding important side effects. Alternatively it should be useful to identify rapid succession regimens in which biologic drugs are taken according to an established sequence. Research in this field is obviously not encouraged by pharmaceutical industries, but our efforts should be driven in this direction. According to these observations, adequate clinical trials should be designed to search for appropriate drugs associations and dosages. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB It has become increasingly clear that the influences on walking as well as other forms of regular physical activity are complex and require an increased understanding of factors across multiple levels of influence. Ecological frameworks have provided the field with a heuristic means of capturing potential impacts on behavior across diverse domains, including personal, behavioral, social or cultural, and environmental. We discuss advances in both understanding and applying this framework through the inclusion of previously ignored dimensions of impact (e.g., time), the application of state-of-the-art statistical methods for understanding interactions among multiple domains (e.g., signal detection), and the development of computer technologies (e.g., agent-based modeling) aimed at simulating the complex relationships between multiple levels of impact and walking behavior. We conclude with suggestions for future research in this emerging field.

AB Background: Antiangiogenic agents have been recently added to the oncological armamentarium with bevacizumab probably being the most popular representative in current clinical practice. The elucidation of the mode of action of these agents is a prerequisite for personalized prediction of antiangiogenic treatment response and selection of patients who may benefit from this kind of therapy. To this end, having used as a basis a preexisting continuous vascular tumour growth model which addresses the targeted nature of antiangiogenic treatment, we present a paper characterized by the following three features. First, the integration of a two-compartmental bevacizumab specific pharmacokinetic module into the core of the aforementioned preexisting model. Second, its mathematical modification in order to reproduce the asymptotic behaviour of tumour volume in the theoretical case of a total destruction of tumour neovasculature. Third, the exploitation of a range of published animal datasets pertaining to antitumour efficacy of bevacizumab on various tumour types (breast, lung, head and neck, colon).
   Results: Results for both the unperturbed growth and the treatment module reveal qualitative similarities with experimental observations establishing the biologically acceptable behaviour of the model. The dynamics of the untreated tumour has been studied via a parameter analysis, revealing the role of each relevant input parameter to tumour evolution. The combined effect of endogenous proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors on the angiogenic potential of a tumour is also studied, in order to capture the dynamics of molecular competition between the two key-players of tumoural angiogenesis. The adopted methodology also allows accounting for the newly recognized direct antitumour effect of the specific agent.
   Conclusions: Interesting observations have been made, suggesting a potential size-dependent tumour response to different treatment modalities and determining the relative timing of cytotoxic versus antiangiogenic agents administration. Insight into the comparative effectiveness of different antiangiogenic treatment strategies is revealed. The results of a series of in vivo experiments in mice bearing diverse types of tumours (breast, lung, head and neck, colon) and treated with bevacizumab are successfully reproduced, supporting thus the validity of the underlying model.

ID HOMO-ECONOMICUS; SIMULATION; MODEL
AB In this paper we argue that simulating complex systems involving human behaviour requires agent rules based on a theoretically rooted structure that captures basic behavioural processes. Essential components of such a structure involve needs, decision-making processes and learning. Such a structure should be based on state-of-the-art behavioural theories and validated on the micro-level using experimental or field data of individual behaviour. We provide some experiences we had working with such a structure, which involve the possibility to relate the results of simulations on different topics, the ease of building in extra factors for specific research questions and the possibility to use empirical data in calibrating the model. A disadvantage we experienced is the lack of suiting empirical data, which necessitates in our view the combined use of empirical and simulation research.

AB We analyze the contract settlement data of a poultry company who contracts the production of broiler chickens with a group of independent growers. The company originally used rank-order (ordinal) tournaments to compensate their contract growers and later switched to cardinal tournaments. Based on the observed payment mechanism we construct an empirical model of a rank-order tournament game and estimate structural parameters of the symmetric Nash equilibrium and then simulate growers' performance under the observed cardinal tournament contract. We found that the model with risk-averse agents fits the data better than the model with risk-neutral agents and that switching from a rank-order tournament to a cardinal tournament, while keeping the growers' ex-ante expected utility constant, improved efficiency. The principal (company) gains from the switch, whereas some of the agents (growers) gain and others lose depending on their realized productivity shocks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB When two or more people coordinate their actions in space and time to produce a joint outcome, they perform a joint action. The perceptual, cognitive, and motor processes that enable individuals to coordinate their actions with others have been receiving increasing attention during the last decade, complementing earlier work on shared intentionality and discourse. This chapter reviews current theoretical concepts and empirical findings in order to provide a structured overview of the state of the art in joint action research. We distinguish between planned and emergent coordination. In planned coordination, agents' behavior is driven by representations that specify the desired outcomes of joint action and the agent's own part in achieving these outcomes. In emergent coordination, coordinated behavior occurs due to perception action couplings that make multiple individuals act in similar ways, independently of joint plans. We review evidence for the two types of coordination and discuss potential synergies between them.

ID CONVEX-OPTIMIZATION
AB This paper investigates the distributed optimization problem of a group of Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems subject to unavailable inertial parameters. A local cost function is assigned to each agent and the sum of all the local cost functions is considered as the global one. Under widely used assumptions, an adaptive distributed algorithm is proposed such that all the agent states converge to the specified point minimizing the global cost function in a cooperative manner. In particular, by introducing a novel auxiliary system with adaptive gains, the proposed optimization algorithm is privacy-preserving such that no actual state of any agent is necessary for other agents. Moreover, the proposed optimization algorithm is fully distributed in the sense that the optimization objective is achieved without knowledge of global graph information, explicit global cost function as well as strongly convex and Lipschitz constants associated with all local cost functions. Numerical simulations are illustrated to validate the theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To develop and validate an efficient comet assay on mouse oocytes without depellucidation.
   Design: In vitro experiments using a murine model.
   Setting: Biogenotoxicology research laboratory in Aix-Marseille II University, France.
   Animal(s): CD1 prepubescent female mice.
   Intervention(s): DNA lesions in oocytes were evaluated by the alkaline comet assay. After oocyte retrieval, we first studied the effect of zona pellucida (ZP) on comet morphology. For this study, we applied the comet assay to mature oocytes with and without ZP after exposure to simulated sunlight irradiation (SSI) compared with negative controls. Next, nondepellucidated mouse oocytes were exposed to three well-known genotoxic agents (SSI, methylmethanesulfonate [MMS], and hydrogen peroxide [H2O2]) and compared with negative controls. Images of oocytes were analyzed with Komet software.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): DNA damages were quantified and expressed as olive tail moment (OTM), defined as the product of the tail length and the fraction of total DNA in the tail. OTM chi(2) were calculated from OTM; they corresponded to the degrees of freedom (n) of each OTM distribution obtained from at least 50 oocytes. OTM chi(2) is an indicator of DNA lesions. The test was considered positive and statistically significant when OTM chi(2) increased in oocytes compared with the medium-only control cells.
   Result(s): There was no difference in comet aspect between oocyte groups with and without ZP. The three genotoxic agents significantly increased DNA damages as compared with the control groups. The OTM chi(2) values were (mean +/- SD): 2.1 +/- 0.07, 7.73 +/- 0.35, 3.35 +/- 0.15, and 12.4 +/- 0.51 in control, SSI, MMS, and H2O2 groups, respectively.
   Conclusion(s): Comet assay on non depellucidated mouse oocytes is a rapid and easy test. This assay would be useful to assess the genotoxicity on female germ cells of chemicals, drugs, or environmental pollutants and the efficiency of antioxidant molecules.

AB Suppose a disaster happens, and several groups of robots are dispatched from distant control stations. To enable rescue staff to make collective decisions, reliable and robust connections need to be established among stations. Motivated by this scenario, a two-stage robot deployment strategy is proposed for wireless robotic networks (WRNs). In the first stage, robots in distant groups are merged into one group that covers a desirable area. Since connectivity alone cannot guarantee a high communication quality, in the second stage, the flow between any two stations is further optimized in terms of expected number of transmissions per successfully delivered packet. In both stages, a distributed collision-free controller is proposed to regulate the interactive force among robots. The stability issues of WRNs, where the proposed controller together with a class of interaction models based on an acute angle test is implemented for robots, are analyzed under both fixed and switching topology. In order to efficiently switch the neighbor set for each robot, a new energy function is constructed taking finite-time consensus into account. To guarantee that energy agreement is achieved before the next topology change, a fixed-time consensus approach is further proposed and an upper bound of the settling time for the energy agreement is obtained. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the two-stage deployment strategy.

AB The effect of sulfonated graphene oxide (SGO) on the interaction mechanism of polyvinyl alcohol and poly (4-styrene sulfonic acid) (PVA/PSS) matrix is investigated in this paper. Pure PVA/PSS, PVA/PSS/graphene oxide (GO) and PVA/PSS/SGO nanocomposites are prepared by the freeze-thaw method. The glutaraldehyde (GLA) is used as a crosslinking agent to improve the stability of the materials. The sulfonation of GO is confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) analyses. The fully exfoliation of GO is recognized using a transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). All the nanocomposites are characterized using FTIR, UV-Vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
   A theoretical molecular simulation of the nanocomposites systems is performed to elucidate the different energies associated with the interfacial interactions. A strong interaction energy is determined due to the presence of different functional groups within the systems. The hydrogen bonding of the OH, COOH, SO3H and C-O-C groups show a EH-bond energy for the PVA/PSS/SGO system (-735.39 kcal/mol) which is higher than the corresponding of PVA/PSS/GO (-686.86 kcal/mol). The effect of the sulfonated group is more significant than that of the carboxylic group, due to both the higher polarity and higher electronegativity of the sulfonic acid group.

AB Simulation is particularly useful for testing different production control and information flow methods in construction, because field experiments suffer from difficulties with isolating cause and effect. Existing methods such as Discrete Event Simulation are limited in their ability to model the behavior of crews and of individuals who make decisions subject to their perceptions of uncertain conditions. Agent-Based Simulation may offer abetter solution because agents can be applied with behavioral models. The aim of this work was to build an experimental tool capable of reflecting the emergent nature of production in construction. This required capturing trade crew behaviors through interviews and encapsulating the behavior in software agents. The system models trades' decision-making and situational awareness while using a Building Information Model to define the physical and the process environment for the simulation. The resulting simulation tool was validated by testing predictable scenarios, which resulted in similar patterns to those found in an actual construction site. It was then applied to explore the emergent outcomes of more complex scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are computer-generated characters that simulate key properties of human face-to-face conversation, such as verbal and nonverbal behavior. In Internet-based eHealth interventions, ECAs may be used for the delivery of automated human support factors.
   Objective: We aim to provide an overview of the technological and clinical possibilities, as well as the evidence base for ECA applications in clinical psychology, to inform health professionals about the activity in this field of research.
   Methods: Given the large variety of applied methodologies, types of applications, and scientific disciplines involved in ECA research, we conducted a systematic scoping review. Scoping reviews aim to map key concepts and types of evidence underlying an area of research, and answer less-specific questions than traditional systematic reviews. Systematic searches for ECA applications in the treatment of mood, anxiety, psychotic, autism spectrum, and substance use disorders were conducted in databases in the fields of psychology and computer science, as well as in interdisciplinary databases. Studies were included if they conveyed primary research findings on an ECA application that targeted one of the disorders. We mapped each study's background information, how the different disorders were addressed, how ECAs and users could interact with one another, methodological aspects, and the study's aims and outcomes.
   Results: This study included N=54 publications (N=49 studies). More than half of the studies (n=26) focused on autism treatment, and ECAs were used most often for social skills training (n=23). Applications ranged from simple reinforcement of social behaviors through emotional expressions to sophisticated multimodal conversational systems. Most applications (n=43) were still in the development and piloting phase, that is, not yet ready for routine practice evaluation or application. Few studies conducted controlled research into clinical effects of ECAs, such as a reduction in symptom severity.
   Conclusions: ECAs for mental disorders are emerging. State-of-the-art techniques, involving, for example, communication through natural language or nonverbal behavior, are increasingly being considered and adopted for psychotherapeutic interventions in ECA research with promising results. However, evidence on their clinical application remains scarce. At present, their value to clinical practice lies mostly in the experimental determination of critical human support factors. In the context of using ECAs as an adjunct to existing interventions with the aim of supporting users, important questions remain with regard to the personalization of ECAs' interaction with users, and the optimal timing and manner of providing support. To increase the evidence base with regard to Internet interventions, we propose an additional focus on low-tech ECA solutions that can be rapidly developed, tested, and applied in routine practice.

AB It is often taken for granted that social/cultural learning increases human adaptability, because it allows us to acquire useful information without costly individual learning by trial and error. Rogers [Am. Anthropol. 90 (1988) 819] challenged this common view by a simple analytic model. Assuming a "cultural" population composed of individual learners engaging in costly information search and imitators who just copy another member's behavior, Rogers showed that mean fitness of such a mixed "cultural" population at the evolutionary equilibrium is exactly identical to the mean fitness of an "acultural" population consisting only of individual learners. Rogers's result implies that no special adaptive advantage accrues from social/cultural learning. We revisited this counterintuitive argument through use of an experiment with human subjects, and by a series of evolutionary computer simulations that extended Kameda and Nakanishi [Evol. Hum. Behav. 23 (2002) 373]. The simulation results indicated that, if agents can switch between individual learning and imitation selectively, a "cultural" population indeed outperforms an "acultural" population in mean fitness for a broad range of parameters. An experiment that implemented a nonstationary uncertain environment in a laboratory setting provided empirical support for this thesis. Implications of these findings for cultural capacities and some future directions are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB We examine the costs and benefits of nongovernmental organization (NGO) networking using a complex systems approach and agent-based modeling to simulate the effects of NGOs' efforts to seek influence in policy making at home and abroad. We elaborate on the boomerang model developed by Keck and Sikkink and uncover macro-level effects of multiple NGOs networking for policy influence in multiple states around multiple positions on the same issue simultaneously. The results of our model and simulations lead us to argue that the boomerang effect has interesting unexplored implications for NGO behavior and state policy worthy of further empirical testing. We find that networking is necessary for NGOs to change state policy but leads to a higher likelihood of organizational collapse for NGOs. Although networking leads to policy change, as is well demonstrated within existing literature, our model suggests that efficacy comes at a cost to NGOs, which should make analysts and academics more ambivalent about the advisability of NGO networking.

AB The inertial cavitation (IC) activity of ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) plays an important role in the development and improvement of ultrasound diagnostic and therapeutic applications. However, various diagnostic and therapeutic applications have different requirements for IC characteristics. Here through IC dose quantifications based on passive cavitation detection, IC thresholds were measured for two commercialized UCAs, albumin-shelled KangRun (R) and lipid-shelled SonoVue (R) microbubbles, at varied UCA volume concentrations (viz., 0.125 and 0.25 vol. %) and acoustic pulse lengths (viz., 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cycles). Shell elastic and viscous coefficients of UCAs were estimated by fitting measured acoustic attenuation spectra with Sarkar's model. The influences of sonication condition (viz., acoustic pulse length) and UCA shell properties on IC threshold were discussed based on numerical simulations. Both experimental measurements and numerical simulations indicate that IC thresholds of UCAs decrease with increasing UCA volume concentration and acoustic pulse length. The shell interfacial tension and dilatational viscosity estimated for SonoVue (0.76 +/- 0.11 N/m, 6.5 +/- 1.01 x 10(-8) kg/s) are smaller than those of KangRun (1.05 +/- 0.18 N/m, 1.66 +/- 0.38 x 10(-7) kg/s); this might result in lower IC threshold for SonoVue. The current results will be helpful for selecting and utilizing commercialized UCAs for specific clinical applications, while minimizing undesired IC-induced bioeffects.

AB Econophysics and economy simulations claim to have demonstrated that the repartition of wealth in every economic system always occur in a very inegalitarian mathematical law, called the Pareto law. As this inegalitarian repartition is a cause of many problems in the world, it would be interesting to find a remedy. We can note that the econophysic studies always start from the hypothesis as what economy systems are formed only of agents perfectly egocentric, each seeking only to gather the maximum of wealth for himself. Should the Pareto law come only of this limiting hypothesis? And if agents had other types of behaviours, for instance altruistic? This study is based on a simple simulation where we can program various rates of altruism and egocentrism. Really we can check that a much more egalitarian repartition appears, even with a relatively low rate of altruism (15%). More so, this egalitarian repartition occurs according to a completely different law from that of Pareto: a Gauss law, a bell curve. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB By adding a polymeric -nucleating agent (acrylonitrile-styrene copolymer, SAN), in situ microfibril reinforced isotactic polypropylene (iPP)/SAN blend parts with high contents of -form crystals and transcrystals were molded via water-assisted injection molding (WAIM). Thanks to the unique stress and temperature fields occurring during the WAIM, SAN microfibers formed across the whole residual wall of iPP/SAN blend parts with relatively large thickness. Numerical simulations on high-pressure water penetration and cooling stages of the WAIM were carried out to reveal the stress and temperature fields. Comprehensive analysis of both experimental and simulated results showed that not only the shear flow field but also elongational flow field occurring during the WAIM was responsible for the formation of SAN microfibers and unique crystal morphology distribution in the WAIM iPP/SAN blend part. Moreover, during the WAIM, the high cooling rate also played an important role in the formation of both phase and crystal morphologies. The preferential formation of transcrystals in the inner layer of WAIM iPP/SAN blend part could be ascribed to the strong elongation, rather than the strong shear. It was believed that the quantification of stress and temperature fields of the WAIM via numerical simulation could provide a guidence for molding high-performance products. POLYM. ENG.

AB Social sciences have discussed the governance of complex systems for a long time. The following paper tackles the issue by means of experimental sociology, in order to investigate the performance of different modes of governance empirically. The simulation framework developed is based on Esser's model of sociological explanation as well as on Kroneberg's model of frame selection. The performance of governance has been measured by means of three macro and two micro indicators. Surprisingly, central control mostly performs better than decentralised coordination. However, results not only depend on the mode of governance, but there is also a relation between performance and the composition of actor populations, which has yet not been investigated sufficiently.Practitioner Summary: Practitioners can gain insights into the functioning of complex systems and learn how to better manage them. Additionally, they are provided with indicators to measure the performance of complex systems.

TI Emotional bookkeeping and differentiated affiliative relationships:
   Exploring the role of dynamics and speed in updating relationship
   quality in the EMO-model
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Emotional bookkeeping is the process by which primates integrate the emotional effects of social interactions to form internal representations of their affiliative relationships. The dynamics and speed of this process, which comprises the formation, maintenance and fading out of affiliative relationships, are not clear. Empirical data suggest that affiliative relationships are slowly formed and do not easily fade out. The EMO-model, an agent-based model designed to simulate the social life of primates capable of emotional bookkeeping, was used to explore the effects of different types of internal relationship dynamics and speeds of increase and decrease of relationship strength. In the original EMO-model the internal dynamics involves a fast built-up of a relationship independent of its current quality, alongside a relatively fast fading out of relationship quality. Here we explore the effect of this original dynamics and an alternative dynamics more in line with empirical data, in combination with different speeds of internal relationship quality increase and decrease, on the differentiation and stability of affiliative relationships. The alternative dynamics leads to more differentiated and stable affiliative relationships than the original dynamics, especially when the speed with which internal relationship quality increases is low and the speed with which it decreases is intermediate. Consequently, individuals can groom different group members with varying frequency and support a rich social life with stable preferred partners and attention to several others. In conclusion, differentiated and stable affiliative relationships are especially formed when friends are not made too quickly and not forgotten too easily.

AB Simulation research has made some notable contributions in political science. This article describes a variety of simulation projects and points out the strengths and weaknesses of simulation in contrast with other methods of research. The strength of simulation research is that it is naturally suited to modeling projects that include a large number of autonomous, interacting agents. Statistical and formal methods of analysis have made contributions in these areas, but there is good reason to believe that simulation can go further. This point is explored in several contexts, including social choice theory, individual-level simulation models, international relations the prisoner's dilemma game, and more general agent-based models of multiperson interaction.

AB Climate change affects biophysical processes related to the transmission of many infectious diseases, with potentially adverse consequences for the health of communities. While our knowledge of biophysical associations between meteorological factors and disease is steadily improving, our understanding of the social processes that shape adaptation to environmental perturbations lags behind. Using computational modeling methods, we explore the ways in which social cohesion can affect adaptation of disease prevention strategies when communities are exposed to different environmental scenarios that influence transmission pathways for diseases such as diarrhea. We developed an agent-based model in which household agents can choose between two behavioral strategies that offer different levels of protection against environmentally mediated disease transmission. One behavioral strategy is initially set as more protective, leading households to adopt it widely, but its efficacy is sensitive to variable weather conditions and stressors such as floods or droughts that modify the disease transmission system. The efficacy of the second strategy is initially moderate relative to the first and is insensitive to environmental changes. We examined how social cohesion (defined as average number of household social network connections) influences health outcomes when households attempt to identify an optimal strategy by copying the behaviors of socially connected neighbors who seem to have adapted successfully in the past. Our simulation experiments suggest that high-cohesion communities are able to rapidly disseminate the initially optimal behavioral strategy compared to low-cohesion communities. This rapid and pervasive change, however, decreases behavioral diversity; i.e., once a high cohesion community settles on a strategy, most or all households adopt that behavior. Following environmental changes that reduce the efficacy of the initially optimal strategy, rendering it suboptimal relative to the alternative strategy, high-cohesion communities can fail to adapt. As a result, despite faring better early in the course of computational experiments, high-cohesion communities may ultimately experience worse outcomes. In the face of uncertainty in predicting future environmental stressors due to climate change, strategies to improve effective adaptation to optimal disease prevention strategies should balance between intervention efforts that promote protective behaviors based on current scientific understanding and the need to guard against the crystallization of inflexible norms. Developing generalizable models allows us to integrate a wide range of theories and multiple datasets pertaining to the relationship between social mechanisms and adaptation, which can provide further understanding of future climate change impacts. Models such as the one we present can generate hypotheses about the mechanisms that underlie the dynamics of adaptation events and suggest specific points of measurement to assess the impact of these mechanisms. They can be incorporated as modules within predictive simulations for specific socio-ecological contexts.

AB Proliferative enteropathy, caused by Lawsonia intracellularis, represents a threat for swine industry. Current vaccines are effective but difficult to obtain and scaled up, because of demanding bacterial culture conditions. In this work, a subunit vaccine candidate against L intracellularis was developed and its efficacy was evaluated in vivo, alone or co-formulated with pig recombinant IFN-alpha.
   The vaccine formulation contains three chimeric antigens: two outer membrane proteins and a secreted one, which were engineered by adding T epitopes using bioinformatics tools. After simultaneously expressing the three antigens in E. coli, its immunogenicity was tested in mice and pigs. Antigens co-formulated with porcine IFN-alpha were also assayed in the last species. Immune response was assessed by ELISA and qPCR, and histopathological studies of intestinal epithelial tissue were performed after challenge.
   Mice and pigs showed an increased IgG response against chimeric antigens. Particularly, there were significant differences in the antibody response when porcine IFN-alpha was co-administrated with L intracellularis antigens. Besides, mRNAs from il12 and cd4 marker were detected during the first week after immunization of pigs, suggesting a Th1-type cellular immune response. The significant enhancement of oast gene expression indicates the effect exerted by porcine IFN-alpha. Post-mortem histopathological analysis post-challenge revealed damage only into epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract from animals of the negative control group. Injuries were related to atrophy of the intestinal villi, where a decrease of globet cells and a greater migration of lymphocytes were observed.
   Overall, our results demonstrated that the vaccine candidate elicited significant humoral and cellular immune responses. Besides, histopathological analysis suggested that vaccinated animals were protected against experimental L. intracellularis infection. This research constitutes a step forward to the generation of the first recombinant chimeric vaccine against L. intracellularis, representing a faster, easier and cost effective approach to counteract the porcine proliferative enteropathy.

AB With the urgent need to provide an efficient and reliable protection for people from fatal chemical and biological weapons, our fundamental understanding of how toxins interact with filters is far from complete. The situation is further complicated by natural difficulties of performing experimental measurements with lethal toxins. Unlike experiments, computational modeling offers an attractive and safe yet reliable way of studying behavior of toxic agents on a variety of substrates at a great level of detail. Here, we report DFT-based quantum-chemical calculations of adsorption and decomposition of DMMP, sarin and soman on MoO2 (011) surface. Our calculations show that MoO2 strongly adsorbs toxic nerve agents and quickly decomposes them.
   Decomposition of DMMP on the MoO2 (011) surface proceeds via the PO-CH3 bond breaking and a formation of a surface methoxy group. The calculated activation barrier for this reaction is 131.5 kJ mol(-1). Unlike DMMP, decomposition of sarin and soman proceeds via the dealkylation reaction yielding propene and 3,3-dimethyl-1-butene, respectively. Decomposition of sarin requires a remarkably low energy (53.7 kJ mol(-1)), whereas the similar reaction in soman requires 50 kJ mol(-1) more energy. We also make specific predictions to guide Ambient-Pressure X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (APXPS) experiments on sarin interaction with MoO2 samples. We conclude that MoO2 serves as an efficient substrate able of degrading toxins.

AB The choices of policy targets and the formation of agents' expectation have been critical issues for reconsidering monetary policy management since 2008. The purpose of this article is to evaluate macroeconomic stability in a New Keynesian open economy in which agents experience cognitive limitations. The (im)perfect credibility of various monetary policies (e.g., a Taylor-type rule, strict domestic inflation targeting, strict CPI inflation targeting, exchange rate peg) may lead agents to react according to their expectation rules, and then create various degrees of booms and busts in output and inflation. Therefore, relaxation of the rational expectation hypothesis has potential consequences for policy designs. Our simulations confirm that the business cycles induced by animal spirits are enhanced by strict inflation targeting. Furthermore, a Taylor-type (CPI or domestic inflation) rule or a credible exchange rate pegging system can improve social welfare and stability in an open economy.

AB Anthropogenic pressures increasingly alter natural systems. Therefore, understanding the resilience of agent-based complex systems such as ecosystems, i.e. their ability to absorb these pressures and sustain their functioning and services, is a major challenge. However, the mechanisms underlying resilience are still poorly understood. A main reason for this is the multidimensionality of both resilience, embracing the three fundamental stability properties recovery, resistance and persistence, and of the specific situations for which stability properties can be assessed. Agent-based models (ABM) complement empirical research which is, for logistic reasons, limited in coping with these multiple dimensions. Besides their ability to integrate multidimensionality through extensive manipulation in a fully controlled system, ABMs can capture the emergence of system resilience from individual interactions and feedbacks across different levels of organization. To assess the extent to which this potential of ABMs has already been exploited, we reviewed the state of the art in exploring resilience and its multidimensionality in ecological and socio-ecological systems with ABMs. We found that the potential of ABMs is not utilized in most models, as they typically focus on a single dimension of resilience by using variability as a proxy for persistence, and are limited to one reference state, disturbance type and scale. Moreover, only few studies explicitly test the ability of different mechanisms to support resilience. To overcome these limitations, we recommend to simultaneously assess multiple stability properties for different situations and under consideration of the mechanisms that are hypothesised to render a system resilient. This will help us to better exploit the potential of ABMs to understand and quantify resilience mechanisms, and hence support solving real-world problems related to the resilience of agent-based complex systems.

AB Knowledge diffusion models typically involve two main features: an underlying social network topology on one side, and a particular design of interaction rules driving knowledge transmission on the other side. Acknowledging the need for realistic topologies and adoption behaviors backed by empirical measurements, it becomes unclear how accurately existing models render real-world phenomena: if indeed both topology and transmission mechanisms have a key impact on these phenomena, to which extent does the use of more or less stylized assumptions affect modeling results? In order to evaluate various classical topologies and mechanisms, we push the comparison to more empirical benchmarks: real-world network structures and empirically measured mechanisms. Special attention is paid to appraising the discrepancy between diffusion phenomena (i) on some real network topologies vs. various kinds of scale-free networks, and (ii) using an empirically-measured transmission mechanism, compared with canonical appropriate models such as threshold models. We find very sensible differences between the more realistic settings and their traditional stylized counterparts. On the whole, our point is thus also epistemological by insisting that models should be tested against simulation-based empirical benchmarks.

AB At the Leipzig Aerosol Cloud Interaction Simulator (LACIS) experiments investigating homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation of ice (particularly immersion freezing in the latter case) have been carried out. Here both the physical LACIS setup and the numerical model developed to design experiments at LACIS and interpret their results are presented in detail.
   Combining results from the numerical model with experimental data, it was found that for the experimental parameter space considered, classical homogeneous ice nucleation theory is able to predict the freezing behavior of highly diluted ammonium sulfate solution droplets, while classical heterogeneous ice nucleation theory, together with the assumption of a constant contact angle, fails to predict the immersion freezing behavior of surrogate mineral dust particles (Arizona Test Dust, ATD). The main reason for this failure is the compared to experimental data apparently overly strong temperature dependence of the nucleation rate coefficient.
   Assuming, in the numerical model, Classical Nucleation Theory (CNT) for homogeneous ice nucleation and a CNT-based parameterization for the nucleation rate coefficient in the immersion freezing mode, recently published by our group, it was found that even for a relatively effective ice nucleating agent such as pure ATD, there is a temperature range where homogeneous ice nucleation is dominant. The main explanation is the apparently different temperature dependencies of the two freezing mechanisms. Finally, reviewing the assumptions made during the derivation of the CNT-based parameterization for immersion freezing, it was found that the assumption of constant temperature during ice nucleation and the chosen ice nucleation time were justified, underlining the applicability of the method to determine the fitting coefficients in the parameterization equation.

ID CONSENSUS; DYNAMICS
AB In the Deffuant model for social influence, pairs of adjacent agents interact at a constant rate and mix up their opinions (represented by continuous variables) only if the distance between opinions is short according to a threshold. We derive a critical threshold for the Deffuant model on Z, above which the opinions converge toward the average value of the initial opinion distribution with probability one, provided the initial distribution has a finite second order moment. We demonstrate our theoretical results by performing extensive numerical simulations on some continuous probability distributions including uniform, Beta, power-law and normal distributions. Noticed is a clear differentiation of convergence rate that unimodal opinions (regardless of being biased or not) achieve consensus much faster than even or polarized opinions. Hereby, the emergence of a single mainstream view is a prominent feature giving rise to fast consensus in public opinion formation and social contagious behavior. Finally, we discuss the Deffuant model on an infinite Cayley tree, through which general network architectures might be factored in. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 19: 38-49, 2013

AB PurposeThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the retention of two-piece computer-aided design (CAD)/computer aided manufacturing (CAM) zirconia abutments after artificial aging under simulated oral conditions using three different types of resin-based luting agents.
   Material and MethodsTwenty-one CAD/CAM-generated zirconia copings (CERCON Compartis, Degudent, Hanau, Germany) were bonded to a prefabricated secondary titanium implant insert (XiVE Ti-Base, Dentsply Friadent, Mannheim, Germany), using three different types of resin-based luting agents: group A: Panavia 21 (Kuraray Co, Kurashiki, Japan); group B: Multilink Implant (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein); and group C: SmartCem2 (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany). The bonding surfaces of the titanium inserts and the zirconia ceramic copings were air-abraded and cleaned in alcohol. All specimens were stored in distilled water for 60 days and subsequently thermal-cycled 15,000 times (5-55 degrees C). The dislodging force of the copings along the long axis of the implant/abutment complex was recorded using a universal testing machine with 2mm/min crosshead speed. Data were analyzed descriptively and by performing the Kruskal-Wallis test.
   ResultsThe mean retention values were 924.93363.31N for Panavia 21, 878.05 +/- 208.33N for Multilink Implant, and 650.77 +/- 174.92N for SmartCem2. The Kruskal-Wallis test indicated no significant difference between the retention values of the tested luting agents (p=0.1314). The failure modes of all tested two-piece abutments were completely adhesive, leaving the detached zirconia coping and titanium insert undamaged.
   ConclusionThe use of resin-based luting agents in combination with air abrasion of titanium inserts and zirconia copings led to a stable retention of two-piece CAD/CAM abutments. The bonding stability of the investigated luting agents exceeded the general limits of fracture resistance of two-piece zirconia abutments. A notable difference between the mean retention values of the tested bond materials was shown. However, the statistical analysis revealed that this difference was not significant.

AB We discuss two models of opinion dynamics. We first present a brief review of the Hegselmann and Krause (HK) compromise model in two dimensions, showing that it is possible to simulate the dynamics in the limit of an infinite number of agents by solving numerically a rate equation for a continuum distribution of opinions. Then, we discuss the Opinion Changing Rate (OCR) model, which allows to study under which conditions a group of agents with a different natural tendency (rate) to change opinion can find the agreement. In the context of the this model, consensus is viewed as a synchronization process.

AB Background. Pertussis control remains a challenge due to recently observed effects of waning immunity to acellular vaccine and suboptimal vaccine coverage. Multiple outbreaks have been reported in different ages worldwide. For certain outbreaks, public health authorities can launch an outbreak response immunization (OM) campaign to control pertussis spread. We investigated effects of an outbreak response immunization targeting young adolescents in averting pertussis cases.
   Methods. We developed an agent-based model for pertussis transmission representing disease mechanism, waning immunity, vaccination schedule and pathogen transmission in a spatially-explicit 500,000-person contact network representing a typical Canadian Public Health district. Parameters were derived from literature and calibration. We used published cumulative incidence and dose-specific vaccine coverage to calibrate the model's epidemiological curves. We endogenized outbreak response by defining thresholds to trigger simulated immunization campaigns in the 10-14 age group offering 80% coverage. We ran paired simulations with and without outbreak response immunization and included those resulting in a single ORI within a 10-year span. We calculated the number of cases averted attributable to outbreak immunization campaign in all ages, in the 10-14 age group and in infants. The count of cases averted were tested using Mann Whitney U test to determine statistical significance. Numbers needed to vaccinate during immunization campaign to prevent a single case in respective age groups were derived from the model. We varied adult vaccine coverage, waning immunity pararneters, immunization campaign eligibility and tested stronger vaccination boosting effect in sensitivity analyses.
   Results. 189 qualified paired-runs were analyzed. On average, ORI was triggered every 26 years. On a per-run basis, there were an average of 124, 243 and 429 pertussis cases averted across all age groups within 1, 3 and 10 years of a campaign, respectively. During the same time periods, 53, 96, and 163 cases were averted in the 10-14 age group, and 6, 11, 20 in infants under 1 (p < 0.001, all groups). Numbers needed to vaccinate ranged from 49 to 221, from 130 to 519 and from 1,031 to 4,903 for all ages, the 10-14 age group and for infants, respectively. Most sensitivity analyses resulted in minimal impact on a number of cases averted.
   Discussion. Our model generated 30 years of longitudinal data to evaluate effects of outbreak response immunization in a controlled study. Immunization campaign implemented as an outbreak response measure among adolescents may confer benefits across all ages accruing over a 10-year period. Our inference is dependent on having an outbreak of significant magnitude affecting predominantly the selected age and achieving a comprehensive vaccine coverage during the campaign. Economic evaluations and comparisons with other control measures can add to conclusions generated by our work.

AB Renewable energy resources and energy-efficient technologies, as well as building retrofitting, are only some of the possible strategies that can achieve more sustainable cities and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Subsidies and incentives are often provided by governments to increase the number of people adopting these sustainable energy efficiency actions. However, actual sales of green products are currently not as high as would be desired. The present paper applies a hybrid agent-based model (ABM) integrated with a Geographic Information System (GIS) to simulate a complex socio-economic-architectural adaptive system to study the temporal diffusion and the willingness of inhabitants to adopt photovoltaic (PV) systems. The San Salvario neighborhood in Turin (Italy) is used as an exemplary case study for testing consumer behavior associated with this technology, integrating social network theories, opinion formation dynamics and an adaptation of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Data/characteristics for both buildings and people are explicitly spatialized with the level of detail at the block scale. Particular attention is given to the comparison of the policy mix for supporting decision-makers and policymakers in the definition of the most efficient strategies for achieving a long-term vision of sustainable development. Both variables and outcomes accuracy of the model are validated with historical real-world data.

AB Achieving efficient and reliable self-organization in groups of autonomous robots is a fundamental challenge in swarm robotics. Even simple states of collective motion, such as group translation or rotation, require nontrivial algorithms, sensors, and actuators to be achieved in real-world scenarios. We study here the capabilities and limitations in controlling experimental robot swarms of a decentralized control algorithm that only requires information on the positions of neighboring agents, and not on their headings. Using swarms of e-Puck robots, we implement this algorithm in experiments and show its ability to converge to self-organized collective translation or rotation, starting from a state with random orientations. Through a simple analytical calculation, we also unveil an essential limitation of the algorithm that produces small persistent oscillations of the aligned state, related to its marginal stability. By comparing predictions and measurements, we compute the experimental noise distributions of the linear and angular robot speeds, showing that they are well described by Gaussian functions. We then implement simulations that model this noise by adding Gaussian random variables with the experimentally measured standard deviations. These simulations are performed for multiple parameter combinations and compared to experiments, showing that they provide good predictions for the expected speed and robustness of the self-organizing dynamics.

AB Task allocation is a critical phase of project management. Tree-type structures are frequently used constraints to obtain a pertinent task allocation. They can illustrate where one task may require numerous agents and when an agent can be assigned to different tasks (roles). The process of task allocation is made more complex when administrators need to satisfy sequential and fixed branch relationships between/among tasks (roles). This paper formalizes the tree-structured task allocation problem (TSTAP) with group multirole assignment (GMRA) and proves necessary conditions, the necessary and sufficient condition, as well as sufficient conditions, of TSTAP. The formalization makes it easy to find a solution with the IBM ILOG CPLEX optimization package (CPLEX). The necessary conditions improve the CPLEX solution by eliminating infeasible cases. The necessary and sufficient condition describes the solution space of TSTAP completely. Another exciting result is that the sufficient conditions can not only improve the CPLEX solution by describing a practical approximate solution space but also help decision-makers and human resource officers organize a team in order to successfully assign tasks. The proposed approach is verified by simulation experiments with respect to a real-world problem. The experimental results present the practicability of the proposed solutions in this paper. This paper was motivated by general cooperative projects whose tasks have tree-structured relationships. This can make the problem of successful multitask assignment extremely challenging. The traditional method of assignment such as the KM algorithm can no longer solve this problem. To solve the assignment problem with tree-structured relationships, an efficient many-to-many assignment with constraints is required. The proposed approach provides theoretical and technical foundations for efficient assignment of TSTA, which can not only provide a viable and effective assignment scheme for TSTA problems but also help human resource officers to formulate reasonable plans according to the relationships between/among tasks.

AB The DNA of some naturally competent species of bacteria contains it large number of evenly distributed copies of a short sequence. This highly overrepresented sequence is believed to be an uptake signal sequence (USS) that helps bacteria to take up DNA selectively from (dead) members of their own species. For some time it has been assumed that the USS evolved in order to enable bacteria to distinguish between conspecific and non-conspecific DNNA fragments (the preference-first hypothesis). Recently, Redfield Suggested that this hypothesis is not in fact realistic,,is it would require biologically implausible group selection. In this article we present a model designed to demonstrate the emergence Of similar USSs in a population of simulated evolving agents. We use this Model to examine the conditions Under which a USS will emerge in a preference-first scenario.

AB The aim of the present study is to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of two antiglaucomatous substances, regardless of their hypotensive effect in the eye. Brimonidine, which does not reduce IOP when administered intraperitoneally, and latanoprost, which has a renowned hypotensive effect topically. We examined rat retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival and size distribution in experimental glaucoma in response to different glaucomatous agents. IOP was elevated by episcleral vein cauterization (EVC) prior to the application of different treatments: (I) PBS application (control group), (II) intraperitoneal administration of brimonidine (a general hypotensive agent), (III) topical application of latanoprost(an ocular hypotensive agent), and (IV) latanoprost combined with brimonidine. After 12 weeks, RGCs were retrogradely labeled with fluorogold and RGC density was analyzed. EVC caused a significant increase (42%) in IOP in each group before drug treatment. After 12 weeks of EVC, RGC survival in control vs. EVC rats was 78.9 +/- 3.2%. No IOP reduction was observed in brimonidine injected rats, but RGC survival at 12 weeks was total (103.7 +/- 2.7%). In latanoprost treated rats, IOP dropped by around 22% and 94.7 +/- 3.7% of the RGC population survived. Finally in the latanoprost + brimonidine combined group, IOP was significantly reduced by 25% and 94.4 +/- 2.2% of RGCs survived. Surprisingly, whereas EVC led to a 6% increase in RGC soma size, brimonidine treatment was associated with a 9% reduction in the soma size of RGCs at 12 weeks. We conclude that brimonidine exerts a neuroprotective effect via a mechanism which is independent of IOP reduction. These findings indicate that cell survival in glaucoma may be enhanced by neuroprotective strategies which are independent of IOP reduction. No synergistic neuroprotective effect was observed when both treatments were applied simultaneously. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We demonstrate by mathematical analysis and systematic computer simulations that redistribution can lead to sustainable growth in a society. In accordance with economic models of risky human capital, we assume that dynamics of human capital is modeled as a multiplicative stochastic process which, in the long run, leads to the destruction of individual human capital. When agents are linked by fully redistributive taxation the situation might turn to individual growth in the long run. We consider that a government collects a proportion of income and reduces it by a fraction as costs for administration (efficiency losses). The remaining public good is equally redistributed to all agents. Sustainable growth is induced by redistribution despite the losses from the random growth process and despite administrative costs. Growth results from a portfolio effect. The findings are verified for three different tax schemes: proportional tax, taking proportionally more from the rich, and proportionally more from the poor. We discuss which of these tax schemes performs better with respect to maximize growth under a fixed rate of administrative costs, and the governmental income. This leads us to general conclusions about governmental decisions, the relation to public good games with free riding, and the function of taxation in a risk-taking society.

AB The natural polyphenol resveratrol and its analogue piceatannol have various beneficial effects including antiarrhythmic properties. The aim of the present study was to examine potential electrophysiologic effects in an experimental whole-heart model of atrial fibrillation (AF). Simultaneous infusion of resveratrol (50 mu mol/L) or piceatannol (10 mu mol/L) in rabbit hearts resulted in an increase in atrial refractory period. Both agents induced a significant slowing of atrial conduction and of intrinsic heart rate. In both groups, a trend toward a reduction in AF and a regularization of AF was observed.

ID AUTOCORRELATION STATISTICS; EARLY HOMO; PROTOCOL; DIET
AB The HOMINIDS ABM is a new Agent Based Model that simulates the actions of two species of proto-human agents defined by a few, simple parameters. These proto-human agents attempt to subsist by foraging and nesting on dynamic, spatially explicit landscapes. The landscapes are described with a number of parameters based on empirical field data collected in habitats in East Africa. The results of three separate scenarios with 1 year model runs repeated 30 times each, for a total of 90 simulations, are presented and discussed to illustrate both the capacity and flexibility of our ABM modeling environment. The simulations show that the model food preferences and anatomy ascribed to Australopithecus boisei resulted in different expressions of foraging behaviors and subsistence strategies in two distinct ecological settings, and that adding tubers to the diet significantly increases the chances of the hominid agents meeting their daily caloric requirements year-round. In addition, this paper provides links to the open-source implementation code, along with the user documentation, design document, java API, and all datasets required to replicate the simulations.

AB Both in vitro and in vivo, contrast agent microbubbles move near bounding surfaces, such as the wall of an experimental container or the wall of a blood vessel. This problem inspires interest in theoretical models that predict the effect of a wall on the dynamics of a contrast microbubble. There are models for a bubble at a large distance from a wall and for a bubble adherent to a wall. The aim of the present study is to develop a generalized model that describes the dynamics of a contrast microbubble at arbitrary distances from a wall and thereby make it possible to simulate the acoustic response of the bubble starting from large separation distances up to contact between the bubble and the wall. The wall is assumed to be a plane. Therefore, the developed model applies for in vitro investigations of contrast agents in experimental containers. It can also be used as a first approximation to the case of a contrast microbubble within a large blood vessel. The derivation of the model is based on the multipole expansion of the bubble velocity potential, the image source method, and the Lagrangian formalism. The model consists of two coupled equations, one of which describes the bubble radial oscillation and the second describes the translation of the bubble center. Numerical simulations are performed to determine how the acoustic response of a contrast microbubble depends on the separation distance near walls of different types: rigid, plastic, arterial, etc. The dynamics of the bubble encapsulation is described by the Marmottant shell model. The properties of the plastic wall correspond to OptiCell chambers commonly used in experiments. The results of the simulations show that the bubble resonance frequency near a wall depends on both the separation distance and the wall material properties. In particular, the rigid wall makes the resonance frequency decrease with decreasing separation distance, whereas in the vicinity of the OptiCell wall and the arterial wall, the resonance frequency increases. The theoretical model is validated by comparing with experimental data available in the literature for phospholipid-shelled microbubbles near a compliant agarose gel boundary. The comparison is conducted for two data sets. In the first case, the simulated and measured parameters of the bubble acoustic response (resonance frequency and maximum amplitude of the scattered pressure) are compared as a function of bubble diameter, using the experimental data obtained for bubbles with diameters ranging from 2.3 to 4 mu m, insonified at 30 kPa in the frequency range from 4 to 13.5 MHz. In the second case, the simulated and measured values of the maximum amplitude of the scattered pressure are compared as a function of separation distance from the agarose boundary, using the experimental data for a 2.3 mu m-diameter bubble insonicated at 69 kPa and 11 MHz. In both cases, the theoretical model correctly predicts the qualitative tendency in the behavior of the measured quantities and their quantitative level.

DT Article
DE meritocracy; performance measurement; serendipity; agent-based modelling
ID FEEDBACK; INFORMATION; INEQUALITY
AB In the name of meritocracy, modern economies devote increasing amounts of resources to quantifying and ranking the performance of individuals and organizations. Rankings send out powerful signals, which lead to identifying the actions of top performers as the 'best practices' that others should also adopt. However, several studies have shown that the imitation of best practices often leads to a drop in performance. So, should those lagging behind in a ranking imitate top performers or should they instead pursue a strategy of their own? I tackle this question by numerically simulating a stylized model of a society whose agents seek to climb a ranking either by imitating the actions of top performers or by randomly trying out different actions, i.e. via serendipity. The model gives rise to a rich phenomenology, showing that the imitation of top performers increases welfare overall, but at the cost of higher inequality. Indeed, the imitation of top performers turns out to be a self-defeating strategy that consolidates the early advantage of a few lucky- and not necessarily talented-winners, leading to a very unequal, homogenized and effectively non-meritocratic society. Conversely, serendipity favours meritocratic outcomes and prevents rankings from freezing.

AB The paper studies the evolution of coordination in a local interaction model where agents can simultaneously choose the strategy to play in the game and the size of their neighborhood. We focus on pure-coordination games played by agents located on one-dimensional lattices and we assume that network externalities become eventually negative as neighborhood sizes increase. We show that the society almost always converges to a steady-state characterized by high levels of coordination and small neighborhood sizes. We find that neighborhood adjustment allows for higher coordination than if interaction structures were static and that large populations attain higher coordination provided that average initial neighborhood sizes are not too small.

AB The animals' reactivity and the levels of experimental anxiety during pregnancy and lactation in female rats were studied using the burying behavior test. The three main parameters analyzed in this test were: the cumulative burying behavior, the burying behavior latency, and the number of shocks necessary for displaying the behavior. The burying behavior was studied at the 7th, 14th, and 21st days of pregnancy and lactation. An additional group tested 12 h after parturition was also included. Simultaneously, in all animals, the ambulatory behavior was evaluated. All results were compared with those obtained in a control group of ovariectomized females. At the end of pregnancy a clear increase in burying behavior latency accompanied by a decrease in cumulative burying behavior was observed. Similarly, a clear reduction in burying behavior immediately after parturition was found. The number of shocks necessary for displaying the burying behavior were not modified along pregnancy and lactation with the exception of a clear decrease for the 7th lactation day. Changes in locomotor activity were observed at pregnancy, but not along lactation. These changes do not account for the reduction in burying behavior observed at the 14th gestation day. Data related to the reduction in burying behavior observed during gestation are discussed on the possible participation of progestins, while those found during lactation are discussed on the bases of the variations in serotonin and endorphins that normally occur during this period.

AB In space systems consisting of a large number of satellites, coordinating orbits among satellites is necessary throughout the entire mission lifetime. Although previous works mainly focused on the boundedness of relative motion between satellites in the group, in this paper, an extra degree of freedom is also addressed in order to manipulate an arbitrary number of orbital elements, which is represented as coordinating a general orbital transfer and an in-space assembly. The underlying concept is using consensus theory to characterize the properties of the control objective as in a multiagent system. To that end, this paper assumes that the communication in the networked satellite system is represented as an undirected graph, and then implements the governing system dynamics in a control-affine form as described by the Gauss's variational equations. For the general orbital transfer problem, an edge-error-based controller is developed and proven asymptotically stable. Definitions of error functions are also investigated to understand the behavior of developed controllers. Several strategies for assembly control are discussed, namely, via changing of variables or in a two-phase control process based on the dynamical structure. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the analysis and demonstrate the results.

AB Building occupancy simulation and estimation simulates the dynamics of occupants and estimates their real-time spatial distribution in a building. It requires a simulation model and an algorithm for data assimilation that assimilates real-time sensor data into the simulation model. Existing building occupancy simulation models include agent-based models and graph-based models. The agent-based models suffer high computation cost for simulating large numbers of occupants, and graph-based models overlook the heterogeneity and detailed behaviors of individuals. Recognizing the limitations of existing models, this paper presents a new graph-based agent-oriented model which can efficiently simulate large numbers of occupants in various kinds of building structures. To support real-time occupancy dynamics estimation, a data assimilation framework based on Sequential Monte Carlo Methods is also developed and applied to the graph-based agent-oriented model to assimilate real-time sensor data. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the developed model and the data assimilation framework. The major contributions of this work are to provide an efficient model for building occupancy simulation that can accommodate large numbers of occupants and an effective data assimilation framework that can provide real-time estimations of building occupancy from sensor data.

AB The sequence of physical improvement in self-built houses is replicated by a model of technology diffusion that addresses the inter-relation between spatial and social processes, and captures the dynamics of house upgrading in blocks located within informal development areas in Lima, Peru. Simulations generate accurate spatio-temporal descriptions that characterizes the actual dynamics at the block scale. Moreover, the separation of the spatial and social structures allows to relate upgraded, susceptible and delayed components of the social network with the number of consolidated houses in order to explore the adoption of upgrade conditions. These empirically based experiments have policy implications related to the timing of tailored intervention at micro-scale for current efforts related to providing property deeds and financial support for individuals located in informally developed areas in Lima.

AB Changes to the electroencephalogram (EEG) observed during general anesthesia are modeled with a physiological mean field theory of electrocortical activity. To this end a parametrization of the postsynaptic impulse response is introduced which takes into account pharmacological effects of anesthetic agents on neuronal ligand-gated ionic channels. Parameter sets for this improved theory are then identified which respect known anatomical constraints and predict mean firing rates and power spectra typically encountered in human subjects. Through parallelized simulations of the eight nonlinear, two-dimensional partial differential equations on a grid representing an entire human cortex, it is demonstrated that linear approximations are sufficient for the prediction of a range of quantitative EEG variables. More than 70 000 plausible parameter sets are finally selected and subjected to a simulated induction with the stereotypical inhaled general anesthetic isoflurane. Thereby 86 parameter sets are identified that exhibit a strong "biphasic" rise in total power, a feature often observed in experiments. A sensitivity study suggests that this "biphasic" behavior is distinguishable even at low agent concentrations. Finally, our results are briefly compared with previous work by other groups and an outlook on future fits to experimental data is provided.

AB Background: Depending on the site of irradiation, about 40-80% of patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) will experience nausea and/or vomiting. The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of ondansetronas as a single agent and with a combination to aprepitant on preventing RT-induced nausea and vomiting (RINV). Materials and Methods: In a clinical randomized controlled trial (from September 2010 to September 2011), conducted in Radiation Oncology Department of Seyed-al-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, 40 abdominopelvic malignancies cancer patients were allocated into two aliquots using block randomization of size. Patients in the first group (group I) received ondansetron alone while those patients in the remaining group (group II) received ondansetron and aprepitant. Then, developing of RINV and its severity and benefit of adding aprepitant to ondansetron, in comparison with ondansetron as a single drug therapy were evaluated. Results: The average age of the patients in group I was 61.15 +/- 12.27 years while in group II it was 50.1 +/- 13.27 years. No statistically significant gender differences were found between the two groups. In patients treated with ondansetron single drug therapy (group I), frequency and grade of RINV were significantly more than the group treated simultaneously by aprepitant and ondansetron (group II) (odds ratio [OR] = 21.2; P < 0.01). Compared with RT alone, the patients whom underwent RT along with chemotherapy showed lower probability of experiencing RINV (OR = 0.13; P < 0.05). Conclusion: The present study indicated a significant superiority of combination of ondansetron and aprepitant in management of RINV, in patients undergoing RT, compared to ondansetron as a single agent therapy. More accurate follow-up studies are needed for the evaluation of the efficacy of ondansetron with combination to aprepitant on preventing the RINV.

ID CAST RESTORATIONS; IMPROVE; CROWNS
AB Statement of problem. Despite careful procedures, master stone dies may be damaged during laboratory procedures. The dentist routinely adjusts castings because the marginal fit of casting is not as accurate as on the dies.
   Purpose. This study evaluated the technique of internal adjustment of castings with use of duplicated stone dies and a disclosing agent to improve marginal fit discrepancy.
   Material and methods. Thirty-two nickel-chromium copings were fabricated and simulated standard clinical and laboratory procedures with 2 variables: tooth preparation convergence angles of 6 and 18 degrees, with or without internal relief. Master stone dies and their duplicates were selected for coping construction and internal adjustment, respectively. A specimen positioning device was coupled with a Toolmakers microscope to allow reproducibility of measurements. Each coping was evaluated at 8 locations of its marginal perimeter, before and after internal adjustment.
   Results. Marginal fit discrepancy of copings were significantly reduced with an internal adjustment technique (mean > 52%) for all experimental groups. Tooth preparations with greater convergence and internally relieved castings recorded a better marginal fit.
   Conclusion. The casting internal adjustment technique with use of duplicated stone dies and a disclosing agent substantially reduced marginal fit discrepancy.

AB Cisplatin is an efficient anticancer drug against various types of cancers however, its usage involves side effects. We investigated the mechanisms of action of indole derivative, 2-(5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-N'-[(E)-(3-nitrophenyl) methylidene] acetohydrazide (MMINA) against anticancer drug (cisplatin) induced organ damage using a rodent model. MMINA treatment reversed Cisplatin-induced NO and malondialdehyde (MDA) augmentation while boosted the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD). The animals were divided into five groups (n=7). Group1: Control (Normal) group, Group 2: DMSO group, Group 3: cisplatin group, Group 4: cisplatin+MMINA group, Group 5: MMINA group. MMINA treatment normalized plasma levels of biochemical enzymes. We observed a significant decrease in CD4(+)COX-2, STAT3, and TNF-alpha cell population in whole blood after MMINA dosage. MMINA downregulated the expression of various signal transduction pathways regulating the genes involved in inflammation i.e. NF-kappa B, STAT-3, IL-1, COX-2, iNOS, and TNF-alpha. The protein expression of these regulatory factors was also downregulated in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain. In silico docking and dynamic simulations data were in agreement with the experimental findings. The physiochemical properties of MMINA predicted it as a good drug-like molecule and its mechanism of action is predictably through inhibition of ROS and inflammation.

AB Computer simulations are increasingly used within various fields of the social sciences, including analytical sociology and computational social science. However, the method has yet to fully find its place within critical realism, generally regarded as reductionist and methodological individualist and thus inadequate to the task of grasping the full and enigmatic complexity of social life. This article contributes to the discussion by suggesting an alternative approach to computer simulations in the social realm. Instead of representing reality, simulations are seen as a way of boosting abstraction by enabling us to isolate and study the effects of emergent mechanisms. The need for such tools is growing more urgent in an age characterized by rapid change and global networks of causal interrelation. Hence there is a need not only for new tools to deal with causal complexity within critical realism, but also for a critical realist perspective to fill the meta-theoretical vacuum on which the simulation approach is largely based. The approach developed here provides a challenge to the predominant ways in which simulations are utilized today, with increasingly sophisticated models aiming towards realistic representation on the basis of empirical data.

AB New leaching agents could lead to a reduction in ammonia nitrogen pollution and the supplementation of soil nutrients during in-situ mining. They could also result in the release of even more toxic heavy metals, which has an impact on the environment as well as human health. In this study, column leaching experiments were used to simulate in-situ leaching, and the leaching behavior and fractional changes of lead in weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore by different leaching agents were studied. The experimental results showed that the amount of lead that was leached followed the order of CLA (60% CaCl2 + 25% NH4Cl + 15% MgSO4) > (NH4)(2)SO4 > MgSO4. The lead leaching process was comprised of both an acceleration and deceleration stage that followed the first order kinetic model. The amount of Pb when using compound agent was the greatest most likely because of the presence of CI The soil heavy metal morphology test showed that the three leaching agents primarily leached acid extractable lead, and the compound leaching agent leached the greatest amount of acid extractable Pb, which mainly due to the presence of NH4Cl. The reducible fraction was enriched in the direction of migration of the leachate, which was due to the presence of SO42-. These results indicate that the introduction of leaching agents during the mining process pose a greater risk for the release of heavy metals and provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and remediation of heavy metal pollution in mining areas where new leaching agents were used.

AB Anti-cancer daunorubicin and etoposide drugs are mostly used in chemotherapy medicine to treat a wide variety of cancers. Many of the side effects and specific delivery to a target tissue are the main challenges of using chemotherapeutic agents. To avoid serious toxic side effects and improve treatment outcomes, functionalized carbon nanotubes (f-CNTs) are considered promising nano-carriers for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to cancerous cells. We examined the effects of -OH and -COO- groups on CNTs surface for absorption of two anticancer drugs including daunorubicin and etoposide using molecular dynamics simulation and experimental assays. To evaluate the absorption of each drug in each CNT, the complexes of drugs/CNTs in water were simulated separately. Theoretical investigation demonstrated that CNT-OH and CNT-COO- are more suitable for absorption of daunorubicin and etoposide, respectively. Experimental findings also confirmed molecular dynamics simulation results. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma

AB A person's epistemic goals sometimes clash with pragmatic ones. At times, rational agents will degrade the quality of their epistemic process in order to satisfy a goal that is knowledge-independent (for example, to gain status or at least keep the peace with friends.) This is particularly so when the epistemic quest concerns an abstract political or economic theory, where evidence is likely to be softer and open to interpretation. Before wide-scale adoption of the Internet, people sought out or stumbled upon evidence related to a proposition in a more random way. And it was difficult to aggregate the evidence of friends and other similar people to the exclusion of others, even if one had wanted to. Today, by contrast, the searchable Internet allows people to simultaneously pursue social and epistemic goals.
   This essay shows that the selection effect caused by a merging of social and epistemic activities will cause both polarization in beliefs and devaluation of expert testimony. This will occur even if agents are rational Bayesians and have moderate credences before talking to their peers. What appears to be rampant dogmatism could be just as well explained by the nonrandom walk in evidence-gathering. This explanation better matches the empirical evidence on how people behave on social media platforms. It also helps clarify why media outlets (not just the Internet platforms) might have their own pragmatic reasons to compromise their epistemic goals in today's competitive and polarized information market. Yet, it also makes policy intervention much more difficult, since we are unlikely to neatly separate individuals' epistemic goals from their social ones.

AB Compatible interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) based on diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and methacrylated diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (MADGEBA) in weight ratios of 100/0, 75/25, 50/50, 25/75 and 0/100 were blended and cured simultaneously by using dicumyl peroxide (DICUP) and hexahydrophthalic anhydride (HHPA) as curing agents. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was employed to investigate the intermolecular interactions and functional group changes. Viscosity increases during crosslinking were examined with a Brookfield viscometer. Curing exothermic peaks were studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The gel fractions of various IPN compositions were measured with a Soxhlet extractor. Samples thus prepared were checked for their compatibility by measuring glass transitions with DSC and damping peaks with rheometric dynamic spectroscopy (RDS). Experimental results revealed that good compatibility between components induced a network interlock, which subsequently resulted in incomplete cure of the IPN materials.

AB Using the computational fluid dynamic model based on the multiphase particle-in-cell approach, reactive gas-solid flows in a three-dimensional bubbling fluidised bed gasifier regarding coal gasification is simulated. The predicted results of gas components are firstly validated with experimental measurements. Subsequently, the dynamics (e.g. chord length, aspect ratio, velocity, volume) together with the essential thermal features (e.g. temperature, pressure, density, viscosity, conductivity, specific heat capacity) of mesoscale bubbles are explored. Bubbles in the central part of the gasifier have a large lateral chord length and volume. The restriction effect of the gasifier wall elongates the vertical chord length and enlarges the aspect ratio of bubbles close to the wall. The density and pressure of bubbles decrease along with the bed height, and the thermochemical properties of bubbles are strongly related to bubble temperature. A large content of the CO2 exists for those bubbles close to the bed surface. The gas velocity, operating pressure and gasifying agent obviously affect the bubble property, while the effects of inlet gas temperature and coal flow rate are relatively weak. The results obtained provide meaningful insight regarding the mesoscale structures involved in fluidised bed coal gasification. (C) 2021 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

AB Ellipticine and some of its derivatives are organic molecules with intense antitumor activity. In this work we report a semiempirical study on the electronic structure of ellipticine and some derivatives. Geometrical and spectroscopic aspects were investigated through the use of the well-known PM3 (Parametric Method 3) and ZINDO (Zerner's Intermediate Neglect of Differential Overlap) methods. Comparing PM3 and previously reported AM1 (Austin Method One) results, we found out that overall PM3 results are better. The ZINDO simulated absorption spectra compare well to the available experimental data. We have observed a very simple correlation between the dipole moment value (DM) and the antitumor activity. These results suggest a way to improve and design new antitumor ellipticine derivatives, as well as, to select promising molecules from untested groups. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Aggregation of many species of invertebrate is an example of a consensus decision, the success of which is central to survival. Personality is a stable form of behavioural diversity which has been observed in the aggregation process, but neither the reasons for its stability nor its effects on consensus decisions are well understood. By using an agent-based model of invertebrate aggregation, it is found that diverse personalities have only limited benefits to the experimental consensus decision-making process, but may have a more valuable role in natural settings. Importantly, although certain personalities may ostensibly have potential drawbacks at the individual level, such as choosing to rest in unfavourable places, all individuals are likely to benefit from maintaining a constant personality, which promotes group stability. These findings help to improve understanding of consensus decision-making and the prevalence of stable personality.

AB As a significant active safety technology towards fully autonomous driving, driver-automation co-piloting provides a new thinking for enhancing vehicle active safety and relieving driver's workload. However, the preview pattern divergence between driver and steering assistance system (SAS) may give rise to serious steering conflicts, which reduces driver's faith in SAS, cause him/her to turn off it, and even result in fatal traffic accidents. Focusing on mimicking the driver's steering behaviour, this paper proposes a human-like steering assistance scheme by adaptively varying the preview time and assistance gain of the SAS controller. Driver's preview behaviour of the road curvature is numerically identified using simulator tests along a multi-curves road, based on which a nominal preview-scheduled driver model is established. Based on the nominal driver model, a co-piloting system featuring human-like preview behaviour and a time-varying assistance penalty is proposed to formulate the steering torque-overlay dynamics of both agents in path-tracking. Next, a linear parameter varying (LPV)/H infinity controller satisfying pole placement is integrated to ensure the robustness and stability within the entire parameter space. This enables the steering assistance scheme to have a scheduled preview pattern like a human driver. Results of driving simulator experiment indicate that the proposed steering assistance scheme is able to mitigate driver-SAS conflicts and improve driver's path-tracking performance.

AB This work presents an extensive case study on modelling the DAX (Deutscher Aktienindex) index and United States Oil Fund (USO) exchange-traded fund (Etf) time series with the financial agent-based system learning financial agent-based simulator (L-FABS) that exploits simulated annealing as a learning method. The USO Etf time series is highly correlated with oil price behaviour, and the DAX index is based on the weighted and accumulated behaviour of the share prices of some of the largest companies traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. These two time series are driven by completely different economic factors and thus provide two diverse empirical settings to evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology. Our experimentation shows that a relatively simple computational representation of real financial markets is effective in capturing the overall behaviour of the time series with varying approximation levels while the prediction target is moved into the future. The reported experimental investigation of L-FABS shows that it is robust notwithstanding the learning method used and the data sets exploited. L-FABS indeed produced a relatively low approximation error in several settings even when evaluated with respect to other modelling approaches, for example, 0.88% and 1.61% errors on average for 1 day ahead experiments in, respectively, DAX index and USO Etf.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of dub cell secretory protein (CCSP), an endogenous modulator, in reducing pulmonary inflammation induced by sevoflurane following one-lung ventilation (OLV). Healthy Japanese white rabbits were randomly assigned to six groups: Sham-operated group (group S); respiratory management of OLV group (group O); OLV + sevoflurane treated group (group OF), club cells exfoliated + sham-operated group (group NA), dub cells exfoliated + OLV group (group NAO); and club cells exfoliated + OLV + sevoflurane treated group (group NAOF). At the end of the experimental observation, all animals in the different groups were sacrificed and lung injury was evaluated according to the lung wet/dry weight ratio and histological scoring system. Lung homogenates were harvested to detect the mRNA and protein expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (c-PLA(2)) and CCSP. The content of arachidonic acid was measured using an ELISA. Following OLV treatment, c-PLA(2) expression was increased, CCSP expression was decreased and lung injury scores were significantly increased. Sevoflurane inhalation in the OLV-treated group induced an upregulation of CCSP and a downregulation of c-PLA(2) expression. In the group NAO, in which the club cells were simultaneously exfoliated, OLV caused more severe lung damage and induced higher expression of c-PLA(2) compared with that in group O. However, sevoflurane inhalation reduced the extent of lung injury and the expression of c-PLA(2) even when the endogenous modulator of lung inflammation, CCSP, was exfoliated (group NAOF). These results indicated that OLV, promoted lung inflammation through the CCSP and c-PLA(2) pathway. However, the results from the club cells exfoliated group indicated that the CCSP may not be involved in the protective effect exerted by sevoflurane inhalation.

TI Assessment of wood utility poles' deterioration through natural

ID STRENGTH
AB Utility poles in a power distribution line are usually made of prestressed concrete, reinforced concrete or wood. In Latin America, given the abundance of different species of wood suitable for structural purposes, the latter material is more commonly used. The durability of wood in structures exposed to meteorological agents is usually an issue, especially when these have a critical role in the operation of industries or when the structures provide a service to society. For this reason, it is convenient to develop simple techniques that allow the assessment of the damage during their service life. In this paper, results obtained experimentally are contrasted with the outcomes of finite element models, taking deterministic property values of the material and simulating the same load state of the test. The correlation between the degree deterioration of wood poles and their dynamic behavior taking into account defects such as cracks, knots and others, was evaluated. The wood used in the experiments is Eucalyptus grandis, a species that is widely cultivated in South and Central America and particularly, found in the northeastern part of Argentina. The experimental work has been carried out in laboratory using real poles with different degrees of damage and deterioration, that were provided by the EDES, the electricity company that provides service in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

AB Oscillating microbubbles within microvessels could induce stresses that lead to bioeffects or vascular damage. Previous work has attributed vascular damage to the vessel expansion or bubble jet. However, ultra-high speed images of recent studies suggest that it could happen due to the vascular invagination. Numerical simulations of confined bubbles could provide insight into understanding the mechanism behind bubble-vessel interactions. In this study, a finite element model of a coupled bubble/fluid/vessel system was developed and validated with experimental data. Also, for a more realistic study visco-elastic properties of microvessels were assessed and incorporated into this comprehensive numerical model. The wall shear stress (WSS) and circumferential stress (CS), metrics of vascular damage, were calculated from these simulations. Resultant amplitudes of oscillation were within 15% of those measured in experiments (four cases). Among the experimental cases, it was numerically found that maximum WSS values were between 1.1-18.3 kPa during bubble expansion and 1.5-74 kPa during bubble collapse. CS was between 0.43-2.2MPa during expansion and 0.44-6MPa while invaginated. This finding confirmed that vascular damage could occur during vascular invaginations. Predicted thresholds in which these stresses are higher during vessel invagination were calculated from simulations. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Motivation: Biological mechanisms contributing to atherogenesis are multiple and complex. The early stage of atherosclerosis (AS) is characterized by the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) droplets, leading to the creation of foam cells (FC). To address the difficulty to explore the dynamics of interactions that controls this process, this study aimed to develop a model of agents and infer on the most influential cell-and molecule-related parameters.
   Results: FC started to accumulate after six to eight months of simulated hypercholesterolemia. A sensitivity analysis revealed the strong influence of LDL oxidation rate on the risk of FC creation, which was exploited to model the antioxidant effect of statins. Combined with an empirical simulation of the drug ability to decrease the level of LDL, the virtual statins treatment led to reductions of oxidized LDL levels similar to reductions measured in vivo.
   Availability and Implementation: An Open source software was used to develop the agent-based model of early AS. Two different concentrations of LDL agents were imposed in the intima layer to simulate healthy and hypercholesterolemia groups of 'virtual patients'. The interactions programmed between molecules and cells were based on experiments and models reported in the literature. A factorial sensitivity analysis explored the respective effects of the less documented model parameters as (i) agent migration speed, (ii) LDL oxidation rate and (iii) concentration of autoantibody agents. Finally, the response of the model to known perturbations was assessed by introducing statins agents, able to reduce the oxidation rate of LDL agents and the LDL boundary concentrations.

AB Previous reports on the spread of bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) from animals primarily infected with the agent are contradictory. In this study, the possibility of transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infection was investigated. Ten calves were inoculated intranasally with BVDV Type 1. Each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups. In each group there were four additional calves, resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group. Virulent BCV was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf. Two calves, susceptible to both BVDV and BCV, were kept in a separate group, as controls. All ten calves actively inoculated with BVDV became infected as shown by seroconversions, and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions. However, none of the other eight calves in the two groups (four in each) seroconverted to this agent. In contrast, it proved impossible to prevent the spread of BCV infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus.
   Following infection, BCV was detected in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and, after three weeks in the study, all had seroconverted to this virus. All calves, including the controls, showed at least One of the following clinical signs during days 3-15 after the trial started: fever (greater than or equal to40degreesC), depressed general condition, diarrhoea, and cough. The study showed chat BVDV primarily infected cattle, even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen, are inefficient transmitters of BVDV. This finding Supports the principle of the Scandinavian BVDV control programmes that elimination of BVDV infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected (PI) animals, i.e. that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of PI animals is highly unlikely.

AB Empathy is the ability to share emotions with others. It is acknowledged to be a powerful means of tacit communication, a key ingredient in any therapeutic relationship as well as in psychotherapy. Empathy is the cornerstone in the humanist perspective (Ego-psychology) in clinical psychology. This approach is often considered as poorly grounded on scientific and objective evidence. It is however acknowledged that empathetic therapists are more effective than less empathetic therapists. I shall argue that this paradox, i.e. it is the least scientific and the less validated psychotherapeutic approach that is the most efficient, can be eliminated if one considers the nature of empathy, its biological foundation, its evolutionary origin and its cognitive architecture. In this paper I will suggest that empathy is based on specific information processing modules which have been designed by natural selection to cope with social regularities in expressing and reading emotional states. This has provided adaptive benefits to individuals living in large groups bestowing them with mechanisms for cooperativity, altruism and more generally various aspects of prosocial behaviour. The capacity to express emotions, and to read and understand emotions of others also ensures implicit communication with others and may be at the root of intersubjectivity. This perspective on empathy is then articulated with two concurrent hypotheses regarding theory of mind (the simulation and the theory-theory) which aim to explain the human capacity to understand that the behaviors of other intelligent agents are caused by intentions, desires and beliefs. In this context, empathy can be considered as a simulation (or analogical) process that is necessary to understand but not sufficient to interpret other people. This last issue is relevant to clinical practice.

AB We used a validated agent-based model-Socio-Emotional CONcern DynamicS (SECONDS)-to model real-time playful interaction between a child diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and its parent. SECONDS provides a real-time (second-by-second) virtual environment that could be used for clinical trials and testing process-oriented explanations of ASD symptomatology. We conducted numerical experiments with SECONDS (1) for internal model validation comparing two parental behavioral strategies for stimulating social development in ASD (play-centered vs. initiative-centered) and (2) for empirical case-based model validation. We compared 2,000 simulated play sessions of two particular dyads with (second-by-second) time-series observations within 29 play sessions of a real parent-child dyad with ASD on six variables related to maintaining and initiating play. Overall, both simulated dyads provided a better fit to the observed dyad than reference null distributions. Given the idiosyncratic behaviors expected in ASD, the observed correspondence is non-trivial. Our results demonstrate the applicability of SECONDS to parent-child dyads in ASD. In the future, SECONDS could help design interventions for parental care in ASD.

AB Light and perspiration stability of triazinylstilbene fluorescent brighteners (TFBs) for cotton fabrics was investigated and many factors affecting the photo-fading of TFBs viz. substituent groups, artificial perspirations and their components were discussed. The experimental results indicated that the TFB with morpholine groups appeared to be the most sensitive one under simultaneous exposure to light and perspiration, whereas the TFBs containing sulfonic acid and diethanolamine groups exhibited the best stability. Among the three selected standards of artificial perspiration, the alkaline Association for Textile Technical Study standard perspiration retarded the photo-fading of TFBs on cotton fabrics remarkably. Furthermore, the study on the contribution of artificial perspiration components disclosed that the sodium salt played the predominant role in decelerating the photo-reaction of TFBs on cotton fabrics, while the influence of lactic acid was usually depended on two factors: the pH value and its reducibility.

AB We develop a novel modeling approach that combines a discrete agent-based model and a continuum material model to simulate collective cell migration in epithelial layers. In this approach, cells are represented as particles located at their geometrical center, but also as a polygonal body derived from the Voronoi diagram. Furthermore, we model the tissue as a continuum medium with different spatial domains that represent cell and substrate materials. In fact, the mechanical behavior of each domain is affected by the presence of cells from the discrete model. Moreover, we solve this mechanical problem using the finite element method (FEM). The forces generated by cells are projected to the FE mesh, that is created dynamically during the simulation from the discrete cell representation. After the FE resolution, we use the mesh displacements to determine the new cell positions in the agent-based model. Finally, to demonstrate the potential of this approach to model epithelial tissue mechanics, we simulate two well-studied cases of collective cell migration: durotaxis and gap closure. We use the experimental data from the literature to validate our numerical results. Therefore, the modeling strategy here presented offers a new perspective for a deeper understanding of tissue mechanics that emerge from cell dynamics in epithelial layers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B. V.

ID TIME-VARIATION; MOMENTS; MCMC
AB Over the last decade, agent-based models in economics have reached a state of maturity that brought the tasks of statistical inference and goodness-of-fit of such models on the agenda of the research community. While most available papers have pursued a frequentist approach adopting either likelihood-based algorithms or simulated moment estimators, here we explore Bayesian estimation using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach (MCMC). One major problem in the design of MCMC estimators is finding a parametrization that leads to a reasonable acceptance probability for new draws from the proposal density. With agent-based models the appropriate choice of the proposal density and its parameters becomes even more complex since such models often require a numerical approximation of the likelihood. This brings in additional factors affecting the acceptance rate as it will also depend on the approximation error of the likelihood. In this paper, we take advantage of a number of recent innovations in MCMC: We combine Particle Filter Markov Chain Monte Carlo as proposed by Andrieu et al. (J R Stat Soc B 72(Part 3):269-342, 2010) with adaptive choice of the proposal distribution and delayed rejection in order to identify an appropriate design of the MCMC estimator. We illustrate the methodology using two well-known behavioral asset pricing models.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging is used to observe solute transport in a 40 cm long, 26 cm diameter sand column that contained a central core of low permeability silica surrounded by higher permeability well-sorted sand. Low concentrations (2.9 g/L) of Magnevist, a gadolinium based contrast agent, produce density driven convection within the column when it starts in an unstable state. The unstable state, for this experiment, exists when higher density contrast agent is present above the lower density water. We implement a numerical model in OpenFOAM to reproduce the observed fluid flow and transport from a density difference of 0.3%. The experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging in observing three-dimensional gravity-driven convective-dispersive transport behaviors in medium scale experiments.

TI Financial price dynamics and pedestrian counterflows: A comparison of
   statistical stylized facts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID STOCK-MARKET; MODEL; RETURNS
AB We propose and document the evidence for an analogy between the dynamics of granular counterflows in the presence of bottlenecks or restrictions and financial price formation processes. Using extensive simulations, we find that the counterflows of simulated pedestrians through a door display eight stylized facts observed in financial markets when the density around the door is compared with the logarithm of the price. Finding so many stylized facts is very rare indeed among all agent-based models of financial markets. The stylized properties are present when the agents in the pedestrian model are assumed to display a zero-intelligent behavior. If agents are given decision-making capacity and adapt to partially follow the majority, periods of herding behavior may additionally occur. This generates the very slow decay of the autocorrelation of absolute return due to an intermittent dynamics. Our findings suggest that the stylized facts in the fluctuations of the financial prices result from a competition of two groups with opposite interests in the presence of a constraint funneling the flow of transactions to a narrow band of prices with limited liquidity.

AB Accurate modeling of urban growth is an extremely important component of urban geographic studies and is also vital for future urban planning. The trajectories of urban growth can be monitored and modeled by the use of geographic information system techniques, remote sensing data, and statistical analysis. In this study, we couple game theory with an integrated agent-cellular method to develop a model of the major determinants controlling urban development, which not only accounts for socioeconomic driving forces but also captures human actions. Wuhan, the largest city in central China, is undergoing rapid urbanization and is facing uncontrolled urban expansion. The city proper region of Wuhan is selected as the case study area to simulate urban growth during the period between 2003 and 2023. The results indicate that the social conflicts between the different stakeholders in urban development can be identified by utilizing a game tree. The game-theory based agent-cellular model is shown to be more effective than a pure cellular automata model in urban growth simulation. The results also show that, from 2013 to 2023, the urban area of the Wuhan city proper region is predicted to grow to 442.77 km(2), which is almost two times the area in 2003. This research is the first study to use empirical data and game theory to analyze the decision-making process in urban development in the Wuhan area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The paper presents the potential of using interoperable agent driven simulation to support development planning; indeed the use of simulation represents a strong benefit to improve planning of infrastructures and plants devoted to disaster relief, civil protection and/or support to country development; the paper describes models used to face these challenges and last updates in population modeling for these applications. The proposed models include population characteristics, need as well as their social networks. In humanitarian support operations and country reconstruction there is a huge potential to use simulators; the paper describes how these models should be designed to support training as well operational planning. The models should be able to consider the impacts of contingencies as well as to guarantee the quick responsiveness requirements for humanitarian crisis management. The authors propose a simulator to be shared and used among Armed Forces and Civil Agencies for addressing Crisis Management, Humanitarian Missions, Country Reconstruction and Development considering joint operations (i.e. Civil Military Cooperation); indeed the paper outlines the importance of training people devoted to guarantee interoperability among civil organization and military units in this sector. The paper describes the models based on interoperable simulation as well as the agents driving the entities during the simulation to create quickly complex scenarios able to consider the impact on population and communities of the different actions by including human behavioral models. The proposed approach guarantees interoperability among different simulators within an HLA (High Level Architecture) federation in order to recreate crisis scenarios combining detailed simulation of multiple factors. The proposed approach is verified and validated by proposing an experimental analysis where it is evaluated a set of construction projects (i.e. digging wells) in a stabilization area and their effectiveness both in terms of direct result (i.e. water availability) as well as of population consensus and disaster relief (i.e. stress mitigation, trustiness respect supporting players).

AB An agent-based evolutionary model of tag-mediated altruism is studied on large-scale complex networks addressing multiplayer one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma-like games with four competing strategies. Contrary to standard theoretical predictions, but in line with recent empirical findings, we observed that altruistic acts in non-repeated interactions can emerge as a natural consequence of recognition of heritable phenotypic traits such as visual tags, which enable the discrimination between potentially beneficial and unproductive encounters. Moreover, we identified topological regimes in which cooperation always prevails at short times, but where unconditional cooperators are favored over conditional tag-based helpers, even though the latter initially have a slight reproductive advantage. After very long times, we found that all four strategies appeared about equally often, meaning that only one quarter of agents refused cooperation egoistically. However, our study suggests that intra-tag generosity can quickly evolve to dominate over other strategies in spatially structured environments that are otherwise detrimental to cooperative behavior.

AB Using a representational momentum paradigm, this study investigated the hypothesis that judgments of how far another agent's head has rotated are influenced by the perceived gaze direction of the head. Participants observed a video-clip of a face rotating 600 towards them starting from the left or right profile view. The gaze direction of the face was either congruent with, ahead of, or lagging behind the angle of rotation. Following this, two static faces, at varying angles of rotation with respect to the end-point angle of the face in the video-clip, were presented simultaneously. The task of the participants was to decide which of the two heads was at an angle best resembling the angle of the end-point of the moving face. The critical test condition consisted of one test face oriented at 10 degrees before, and the other at 10 degrees after the end-point. The 'lagging behind' gaze condition elicited a significant underestimation of the rotation compared to the 'congruent' and 'ahead' gaze conditions. Participants did not exhibit similar biases when judging the rotation of several non-face control stimuli with visual features that mimicked different aspects of gaze direction. The findings suggest that when the gaze direction of a perceived agent is incongruent with the direction of the agent's head motion observers automatically utilise this discrepancy to adjust their inferences about the agent's intended heading direction.

AB Ageing populations, rapid technological progress and recent public budget cuts currently threaten the sustainability of public health systems. To meet growing needs with declining resources, decision-makers must identify new ways to avoid reducing the quality of services offered to citizens. This paper focuses on the so-called "co-payment'' tools aimed to obtain additional resources for the public health budget directly from citizens. Whereas certain forms of co-payments have always been introduced within health systems to prevent moral hazard behaviours, other co-payment mechanisms are explicitly intended to help finance public healthcare systems. Literature and empirical findings do not agree about the final impact of such co-payment tools, particularly whether they can attain system sustainability and guarantee equitably delivered services. In this paper, we develop an agent-based simulation model which can be used by decision-makers as a decision support tool to compare different co-payment rules and evaluate their impact on the public budget and the health expense of different groups of citizens.

AB In Germany, doubling today's insulation rate of about 1% is an important element for reaching the government's target of reducing the demand for energy in the housing sector by 80% by 2050. A survey among 275 private homeowners was conducted to better understand their insulation activity. The results were incorporated into an agent-based model, which was applied to evaluate new policy options. The results of the survey show that policies should focus on homeowners' wall insulation activity. Homeowners' decision-making processes regarding insulation are largely unaffected by their financial resources, which raises the question of the usefulness of financial incentives. In contrast, non-economic factors were found to have a statistically significant influence: in the year following a house ownership change, a comparatively large number of insulation projects are carried out. The probability of insulating walls can be predicted from knowing the homeowner's age, attitude towards insulation, and the structural condition of the walls. The simulations indicate that information instruments lead to a comparatively small increase in the wall insulation rate, while obligating new homeowners to insulate the walls within the first year after moving in has the potential to increase the total insulation rate by up to 40%.

ID DYNAMICS
AB Agent-based simulation methods are a relatively new way to address complex systems. Usually, the idea is that the agents used are rather simple, and the complexity and adaptivity of such a system are modeled by the interaction between these agents. However, another way to exploit agent-based simulation methods is by use of agents that themselves also have certain forms of learning or adaptation. In order to simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world biological or societal counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate certain adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent models. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative, numerical methods, and in particular, differential equations. Since agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages, these quantitative models are often not directly appropriate as an input in the context of agent-based simulation. To deal with this problem, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyze the dynamics of complex systems, in particular a conditioning process of an adaptive agent, integrating quantitative, numerical and qualitative, logical aspects within one expressive temporal specification language. To obtain a simulation model, an executable sublanguage of this language is used to specify the agent's adaptation mechanism in detail. For analysis and validation, in the proposed approach both properties characterising the externally observable adaptive behavior and properties characterizing the dynamics of internal intermediate states have been identified, formally specified and automatically checked on the generated simulation traces. As part of the latter, an approach to (formally) specify and check representational relations for intermediate, internal agent states is put forward. This enables veri. cation of whether the representational content of an intermediate state a modeller has in mind indeed is in accordance with the agent model's internal dynamics. For a biological agent with known neural mechanisms, such as Aplysia, the modeling approach incorporates high-level modeling of neural states occurring as intermediate states and relates them to their representational content specification. This provides the possibility to validate not only the resulting observable behavior of a simulation model against the observable behavior of the agent in the real world, but also the intermediate states of the agent in the model against the intermediate states of the agent in the world.

AB Due to negative consequences of climate change for agriculture and food production shocks affecting different areas of the world, the past two decades saw the conditions of global food security increasingly worsen. This has resulted in negative consequences for the world economy, partly causing international food price spikes and social upheavals. In this paper we present statistical findings along with a preliminary version of an original agent-based model called the Dawe Global Security Model that simulates the global food market and the political fragility of countries. The model simulates the effects of food insecurity on international food prices and how these, coupled with national political fragility and international food trade can, in turn, increase the probability of food riots in countries. The agents in the model are the 213 countries of the world whose characteristics reflect empirical data and the international trade of food is also simulated based on real trade partnerships and data. The model has been informed, calibrated and validated using real data and the results of these procedures are presented in the paper. To further test the model we also present the model's forecasts for the near future in terms of food prices and incidence of food riots. The Dawe Global Security Model can be used to test scenarios on the evolution of shocks to global food production and analyse consequences for food riots. Further developments of the model can include national responses to food crises to investigate how countries can influence the spread of global food crises.

AB In this paper, we study how seriously residents with disabilities affect the evacuation of other residents in a 24-story high-rise building environment through an agent-based simulation model. In particular, we analyze the trends of the evacuation times in two population scenarios, homogeneous (i.e., only residents without disabilities) and heterogeneous residents (i.e., residents with and without disabilities), while we vary the size of populations and the compositions of disability types of residents. According to our experimental results, residents with disabilities significantly delay the evacuation process by causing congestion and blocking phenomenon. Our experimental results also indicate that the differences in the evacuation time of the homogenous and the heterogeneous population scenarios become more significant as the population size increases because of serious congestion from the increased population size and blocking from the increased proportion of the handicapped. Finally, we present regression models and controlled evacuation strategies that help evacuation administrators ensure the safe evacuation of all the residents by controlling the number of residents and evacuate residents with disabilities efficiently.

AB In this study, a two-dimensional mathematical solute transport model is proposed to simulate the leaching of copper ore tailings using sulfuric acid as the leaching agent, injection wells to introduce the leaching agent, and pumping wells to retrieve the pregnant copper leach solution. To calibrate the model, a tracer experiment and a leaching experiment were performed, both under conditions of a single-direction flow pattern established between two boundaries of constant height. These experiments enabled the model hydraulic, dispersion and reaction parameters to be determined. Validation of the model was performed by comparison of the numerical results given by the model with experimental results obtained from a second leaching experiment, performed under conditions of a radial flow pattern established through the use of four injection wells and one pumping well and making use of the parameters estimated previously during the calibration process, The comparison between predicted and measured leaching behavior was good (20-22% error). The study has significant implications for applications related to the use of the proposed numerical model for predicting the performance of in-situ soil washing alternatives.

AB We investigate a simple two-person tournament in a controlled laboratory experiment. Each player chooses between two distributions of random shocks. After observing the overall risk, both players decide simultaneously on their effort. Theory predicts both players should choose the distribution with the higher variance of random shock, as this minimizes equilibrium effort. We show that the effort exerted is sensitive towards risk. The agents exert less effort if the random shock is high. However, agents do not learn to commit themselves by choosing a high risk in our experiment.

DE collective motion; intelligent matter; active matter
ID BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Collective motion is found in various animal systems, active suspensions, and robotic or virtual agents. This is often understood by using high-level models that directly encode selected empirical features, such as coalignment and cohesion. Can these features be shown to emerge from an underlying, low-level principle? We find that they emerge naturally under future state maximization (FSM). Here, agents perceive a visual representation of the world around them, such as might be recorded on a simple retina, and then move to maximize the number of different visual environments that they expect to be able to access in the future. Such a control principle may confer evolutionary fitness in an uncertain world by enabling agents to deal with a wide variety of future scenarios. The collective dynamics that spontaneously emerge under FSM resemble animal systems in several qualitative aspects, including cohesion, coalignment, and collision suppression, none of which are explicitly encoded in the model. A multilayered neural network trained on simulated trajectories is shown to represent a heuristic mimicking FSM. Similar levels of reasoning would seem to be accessible under animal cognition, demonstrating a possible route to the emergence of collective motion in social animals directly from the control principle underlying FSM. Such models may also be good candidates for encoding into possible future realizations of artificial "intelligent" matter, able to sense light, process information, and move.

AB Objective: Although beating heart coronary artery bypass grafting has recently gained popularity, it eliminates the protective strategies tie, cardioplegia) developed for use in conventional cardiac operations. We recently introduced the technique of perfusion-assisted direct coronary artery bypass to perfuse the grafted vessels during multivessel off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that intracoronary reperfusion with the cardioprotective agent adenosine during simulated perfusion-assisted direct coronary artery bypass attenuates reperfusion injury.
   Methods: In anesthetized dogs the heart was exposed, and the left anterior descending coronary artery was ligated for 75 minutes. Reperfusion was achieved through a catheter in the left anterior descending coronary artery by means of a computer-controlled pump. Intracoronary left anterior descending coronary artery perfusion pressure was continuously matched to mean arterial blood pressure. In one group (adenosine group) 10 mu mol/L adenosine was added to the blood during the first 30 minutes of reperfusion, whereas another group (vehicle group) received a comparable volume of saline solution.
   Results: During the first 30 minutes of reperfusion, blood flow through the left anterior descending coronary artery was significantly greater (P < .05) in the adenosine group than in the vehicle group (150.6 <plus/minus> 21.9 vs 50.2 +/- 11.3 mL/min at 15 minutes of reperfusion). Although there were no group differences in postischemic wall motion, infarct size was significantly smaller in the adenosine group than in the vehicle group (11.1% +/- 3.0% vs 28.0% +/- 4.0% of area at risk, P < .05). Myeloperoxidase activity in the necrotic tissue, an index of neutrophil accumulation, tended to be lower in the adenosine group than in the vehicle group (58.6 <plus/minus> 14.2 vs 91.0 +/- 21.6 Delta AbsUnits . min(-1) . g(-1) tissue). In isolated postischemic left anterior descending coronary artery rings, the maximal relaxation response to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine was significantly greater in the adenosine group than in the vehicle group (97.9% +/- 5.6% vs 64.7% +/- 6.5%, P < .05).
   Conclusion: This novel reperfusion strategy for off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting can be used not only in cases requiring multiple grafting but also to attenuate necrosis and endothelial dysfunction in acute evolving infarction.

In this work, by applying the Potts dynamic system, a random agent-based financial time series model is developed in an attempt to uncover the empirical laws in finance, where the Potts model is introduced to imitate the trading interactions among the investing agents. Based on the computer simulation in conjunction with the statistical analysis and the nonlinear analysis, we present numerical research to investigate the fluctuation behaviors of the proposed time series model. Furthermore, in order to get a robust conclusion, we consider the daily returns of Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Component Index, and the comparison analysis of return behaviors between the simulation data and the actual data is exhibited.

AB Current treatment strategies for acute leukemias largely rely on nonspecific cytotoxic drugs that result in high therapy-related morbidity and mortality. Cost-effective, pertinent animal models are needed to link in vitro studies with the development of new therapeutic agents in clinical trials on a high-throughput scale. However, targeted therapies have had limited success moving from bench to clinic, often due to unexpected off-target effects. The zebrafish has emerged as a reliable in vivo tool for modeling human leukemia. Zebrafish genetic and xenograft models of acute leukemia provide an unprecedented opportunity to conduct rapid, phenotype-based screens. This allows for the identification of relevant therapies while simultaneously evaluating drug toxicity, thus circumventing the limitations of target-centric approaches.

AB An ab initio study of the adsorption of NOx and SO2 onto SnO2(110) surfaces is presented and related to gas-sensing applications. Using first-principles calculations density functional theory-generalized gradient approximation (DFT-GGA), the most relevant NO and NO2 adsorptions were analyzed by estimating their adsorption energies. The resulting values were compared to experimental desorption temperatures for NO and NO2. The adsorption of the poisoning agent SO2 was also analyzed. Optimum SnO2 working temperatures for minimum SO2 poisoning in NO2 sensing applications are discussed from the perspective of adsorption. In all cases, we observed that the surface reduction state has dramatic consequences on adsorption strength. An ab initio thermodynamics study is presented to analyze the stability of several surface oxygen configurations with respect to the ambient oxygen partial pressure and the temperature of the material.

AB Temporal and sequential information is essential to any agent continually interacting with its environment. In this paper, we test whether it is possible to evolve a recurrent neural network controller to match the dynamic requirement of the task. As a benchmark, we consider a sequential navigation task where the agent has to alternately visit two rewarding sites to obtain food and water after first visiting the nest. To achieve a better fitness, the agent must select relevant sensory inputs and update its working memory to realize a non-Markovian sequential behavior in which the preceding state alone does not determine the next action. We compare the performance of a feed-forward and recurrent neural control architectures in different environment settings and analyze the neural mechanisms and environment features exploited by the agents to achieve their goal. Simulation and experimental results using the Cyber Rodent robot show that a modular architecture with a locally excitatory recurrent layer outperformed the general recurrent controller.

AB Challenge studies are often implemented for assessing whether a subject is sensitive to a certain agent or allergen. In particular, researchers test groups of subjects to determine if there really exists a causal relationship between some agent of interest and a response. To answer such a question, we need to detect the presence of the phenomenon in just one individual. Typically, however, there are a large number of unknown risk factors associated with the response and a potentially small population prevalence. Hence, standard statistical techniques, by averaging the treatment effect across the group, may miss a significant response of a single individual and lead to inconclusive results. We develop an alternative approach based on union-intersection testing that will allow a practitioner to correctly examine observations on an individual apart from the other subjects and test the hypothesis of interest: Does the phenomenon exist in the population? More specifically, we show how this technique adjusts for the multiple number of tests encountered when analyzing data for each individual subject separately. Furthermore, we demonstrate power calculations for the determination of sample size prior to performing the study. The performance of the union-intersection approach in comparison to linear models and semiparametric techniques is considered through sample size calculations and simulations. The union-intersection testing methodology out performs the Kolmogorov tests. However, the nested linear model performs as well if not better than the union-intersection tests. To illustrate the ideas presented in the paper, we provide an application in which we analyze psychological data collected by way of a challenge study design.

AB Synthesis of the melamine-monoammonium phosphate complex and its application for fireproof intumescent paints are reported. The experimental intumescent liquid samples appear smooth with excellent rheology and thixotropicity; they produce good expanded chars with satisfactory time of fire resistance in the case of a simulated cellulose fire. In this study, the influence of mineral foam cementing agents was also established. Talc (MgSiO3) and kaolin (Al-2(SiO3)(3)) seem to be preferable cementing agents due to their soft influence on the expanded char structure.

AB Calls for the adoption of complex systems approaches, including agent-based modeling, in the field of epidemiology have largely centered on the potential for such methods to examine complex disease etiologies, which are characterized by feedback behavior, interference, threshold dynamics, and multiple interacting causal effects. However, considerable theoretical and practical issues impede the capacity of agent-based methods to examine and evaluate causal effects and thus illuminate new areas for intervention. We build on this work by describing how agent-based models can be used to simulate counterfactual outcomes in the presence of complexity. We show that these models are of particular utility when the hypothesized causal mechanisms exhibit a high degree of interdependence between multiple causal effects and when interference (i.e., one person's exposure affects the outcome of others) is present and of intrinsic scientific interest. Although not without challenges, agent-based modeling (and complex systems methods broadly) represent a promising novel approach to identify and evaluate complex causal effects, and they are thus well suited to complement other modern epidemiologic methods of etiologic inquiry.

AB Previously, our work reported the experimental details of the thermally controlled decrosslinking behaviour of a polymer network comprised of 2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate-isophorone diisocyanate polypropylene oxide 725-isophorone diisocyanate-2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate (t-BAEM-IPDI-PPO725-IPDI-t-BAEM). Such systems are of interest because they introduce rework capabilities into a polymeric material. In this study, computational methods were used to study the disassembly process. Heats of reaction data were determined from simulations of the decrosslinking reactions. These data were then compared to the experimental data and a predictive model developed to estimate the decrosslinking temperature of the polymer network when exposed to a particular severing agent. This system was then compared to another thermally decrosslinking system 2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate-isophorone diisocyanate-2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate (t-BAEM-IPDI-t-BAEM), which is the shorter chain analogue of t-BAEM-IPDI-PPO725-IPDI-t-BAEM. The introduction of the polymer chain into the disassembling crosslinker was found to lower the disassembly temperature when exposed to the same degradation conditions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Plants can solve amazingly difficult tasks while adjusting their growth and development to the environment. They can explore and exploit several resources simultaneously, even when the distributions of these vary in space and time. The systematic study of plant behaviour goes back to Darwin's book The power of movement in plants. Current research has highlighted that modularity is a key to understanding plant behaviour, as the production, functional specialization and death of modules enable the plant to adjust its movement to the environment. The adjustment is assisted by a flow of information and resources among the modules. Experiments have yielded many results about these processes in various plant species. Theoretical research, however, has lagged behind the empirical studies, possibly owing to the lack of a proper modelling framework that could encompass the high number of components and interactions. In this paper, I propose such a framework on the basis of network theory, viewing the plant as a group of connected, semi-autonomous agents. I review some characteristic plant responses to the environment through changing the states of agents and/or links. I also point out some unexplored areas, in which a dialogue between plant science and network theory could be mutually inspiring.

TI A comparison of the pathophysiologic effects of carbon dioxide, nitrous
   oxide, and helium pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that diagnostic laparoscopy may be contraindicated in multiple trauma patients with closed head injuries because of the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pneumoperitoneum on intracranial pressure (ICP). In this study we compared the effects of two alternative inflation gases, helium (He) and nitrous oxide (N2O), against the standard agent used in most hospitals, CO2. ICP was monitored in experimental animals both with and without a space occupying intracranial lesion designed to simulate a closed head injury.
   METHODS: Twenty-four domestic pigs (mean, 30 kg) were divided into four groups (6 CO2, 6 He, 6 N2O, and 6 control animals without insufflation). All animals were monitored for ICP, intraabdominal pressure, mean arterial pressure, end-tidal CO2 (ETCO(2)), and arterial blood gases. These parameters were measured for 30 minutes prior to introducing a pneumoperitoneum and then for 80 minutes thereafter. The measurements were repeated after artificially elevating the ICP with a balloon placed in the epidural space.
   RESULTS: The mean ICP increased significantly in all groups during peritoneal insufflation compared with the control group (P <0.005). The CO2-insufflated animals also showed a significant increase in PaCO2 (P <0.05) and ETCO(2) (P <0.05), as well as a decrease in pH (P <0.05). After inflating the epidural balloon the ICP remained significantly higher in animals inflated with CO2 as compared with the He and N2O groups (P <0.05).
   CONCLUSIONS: Peritoneal insufflation with He and N2O resulted in a significantly less increase in ICP as compared with CO2. That difference was most likely due to a metabolically mediated increase in cerebral perfusion (PaCO2) in the CO2 group. Further studies need to be conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of using He and N2O as inflation agents prior to attempting diagnostic or therapeutic laparoscopy in patients with potential closed head injuries.

AB For the first time, solubility of imatinib mesylate (as a paradigm for cancer chemotherapy) in SC-CO2 was determined. Experiments were performed at operating temperatures and pressures of 308.2-338.2 K and 120-270 bar, respectively. Two different groups of methods including (1) three equations of state (EoSs), namely Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK), Pazuki et al. (PAZ), and Haghtalab et al. (HKM) with vdW2 mixing rule and (2) six density-based semi-empirical models were applied to correlate the solubility data of imatinib mesylate. The calculated results indicated the superiority of HKM EoS over other models. Then, a new, comprehensive empirical model with six adjustable parameters was proposed and compared with existing empirical models. The superiority of this model was confirmed by experimental solubility data of imatinib mesylate and 25 solubility datasets published in the literature. The proposed model could correlate the experimental solubility of imatinib mesylate with satisfactory accuracy.

AB The effects of an inhomogeneous competing environment on the extent of cooperation are studied within the context of a site-diluted evolutionary snowdrift game on a square lattice, with the occupied sites representing the players, both numerically and analytically. The frequency of cooperation F-C generally shows a non-monotonic dependence on the fraction of occupied sites rho, for different values of the payoff parameter r. Slightly diluting a lattice leads to a lower cooperation for small and high values of r. For a range of r, however, dilution leads to an enhanced cooperation. An analytic treatment is developed for F-C = F-C(I) + F-C(II), with F-C(I) emphasizing the importance of the small clusters of players especially for rho << 1 and being treated exactly. A pair approximation for the contribution F-C(II) from the other players is shown to be inadequate. A local configuration approximation (LCA) that treats the local competing configurations as the variables and amounts to include spatial correlation up to the neighborhood of a player's neighbors is developed. Results of F-C(rho) and the number of different local configurations from LCA are in good agreement with simulation results. A transparent physical picture of the dynamics stemming from LCA. is also presented. The theoretical approach provides a framework that can be readily applied to competing agent-based models in structurally ordered and disordered populations.

The presented concept of socio-cyber-physical work systems is based on connecting social, cyber and physical working environments into a single functional, productive entity of the appointed elementary socio-cyber-physical work system.The elementary socio-cyber-physical work system is a basic building block of the cyber-physical production systems at the manufacturing level. The cyber system of the elementary socio-cyber-physical work system enables autonomous decision-making and cooperation in the network system. The possibility of implementing the proposed concept is based on the introduction of agency technologies in the domain of modern production systems and the development of information-communication technologies for the advanced management and control of cyber-physical production systems. Some illustrative examples reflect the experimental results of a research work in the field of cyber-physical systems and demonstrate the potential possibilities of implementing the concept of sociocyber-physical work systems in the real industrial environment.

AB The possibility of solid solution behavior of diastereomeric salts, containing multiple resolving agents of the same family (Dutch Resolution), is predicted by molecular modeling. Super-cells containing different ratios of resolving agents in the diastereomeric salt are constructed and optimized, and their lattice energy is computed. The energy difference between these "simulated solid solutions" and the native structures is related in an understandable fashion to the probability of solid solution formation. This procedure is applied to a family of diastereomeric salts of ephedrine and cyclic phosphoric acids, for which the ternary diagrams have been determined experimentally at 25degreesC in ethanol. Good agreement between experimental and computational results indicates that this relatively simple and fast method could predict the stable character of solid solution behavior in binary systems.

AB Objectives: This study evaluated the effect of argon plasma treatment (PLA) and its combination with sandblasting (SAN), silanization (SIL), and hydrophobic bonding resin (HBR) application on the micro-shear bond strength of water-aged restorative resin composite to a newly placed composite, simulating restoration repair.
   Methods and Materials: Forty-five light-cured composite plates (20-mm long x 20-mm wide x 4-mm thick) were fabricated using a hybrid composite and stored at 37 degrees C in distilled water for six months. The aged composite surfaces were treated according to the following experimental groups, varying both treatment and order of application: 1) SAN + SIL + HBR (control), 2) SAN + PLA for 30 seconds + SIL + HBR, 3) SAN + SIL + PLA + HBR, 4) PLA + SIL + HBR, 5) PLA + SIL, 6) PLA + HBR, 7) SIL + PLA + HBR, 8) SIL + PLA, and 9) PLA. After the surface treatments, four fresh resin composite cylinders (1.5-mm high x 1.5-mm diameter) of the same composite were built on each aged composite surface using a silicone mold. After water storage for 24 hours or one year, the specimens were submitted to shear bond strength testing. Data were statistically analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and Tukey's test (5%).
   Results: Groups 1, 2, and 4 presented significantly higher bond strength means at 24 hours, although group 4 did not differ from group 7. Groups 5, 8, and 9 demonstrated significantly lower means than the other groups. Even though groups 1 and 2 had a significant bond strength reduction after 1 year, they still demonstrated higher bond strength at one year of storage.
   Conclusions: While PLA application combined with surface treatment methods demonstrated high bond strength results, this treatment alone was not as beneficial as other methods that included SAN, SIL and HBR.

AB Background Biological hydroxyapatite (HA), has several mechanical and physical advantages over the commercially available synthetic apatite (CAP-HA). The aim of this in vivo study was to investigate the effect of osteoinductive bone-like hydroxyapatite obtained from simulated body fluid (SBF) combined with osteoinductive boron (B) on bone healing.
   Materials Bone like nanohydroxyapatite (SBF-HA) was precipitated from 10x simulated body fluid (10xSBF). Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 5 experimental groups (n = 6 each). The groups were involving blank defect, chitosan, SBF-HA, SBF-HA/B, and CAP-HA. Two biparietal round critical sized bone defect was created using a dental burr. The rats were sacrificed respectively at the end of second and fourth months after surgery and their calvarium were harvested for further macroscopic, microtomographic, and histologic evaluation.
   Results The SBF-HA/B group demonstrated the highest mineralized matrix formation rates (30.69 3.73 for the second month, 62.68 +/- 7.03 for the fourth month) and was significantly higher than SBF-HA and the CAP-HA groups. The SBF-HA/B group demonstrated the highest mineralized matrix formation rates (30.69 +/- 3.73 for the second month, 62.68 +/- 7.03 for the fourth month) and was significantly higher than SBF-HA and the CAP-HA groups. In means of bone defect repair histologically, the highest result was observed in the SBF-HA/B group (P < 0.001).
   Conclusions The bone-like hydroxapatite obtained from simulated body fluid is worth attention when both its beneficial effects on bone healing and its biological behavior is taken in consideration for further bone tissue engineering studies. It appears to be a potential alternative to the commercially available hydroxyapatite samples.

AB Endothelial dysfunctions that include decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity and increased endothelin-1 (ET-1) bioactivity have been considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm (CVS) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Recent cardiovascular studies have revealed that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is involved in a disturbance in cross-talk between NO and ET-1. COX-2 expression was detected in the endothelial cells of a spastic artery after experimental SAH; however, the pathophysiological significance of COX-2 in relation to CVS remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of COX-2 in relation to NO and ET-1 in the pathogenesis of CVS by using the COX-2 selective inhibitor, celecoxib. In the SAH group, SAH was simulated using the double-hemorrhage rabbit model. In the celecoxib group, SAH was simulated and celecoxib was administered. The basilar artery was extracted on day 5 and examined. The cross-section area of the basilar artery in the celecoxib group was significantly larger than in the SAH group. An increased expression of COX-2, ET-1, and ETA receptor (ETAR), and a decreased expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) were seen in the SAH group. In the celecoxib group compared to the SAH group, expression of COX-2, ET-1, and ETAR were statistically significantly decreased, and eNOS expression was significantly increased. COX-2 might be involved in the pathogenesis of CVS due to up-regulation of ET-1 and ETAR and down-regulation of eNOS, and celecoxib may potentially serve as an agent in the prevention of CVS after SAH.

AB Immunology inspired computer security has attracted enormous attention as its potential impacts on the next generation service-oriented network operation system. In this paper, we propose a new agent-based threat awareness assessment strategy inspired by the human immune system to dynamically adapt against attacks. Specifically, this approach is based on the dynamic reconfiguration of the file access right for system calls or logs (e.g., file rewritability) with balanced adaptability and vulnerability. Based on an information-theoretic analysis on the coherently associations of adaptability, autonomy as well as vulnerability, a generic solution is suggested to break down their coherent links. The principle is to maximize context-situation awared systems' adaptability and reduce systems' vulnerability simultaneously. Experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed biological behaviour-inspired vulnerability awareness system.

AB Experimental patterns of epithelial cell proliferation in the prostate suggest that cell movement may play an important role in prostate epithelial homeostasis, and genes known to regulate cell movement are commonly mutated or deleted in prostate carcinomas. However, the nature of cell movement within the prostate epithelium remains unknown. Here, the role of cellular movement in the prostate epithelium was explored by developing an agent-based model of the prostate duct. Prostatic adult stem cells, transit amplifying/ intermediate cells (TA/ICs), and luminal cells were individually modeled within a three-dimensional reconstruction of a prostate duct. Different movement behaviors for TA/ICs and luminal cells were assessed by their ability to recreate experimental patterns of prostate cell proliferation and epithelial morphology. Strongly directed TA/IC movement toward the distal region of the prostate duct combined with weakly directed luminal cell movement toward the proximal region of the prostate duct was able to best recreate experimental patterns of prostate proliferation and morphology. The effects on cell mobility from abnormalities in PTEN and thymosin beta 15 (T beta 15), genes which are commonly altered in prostate cancer, were simulated in the model. These simulations show that altering prostate stem cell movement can dysregulate epithelial homeostasis and lead to excessive cell growth, suggesting that disruption of cell movement may contribute to prostate carcinogenesis.

ID DISCOURSES
AB Contemporary discourses of social justice in education, disability, mental health, social policy and feminist studies are refracted increasingly through concerns about psychological and structural vulnerabilities created by the crises of late capitalism. Focusing on developments in British social policy generally and educational research specifically, this paper uses the authors' contrasting perspectives on two discernible discourses of vulnerability emerging in these contexts. One elevates the recognition of collective vulnerability as a springboard for new conceptualisations of resistance that disrupt materialist narratives of the human subject as a coherent, unified and rational agent of history. A second discourse offers a materialist understanding that locates vulnerability as both driver and product of a 'therapeutic culture', arguing that a psycho-emotional focus for vulnerability offers a diminished and ineffective subjectivity that belies rhetorics of resistance. These contrasting perspectives generate and emerge simultaneously from new understandings of the human subject. The paper evaluates the implications of using vulnerability to frame expectations of human subjects for everyday educational practices and relationships. It concludes by suggesting empirical questions that need exploring.

AB A liquid sizing agent containing multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) was prepared for carbon fiber (CF) reinforced methylphenylsilicone resin (MPSR) composite applications. In order to improve the dispersion of MWCNTs in the sizing agent and interfacial adhesion between CF and MPSR, MWCNTs and CF were functioned by the chemical modification with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) used as a MPSR curing agents. The CF before and after the sizing treatment-reinforced MPSR composites were prepared by a compression molding method. The microstructures, interfacial properties, and impact toughness of CF were systematically investigated. Experimental results revealed that a thin layer of MPSR coating containing functionalized MWCNTs (MWCNT-TEPA) was uniformly grafted onto the surface of CF. The sized CF-reinforced MPSR composite showed simultaneously remarkable enhancement in the interlaminar shear strength and impact toughness. Meanwhile, the tensile strength of CF had no obvious decrease after sizing treatment. In addition, the interfacial reinforcing and toughening mechanisms were also discussed.

AB Use of tags to limit partner selection for playing has been shown to produce stable cooperation in agent populations playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game. There is, however, a lack of understanding of how and why tags facilitate such cooperation. We start with an empirical investigation that identifies the key dynamics that result in sustainable cooperation in PD. Sufficiently long tags are needed to achieve this effect. A theoretical analysis shows that multiple simulation parameters including tag length, mutation rate and population size will have significant effect on sustaining cooperation. Experiments partially validate these observations. Additionally, we claim that tags only promote mimicking and not coordinated behavior in general, i.e., tags can promote cooperation only if cooperation requires identical actions from all group members. We illustrate the failure of the tag model to sustain cooperation by experimenting with domains where agents need to take complementary actions to maximize payoff.

AB Mirror neuron research has come a long way since the early 1990s, and many theorists are now stressing the heterogeneity and complexity of the sensorimotor properties of fronto-parietal circuits. However, core aspects of the initial 'mirror mechanism' theory, i.e. the idea of a symmetric encapsulated mirroring function translating sensory action perceptions into motor formats, still appears to be shaping much of the debate. This article challenges the empirical plausibility of the sensorimotor segregation implicit in the original mirror metaphor. It is proposed instead that the teleological organization found in the broader fronto-parietal circuits might be inherently sensorimotor. Thus the idea of an independent 'purely perceptual' goal understanding process is questioned. Further, it is hypothesized that the often asymmetric, heterogeneous and contextually modulated mirror and canonical neurons support a function of multisensory mapping and tracking of the perceiving agents affordance space. Such a shift in the interpretative framework offers a different theoretical handle on how sensorimotor processes might ground various aspects of intentional action choice and social cognition. Mirror neurons would under the proposed "social affordance model" be seen as dynamic parts of larger circuits, which support tracking of currently shared and competing action possibilities. These circuits support action selection processes-but also our understanding of the options and action potentials that we and perhaps others have in the affordance space. In terms of social cognition 'mirror' circuits might thus help us understand not only the intentional actions others are actually performing but also what they could have done, did not do and might do shortly.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the dentinal tubular occlusion of nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) containing desensitizing toothpastes and their influence on the resin-dentin bonding performance of two mild self-etch adhesives.
   Materials and methods: Mid-coronal dentin specimens were prepared from obtained intact human third molars. They were immersed in 1% citric acid for 20 s to expose the dentinal tubules to simulate sensitive teeth and then randomly divided into four groups. The control group received no desensitizing treatment. Experimental groups were treated with two commercial nHAp containing desensitizing toothpastes (Biorepair and Dontodent) and an experimental pure nHAp paste respectively. Each group was further divided into two subgroups and bonded with either G-Bond or Clearfil S-3 Bond. The micro-tensile bond strength was tested and failure mode distribution was analyzed. Moreover, the effect of desensitizers on dentinal tubular occlusion was observed by the field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Resin infiltration of the adhesives labeled by fluorescent Rhodamin B was evaluated under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM).
   Results: FESEM revealed that all the desensitizers noticeably occluded the dentinal tubules, and the extents were completer after application for 7 days. The majority of the occlusion still preserved even after acid challenge with cola or adhesive. CLSM demonstrated shorter resin tags were produced in the desensitized groups. When bonding with G-Bond, the pure nHAp group showed comparable bond strength to the control group, while Biorepair and Dontodent treatment decreased the bond strength. For groups bonded with Clearfil S-3 Bond, all the desensitizers reduced the bond strengths compared to the control and no significant difference was found among the three groups.
   Conclusion: Nano-hydroxyapatite containing desensitizing toothpastes could occlude dentinal tubules effectively with a certain degree of acid resistance, which contributes to the relief of dentin hypersensitivity. While, the application of these nHAp desensitizers comprised the resin infiltration of G-Bond and Clearfil S-3 Bond, resulting in decreased bond strengths of the resin-dentin bonding.

DE social amplification of risk; risk perception; general practitioners;
   BSE
ID INFORMATION; MEDIA; VCJD; FOOD
AB Social studies of risk have consistently shown that physicians and health professionals are viewed by the general public as a trustworthy source of information and communication regarding risks. However, few if any empirical investigations have focused on the role physicians, particularly general practitioners (GPs), may play as a 'social station' in the processes of amplification or attenuation of risks to health that Kasperson et al described in their framework. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether French GPs acted as amplifiers or attenuators in the BSE ('mad cow disease') crisis. A sample of 602 general practitioners completed a questionnaire aimed at assessing in a variety of ways their cognitive, affective and behavioural responses to BSE. Results show that, ( 1) GPs expressed moderate concern about BSE-related risks: Mad cow disease only ranked tenth in averaged ratings of 14 current risks to health. ( 2) However, about 90% of respondents reported having recommended one or several modi. cations in their patients' food habits. Remarkably, only 44% did the same at home. ( 3) By far the most common recommendation was to avoid organ meats from cattle, even though specified risk materials ( which included some of those cuts) had been withdrawn from the market as early as April 1996. Such results point to potentially complex-perhaps even contradictory-responses to BSE from the GPs, with a clear dichotomy between reported private and professional behaviour. Our data suggest that social agents may act simultaneously as risk amplifiers and risk attenuators depending on the public towards which their communication was directed.

AB This paper describes a participatory and collaborative process for formalising qualitative data, using research from southeast Cameroon, how these results can provide input to an social simulation model, and what insights they can provide in better understanding decision-making in the region. Knowledge Elicitation Tools (KnETs) have been used to support a body of existing research on local strategies that build community adaptive capacity and support sustainable forest management under a range of socio-environmental and climatic stressors. The output of this approach is a set of decision rules which complements previous analysis of differentiated vulnerability of forest communities. Improvements to the KnETs methodology, such as new statistical measurements, make it easier to generate inputs for a social simulation model, such as agent attributes and heterogeneity, as well as informing which scenarios to prioritise during model development and testing. The KnETs process served as a vehicle to structure a large volume of empirical data, to identify the most salient drivers of decision-making amongst different actors, to uncover tacit knowledge and to make recommendations about which strategic interventions should be further explored in a social simulation and by local organizations planning interventions. It was notable that there were many common rule drivers for men and women from the same households, though they participated in the game-interviews separately. At the same time, though strategies were common to both poor and better-off farmers, differences lay in the package of strategies chosen - the number and type of strategies as well the drivers factors - and how they were prioritised with respect to each farmer's goal.

AB The hypothesis that two known chelators 1,2-dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one (L1) and desferrioxamine (DFO) might be more efficient as combined treatment than as monotherapies in removing aluminium from the body was tested in a new acute rat model. Five-week old female rats received chelators: L1 (p.o.), DFO (i.p.) or L1 + DFO as 100 or 200 mg/kg dose half an hour after a single i.p. administration of 6 mg Al/kg body weight in the form of chloride. Serum aluminium concentration and urinary aluminium and iron excretions were determined by electrothermal or flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Both chelators were effective only at the higher dose level. While DFO was more effective than L1 in enhancing urinary aluminium excretion, L1 was more effective than DFO in enhancing urinary iron excretion. In the combined treatment group L1 did not increase the DFO effect on aluminium and DFO did not increase the effect of L1 on iron elimination. However, in this group a simultaneous increase in both aluminium and iron elimination was observed. Our results support the usefulness of this animal model for preliminary in vivo testing of aluminium chelators. Urinary values were more useful because of the high variability of serum results. Result of combined chelators treatment should be confirmed in a different experimental model before extrapolation to other systems. This testing procedure of course does not provide all the relevant answers for evaluating the efficiency of chelating agents in aluminium toxicity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Combination treatments of botulinum toxin type-A and other rejuvenation agents or instruments are gradually becoming more popular. After observing a high incidence of therapy failure following simultaneous applications of botulinum toxin type-A and platelet-rich plasma mesotherapy, we aimed to investigate whether PRP has an inhibitory effect on botulinum toxin type-A.
   Twenty-four New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 4 groups, and the anterior auricular muscle and overlying skin were used for injections. Groups I and II both received onabotulinumtoxinA intramuscular injections. In addition, autologous platelet-rich plasma mesotherapy was performed in Group I while Group II received saline mesotherapy. Group III was designed as the in vitro mixture group in which onabotulinumtoxinA and platelet-rich plasma were mixed and then administered intramuscularly. Group IV received saline within the mixture instead of platelet-rich plasma. The contralateral ears of all the rabbits served as control and were only treated with onabotulinumtoxinA. Visual evaluation of ear positions and electroneuromyographic studies were done prior to all procedures and at day 14. Anterior auricular muscles were harvested at day 14 and were evaluated with quantitative real-time PCR.
   Visual and electroneuromyographic studies revealed less onabotulinumtoxinA activity in Groups I and III. When platelet-rich plasma was administered through skin mesotherapy, onabotulinumtoxinA activity failure was more severe in comparison with direct contact. No significant difference in SNAP-25 mRNA expression through quantitative real-time PCR was observed between groups.
   Although we could not explain the exact mechanism underlying this interaction, platelet-rich plasma applications result in less onabotulinumtoxinA muscle paralysis activity.

TI Contextual bandits with hidden contexts: a focused data capture from
   social media streams
SO DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY
LA English
DT Article
DE Contextual bandits; Data capture; Variational Bayesian optimization
AB This paper addresses the problem of real time data capture from social media. Due to different limitations, it is not possible to collect all the data produced by social networks such as Twitter. Therefore, to be able to gather enough relevant information related to a predefined need, it is necessary to focus on a subset of the information sources. In this work, we focus on user-centered data capture and consider each account of a social network as a source that can be followed at each iteration of a data capture process. This process, whose aim is to maximize the cumulative utility of the captured information for the specified need, is constrained at each time step by the number of users that can be monitored simultaneously. The problem of selecting a subset of accounts to listen to over time is a sequential decision problem under constraints, which we formalize as a bandit problem with multiple selections. In this work, we propose a contextual UCB-like approach, that uses the activity of any user during the current step to predict his future behavior. Besides the capture of usefulness variations, considering contexts also enables to improve the efficiency of the process by leveraging some structure in the search space. However, existing contextual bandit approaches do not fit for our setting where most of the contexts are hidden from the agent. We therefore propose a new algorithm, called HiddenLinUCB, which aims at dealing with such missing information via variational inference. Experiments demonstrate the very good behavior of this approach compared to existing methods for tasks of data capture from social networks.

AB SiCp/2024Al composite foams were manufactured by powder metallurgical methods using foaming agent CaCO3 in order to enrich the foam fabrication process and promote its development and extensive application. The effects of CaCO3 and SiC volume fractions on the foaming behaviours were investigated by means of SEM and Magiscan-2A image analysis technique. The influence of SiC content on the compressive behaviour was analyzed using Gleeble 1500 thermal simulation testing machine. The experimental results show that with increasing the foaming agent, the porosity and pore dimension increase first and decrease later. With increasing the reinforcement content, the porosity and pore dimension decrease. The compressive curves reveal that the introduction of SiC particles can improve compressive yield strength and energy absorption capacity. Meanwhile, it is found that SiCp/2024Al composite foams are the brittle foam materials.

ID BREAST-CANCER; TRANSCRIPTION; INDUCTION; RECEPTORS
AB Interactions among transcription factors are one of the mechanisms that regulate gene expression. Through protein-protein associations different signaling pathways become connected and the message triggered by each of the molecules involved can modify other related routes. In a murine mammary tumor induced by medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), further treatment with this agent showed a different response on tumor growth. In one group of tumors, growth rate was increased (hormone dependent, HD), whereas in the other group the progestin agent failed to modify the rate of tumor development (hormone autonomous, HA). Progesterone receptors (PgR) and estrogen receptors (ER) were expressed in both groups. Administration of 8-CI-cAMP, a cAMP analogue, stimulated tumor growth in the HD subline and inhibited growth in the HA subline. Simultaneous administration of 8-CI-cAMP and MPA resulted in suppression of inhibitory 8-CI-cAMP action in the HA tumor subline attributable to changes in molecular configuration of protagonic members of each signaling pathway, whereas in the HD subline growth was additive as if each of the pathways were acting separately. MPA induced down regulation of PgR in both tumor sublines and up regulation of ER in the C4-HD subline. The effect of 8-CI-cAMP alone or associated with MPA was more complex and variations in PgR and ER content by themselves are insufficient to explain changes in tumoral growth. A model consistent with our experimental findings is presented.

AB Statement of problem. Luting material, surface properties, and loading conditions affect the retention of prefabricated dowels to varying degrees.
   Purpose. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of roughening of the dentinal walls and artificial aging on the retention of prefabricated tapered titanium dowels, using 4 different luting materials.
   Material and methods. One-Hundred twenty-eight single-rooted teeth were selected, the coronal aspect of each tooth was removed, and the remaining root received endodontic therapy. All specimens were divided into 4 groups (n = 32). Dowel spaces were prepared to a depth of 10 mm using ISO 90 rotary cutting instruments. Tapered titanium dowels were luted with the following luting materials: zinc-phosphate cement (Harvard cement), glass-ionomer cement (Ketac Cem EasyMix), resin Composite luting agent (Panavia 21) with autopolyinerizing dentin primer (ED-Primer), or a self-adhesive composite luting agent (RelyX Unicem). Both composite luting agents were used without acid etching of the canal dentin. Each luting agent was used under 2 conditions: in I subgroup (11 = 16) the dentinal walls were not roughened, and in the other subgroup (n = 16), walls were roughened with a diamond rotary cutting instrument. Eight specimens from each Subgroup were stored in water at 37 degrees C for 3 days; the other 8 specimens were stored for 150 days and subjected to simulated aging conditions using 37,500 thermal cycles (5 degrees C/55 degrees C) and 300,000 mechanical loading cycles with 30 N. Dowel retention (N) was measured using a universal testing machine with a crosshead speed of 2 mm/mm. Data were analyzed using 2- and 3-way ANOVAs and the Tukey HSD test (alpha=.05).
   Results. The dislodged dowels were examined microscopically to evaluate mode of failure. The nonroughened dentinal walls showed no significant differences between the different luting agents. Roughening the dentinal walls increased the retention significantly for all groups. This increase was significantly higher for the resin composite groups (P=.0001). Storage for 150 days with thermal cycling and mechanical loading caused a significant decrease in dowel retention (P=.001). The Failure mode was Purely adhesive at the luting material-dentin interface for all dowels cemented in nonroughened root canals. A mixed failure mode, adhesive at the luting material-dentin interface and cohesive in the luting material, was observed for dowels cemented in roughened root canals.
   Conclusion. Roughening the dentinal walls and the use of resin luting cements provided statistically significant increases in dowel retention values.

TI Agent-based modeling in marketing: Guidelines for rigor
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MARKETING

DT Article
ID SIMULATION; DIFFUSION; INFLUENTIALS; PARADIGM
AB Agent-based modeling can illuminate how complex marketing phenomena emerge from simple decision rules. Marketing phenomena that are too complex for conventional analytical or empirical approaches can often be modeled using this approach. Agent-based modeling investigates aggregate phenomena by simulating the behavior of individual "agents," such as consumers or organizations. Some useful examples of agent-based modeling have been published in marketing journals, but widespread acceptance of the agent-based modeling method and publication of this method in the highest-level marketing journals have been slowed by the lack of widely accepted standards of how to do agent-based modeling rigorously. We address this need by proposing guidelines for rigorous agent-based modeling. We demonstrate these guidelines, and the value of agent-based modeling for marketing research, through the use of an example. We use an agent-based modeling approach to replicate the Bass model of the diffusion of innovations, illustrating the use of the proposed guidelines to ensure the rigor of the analysis. We also show how extensions of the Bass model that would be difficult to carry out using traditional marketing research techniques are possible to implement using a rigorous agent-based approach.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate the gastric damage related to high dose radioactive iodine treatment during thyroid cancer treatment in an experimental rat model and evaluate histopathologically the radioprotective effect of amifostine.
   Methods and findings: 40 adult rats were enrolled into the study. Radioactive iodine treatment with 30 mCi/kg I-131 was applied via orogastric tube simulating radioiodine ablation treatment (RAI) in thyroid cancer in all rats. After RAI subjects were divided into 2 groups: Group Orogastric RAI (Group OG, n: 20): Rats received no radioprotective agent but serum physiologic. Group Amifostine RAI (Group AP, n: 20): Rats received 200 mg/kg amifostine intraperitoneally 30 minutes before I-131 application. On the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 7th days of experiment rats were sacrificed for histopathological evaluation. Gastric tissues were excised and tissue damage was assessed by using histopathological scoring. Total pathology score revealed a significant change on the 7th day. The subjects in Group OG had histopathological changes, while only one subject in Group AP was found to have pathologic changes (X2=39.7 df (28), p=0.04). The common histopathological findings were striking mucosal and intraepithelial leucocytic infiltration together with thinning of the mucosa, regenerative changes, and reactive atypia.
   Conclusions: RAI treatment causes gastric mucosal injury and amifostine was found to decrease radioactive iodine treatment related gastric damage.

AB The study of social networks, and in particular those aspects related to disease spreading, has recently attracted considerable attention in the scientific community. In this paper, we investigate the effect of motion on the spread of diseases in dynamical networks of mobile agents. In order to simulate the long distance displacements empirically observed in real human movements, we consider different motion rules, such as random walks with the addition of jumps or Levy flights. We compare the epidemic thresholds found in dynamical networks of mobile agents with the analogous expressions for static networks. We discuss the existing relations between dynamical networks of random walkers with jumps and static small-world networks, and those between systems of Levy walkers and scale-free networks.

AB This paper considers a class of social foraging swarms with a nutrient profile (or an attractant/repellent) and an attraction-repulsion coupling function, which is chosen to guarantee collision avoidance between individuals. The paper also studies non-identical interaction ability or efficiency among different swarm individuals for different profiles. The swarm behavior is a result of a balance between inter-individual interplays as well as the interplays of the swarm individuals (agents) with their environment. It is proved that the individuals of a quasi-reciprocal swarm will aggregate and eventually form a cohesive cluster of finite size for different profiles. It is also shown that the swarm system is completely stable, that is, every solution converges to the set of equilibrium points of the system. Moreover, all the swarm individuals will converge to more favorable areas of the profile under certain conditions. For general non-reciprocal swarms, numerical simulations show that more complex self-organized rotation may occur in the swarms. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Motor activities of interacting agents get temporally coordinated to form synchronized actions. Such activity synchrony is observed in several mammalian species and is supposed to play vital roles in human social interactions. Therefore, it has long been proposed that the activity patterns of mother and infant get temporally synchronized. However, few studies to date have empirically investigated the developmental course of such synchrony. The present study simultaneously measured motor activities of mother-infant pairs for about 3.5 consecutive days by actigraph, and investigated the developmental course of mother-infant synchrony. The multiple regression analysis revealed an increase of mother-infant synchrony from 4 to 18 months after birth, giving support to the notion that activity patterns of mother and infant mutually entrain each other through the course of development.

AB We consider a simple decision model in which a set of agents randomly choose one of two competing shops selling the same perishable products (typically food). The satisfaction of agents with respect to a given store is related to the freshness of the previously bought products. Agents select with a higher probability the store that they are most satisfied with. Studying the model from a statistical physics perspective, both through numerical simulations and mean-field analytical methods, we find a rich behaviour with continuous and discontinuous phase transitions between a symmetric phase where both stores maintain the same level of activity, and a phase with broken symmetry where one of the two shops attracts more customers than the other.

AB We fit the logistic function, the reduced form of epidemic behaviour, to the data for deaths from Covid-19, for a wide variety of countries, with a view to estimating a causal model of the Covid virus' progression. We then set up a structural model of the Covid virus behaviour based on evolutionary biology and social household behaviour; we estimated and tested this by indirect inference, matching its simulated logistic behaviour to that found in the data. In our model, the virus' progression depends on the interaction of strategies by household agents, the government and the virus itself as programmed by evolution. Within these interactions, it turns out that there is substitution between government topdown direction (such as lockdown) and social reaction to available information on the virus' behaviour. We also looked at the experience of second waves, where we found that countries successfully limited second waves when they had had longer first waves and followed policies of localized reaction in the second.

TI Phase transitions in a coevolving snowdrift game with costly rewiring
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID SOCIAL DILEMMAS; COOPERATION; EVOLUTION; EMERGENCE; NETWORKS
AB We propose and study a dissatisfied adaptive snowdrift game with a payoff parameter r that incorporates a cost for rewiring a connection. An agent, facing adverse local environment, may switch action without a cost or rewire an existing link with a cost a so as to attain a better competing environment. Detailed numerical simulations reveal nontrivial and nonmonotonic dependence of the frequency of cooperation and the densities of different types of links on a and r. A theory that treats the cooperative and noncooperative agents separately and accounts for spatial correlation up to neighboring agents is formulated. The theory gives results that are in good agreement with simulations. The frequency of cooperation f(C) is enhanced (suppressed) at high rewiring cost relative to that at low rewiring cost when r is small (large). For a given value of r, there exists a critical value of the rewiring cost below which the system evolves into a phase of frozen dynamics with isolated noncooperative agents segregated from a cluster of cooperative agents, and above which the system evolves into a connected population of mixed actions with continual dynamics. The phase boundary on the a-r phase space that separates the two phases with distinct structural, population and dynamical properties is mapped out. The phase diagram reveals that, as a general feature, for small r (small a), the disconnected and segregated phase can survive over a wider range of a(r).

TI Sensitivity of delta C-13 values of seabird tissues to combined spatial,

AB Biologging technologies have revolutionised our understanding of the foraging ecology and life history traits of marine predators, allowing for high resolution information about location, and in some cases, foraging behaviour of wild animals. At the same time, stable isotope ecologists have independently developed methods to infer location and foraging ecology (trophic geography). To date, relatively few studies have combined these two approaches, despite the potential wealth of complementary information.
   In marine systems, spatial and trophic information are coded in the isotopic composition of carbon and nitrogen in animal tissues, but interpretation of isotope values is limited by both the lack of reference maps (isoscapes) needed to relate the isotopic composition of an animal's tissues to a location, and the relatively large number of variables that could influence tissue isotope compositions. Simulation modelling can help to interpret measured tissue isotope compositions of migratory animals in the context of spatio-temporally dynamic isotopic baselines.
   Here, we couple individual-based movement models with global marine isotope models to explore the sensitivity of tissue delta C-13 values to a range of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (behavioural, physiological) drivers. We use in-silico experiments to simulate isotopic compositions expected for birds exhibiting different movement and foraging behaviours and compare these simulated data to isotopic data recovered from biologgerequipped female northern giant petrels Macronectes halli incubating eggs on sub-Antarctic Marion Island.
   Our simulations suggest that in the studied system, time is a strong driver of isotopic variance. Accordingly, this implies that caution should be used when comparing delta C-13 values of marine predators' tissues between seasons and years.
   We show how an in-silico experimental approach can be used to explore the sensitivity of animal tissue isotopic compositions to complex and often interacting drivers. Appreciation of the principle drivers behind isotopic variance specific to a given animal and geographic context can enhance inferences of geolocation as well as foraging behaviour, and can be applied to any mobile predator. Models can be relativey simple or complex and multi-layered depending on the level of ecological realism required. Future investigations can use other isoscapes, including terrestrial isoscapes and more complex or different movement models.

AB I defend the view that we should not overintellectualize the mind. Non-human animals can occupy islands of practical rationality: they can have context-bound reasons for action even though they lack full conceptual abilities. Holism and the possibility of mistake are required for such reasons to be the agent's reasons, but these requirements can be met in the absence of inferential promiscuity. Empirical work with animals is used to illustrate the possibility that reasons for action could be bound to symbolic or social contexts, and connections are made to simulationist accounts of cognitive skills.

AB Deforestation and changes in forest cover are subject to the effects of many factors: economic, social, cultural, political, and environmental and their interactions. To assess these factors, one should necessarily know their nature and then model them. Nowadays many models have been introduced to explore deforestation, however most of them are based on past events and do not pay enough attention to socioeconomic factors. Moreover, considering the future is sometimes absent in those models. The present study develops an agent-based model for studying deforestation and changes in forest land cover using a case study. The model assesses deforestation in the past and then concentrates on the future of forest land cover. The study area is located in the north of Iran. The socioeconomic factors considered in this research as agents are farmers, ranchers and lumberjacks. The information and statistics of the agents were gathered over 10 years and so their manner in the forest was simulated. To validate the model, satellite imagery was used. The comparison between the simulated forest and the real one shows the power of the model as being 76% correct considering the Kappa coefficient. The results of forecasting reveal that the forest land cover will be reduced by 189 ha in 10 years' time. Also the results show that in the study area the ranchers have more severe effects on deforestation than the beneficiaries.

AB In a recent paper List, Elsholtz and Seeley (List et al., 2009) have devised an agent-based model of the nest-choice dynamics in swarms of honeybees, and have concluded that both interdependence and independence are needed for the bees to reach a consensus on the best nest site. We here present a simplified version of the model which can be treated analytically with the tools of statistical physics and which largely has the same features as the original dynamics. Based on our analytical approaches it is possible to characterize the co-ordination outcome exactly on the deterministic level, and to a good approximation if stochastic effects are taken into account, reducing the need for computer simulations on the agent-based level. In the second part of the paper we present a spatial extension, and show that transient non-trivial patterns emerge, before consensus is reached. Approaches in terms of Langevin equations for continuous field variables are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present results from experimental asset markets and simulations in which traders are asymmetrically informed about the fundamental value of an asset. To control for learning we run the experimental markets three times with identical subjects at identical information levels. With questionnaires we further check whether the results are driven by subjects' overconfidence. To obtain benchmarks and to measure the impact of the asymmetric information structure on traders' abnormal returns, we run two simulation settings. In the experimental markets insiders outperform the market and uninformed computerized random traders perform equally well compared to average informed traders. This is in line with the results of the equilibrium simulation in which agents choose between a random strategy and their fundamental strategy until equilibrium is reached. Similar to the equilibrium simulation, insiders mainly use a fundamental strategy while average and weak informed subjects ignore the fundamental information given to them. Our benchmark simulations also show that the latter would have ended up worse if they would have used their fundamental information in the experiment. When looking for behavioral explanations we find no evidence for overconfidence and learning in the markets, thus concluding that the information structure is the main driver of our results.?

   Simulations
AB Agent-based modeling is a technique for modeling dynamic systems from the bottom up. Individual elements of the system are represented computationally as agents. The system-level behaviors emerge from the micro-level interactions of the agents. Contemporary state-of-the-art agent-based modeling toolkits are essentially discrete-event simulators designed to execute serially on the Central Processing Unit (CPU). They simulate Agent-Based Models (ABMs) by executing agent actions one at a time. In addition to imposing an un-natural execution order, these toolkits have limited scalability. In this article, we investigate data-parallel computer architectures such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to simulate large scale ABMs. We have developed a series of efficient, data parallel algorithms for handling environment updates, various agent interactions, agent death and replication, and gathering statistics. We present three fundamental innovations that provide unprecedented scalability. The first is a novel stochastic memory allocator which enables parallel agent replication in O(1) average time. The second is a technique for resolving precedence constraints for agent actions in parallel. The third is a method that uses specialized graphics hardware, to gather and process statistical measures. These techniques have been implemented on a modern day GPU resulting in a substantial performance increase. We believe that our system is the first ever completely GPU based agent simulation framework. Although GPUs are the focus of our current implementations, our techniques can easily be adapted to other data-parallel architectures. We have benchmarked our framework against contemporary toolkits using two popular ABMs, namely, SugarScape and StupidModel.

AB This paper presents the finding of the investigation on the behaviour of metal removal and recovery using insoluble starch xanthate. It is hypothesized that metal-xanthate interaction is a net result of the two simultaneous reactions - (i) reversible complexation of metal with xanthate groups, and (ii) decomposition of the xanthates. The affinity, and also the selectivity sequence of metals for xanthate groups is postulated to follow the reverse order of metal-ethyl xanthate solubilities. Further decomposition of xanthates is viewed advantageous for metal recovery. Metal recovery is predicted to follow reverse order of metal selectivity for xanthates. Results of the laboratory experiments carried out on insoluble starch (corn) xanthate are used to test the hypothesis. The selectivity of metals for ISX follows the sequence Hg(II)>Cu(II)>Cd(II)>Ni(II) which correlates with metal-ethyl xanthate Ksp values. The recovery of metals from metal-ISX sludge is attempted by using mineral acids (hydrochloric, sulfuric and nitric), oxidizing agents (chlorine solution and hydrogen peroxide) and eluting agent (EDTA). The results of metal removal and recovery are in accordance with the proposed hypothesis. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

AB Numerical simulations are reported on the Bonabeau model on a fully connected graph, where spatial degrees of freedom are absent. The control parameter is the memory factor f. The phase transition is observed at the dispersion of the agents power h(i). The critical value f(C) shows a hysteretic behavior with respect to the initial distribution of h(i). f(C) decreases with the system size; this decrease can be compensated by a greater number of fights between a global reduction of the distribution width of h(i). The latter step is equivalent to a partial forgetting.

AB But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid. He's not to be allowed to fall into his grave like an old dog. Attention, attention must be finally paid to such a person. Arthur Miller Work in the fields of bioethics and public health ethics over several decades has been theoretically diverse, but particular styles of theorizing, let alone individual theories, do have distinctive philosophical assumptions and discursive characteristics. For example, in the domain of clinical bioethics a strong emphasis has been given to respect for autonomous will-formation by individuals in medical decisions and behavioral choices directly affecting them. In the domain of public health ethics and policy bioethics, where debates over issues such as health access and financing and over mandatory vaccination policies are ongoing, there is a clash between an individualistic understanding of rights, liberty, and privacy, on the one hand, and a communitarian understanding of the common good and the health and well-being of society as a whole, on the other. Cutting across this spectrum of individualism and holism, there is another discernable array of approaches to theorizing and concept formation in bioethics. Two in particular are pertinent to this article. One may be called an 'applied' mode of bioethics, which is focused on applying moral principles and rules to specific situations of action and choice. A contrasting 'relational' mode of bioethics seeks to present normative interpretations of historically embedded patterns of agency, interdependency, and institutional structures of power. To be sure, many specific works of bioethics utilize both an applied and a relational approach, but I believe that this distinction is heuristically useful. It can alert us to the fact that seemingly univocal concepts, such as autonomy, justice, equality, dignity, and personhood, carry a different meaning when they are theorized as principles to be applied from when they are theorized as practices to be interpreted. In this article my aim is to advance the discussion of relational approaches within bioethics by an interpretive analysis of the concept of solidarity and the concept of care when seen as modes of moral and political practice. I single out solidarity for this discussion because the range of moral questions traditionally associated with the concept are normatively integral to many key issues with which health policy and public health must deal-such as just access to healthcare, civic and financial support for social insurance and social welfare policies, and the intergenerational justice issues that bedevil the transition to an aging society and the mitigation of global climate change. In bioethics and public health ethics today, solidarity should be taken seriously and not dismissed as an obsolete idea from a bygone political era, and a recent surge of interest in the concept attests to this. On the other hand, care is an extremely influential normative concept in bioethics and has been for several decades. But the praxis and institutional support for care, no less than those of solidarity, are vulnerable in the current ideological climate and need to be supported discursively and politically. The practices of care are also essential to the core problems with which health policy and public health must grapple.
   I believe that solidarity and care offer instructive constitutive contexts within which the moral identity of persons is grounded and articulated in recognition, affirming the moral standing of those oppressed as equal members of a moral community, and in attention, attesting to the moral presence and considerability of those vulnerable and in need. Solidarity constitutes just affirmation of the other as subject, not merely object; care constitutes just attention to the other in a cognate way as subject, not object. This recognition of, and attention paid to, persons as moral subjects, in turn, can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. As Carol Gould observes concerning solidarity on this score: 'the proliferation of solidarity relations that establish commonalities across differences, along with the linkages that develop among individuals and groups within solidarity movements, help to construct more universalistic conceptions of our obligations to each other.' Though much has been written on the protean concepts of solidarity and care, much still remains to be seen and said, for their ethical meaning and political significance change as they develop and manifest themselves in action over time. My discussion explores how persons and groups are recognized within the practices of solidarity and care; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The guiding thread is right recognition of the full ethical standing of other human beings as subjects rather than as objects. Just recognition of moral standing and moral attention in solidarity and care is my explicit focus, finding the moral imagination and political will to sustain them, my background theme. Relational bioethics is a conceptually dynamic and rather eclectic field today, frequently drawing on paradigm-shifting work in moral and political philosophy and on conceptual innovations ongoing in the humanities and the social sciences, including feminist theories, critical theories of various kinds, and orientations informed by philosophical pragmatism and hermeneutics, among others. Inspired by several cognate modes of critical discourse, relational theorizing has turned away from both methodological and ethical individualism. Often, it is more concerned with diachronic (streaming over time) social practices than with synchronic (snapshot in time) individual acts. It favors what Margaret Urban Walker has called the 'expressive-collaborative' model of morality over the 'theoretical-juridical' model. It strives to place the agency of individuals within a constitutive context of meaning and interdependence. This context includes both dyadic and small group transactions among persons in direct contact and social, structural interdependencies growing out of institutionalized forms of power. Relational theorizing is a space of historical and cultural embeddedness and embodied living in the natural, material world.
   Moreover, due to this contextual perspective, relational theorizing and its discourse are reflexive in questioning their own philosophical grounding and epistemic legitimacy, and they are willing to move away from once solid convictions concerning objectivity, impartiality, and rational authority. All theory and praxis, on this view-including bioethics-inevitably reflects some positional perspective, especially when it most strenuously claims not to, and the best that can be done is to sustain a continuing engagement with different values and viewpoints over time. Closure of conflicting interpretations in the public space of question and answer is apt to be provisional and contingent. While chastening, this need not be an epistemological loss. Within such a critical reflexivity, possibilities open up for new ways of thinking about the basic object of study of ethics and for an emphasis on substantive aspects of ethical agency and value that have been relatively neglected heretofore. The object of study in bioethics (or in ethics generally) or in social science is not intuitively given or logically or methodologically determined. Settling on what should be taken as the unit of ethics analysis is the result of an on-going, contested process of interpretation, partly derived from available theoretical concepts, partly from the exercise of experience-based practical judgment. As social theorist Craig Calhoun argues, concerning this contest, we should 'see the process as basic and never ending, and [subject] it to our continuing attention, rather than [imagine] that it is settled once and for all'. When bioethics focuses on relational practices, its designated object of study becomes those patterns and structures of interrelated activity, choice, and the exercise of power in time. These patterns are understood dynamically, as well as diachronically, with emergent properties and functions taking shape contingently rather than deterministically. Dynamic patterns in social life and human action may at times be spontaneous or random. However, when these patterns endure they comprise 'practices', which may be defined as rule-based, value-laden forms of agency and activity in which diverse human capabilities or potentialities are actualized in the social and material worlds. Let us consider the elements of this definition more fully. First, social practices are structured sociologically by roles and relationships involving authority, power, distribution, and exchange. Governments, corporations, and hospitals are examples of institutionalized structures where social practices of various kinds take place. Social practices are also structured normatively by various conceptions of rightness, goodness, and value. Finally, social practices are experienced within lifeworlds of social-cultural meanings, where action-guiding reasons and motivations are formed, culturally mediated self- and group-identities are shaped, and ongoing reinterpretation of roles and relationships takes place. How are social practices so conceived possible and sustainable? Here the theoretical mediation between individualistic and communitarian orientations takes place. Diachronic social practices are made possible by moral agents who possess the ability to interpretively apprehend what other human beings are thinking in and through their agency, and to read the meaning such expressive agency conveys among agents as they interact together.
   A moral philosophy that took human beings to be radically solipsistic and opaque to one another would be unable to account for, let alone justify, its own discourse. A theory of practices presupposes the possibility of social communication and cultural hermeneutics. A practice is a form of activity that is valued in a society and governed by ethical norms. By engaging in these orderly, yet living, flexible activities, individuals pursue the attainment of excellence and seek to actualize potential capabilities. In this way, cultures and societies provide pathways for the development of flourishing lives well lived. It is through practices that virtues of character are developed, rights are respected and duties fulfilled, and beneficial collective consequences are pursued and obtained. To be sure, practices are conceptually constructed or 'theorized', as are notions like autonomous reason, but they are grounded in ongoing cultural traditions and experimental or innovative new modes of social cooperation. Practices are both embodied and enacted. In the embodiment of practices, they are informed by tacit knowing or habitus-Pierre Bourdieu stresses their phenomenological and pre-reflective aspects. In the enactment of practices, evaluative deliberations take place and reflective judgments are arrived at that shape future activity and the structure of subsequent lives-Alasdair MacIntyre stresses their aspects that mirror Aristotle's notion of phronesis or practical judgment. Drawing explicitly on the work of Simone Weil and implicitly on Emmanuel Levinas, David Wiggins suggestively and rather effusively locates solidarity at 'the root of the ethical'. His essay can be read as a strong reinterpretation of the object of ethical analysis or the moral point of view. He is not interested in offering a stipulative definition of solidarity or a classification of its various types. Solidarity names a fundamental awareness, arbitrary and uncalculating, and an ability to respond to a call to ethical action in the presence of another in peril-another who is a moral subject, a being with a visage, a gaze, an ontological claim to stake, a political inheritance to claim, a place of membership rightfully to occupy. In tune with considerations of this sort, I posit right recognition and attention at the center of my analysis of solidarity and care as moral practices. My approach is a modification of what has been called 'interpretive phenomenology' and has been well developed in the literature of nursing and nursing ethics. While it is clearly well designed for the study of care, I believe it can also throw important light on solidarity. Like philosophical phenomenology more broadly, interpretive phenomenology seeks to offer a deeper understanding of intentional activity and its aim than agents themselves may explicitly possess; an understanding that may be more perspicacious than their own sense of what they are doing or bringing about. The following characterization of the general approach by Patricia Benner informs my discussion of solidarity and care: The understanding sought in interpretive phenomenology considers historical change, transformations, gains, losses, temporality, and context horizontal ellipsis The ethos embedded in [interpretive] phenomenology is respect for the social and cultural nature of being human. Human practices, skills, habits, meanings, and, in particular, recognition practices allow for the other to be encountered and made visible.
   When unarticulated, taken-for-granted practices and meanings fade from our social ecology and the social fabric of our lives, and we lose what they enable us to see, create, and represent. As I seek to develop it, this interpretive approach involves seeing human beings and doings in and through relationships of recognition, mutuality, respect and concern, need and vulnerability. In this relational dynamic, the watchword is the variety, not uniformity, of transactional agency and interdependent positions and projects. The context for the importance of right recognition and attention in solidarity and care is pluralism, reflexive perspectivalism, and a restructuring of economic and social institutions that would open society to new forms of inclusive, discursive engagement. Solidarity promotes these conditions and values as a future demand and promise; care honors them as a precondition for the possibility of the healing and meaning it facilitates. Perhaps I can clear the way for my account of solidarity offered below by briefly mentioning some contrasting and complementary approaches. In recent studies of solidarity, two overlapping concerns have been salient. One is to counter interpretations of solidarity that make it unduly insular and defined by exclusive, closed bonds of shared experience or loyalty. The other is to counter interpretations of solidarity that render it unduly political in the sense of being instrumental and strategic rather than viewing it as a form of life that can give expression to a normative moral or political ideal. The first problem of overly thick solidarity in which certain beliefs and values are so deeply shared that they are beyond debate, is addressed by Jodi Dean. She presents a critique of what she calls 'conventional solidarity', and defines a counter-notion of 'reflective solidarity'-a space of mutuality in which in which genuine difference, discursive conflict, and pluralism would be at home and neither uncritical consensus nor the predominance of only one group of voices would prevail. Focusing on the second problem, Carol Gould and Craig Calhoun both seek ways of introjecting a cosmopolitan orientation into the practice of solidarity. Gould does so by aligning it with justice and human rights in the formation of global networks of political activity. And Calhoun, whose emphasis is more on discursive agency, does so by exploring how a more universal kind of solidarity can emerge from the ongoing discourse within the public sphere. In contrast to these concerns that the bonds of solidarity will be overly tight and narrowly nationalistic, ethnic or localized, Avery Kolers is concerned that bonds of solidarity will not be thick enough to override the primacy of individual judgment and conscience. Then the practice of solidarity will be too weak and will ultimately break down into something irresolute and individualistically self-serving, whether in the authentic form of Quaker witness inspired by inner light or the inauthentic moral narcissism of radical chic. 'Conscience just isn't enough to enable us to comprehend the nature of grave evils or our role in them,' he writes. 'Ultimately we must overcome conscience in favor of solidarity horizontal ellipsis Conscience is directed at ensuring one's own moral integrity rather than at fostering the political movement that could secure moral results that challenge one's standing.
   ' Solidarity on Kolers's view is about taking sides and deferring to the views of others concerning why and how their rights and interests should prevail. It is a political practice that attempts to achieve moral outcomes, rather than one that is constitutive of moral norms. It gives voice primarily to those for whom solidarity is enacted, rather than containing within its own practice the standard of parity of voice and agency toward which it aims as an achieved political condition for all. Thus Kolers defines solidarity as 'reason-driven political action on other's terms'. This appeal to deference sets him apart from the more dialogic and egalitarian interaction envisioned by Dean, Gould, and Calhoun in their various ways. He is taken by the danger that both reflective or dialogic communication and the self-correcting function of networks of solidarity will subtly reinforce forms of domination and power instead of overcoming them. By integrating the notion of right recognition of the moral standing of others, I am trying to understand thick relationships of community and more abstract and principled commitments to justice and respect for persons as orientations that can mutually inform and refine one another. My strategy is to conceptualize the practice of solidarity in developmental and transformational ways so that the practice of solidarity contains within itself a shaping of moral psychology and moral learning, from relatively thin commitments at first, to increasingly strong commitments over time, as a deeper understanding of the other fuels a kind of political and ethical maturity in oneself. Important groundwork for the perspective on solidarity that I offer here has been laid by Barbara Prainsack and Alena Buyx, whose work provides an institutional and structural analysis of solidarity, distinguishing among various levels of social organization within which it can be practiced. I agree that in understanding solidarity as a practice one cannot ignore the interaction between agency and the institutional structures within which agency takes place. Nor should one take solidarity as an abstract regulative idea rather than a concept whose philosophical and motivational force develops in and through active social practices. Nonetheless, my own approach tends to be more moral psychological, stressing the cognitive and motivational bases for a growth of understanding and cooperation among self and other in the practice of solidarity. Among those actively working on the concept, my thinking about solidarity is perhaps closest to that of Andrew Mason, who is primarily interested in the concept and practices of community, but who crucially brings community and solidarity into close theoretical proximity. He offers a study of what might be called 'comparative relationalities', and I am attempting to follow along these lines here with a comparative discussion of solidarity and care. For his part, Mason deploys solidarity and community together not so much by characterizing solidarity as more intense and intimate than it is often taken to be, nor by making community less so, but by circumventing a dichotomous view (the legacy, one might say, of Aristotle and Kant alike) altogether. He builds solidarity into a normative conception of community, and his formulation is worth considering at length: A community is not just a group of people who share a range of values and a way of life, identify with the group and its practices, and recognize each other as fellow members.
   In order for a group to constitute a community in the moralized sense, two further conditions need to be met. First, there must be solidarity between its members. 'Solidarity' is a multiply ambiguous notion, but in the sense I intend it consists in mutual concern: minimally this means that members must give each other's interests some non-instrumental weight in their practical reasoning. horizontal ellipsis Second, there must be no systematic exploitation or (on some versions) no systematic injustice. My own specific concern is to accentuate the normative aspects of this type of interpretation of the practices of solidarity and care: how persons and groups are recognized within these practices; what stance or posture persons and groups take toward one another; and how their standing as free and equal members of a moral community is constituted and sustained by these practices. The practice of solidarity begins with the latent possibilities of a given place at a given time. It builds on senses of historical memory and tradition, and it feeds on the gratitude felt when one remembers the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life in the past, or when one has the moral imagination to foresee the contributions that newcomers can make in the future. Solidarity begins with the recognition of reciprocal and symbiotic interdependence among members of a moral community and then intervenes in-interrupts-an ongoing community when it is unjustly exclusionary and refuses to recognize the moral standing of some within it. Solidarity inherently leads us to view our own lives and agency as bound together with the rights, well-being, health, and dignity of others here and now. I take the fundamental gesture and stance of solidarity to be standing up beside another, thereby signaling publicly one's recognition of that person's (or group's) moral standing. In addition, there are three distinct postures agents assume toward others whose moral standing is in need of defense. These may be called standing up for, standing up with, and standing up as.Standing up for. This mode of solidarity assumes the stance of advocacy. It involves assisting, defending, and pleading the cause of the other. It stands up against exclusion and oppression. In general discussions of solidarity, the other is often taken to be a stranger, but that is not necessary; it makes perfect sense to talk about being in solidarity with friends and acquaintances. Moreover, the other need not be a human individual: one can stand up for other species, an ecosystem, or a cultural way of life. What is crucial is that there is some kind of power or knowledge differential between self and other in a relationship of solidarity and some kind of injustice or danger impinging upon the life of the other. This kind of solidarity can advocate for improved treatment or benefits for an oppressed or vulnerable group, but does not necessarily challenge the underlying basis for their subordinate social status. Yet, if it does not undermine structural inequalities, standing up for solidarity can perpetuate subordination rather than achieve equality.Standing up with. Solidarity as standing up with takes another step in the recognition of moral standing. Moving from the standpoint for to the standpoint with requires deeper engagement with the experience and lifeworld of the other.
   The difference created by the specificity of lifeworlds nonetheless resides within an overarching interpretive commonality, namely, the ability to understand lifeworlds other than one's own. Without such understanding, others cannot truly be treated with respect, they can only be tolerated, benignly neglected, not interfered with. This closer understanding can tend to humanize and personalize the relationship further, and the potential benefit becomes more reciprocal. Those who stand with others may find their own initial prejudgments concerning others transformed by the encounter. Those who practice solidarity must open themselves to the opportunity-and risk-it poses. Relating to other people or groups in the specificity of their values and vocabularies of self-interpretation can simultaneously develop respect for the specific standpoints of others. It can also enable a greater capacity for intercultural and transpersonal interpretive understanding broadly within a democratic political culture and way of life.Standing up as. The third standpoint is solidarity as standing up as. Obviously this suggests a yet stronger degree of identification between the providers of solidaristic support and the recipients of such support. The solidarity of standing up as involves finding a kind of covering connection that does not negate diversity among individuals at all, but rather establishes the grounds of its respect, protection, and perpetuation. To move through the trajectory of solidarity is to move in the direction of greater imaginative creativity and range in the moral life. Standing up for depends upon a kind of abstract moral commitment to support the application of general norms to the life situation of the other as a being with a certain inherent moral status. It thereby embraces shared moral norms (equal protection of the law, universal human rights), but without necessarily embracing the lived reality and distinct perspectives of the other. Standing up with involves adopting a perspective that is more internal to the lifeworld and the contextually meaningful agency of the other. Standing up as returns to generality, in the sense of a recognition of common humanity, a global or planetary membership, but also moves one imaginatively more deeply into a comprehension of difference and the distinctive individuality of the other. As the moral recognition of the other is altered by this interpretive journey, so is the moral imagination of the self. Arguably a growth in one's capacity to project oneself imaginatively into the perspective and viewpoint of the other person, and a growth in moral awareness or the ability to see connections previously unseen are plausible outcomes of the interpretive transformation effected by the trajectory of solidarity. The practices of solidarity mainly arise in the face of morally aberrant and unjust situations that are stifling human potential and where those being oppressed or suppressed need mobilized support and recognition. What the recipients of solidarity need, and the agents of solidarity provide, is affirmation and tangible support. In contrast, what the recipients of care need, and the agents of care provide, is attention. Though closely related and mutually reinforcing in many ways, solidarity and care are not the same, as affirmation and attention are different stances with different moral significance and developmental potentials. The practices of care are premised on situations that are neither aberrant nor unjust per se but are an inherent part of human species-being.
   Like solidarity, care also deepens the moral imagination of both those who care for others and those who are cared for by others. If focusing on solidarity shifts away from individualism and independence toward mutuality and interdependence, focusing on care shifts away from the individualism of self-reliance to an individuality validated by reliance on others. The practices of care are called forth where a common background condition of potential fragility, vulnerability, insufficiency, and mortality take center stage in the lives of persons in need or trouble and in the lives of those around them. Care offers a universalism that is concrete and thick. It is quite possible to imagine (and to find close empirical approximations of) societies where solidarity is absent. Not so with care. Even the subjugated and impoverished society of the Ik so strikingly (and controversially) described by Colin Turnbull, retained ways of caring for their very young, if not for their very old. They almost, but not quite, lost their cultural concept of care. Care theorists, such as Eva Feder Kittay, point out that universalism is biologically grounded on the necessity of maternal care. Every living human being has in common the fact that once they were cared for by someone (female or male) who took on a mothering role and relationship with them. This commonality extends backward in time. All persons who cared as a mother for a child were able to do so only because mothering had been extended to them by a previous generation. Human society fundamentally depends on the production and reproduction of this structure of care-giving roles and relationships. Equality, Kittay argues, is not based on properties that an individual possesses by virtue of who that individual is, but instead on properties that one possesses by virtue of properties that another person has or once had. In keeping with this, care theorist Joan Tronto also views care as a concrete universal, or a 'species activity' and has proposed that caring: includes everything that we do to maintain, continue, and repair our 'world' so that we can live in it as well as possible. That world includes our bodies, our selves, and our environment, all of which we seek to interweave in a complex, life-sustaining web. This provides yet another reason to distinguish between solidarity and care. Solidarity is based on who the other is as an individual human being and on 'properties' they possess, if by properties we mean something like their moral standing and considerability, their entitlement to dignity and to respect for their human rights. When it comes to care, however, we are dealing not so much with recognition due to persons as with the ongoing, intergenerational, evolutionary web of living that all practices of care at any given moment are a part of. Solidarity is a response that unjustly denied recognition and moral standing calls for. Caring is a response that need calls forth, drawing on cognitive commitments and emotional capabilities that previous practices of caring have made possible. Care, like all the practices that relational bioethics examines and evaluates, should not be defined as good or just in all circumstances and in all its forms. The important work of ethical specification and judgment is skipped over when we equate care with virtues such as agape (selfless love of the other) and caritas (charity), or with social emotions such as other-regarding altruism or sympathy.
   Thus it is important to ask what substantive values should inform caring as a moral practice and its effects. How best to describe the stance and intentionality of caring, its transformative moral psychological effects on agents of care and recipients, and its role in governing structural and institutional power so as to mitigate the tension between social order and social diversity? With these questions in mind, I turn again to construct a developmental moral phenomenology of the practice of care. Before presenting my own account, I should note that Tronto has already offered something akin to what I have in mind. She distinguishes among caring about, taking care of, care giving, and care receiving. Caring about denotes the initial recognition of another's need for care. Taking care of involves assuming responsibility for the determined need of the other and undertaking steps to meet that need. Care giving involves assuming a more direct, physical, and intimate role in the practices of care. Need can be recognized and attended to in many distanced and indirect ways, but giving care is hands-on, physical work. It signifies a new level of commitment and engagement than the other forms the activity of care can take. Finally, care receiving as a distinct component of the practice of care recognizes that the recipient will often be a responsive agent in the care relationship. These distinctions are helpful, particularly in the context of Tronto's concern with the ethically and democratically appropriate institutionalization of the practices of care in a society as a whole. I seek, on the other hand, to explore a structured growth of moral awareness that may be illuminating to ascribe to the praxis of care, as I have tried to do with solidarity. The fundamental stance of the practice of care is to pay attention to. Just as right recognition of personhood and moral standing is fundamental to the solidaristic posture of standing up beside, so too the directed gaze of attention is fundamental to the posture of care. When someone, a student or a distracted friend during a conversation, is called upon to pay attention, their focus shifts and even their bodily orientation may change: they open their eyes, they listen actively, they lean in. Right recognition here comes from becoming visible to another as a sign of acknowledgment and respect. In some cultures and settings, paying attention to someone takes the form of making eye contact as a sign of such respect; in others, deliberately not making eye contact has the same significance. Both are gestures and postures of care. In this sense, the propensity to attend, to care, is not primarily biological or reflexive; it is a mode of culturally meaningful agency, it is a wink rather than a blink. Standing up beside the oppressed-and up against the oppressor-is a gesture that extracts 'payment' in the form of public witness, which can incur negative sanctions or give one an aura of virtue by association. Paying attention to is also not cost-free in terms of its effects on plans in one's life or on other persons, whom the practice of care displaces from one's attention. Solidarity sets priorities, care balances and reshuffles them. Finally, on this account of the moral phenomenology of care, the presence of physical or psychological limitation or impairment is not primarily what calls forth the duty to care, although it is often the trigger for an intensified focus of attention and the commencement of new caring relationships and services.
   The moral raison d'etre of paying attention to is the evil of invisibility, disregard, and abandonment. Willie Loman's wife, Linda, understood this in Death of a Salesman, when she called upon her son to care for his father. 'Attention must be paid.' She was not asking him to help Willie with his medications. The need for care is indeed universal, both biologically and culturally, because it responds to vulnerability, suffering, and mortality. However, being erased and deserted, reduced to bare self-reliance, having to fend for oneself alone-these conditions are neither universal nor inevitable. They are potentials in the human condition that the practice of care was morally and culturally invented to prevent, just as the practice of solidarity was invented to prevent the evil of misprision. And failure to prevent these evils not only diminishes the humanity of those who did not receive attention and recognition, but also diminishes those who failed to give them. There are three distinct postures that agents of care assume toward others in need. No doubt there are many more, but I want to single these out here. I shall call them attentive rehabilitation, attentive companionship, and attentive commitment. These moments in the practices of care are relational interactions between individuals or groups, with each side having voice (to the extent possible) and engaging in a give and take of initiative and response. However, as with my analysis of solidarity, this is presented primarily from the perspective of the agent of care rather than the other receiving care.Attentive rehabilitation of the other. To care is to take steps to rehabilitate or return the other in need to a situation of enhanced living or, as Tronto aptly puts it, repairing the other's world. If return to the status quo ante is impossible, rehabilitative attention becomes a project of helping to construct a new mode of life that will be meaningful and sustainable for the other, who will then go on to live with-and in spite of-social or physical limitations. This is the aspect of care that is perhaps closest to care giving and care provision in a professional sense. It is certainly based on respectful recognition of the moral standing of the patient, but its main hallmark is efficacy in the restoration of function. It is also the aspect of care that is closest in intention to solidarity, for the attention paid here is largely affirming, and the line I have tried to draw between affirmation and attention is blurred. But to probe more deeply into the dimensions of care that have to do with suffering and loss of self and meaning, we need to move beyond restoration and repair.Attentive companionship with and for the other. Companionship is an aspect of care that includes, but is not limited to, physically spending time together and direct communication, as humanly important as they are. Companionship, in the sense I am trying to get at, lays the groundwork for a developing sense of promise, presence, and assurance in the minds and hearts of both the agent of care and the other. Companionship recognizes the evil of abandonment and is one of the most powerful answering responses to this evil on behalf of the human good. It is difficult to say what concept best conveys the aspect of care that can provide this reassurance and abiding sense of connection between and among individuals and groups. Promise connotes perhaps too formal and legalistic a sense. Loyalty connotes something perhaps overly psychological.
   Friendship is tempting but again may suggest an affection or emotional bond that is stronger than I want to convey for this aspect of care.In any case, the reassurance of a promise of non-abandonment is what is built into this mode of attentiveness. Note that this reassurance applies, albeit differently, to both the agent and the recipient of care. My notion is that the suffering experienced by those with unmet needs for care takes place against an ever-present prospect of being left alone. Those young and well often ask to be left alone, not realizing truly what they are inviting, when what they actually want is more privacy and a less intrusive care presence. Caring as attentive companionship makes the grim prospect of abandonment recede in the other's imagination and hence palliates the suffering-often in the form of dread, anxiety, and loss of self-confidence and self-esteem-they experience.To move into a mode of attentive companionship in the care process is clearly a step beyond rehabilitation. What prompts such a step, or better, what is germinated by it? My answer is a new sense of gratitude in the moral imagination of the agent of care. It may be the gratitude felt for the newly arrived life of an infant, and the realization of how vital the assurance of non-abandonment will be to the developmental flourishing of the child. It may be intergenerational gratitude that is reciprocal, as when adult children alter their own lives and priorities to assure companionship to an ailing or lonely parent. It may be a sense of obligation or debt based on remembering the constructive activities of the other, which indirectly has been of significant social and individual benefit to the attentive companion. This is the case, for example, in care-providing institutions that serve military veterans, and this moral sensibility could indeed be extended to all, military and non-military alike, who have sacrificed for the sake of public service. Or it may be itself a form of solidarity at the heart of the practice of care, because it is based on recognition of the human value of rescuing a person from fear and despair to give them a better chance of flourishing in the future.Attentive commitment to the other. This represents a stronger and deeper sense of caring connection, in which the caring agent has internalized a stronger sense of duty and embraced a longer-term, and maybe more arduous, promise to the care recipient. However, the notion of care as attentive commitment to, precisely because it takes in a longer time horizon, can bring out the structural and public policy dimensions of the practice of care, as well. The fact is that individuals and private groups (like families) cannot actually sustain this modality of care without significant social, economic, and institutional support. Part of their commitment would be to work toward building systems of public provision for care services in their role as democratic citizens. Indeed, the politics of social insurance and long-term care policy in the United States would be altered if millions of unpaid family care givers could find the information, time, and energy to mobilize in favor of new financing and service delivery systems.
   To the extent that we want to develop an ecology of care-the creation of a cultural ethos and an institutional framework that promotes and supports practices of care not only in the household and family but also in the public sphere and the civil society-then we must link practices of care to forms of democratic political reform to make society more just, equitable, and conducive to health and well-being. Within the broader political economy and social welfare policy of a nation, paying attention in private life and in public policy-civic care-can reinforce one another. The practice of care can sometimes be imperious and domineering. And all too often caring becomes merely custodial. Yet, when it realizes its full moral promise, care offers nurture, protection, provision, and support for the other. It does not so much domineer as give the person receiving it a new insight about his or her own life. Since the need for care often follows injury, illness, and loss of various kinds, care offers hope through a new way of seeing the positive possibilities present in a given situation. It sustains purpose in the face of diminution. Care among humans is a transaction among individuals who are the authors of their own acts and lives, despite their need, impairment, or limitations. But they are symbiotic, not solipsistic, authors. Like solidarity, care is grounded in the gratitude felt when one recognizes the service and contributions that others have made to one's way of life. And like the practice of solidarity, the practice of care interrupts an ongoing form of life in order to be present with another in the face of their need, vulnerability, and suffering, finally winning through to a life well lived. Solidarity and care can arise developmentally out of an engagement with the vocation of repairing a needful, vulnerable, responsive world. The author declares no conflict of interest. Miller, A.

The terminology related to care is more complex and varied, in English, than that related to solidarity. I have chosen to use the term 'care' rather than resort to terms such as caring, care giving, care providing, and the like. When conjoined with the concept of a practice, care should be understood always to connote a dynamic pattern of agency, intention, and action over time. For my purposes in this article, this pattern and its consequences are more important than specific acts performed within practices of care, such as direct physical assistance with activities of everyday living, psychological assistance, ensuring comfort and safety, and the like. Care is touching, but as John Dewey pointed out, it is also minding. See Boydston, J. A. (Ed.). (2008). Art as experience. In The Later Works of John Dewey, 1925-1953 (Vol. 10, p. 68).

   SOLIDARITY AND CARE SOLIDARITY THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF SOLIDARITY CARE THE MORAL TRAJECTORY OF CARE CONCLUSION CONFLICT OF INTEREST Footnotes Many working in bioethics today are engaging in forms of normative interpretation concerning the meaningful contexts of relational agency and institutional structures of power. Using the framework of relational bioethics, this article focuses on two significant social practices that are significant for health policy and public health: the practices of solidarity and the practices of care. The main argument is that the affirming recognition of, and caring attention paid to, persons as moral subjects can politically motivate a society in three respects. The recognition of solidarity and the attention of care can prompt progressive change toward a democratic willingness: (a) to provide for equal respect for rights and dignity; (b) to provide the social resources and services needed for just health and well-being; and (c) to focus its creativity and wealth on the actualization of potential flourishing of each and all. Solidarity is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from standing up for another, standing up with another, and standing up as another. Care is discussed as a morally developmental stance that moves from the attentive rehabilitation of another, attentive companionship with and for another, and attentive commitment to another.

AB In this paper, we consider one of old-age problems about trade-off relation between homogeneity and diversity. We investigate combat based on agent-based simulation, not conventional mathematical model based on attrition. By introducing synthetic approach and adapting evolutionary learning to action rules that are expressed by a combination of parameters in combat simulation, we focus on the interaction between sets of action rules. For searching how many sets of action rules does work well, we change the number of sets of action rules. And we make statistical analysis and show that there is good intermediate stage between high homogeneity and high diversity in group.

AB Using an agent-based modeling approach, in this paper, we study self-organized dynamics of interacting agents in the presence of chat Bots. Different Bots with tunable 'human-like attributes, which exchange emotional messages with agents, are considered, and the collective emotional behavior of agents is quantitatively analyzed. In particular, using detrended fractal analysis we determine persistent fluctuations and temporal correlations in time series of agent activity and statistics of avalanches carrying emotional messages of agents when Bots favoring positive/negative affects are active. We determine the impact of Bots and identify parameters that can modulate that impact. Our analysis suggests that, by these measures, the emotional Bots induce collective emotion among interacting agents by suitably altering the fractal characteristics of the underlying stochastic process. Positive emotion Bots are slightly more effective than negative emotion Bots. Moreover, Bots which periodically alternate between positive and negative emotion can enhance fluctuations in the system, leading to avalanches of agent messages that are reminiscent of self-organized critical states.

AB Scholars of the policy process offer compelling explanations for patterns in the aggregate-level attention of policymakers. Yet, we have little systematic understanding of the day-to-day behavior of these individuals. Why does a given policymaker, on a given day, decide to focus on one pressing issue while ignoring many others? I approach this question from a cognitive systems perspective and argue that policymakers are highly interdependent actors who are subject to cognitive limits and have incentives to closely monitor the political environment. These tendencies contribute to the emergence of widespread herd behavior in their individual attention to policy issues, a phenomenon I conceptualize as 'issue contagion.' I then utilize the methods of computational social science to build an agentbased simulation model of policymakers' issue attention over time. I also outline three empirical expectations regarding the density of communication ties between actors, the presence of segmented groups (e.g. political parties and coalitions), and the rate at which actors take cues from one another. Through a series of sensitivity tests, I document the internal validity of the model and show that incremental changes in network density, segmentation, and cue-taking all generate clear and visible trends in the frequency of issue contagion events.

AB In order to investigate the effects of binder component on the creep properties of polymer-bonded explosive (PBX), three-point bending creep behaviors of 1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB)-based PBX and its styrene copolymer modified formulation were studied by dynamic mechanical analyzer. The experimental results showed that owing to the addition of reinforcing agent (styrene copolymer) with high glass transition temperature and high mechanical strength, the creep resistance performance of the modified formulation was improved with reduced creep strain and constant creep rate and prolonged creep failure time. A six-element mechanical model was applied to simulate the creep behaviors of TATB-based PBX and its modified formulation. The constitutive equation of creep curves under different conditions were obtained by nonlinear fit. The predicted theoretical results coincided quite well with the experimental data.

AB We demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing the absorption and scattering spectra of micron-scale structures in a turbid medium using a spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (SOCT) system with a bandwidth of 430-650nm. SOCT measurements are taken from phantoms composed of fluorescent microspheres. The absorption and scattering spectra are recovered with proper selections of spatial window width in the post processing step. Furthermore, we present an analysis using numerical OCT simulation based on full-wave solutions of the Maxwell's Equation to elucidate the origination of the multiple peaks in the OCT image for a single microsphere. Finally, we demonstrate the possibility of identifying contrast agents concentrated in micron-sized scale in an SOCT image. Two different types of microspheres in gel phantom are discriminated in 3D volume based on their distinguished absorbent feature. (C) 2009 Optical Society of America

AB Groundwater depletion is arguably one of humanity's greatest sustainability challenges of the 21st century. With Sustainable Development Goals only a decade away, water authorities around the world are in the urgent need for concrete and targeted measures to ensure that communities adhere to groundwater management policies as rapidly and as effectively as possible. In this paper, we combine computational social science, groundwater modelling and empirical data from the World Values Survey to generate future ensembles of hydro-social trajectories under alternative courses of management and social action or inaction. Our simulations shed new light on the role that cultural values can play in shaping the societal trajectories and norms that emerge when resources are either allocated or not sufficiently allocated to monitor compliance, issue fines, engage community leaders, and deter rule-breakers. This study presents a new approach to explore and evaluate the capacity of existing and future management actions to steer groundwater systems towards sustainable trajectories, to forecast the celerity and timing of social transformations at the inter-decadal scale, and to help nations identify the most pertinent management options under institutional, political, social, and/or cultural constraints.

AB Chemical and physical properties of metal nanoparticles (NPs) are determined not only by the synthesis method used to prepare them but also by the experimental conditions under the generation process takes place. One of the most important factors in the synthesis of NPs is the presence of complexing agents in the media that can change the size and shape of the NPs. The significant role of different complexing agents (cyanide, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and ethylenediamine) in the electrochemical formation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) has been analyzed by time-resolved Raman spectroelectrochemistry. Electrochemical and spectroscopic responses, obtained simultaneously, provide suitable information about the changes that occur on the platinum electrode surface during the AgNPs electrodeposition. The morphology of AgNPs has been analyzed by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroelectrochemistry, providing additional information and a detailed view of the electrodeposition process. The influence of the complexing agent used to generate AgNPs has been studied analyzing the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect of the modified substrate. Raman spectra show different SERS behavior depending on the complexing agent and therefore on the AgNPs generated. The relationship between SERS signals and the morphology of AgNPs has been displayed by scanning electron microscopy images. Time-resolved Raman spectroelectrochemistry confirms that chemical mechanism is necessary for SERS effect.

AB The aim was to evaluate, in vitro, the influence of different computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) materials (IPS e.max CAD, Vita Enamic, and Lava Ultimate) and thicknesses (0.6 mm and 1.5 mm) on the fracture resistance of occlusal veneers. Sixty human third molars were prepared to simulate advanced erosion of the occlusal surface, and the teeth were randomly divided into six experimental groups (n=10) according to the material and thickness used to build the veneers. Ten sound teeth formed the control group. The veneers were adhesively luted and submitted to mechanical cyclic loading (1 million cycles at 200-N load). The fracture resistance test was performed in a universal testing machine. The failures were classified as "reparable" and "irreparable." According to two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test, the interaction (material x thickness) was significant (p=0.013). The highest fracture resistance was obtained for IPS e.max CAD at a 1.5-mm thickness (4995 N) and was significantly higher compared to the other experimental groups (p<0.05). The lowest fracture resistance was obtained for Vita Enamic at 0.6 mm (2973 N), although this resistance was not significantly different from those for IPS e.max CAD at 0.6 mm (3067 N), Lava Ultimate at 0.6 mm (3384 N), Vita Enamic at 1.5 mm (3540 N), and Lava Ultimate at 1.5 mm (3584 N) (p> 0.05). The experimental groups did not differ significantly from the sound teeth (3991 N) (p>0.05). The failures were predominantly repairable. The occlusal veneers of IPS e.max CAD, Vita Enamic, and Lava Ultimate, with thicknesses of 0.6 mm and 1.5 mm, obtained fracture resistances similar to those associated with sound teeth.

AB This paper presents a multirobot cooperative event based localization scheme with improved bandwidth usage in a heterogeneous group of mobile robots. The proposed method relies on an agent based framework that defines the communications between robots and on an event based Extended Kalman Filter that performs the cooperative sensor fusion from local, global and relative sources. The event is generated when the pose error covariance exceeds a predefined limit. By this, the robots update the pose using the relative information available only when necessary, using less bandwidth and computational resources when compared to the time based methods, allowing bandwidth allocation for other tasks while extending battery life. The method is tested using a simulation platform developed in the programming language JAVA with a group of differential mobile robots represented by an agent in a JADE framework. The pose estimation performance, error covariance and number of messages exchanged in the communication are measured and used to compare the traditional time based approach with the proposed event based algorithm. Also, the compromise between the accuracy of the localization method and the bandwidth usage is analyzed for different event limits. A final experimental test with two SUMMIT XL robots is shown to validate the simulation results.

AB The recent literature on complex contagions challenges Granovetter's classic hypothesis on the strength of weak ties and argues that, when the actors' choice requires reinforcement from several sources, it is the structure of strong ties that really matters to sustain rapid and wide diffusion. The paper contributes to this debate by reporting on a small-N study that relies on a unique combination of ethnographic data, social network analysis, and computational models. In particular, we investigate two rural populations of Indian and Kenyan potters who have to decide whether to adopt new, objectively more efficient and economically more attractive, technical/stylistic options. Qualitative field data show that religious sub-communities within the Indian and Kenyan populations exhibit markedly different diffusion rates and speed over the last thirty years. To account for these differences, we first analyze empirically observed kinship networks and advice networks, and, then, we recreate the actual aggregate diffusion curves through a series of empirically calibrated agent-based simulations. Combining the two methods, we show that, while single exposure through heterophilious weak ties were sufficient to initiate the diffusion process, large bridges made of strong ties can in fact lead to faster or slower diffusion depending on the type of signals circulating in the network. We conclude that, even in presence of complex contagions, dense local ties cannot be regarded as a sufficient condition for faster diffusion.

AB A large number of acoustic signals from single lipid-shelled Definity (R) (Lantheus Medical Imaging, N. Billerica, MA) microbubbles have been measured using a calibrated microacoustic system, and a unique transient characteristic of resonance has been identified in the onset of scatter. Comparison of the numerically obtained response of microbubbles with acoustic measurements provides good agreement for a soft shell that is characterized by small area dilatation modulus and strain softening behavior, and identifies time to maximum radial excursion and scatter as a robust marker of resonance during transient response. As the sound amplitude increases a two-population pattern emerges in the time delay vs the fundamental acoustic scatter plots, consisting of an initial part pertaining to microbubbles with less than resonant rest radii, which corresponds to the weaker second harmonic resonance, and the dominant resonant envelope pertaining to microbubbles with resonant and greater than resonant rest radii, which corresponds to the primary and subharmonic resonances. Consequently, a wider resonant spectrum is observed. It is a result of the strain softening nature of soft lipid shells, based on which the microbubble sizes corresponding to the above resonances decrease as the sound amplitude increases. This bares an impact on the selection of an optimal microbubble size pertaining to subharmonic imaging. (C) 2018 Acoustical Society of America.

SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS
LA English
DT Article
AB Based on the observance in human society, the satisfaction level of an individual as a result of an obtained payoff depends on personal tendency to some extent; we establish a new model for spatial prisoner's dilemma games. We describe individual satisfaction as a stochastically deviated value around each of the four payoffs stipulated by a payoff matrix, which is maintained throughout the life of a certain agent. When strategy updating, an agent who refers to his own satisfaction level cannot see neighbors' satisfaction levels but can only observe neighbors' accumulated payoffs. By varying the update rule and underlying topology, we perform numerical simulations that reveal cooperation is significantly enhanced by this change. We argue that this enhancement of cooperation is analogous to a stochastic resonance effect, like the payoff noise effects Perc (2006). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB High intensity pulsed ultrasound, interacting with microbubble contrast agents, is potentially useful for drug delivery, cancer treatment, and tissue ablation, among other applications. To establish the fundamental understanding on the interaction of a microbubble (in an infinite volume of water) with an ultrasound pressure field, a numerical study is performed using the boundary element method. The response of the bubble, in terms of its shape at different times, the maximum bubble radius obtained, the oscillation time, the jet velocity, and its translational movement, is studied. The effect of ultrasound intensity and initial bubble size is examined as well. One important outcome is the determination of the conditions under which a clear jet will be formed in a microbubble in its interaction with a specific sound wave. The high speed jet is crucial for the aforementioned intended applications. (C) 2008 Acoustical Society, of America.

ID POWER-LAW TAIL; WEALTH DISTRIBUTION
AB The personal income distribution in China was studied by employing the data from China Household Income Projects (CHIP) between 1990 and 2002. It was observed that the low and middle income regions could be described by the log-normal law, while the large income region could be well fitted by the power law. To characterize these empirical findings, a stochastic interactive model with mean-field approach was discussed, and the analytic result shows that the wealth distribution is of the Pareto type. Then we explored the agent-based model on networks, in which the exchange of wealth among agents depends on their connectivity. Numerical results suggest that the wealth of agents would largely rely on their connectivity, and the Pareto index of the simulated wealth distributions is comparable to those of the empirical data. The Pareto behavior of the tails of the empirical wealth distributions is consistent with that of the 'mean-field' model, as well as numerical simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Polyurethane (PU) is a commonly used insulation material for cold storage warehouses. The insulation performance of PU sandwich panels made from blended blowing agents were reassessed by k-factor measurements and insulation thickness calculation based on the cold warehouse design standard, which has proven the significant impact of blowing agent difference on energy saving. The foam poststability was also evaluated by mathematic profiling. The developed three-dimensional paraboloid model based on gridding measurements has provided a scientific method for panel shrinkage evaluation. Cell microstructure characterization and postgrowth angle coefficients calculation were further performed for better understanding the shrinkage problem at the microscopic level. The foaming process model of continuous panel production was developed based on reactivity profiling characterization which has provided a theoretical solution to panel processing.

AB The colloidal stability, in vitro toxicity, cell association, and in vivo pharmacokinetic behavior of liposomes decorated with monomethoxy-poly(ethylene glycol)-lipids (mPEG-lipids) with different chemical features were comparatively investigated. Structural differences of the mPEG-lipids used in the study included: (a) surface-anchoring moiety [1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE), cholesterol (Chol), and cholane (Chin)]; (b) mPEG molecular weight (2 kDa mPEG and 5 kDa mPEG(114)); and (c) mPEG shape (linear and branched PEG). In vitro results demonstrated that branched (mPEG(114))(2)-DSPE confers the highest stealth properties to liposomes (similar to 31-fold lower cell association than naked liposomes) with respect to all PEGylating agents tested. However, the pharmacokinetic studies showed that the use of cholesterol as anchoring group yields PEGylated liposomes with longer permeance in the circulation and higher systemic bioavailability among the tested formulations. Liposomes decorated with mPEG(114)-Chol had 3.2- and similar to 2.1-fold higher area under curve (AUC) than naked liposomes and branched (mPEG(114))(2)-DSPE-coated liposomes, respectively, which reflects the high stability of this coating agent. By comparing the PEGylating agents with same size, namely, linear 5 kDa PEG derivatives, linear mPEG(114)-DSPE yielded coated liposomes with the best in vitro stealth performance. Nevertheless, the in vivo AUC of liposomes decorated with linear mPEG(114)-DSPE was lower than that obtained with liposomes decorated with linear mPEG(114)-Chol. Computational molecular dynamics modeling provided additional insights that complement the experimental results.

AB Intense underwater sounds caused by military sonar, seismic surveys, and pile driving can harm acoustically sensitive marine mammals. Many jurisdictions require such activities to undergo marine mammal impact assessments to guide mitigation. However, the ability to assess impacts in a rigorous, quantitative way is hindered by large knowledge gaps concerning hearing ability, sensitivity, and behavioral responses to noise exposure. We describe a simulation-based framework, called SAFESIMM (Statistical Algorithms For Estimating the Sonar Influence on Marine Megafauna), that can be used to calculate the numbers of agents (animals) likely to be affected by intense underwater sounds. We illustrate the simulation framework using two species that are likely to be affected by marine renewable energy developments in UK waters: gray seal (Halichoerus grypus) and harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). We investigate three sources of uncertainty: How sound energy is perceived by agents with differing hearing abilities; how agents move in response to noise (i.e., the strength and directionality of their evasive movements); and the way in which these responses may interact with longer term constraints on agent movement. The estimate of received sound exposure level (SEL) is influenced most strongly by the weighting function used to account for the specie's presumed hearing ability. Strongly directional movement away from the sound source can cause modest reductions (similar to 5 dB) in SEL over the short term (periods of less than 10 days). Beyond 10 days, the way in which agents respond to noise exposure has little or no-effect on SEL, unless their movements are constrained by natural boundaries. Most experimental studies of noise impacts have been short-term. However, data are needed on long-term effects because uncertainty about predicted SELs accumulates over time. Synthesis and applications. Simulation frameworks offer a powerful way to explore, understand, and estimate effects of cumulative sound exposure on marine mammals and to quantify associated levels of uncertainty. However, they can often require subjective decisions that have important consequences for management recommendations, and the basis for these decisions must be clearly described.

AB Purpose: Subharmonic intravascular ultrasound imaging (S-IVUS) could visualize the adventitial vasa vasorum, but the high pressure threshold required to incite subharmonic behavior in an ultra-sound contrast agent will compromise sensitivity-a trait that has hampered the clinical use of S-IVUS. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of using coded-chirp excitations to improve the sensitivity and axial resolution of S-IVUS.
   Methods: The subharmonic response of Targestar-p (TM), a commercial microbubble ultrasound contrast agent (UCA), to coded-chirp (5%-20% fractional bandwidth) pulses and narrowband sine-burst (4% fractional bandwidth) pulses was assessed, first using computer simulations and then experimentally. Rectangular windowed excitation pulses with pulse durations ranging from 0.25 to 3 mu s were used in all studies. All experimental studies were performed with a pair of transducers (20 MHz/10 MHz), both with diameter of 6.35 mm and focal length of 50 mm. The size distribution of the UCA was measured with a Casy (TM) Cell counter.
   Results: The simulation predicted a pressure threshold that was an order of magnitude higher than that determined experimentally. However, all other predictions were consistent with the experimental observations. It was predicted that: (1) exciting the agent with chirps would produce stronger subharmonic response relative to those produced by sine-bursts; (2) increasing the fractional bandwidth of coded-chirp excitation would increase the sensitivity of subharmonic imaging; and (3) coded-chirp would increase axial resolution. The experimental results revealed that subharmonic-to-fundamental ratios obtained with chirps were 5.7 dB higher than those produced with sine-bursts of similar duration. The axial resolution achieved with 20% fractional bandwidth chirps was approximately twice that achieved with 4% fractional bandwidth sine-bursts.
   Conclusions: The coded-chirp method is a suitable excitation strategy for subharmonic IVUS imaging. At the 20 MHz transmission frequency and 20% fractional bandwidth, coded-chirp excitation appears to represent the ideal tradeoff between subharmonic strength and axial resolution.

AB The studies were carried out on 120 lambs in the weight range 21-22.5 kg, divided into the following groups control (A); treated with salinomycin 0.6 mg/kg body weight, (B); treated with selenium (Se) - 2 mi of 0.1% solution monthly (C); treated with salinomycin and Se as above (D); treated with toltrazuril 20 mg/kg body weight, twice at the age of 110 and 117 of days (E); and treated with selenium and toltrazuril (F) as above. The selenium level was determined with the Watkinson method. The extensity and intensity of coccidia infection were examined using the Willis-Schlaaf and McMaster methods. The body weight was recorded monthly. The coccidiostats salinomycin and toltrazuril were highly efficient against Eimeria and are suited for coccidiosis prophylaxis in lambs. In particular toltrazuril is active against all intracellular stages, and can be used for controlling and treatment coccidiosis. The use of coccidiostats simultaneously with selenium had increased the body weight gains in lambs. The best results were obtained in experimental groups in which both agents were used. The results of the studies show, that selenium enhances the activity of coccidiostats. It seems to be useful to administer selenium simultaneously with coccidiostats as an agent aiding their efficiency when controlling the coccidiosis.

AB Motivation: Single cells often show stochastic behaviour and variations in the physiological state of individual cells affect the behaviour observed in cell populations. This may be partially explained by variations in the concentration and spatial location of molecules within and in the vicinity of each cell.
   Methods: This paper introduces an agent-based model that represents single-molecule transport through the cellular envelope of Escherichia coli at the micrometre scale. This model enables broader observation of molecular transport throughout the different membrane layers and the study of the effect of molecular concentration in cellular noise. Simulations considered various low molecular weight molecules, i.e. ampicillin, bosentan, coumarin, saquinavir, and terbutaline, and a gradient of molecular concentrations. The model ensured stochasticity in the location of the agents, using diffusing spherical particles with physical dimensions.
   Results: Simulation results were validated against theoretical and experimental data. For example, theoretically, ampicillin molecules take 0.6 s to cross the entire cell envelope, and computational simulations took 0.68 s, 0.68 s, 0.70 s, and 0.69 s, for concentrations of 1.44 mu M, 13.21 mu M, 26.4 mu M and 105.61 mu M, respectively. Replicate standard deviation decreased with growing initial concentrations of the molecules. In turn, no clear relationship could be observed between molecular size and variability.
   Conclusions: This work presented a novel agent-based model to study the effect of the initial concentration of low molecular weight molecules on cellular noise. Cellular noise during molecule diffusion was found to be concentration-dependent and size-independent. The new model holds considerable potential for future, more complex analyses, when emerging experimental data may enable modelling of membrane transport mechanisms.

AB In various agent-based models, the stylized facts of financial markets (unit roots, fat tails, and volatility clustering) have been shown to emerge from the interactions of agents. However, the complexity of these models often limits their analytical accessibility. In this paper we show that even a very simple model of a financial market with heterogeneous interacting agents is capable of reproducing these ubiquitous statistical properties. The simplicity of our approach permits us to derive some analytical insights using concepts from statistical mechanics. In our model, traders are divided into two groups, fundamentalists and chartists, and their interactions are based on a variant of the herding mechanism introduced by A. Kirman (Ants, rationality, and recruitment, Quarterly Journal of Economics 108, 137-156, 1993). The statistical analysis of simulated data points toward long-term dependence in the autocorrelations of squared and absolute returns and hyperbolic decay in the tail of the distribution of raw returns, both with estimated decay parameters in the same range as those of empirical data. Theoretical analysis, however, excludes the possibility of "true" scaling behavior because of the Markovian nature of the underlying process and the boundedness of returns. The model, therefore, only mimics power law behavior. Similarly to the phenomenological volatility models analyzed by LeBaron (Stochastic volatility as a simple generator of apparent financial power laws and long memory, Quantitative Finance 1, 621-631, 2001), the usual statistical tests are not able to distinguish between true and pseudo-scaling laws in the dynamics of our artificial market.

AB With the central effects of serotonin (5-HT) on ejaculation having been relatively established, we investigated the peripheral effects of serotonin on the contractile responses of rat seminal vesicles and vasa deferentia. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were grouped on the basis of the agents administered: serotonin, clomipramine, or fluoxetine. The intraluminal pressures of the seminal vesicles and of the vasa deferentia were measured simultaneously. Control responses to hypogastric nerve stimulation (HNS) were recorded in each animal, and HNS was repeated after drug administration. Expression of the mRNAs of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2C), which have been suggested to be involved in the ejaculation process, were examined by semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Serotonergic agents resulted in the concentration-dependent inhibition of HNS-induced seminal vesicle pressure increases (clomipramine > serotonin > fluoxetine). Vasal pressure responses were effectively inhibited by clomipramine and serotonin, but fluoxetine had no effect. No significant difference was observed in the relative expression levels of 5-HT, receptor mRNA in seminal vesicles and in the vasa deferentia. However, the expression levels of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptor mRNAs were lower in the vasa deferentia than in the seminal vesicles. These in vivo and in vitro experimental results provide evidence for the peripheral role of 5-HT in the regulation of contractile responses of the seminal tract. Regional differences in the distribution of the 5-HT receptor subtypes of the seminal vesicles and the vasa deferentia might contribute to the different responses to serotonergic agents shown by these organs.

AB We demonstrate that weak CH...O hydrogen bonds (HBs) are important host-guest interactions in zeolite assemblies involving structure directing organocations. This type of HB is identified between alkyl groups of the organic structure directing agent (OSDA) and the silica framework in as-synthesized silicalite-1 of complex topology (MFI) using a combination of experimental and theoretical data obtained at low and room temperatures. The 28 weak CH...O HBs, evidenced along dynamics simulation at room temperature, represent 30 % of the energy of the Coulomb electrostatic interaction between OSDA and the zeolite framework. The strongest and most stable HB found here connects the OSDA to the [4(1)5(2)6(2)] cage containing F atoms and should contribute to preserve zeolite topology during crystal growth. An inspection of other as-synthesized zeolites of very different framework topology indicates that the directional CH...O HBs have to be considered when discussing zeolite structure directing phenomena.

AB This article develops identification methods for linear continuous-time symmetric systems, such as electrical network systems, multiagent network systems, and temperature dynamics in buildings. To this end, we formulate three system identification problems for the corresponding discrete-time systems. The first is a least-squares problem in which we wish to minimize the sum of squared errors between the true and model outputs on the product manifold of the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices and two Euclidean spaces. In the second problem, to reduce the search dimensions, the product manifold is replaced with the quotient set under a specified group action by the orthogonal group. In the third problem, the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices in the first problem is replaced by the manifold of matrices with only positive diagonal elements. In particular, we examine the quotient geometry in the second problem. We propose Riemannian conjugate gradient methods for the three problems, and select initial points using a popular subspace method. The effectiveness of our proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical simulations and comparisons with the Gauss-Newton method, which is one of the most popular approach for solving least-squares problems.

DE Sequential decision aggregation; Decision accuracy; Expected decision
   time; Fusion center; Fastest rule; Majority rule
AB This paper proposes and characterizes a sequential decision aggregation system consisting of agents performing binary sequential hypothesis testing and a fusion center which collects the individual decisions and reaches the global decision according to some threshold rule. Individual decision makers' behaviors in the system are influenced by other decision makers, through a model for social pressure; our notion of social pressure is proportional to the ratio of individual decision makers who have already made the decisions. For our proposed model, we obtain the following results: First, we derive a recursive expression for the probabilities of making the correct and wrong global decisions as a function of time, system size, and the global decision threshold. The expression is based on the individual decision makers' decision probabilities and does not rely on the specific individual decision-making policy. Second, we discuss two specific threshold rules: the fastest rule and the majority rule. By means of a mean-field analysis, we relate the asymptotic performance of the fusion center, as the system size tends to infinity, to the individual decision makers' decision probability sequence. In addition to theoretical analysis, simulation work is conducted to discuss the speed/accuracy tradeoffs for different threshold rules.

AB Is it rational to reduce criminal activities if punishments are increased? While intuition might suggest so, game theory concludes differently. From the game theoretical perspective, inspectors anticipate the effect of increased punishments on criminal behavior and reduce their inspection activities accordingly. This implies that higher punishments reduce inspections and do not affect crime rates. We present two laboratory experiments, which challenge this perspective by demonstrating that both, criminals and inspectors, are affected by punishment levels. Thereupon, we investigate with agent-based simulations, whether models of bounded rationality can explain our empirical data. We differentiate between two kinds of bounded rationality; the first considers bounded learning from social interaction, the second bounded decision-making. Our results suggest that humans show both kinds of bounded rationality in the strategic situation of crime, control and punishment. We conclude that it is not the rationality but the bounded rationality in humans that makes punishment effective.

AB With the development of modern cities, metro are playing an increasingly important role in urban traffic. A biochemical terrorist attack in a metro station can cause many casualties. Therefore, more attention should be paid to metro emergency management. This paper presents a guidance scheme based on an improved empirical formula to optimize emergency evacuation. Additionally, the guidance evacuation model combined the social force model with pedestrian characteristics to study the influence of pedestrian behaviors on guidance evacuation. The experiment results show the following: (1) A guidance scheme based on an improved empirical formula can significantly reduce the casualties and improve the efficiency of evacuation; (2) The guidance evacuation model can be used to find the reasonable guidance locations and the combination of guides. (3) Pedestrian characteristics must be taken into account in the research of the guidance evacuation. Analyzing the behavioral characteristics of pedestrian can provide improvement measures for guidance evacuation. This paper focuses on the simulation experiments of emergency evacuation in metro station, which can provide practical references for developing an efficient and safe emergency evacuation scheme.

AB In a fully nonlinear model of wave propagation through bubbly media, computational complexity arises when the medium contains a polydisperse bubble population. This is because a nonlinear ordinary differential equation governing the bubble response must be solved for the current radius of each bubble size present at every spatial location and at every time step. In biomedical ultrasound imaging, commercial contrast agents typically possess a wide range of bubble sizes that exhibit a variety of differing behaviours at ultrasound frequencies of clinical interest. Despite the advent of supercomputing resources, the simulation of ultrasound propagation through microbubble populations still represents a formidable numerical task. Consequently, efficient computational algorithms that have the potential to be implemented in real time on clinical scanners remain highly desirable. In this work, a numerical approach is investigated that computes only a single ordinary differential equation at each spatial location which can potentially reduce significantly the computational effort. It is demonstrated that, under certain parameter regimes, the approach replicates the fully nonlinear model of an incident ultrasound pulse propagating through a polydisperse population of bubbles with a high degree of accuracy.

AB In the present study we evaluated the potential of ipriflavone against the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects induced by cyclophosphamide chemotherapeutic agent in bone marrow cells of mice, using the micronucleus assay in vivo on cells of bone marrow. The study was performed following three protocols: pre-treatment, simultaneous treatment and post treatment. The results demonstrated that ipriflavone has a protective effect against mutagenicity induced by cyclophosphamide in the pre-treatment and post-treatment and against the cytotoxicity in all treatments. There was variation between the genders in some of the experimental groups. To evaluate their possible mechanisms of action, it was performed the DPPH assay, which showed no ability to donate hydrogens, suggesting that it acts through other mechanisms. Due to its ability to prevent chromosomal damage, ipriflavone is likely to open an interest field concerning its possible the use in clinical applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Agent-based modeling is used for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous entities aiming to assessing their effects on the system as a whole. At an abstract level, an agent-based model (ABM) is a representation of the many simple agents and interactions among them. The decision making of the agents is based on the rules given to them. In an ABM, the model output is the result of internal decision-making and may differ with alteration in the decision path. On the contrary, with the set of rules embedded in agents, their behavior is modeled to take a 'certain action' in a 'certain situation'. It suggests that the internal decision making behavior of agents is truly responsible for the model output and thus it cannot be ignored while validating ABMs. This research article focuses on the validating agents' behavior by evaluating decision-making processes of agents. For this purpose, we propose a validation framework based on a participatory simulation game. Using this framework we engage a human player (i.e. a domain stakeholder) to allow us to collect information about choices and validate the behavior of an individual agent. A proof-of-concept game is developed for a city logistics ABM to test the framework. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The biological-tuning of the Action Observation Network is highly debated. A current open question relates to whether the morphological appearance (body shape) and/or the biological motion of the observed agent triggers action simulation processes. Motor simulation of the partner's action is critical for motor interactions, where two partners coordinate their actions in space and time. It supports interpersonal alignment and facilitates online coordination. However, motor simulation also leads to visuo-motor interference effects when people are required to coordinate with complementary actions, i.e. incongruent movements as compared to the observed ones. Movement kinematics of interactive partners allows us to capture their automatic tendency to simulate and imitate the partner's complementary movements. In an online reach-to-grasp task, we investigated whether visuo-motor interference effects, visible in the kinematics of complementary movements, are modulated by the visual presence of the interactor's body shape. We asked participants to interact with 1) a humanoid agent with a human-like body shape and with real human, biological, movement kinematics, or 2) a non-humanoid agent, which did not resemble the human body-shape but moved with the same real kinematics. Through the combination of inferential and Bayesian statistics, the results show no effect of interactor's body shape on visuomotor interference in reaching and grasping kinematics during online motor coordination. We discuss the results and propose that the kinematics of the observed movements, during motor interactions, might be the key factor for visuo-motor interference to take place independently from the morphological appearance of the partner. This is particularly relevant in a technological society that constantly asks humans to interact with artificial agents.

DE agent-based models; verification; validation; minimalist approaches
ID VERIFICATION; SIMULATION; SYSTEMS; COMPLEX
AB The assurance, that is, the verification and validation, of agent-based models is difficult, because of the heterogeneity of agents, and the possibility of the emergence of new patterns of macro behavior as a result of the interactions of these agents at the micro-level. This paper uses an agent-based model of the complex interactions among consumers, retailers, and manufacturers to explore issues of model assurance. These explorations involve two challenges for the agent-based model's field. The first challenge is to address the critical issue of software verification. The second challenge is to overcome the many methodological obstacles that exist in empirically validating these models. This paper will outline some of them. The authors propose a method based on the Genetic Algorithm to address both these challenges, but the experiments required, and a lack of good data on many kinds of agents, generally call for a minimalist approach to building and assuring agent-based models.

AB The agent-based model of stock price dynamics on a directed evolving complex network is suggested and studied by direct simulation. The stationary regime is maintained as a result of the balance between the extremal dynamics, adaptivity of strategic variables and reconnection rules. The inherent structure of node agent "brain" is modeled by a recursive neural network with local and global inputs and feedback connections. For specific parametric combination the complex network displays small-world phenomenon combined with scale-free behavior. The identification of a local leader (network hub, agent whose strategies are frequently adapted by its neighbors) is carried out by repeated random walk process through network. The simulations show empirically relevant dynamics of price returns and volatility clustering. The additional emerging aspects of stylized market statistics are Zipfian distributions of fitness.

AB Background: Metastatic tumors are a major source of morbidity and mortality for most cancers. Interaction of circulating tumor cells with endothelium, platelets and neutrophils play an important role in the early stages of metastasis formation. These complex dynamics have proven difficult to study in experimental models. Prior computational models of metastases have focused on tumor cell growth in a host environment, or prediction of metastasis formation from clinical data. We used agent-based modeling (ABM) to dynamically represent hypotheses of essential steps involved in circulating tumor cell adhesion and interaction with other circulating cells, examine their functional constraints, and predict effects of inhibiting specific mechanisms.
   Methods: We developed an ABM of Early Metastasis (ABMEM), a descriptive semi-mechanistic model that replicates experimentally observed behaviors of populations of circulating tumor cells, neutrophils, platelets and endothelial cells while incorporating representations of known surface receptor, autocrine and paracrine interactions. Essential downstream cellular processes were incorporated to simulate activation in response to stimuli, and calibrated with experimental data. The ABMEM was used to identify potential points of interdiction through examination of dynamic outcomes such as rate of tumor cell binding after inhibition of specific platelet or tumor receptors.
   Results: The ABMEM reproduced experimental data concerning neutrophil rolling over endothelial cells, inflammation-induced binding between neutrophils and platelets, and tumor cell interactions with these cells. Simulated platelet inhibition with anti-platelet drugs produced unstable aggregates with frequent detachment and re-binding. The ABMEM replicates findings from experimental models of circulating tumor cell adhesion, and suggests platelets play a critical role in this pre-requisite for metastasis formation. Similar effects were observed with inhibition of tumor integrin alpha V/beta 3. These findings suggest that anti-platelet or anti-integrin therapies may decrease metastasis by preventing stable circulating tumor cell adhesion.
   Conclusion: Circulating tumor cell adhesion is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple cell-cell interactions. The ABMEM successfully captures the essential interactions necessary for this process, and allows for in-silico iterative characterization and invalidation of proposed hypotheses regarding this process in conjunction with in-vitro and in-vivo models. Our results suggest that anti-platelet therapies and anti-integrin therapies may play a promising role in inhibiting metastasis formation.

AB Background: Medically based efforts and alternative treatment strategies to prevent or remediate the corrosive effects of radiotherapy on pathologic fracture healing have failed to produce clear and convincing evidence of success. Establishing an effective pharmacologic option to prevent or treat the development of non-unions in this setting could have immense therapeutic potential. Experimental studies have shown that deferoxamine (DFO), an iron-chelating agent, bolsters vascularity and subsequently enhances normal fracture healing when injected locally into a fracture callus in long bone animal models. Since radiotherapy is known to impede angiogenesis, we hypothesized that the pharmacologic addition of DFO would serve to mitigate the effects of radiotherapy on new vessel formation in vitro and in vivo.
   Materials and Methods: In vitro investigation of angiogenesis was conducted utilizing HUVEC cells in Matrigel. Endothelial tubule formation assays were divided into four groups: Control, Radiated, Radiated + Low-Dose DFO and Radiated + High-Dose DFO. Tubule formation was quantified microscopically and video recorded for the four groups simultaneously during the experiment. In vivo, three groups of Sprague-Dawley rats underwent external fixator placement and fracture osteotomy of the left mandible. Two groups received pre-operative fractionated radiotherapy, and one of these groups was treated with DFO after fracture repair. After 40 days, the animals were perfused and imaged with micro-CT to calculate vascular radiomorphometrics.
   Results: In vitro, endothelial tubule formation assays demonstrated that DFO mitigated the deleterious effects of radiation on angiogenesis. Further, high-dose DFO cultures appeared to organize within 2 h of incubation and achieved a robust network that was visibly superior to all other experimental groups in an accelerated fashion. In vivo, animals subjected to a human equivalent dose of radiotherapy (HEDR) and left mandibular fracture demonstrated quantifiably diminished mu CT metrics of vascular density, as well as a 75% incidence of associated non-unions. The addition of DFO in this setting markedly improved vascularity as demonstrated with 3D angiographic modeling. In addition, we observed an increased incidence of bony unions in the DFO treated group when compared to radiated fractures without treatment (67% vs. 25% respectively).
   Conclusion: Our data suggest that selectively targeting angiogenesis with localized DFO injections is sufficient to remediate the associated severe vascular diminution resulting from a HEDR. Perhaps the most consequential and clinically relevant finding was the ability to reduce the incidence of non-unions in a model where fracture healing was not routinely observed.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused byMycobacterium tuberculosis(MTB) and considered as serious public health concern worldwide which kills approximately five thousand people every day. Therefore, TB drug development efforts are in gigantic need for identification of new potential chemical agents to eradicate TB from the society. The bacterial DNA gyrase B (GyrB) protein as an experimentally widely accepted effective drug target for the development of TB chemotherapeutics. In the present study, advanced pharmacoinformatics approaches were used to screen the Mcule database against the GyrB protein. Based on a number of chemometric parameters, five molecules were found to be crucial to inhibit the GyrB. A number of molecular binding interactions between the proposed inhibitors and important active site residues of GyrB were observed. The predicted drug-likeness properties of all molecules were indicated that compounds possess characteristics to be the drug-like candidates. The dynamic nature of each molecule was explored through the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study. Various analyzing parameters from MD simulation trajectory have suggested rationality of the molecules to be potential GyrB inhibitor. Moreover, the binding free energy was calculated from the entire MD simulation trajectories highlighted greater binding free energy values for all newly identified compounds also substantiated the strong binding affection towards the GyrB in comparison to the novobiocin. Therefore, the proposed molecules might be considered as potential anti-TB chemical agents for future drug discovery purposes subjected to experimental validation.

ID CONTEXT; FRAMEWORK
AB The present paper evaluates the use of software agents to identify relevance of information, called awareness. This evaluation is based on existing policies and scenarios in the context of wireless communication of a hospital in Norway. The study is to address the lack of literature for experimental studies on a method to employ software agents for awareness identification. Research in computer supported cooperative work indicates the significant contributions of software agents to assist individuals. There are bodies of work that show awareness provides the means for software agents in which effective cooperation can take place. In addition, the role of the methods to identify awareness is emphasized in the literature of both computer supported cooperative work and software agents. This paper explains a step-wise process, called Policy-based Awareness Management, which allows agents to use policies as a source to identify awareness and thus change their behaviors accordingly. The contribution of this method is based on the concepts proposed by the logic of general awareness. The present study applies Directory Enabled Networks-next generation as the policy structure for the method. The paper evaluates the process via its application to identify the relevance of information in wireless communication scenarios in a hospital. The present study conducts observations, interviews and discussions on the wireless communication system of the hospital to identify the different scenarios happening in the system. The paper presents a set of simulations on these scenarios and concludes that the method is effective and cost-efficient. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID HAPPINESS; INCOME; MACROECONOMICS
AB We combine macro and microeconomic perspectives in an agent-based endogenous growth model that uses individual satisfaction as a driver of human capital accumulation. The micro perspective is based on individual satisfaction: an utility function computed from the income variation in space (relative to others) and time. The macro perspective emerges from micro decisions that, at an aggregate level, determine an important social decision about the share of the working population engaged in producing ideas (i.e. skilled workers). Underlying our analysis is the Easterlin hypothesis (Easterlin, in: David, Melvin (eds) Nations and households in economic growth: essays in Honor of Moses Abramowitz, Academic Press, New York, 1974, J Econ Behav Organ 27(1):35-47, 1995) which states that individuals care much more about their relative income than about increases in their own income, weakening the link between growth and income. Simulations show that growth and satisfaction levels are higher when relative and absolute incomes are equally weighted in satisfaction computation and are lower when satisfaction only depends on relative incomes.

AB Compared with the U.S., Japan is believed to have a collectivist culture that nurtures high trust. Results from laboratory and survey research, however, show that Americans are more likely to trust strangers than are Japanese. Why would trust be lower in a collectivist culture? We use an agent-based computational model to explore the evolutionary origin of this puzzling empirical finding. Computer simulations suggest that higher social mobility in the U.S. may be the explanation. With low mobility, agents rarely encounter strangers and thus remain highly parochial, trusting only their neighbors and avoiding open-market transactions with outsiders. With moderate mobility, agents learn to read telltale signs of character so that they can take advantage of better opportunities outside the neighborhood. However, if mobility is too great, there is too little trustworthiness to make the effort to discriminate worthwhile. This finding suggests that higher mobility in the U.S. may explain why Americans are more trusting than Japanese, but if mobility becomes too high, the self-reinforcing high-trust equilibrium could collapse.

AB Injection molding of foamed components typically uses chemical blowing agents (CBAs) or physical blowing agents (PBAs) to produce a cellular or microcellular structure. A CBA can be easily and directly mixed with plastic pellets and fed into the molding machine through the hopper while a generally finer, microcellular structure can be realized using PBAs. The PBA route is accomplished by injecting more environmentally benign gases into the machine barrel to form a single-phase polymer-gas solution that subsequently foams during molding. This article proposes a new foam injection molding technology that enables the ease of processing of the CBA method with the foaming characteristics of a PBA, but in a cost-effective fashion. In this article, the manufacturing method and theoretical background for producing plastic pellets loaded with carbon dioxide as well as the resulting part characteristics are described. Using the proposed technique, lightweight injection molded parts with a cellular structure, good dimensional stability, and a good surface quality can be produced. POLYM. ENG.

AB Microbubble clustering may occur when bubbles become bound to targeted surfaces or are grouped by acoustic radiation forces in medical diagnostic applications. The ability to identify the formation of such clusters from the ultrasound echoes may be of practical use. Nonlinear numerical simulations were performed on clusters of microbubbles modeled by the modified Keller-Miksis equations. Encapsulated bubbles were considered to mimic practical applications but the aim of the study was to examine the effects of inter-bubble spacing and bubble size on the dynamical behavior of the cluster and to see if chaotic or bifurcation characteristics could be helpful in diagnostics. It was found that as microbubbles were clustered closer together, their oscillation amplitude for a given applied ultrasound power was reduced, and for inter-bubble spacing smaller than about ten bubble radii nonlinear subharmonics and ultraharmonics were eliminated. For clustered microbubbles, as for isolated microbubbles, an increase in the applied acoustic power caused bifurcations and transition to chaos. The bifurcations preceding chaotic behavior were identified by Floquet analysis and confirmed to be of the period-doubling type. It was found that as the number of microbubbles in a cluster increased, regularization occurred at lower ultrasound power and more windows of order appeared. (C) 2013 Acoustical Society of America.

AB This paper studies the effects of progressive income taxes and education finance in a dynamic heterogeneous-agent economy. Such redistributive policies entail distortions to labor supply and savings, but also serve as partial substitutes for missing credit and insurance markets. The resulting tradeoffs for growth and efficiency are explored, both theoretically and quantitatively, in a model that yields complete analytical solutions. Progressive education finance always leads to higher income growth than taxes and transfers, but at the cost of lower insurance. Overall efficiency is assessed using a new measure that properly reflects aggregate resources and idiosyncratic risks but, unlike a standard social welfare function, does not reward equality per se, Simulations using empirical parameter estimates show that the efficiency costs and benefits of redistribution are generally of the same order of magnitude, resulting in plausible values for the optimal rates. Aggregate income and aggregate welfare provide only crude lower and upper bounds around the true efficiency tradeoff.

AB In this paper we examine the epistemic value of highly idealized agent-based models (ABMs) of social aspects of scientific inquiry. On the one hand, we argue that taking the results of such simulations as informative of actual scientific inquiry is unwarranted, at least for the class of models proposed in recent literature. Moreover, we argue that a weaker approach, which takes these models as providing only how-possibly explanations, does not help to improve their epistemic value. On the other hand, we suggest that if ABMs of science underwent two types of robustness analysis, they could indeed have a clear epistemic function, namely by providing evidence for philosophical and historical hypotheses. In this sense, ABMs can obtain evidential and explanatory properties and thus be a useful tool for integrated history and philosophy of science. We illustrate our point with an example of a modelbuilding on the work by Kevin Zollmanwhich we apply to a concrete historical case study.

AB Infection with Ehrlichia phagocytophila in white-footed mice is transient and followed by a strong immune response. We investigated whether the presence of acquired immunity against E. phagocytophila precludes whitefooted mice from further maintenance of this agent in nature. Mice were infected with E. phagocytophila via tick bite and challenged either 12 or 16 weeks later by Ixodes scapularis nymphs infected with the same agent. Xenodiagnostic larvae fed upon each mouse simultaneously with challenging nymphs and 1 week thereafter. Ticks were tested for the agent by PCR, and the prevalence of infection was compared to that in ticks that fed upon nonimmune control mice. Only 30% of immunized mice sustained cofeeding transmission of E. phagocytophila between simultaneously feeding infected and uninfected ticks, compared to 100% of control mice. An average of 6.3% of xenodiagnostic ticks acquired Ehrlichia from previously immunized mice when fed 1 week after the challenge, compared to 82.5% infection in the control group. Although an immune response to a single infection with E. phagocytophila in white-footed mice provided only partial protection against reinfection with the same agent, the majority of mice were rendered reservoir incompetent for at least 12 to 16 weeks. Immunity acquired by mice during I. scapularis nymphal activity in early summer may exclude a large proportion of the mouse population from maintaining E. phagocytophila during the period of larval activity Later in the season.

AB This paper addresses the problem of event-triggered stabilization for positive systems subject to input saturation, where the state variables are in the nonnegative orthant. An event-triggered linear state feedback law is constructed. By expressing the saturated linear state feedback law on a convex hull of a group of auxiliary linear feedback laws, we establish conditions under which the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable with a given set contained in the domain of attraction. On the basis of these conditions, the problem of designing the feedback gain and the event-triggering strategy for attaining the largest domain of attraction is formulated and solved as an optimization problem with linear matrix inequality constraints. The problem of designing the feedback gain and the event-triggering strategy for achieving fast transience response with a guaranteed size of the domain of attraction is also formulated and solved as an linear matrix inequality problem. The effectiveness of these results is then illustrated by numerical simulation.

AB We report gas phase calculations on uranyl ions (UO22+) complexes with symmetrical trialkyl phosphates, (RO)(3)PO, as ligand (L), where, R is a linear or branched propyl, butyl and amyl groups. Density functional theory (DFT) using double numerical polarization (DNP) basis set with restricted scalar relativistic effect is used to validate the structural features of UO2(NO3)(2)L-2 complexes against experimental XRD data. The interaction energy and extraction ability of the trialkyl phosphates are compared for uranyl (VI) ion. Steric effect of the extracting agent that governs the metal extraction is explained in terms of cone angles made by ligands towards metal ion. The complexation behaviour of straight chain and branched chain ligands is well understood by this study. The relative order of cone angles and interaction energies from DFT simulation follow the trend with the experimentally determined distribution coefficients. An interesting approach of this work is the importance of cone angle in the solvent extraction.

AB We characterized an outbreak of acute diarrheal disease caused by group A rotavirus that occurred during the Autumn of 2005 in Malatya City Turkey A total 9907 patients between 0 to 91 years old (mean age: 25.05 +/- 19.67) were included in the epidemic. The patients' data were prospectively collected and statistically analyzed. Microbiologic analyses were performed to determine the etiologic agent. Rapid onset diarrhea (98.36%), abdominal cramps (69%), fever (44.4%) and vomiting (69.6%) were the most common symptoms observed in patients. Rotavirus antigen was detected in 52.7% of the studied patients. RT-PCR analysis led to identification of Group A rotavirus as the causative agent of this epidemic. Simultaneous measurements of the drinking water samples yielded very low chlorine levels; as low as 0 to 0.05 mg/L. The outbreak investigation team indicated possible contamination of a large water depository from a water well, which supplies drinking water to two major districts of the city Effective chlorination and blockage of the passage between the well and the water depository stopped the outbreak. This outbreak shows the high epidemic potency of rotavirus in large human populations, including all age groups, and underlines the importance of water safety in pipeline systems.

AB Mechanical characterization of the intervertebral disc involves labor-intensive and destructive experimental methodology. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography is a nondestructive imaging modality for high-resolution visualization and glycosaminoglycan quantification of cartilaginous tissues. The purpose of this study was to determine whether anionic and cationic contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography of the intervertebral disc can be used to indirectly assess disc mechanical properties in an ex vivo model of disc degeneration. L3/L4 motion segments were dissected from female Lewis rats. To deplete glycosaminoglycan, samples were treated with 0U/ml (Control) or 5U/ml papain. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography was performed following incubation in 40% Hexabrix (anionic) or 30mg I/ml CA(4+) (cationic) for 24h (n=10/contrast agent/digestion group). Motion segments underwent cyclic mechanical testing to determine compressive and tensile modulus, stiffness, and hysteresis. Glycosaminoglycan content was determined using the dimethylmethylene blue assay. Correlations between glycosaminoglycan content, contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography attenuation, and mechanical properties were assessed via the Pearson correlation. The predictive accuracy of attenuation on compressive properties was assessed via repeated random sub-sampling cross validation. Papain digestion produced significant decreases in glycosaminoglycan content and corresponding differences in attenuation and mechanical properties. Attenuation correlated significantly to glycosaminoglycan content and to all compressive mechanical properties using both Hexabrix and CA(4+). Predictive linear regression models demonstrated a predictive accuracy of attenuation on compressive modulus and stiffness of 79.8-86.0%. Contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography was highly predictive of compressive mechanical properties in an ex vivo simulation of disc degeneration and may represent an effective modality for indirectly assessing disc compressive properties.

AB Ecological restoration actions generally result from collective decision-making processes and can involve diverse, at times contentious, views. As such, it is critical to understand these processes and the factors that might influence the resolution of diverse perspectives into a set of coordinated actions. This paper describes the adaptation and calibration of a stylized collective decision-making agent-based model using ethnographic data, to advance theory on how decisions emerge in the context of ecological restoration in the Chicago Wilderness. The prototypical model provided structure and organization of the empirical data of two Chicago Wilderness member groups and revealed organizational structures, patterns of interactions via formal and informal meetings, and parameter values for the various mechanisms. The organization of the data allowed us to identify where our original model mechanisms required adaptation. After model modifications were completed, baseline scenarios were contrasted with observations for final parameter calibration and to elaborate explanations of the study cases. This exercise allowed us to identify the components and mechanisms in the system to which the outputs are most sensitive. We constructed relevant hypothetical scenarios around these critical components, and found that key liaisons, agents with high interaction frequencies and high mutual respect values are useful in promoting efficient decision processes, but are limited in their ability to change the collective position with respect to a restoration practice. Simulations suggest that final collective position can be changed when there is a more equitable distribution of agents across groups, or the key liaison is very persuasive (i.e. interacts frequently and is highly respected) but is non-reciprocal (i.e. does not respect others highly). Our work advances our understanding of key mechanisms influencing collective decision processes and illustrates the value of agent-based modeling and its integration with ethnographic data analysis to advance the theory of collective decision making.

AB Aims The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety profile in terms of changes in renal function after co-treatment with sacubitril/valsartan and empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).
   Methods and results This multicentre observational analysis included 108 patients with T2D and HFrEF treated with both agents: baseline sacubitril/valsartan (Group A; n = 43), baseline empagliflozin (Group B; n = 42), or both agents initiated simultaneously (Group C;n = 23). The primary endpoint was estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) dynamics across treatment groups. A binary characterization of worsening renal function (WRF)/improved renal function (IRF) was included in the primary endpoint. WRF and IRF were defined as an increase/decrease in serum creatinine >= 0.3 mg/dL or GFR >= 20%. Changes in quantitative variables were evaluated using joint modelling of survival and longitudinal data (JM). Rates and their treatment differences were determined by Poisson regression. The mean left ventricle ejection fraction and eGFR were 32 +/- 6% and 70 +/- 28 mL/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. At a median follow-up of 1.01 years (inter-quartile range 0.71-1.50), 377 outpatient visits were recorded. Although there were differences in GFR trajectories over time within each treatment, they did not achieve statistical significance (omnibusP = 0.154). However, when these differences were contrasted among groups, there was a significant decrease in GFR in Group A as compared with Group B (P = 0.002). The contrast between Groups C and B was not significant (P = 0.430). These differences were also reflected when the rates for WRF and IRF were contrasted among treatments.
   Conclusions The co-administration of sacubitril/valsartan and empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF and concomitant T2D appears to be safe in terms of renal function.

AB A one-dimensional kinematic model is used to investigate the effects of silver iodide seeding in the region of a Cb cloud between isotherms of -8-degrees-C and -12-degrees-C. The agent interaction with cloud atmosphere is simulated by an improved microphysical model version which includes phoretic processes. The behaviour of the different agent types is investigated using the maximum values of agent mixing ratios and corresponding agent particle masses and radii.
   It is shown that the agent residence time in the seeding zone significantly depends on vertical velocity. The residence time is comparable to that previously reported. On the other side, the final graupel production decreases slightly when vertical velocity increases, while the corresponding graupel production is quite different for agents used. The main agent nucleation mechanisms are the Brownian coagulation of cloud droplets, inertial impact of cloud droplets and deposition nucleation.

ID DOGS; TOLTRAZURIL; OHIOENSIS; PUPPIES
AB Isospora spp. are the causative agents of canine isosporosis. Of the 3590 diagnostic samples from Austrian dogs (<= 2 years old), 8.7% contained Isospora oocysts, 78% of which from dogs up to 4 months of age. Non-haemorrhagic and haemorrhagic diarrhoea were significantly more prevalent in Isospora-infected animals than in coccidia-negative ones. Twelve of 15 litters from a large commercial dog breeding unit (examined from the third to the 10th week of life) also excreted Isospora (average prevalence: 36.4%) in intensities from 333 to 35 000 oocysts per gram of faeces (opg). In experimental trials 26 3-week-old Beagle puppies were infected with low (600-6000), medium (10 000) or high (20 000) dose of Isospora ohioensis-group or Isospora canis field isolates. Additionally 21 puppies were infected as above and treated with a symmetrical triazintrione. Parasitological and clinical parameters were examined. The two Isospora species differed significantly concerning intensity and duration of excretion. The pre-patent period was 6-7 days for I. ohioensis and 10-12 days for I. cams. The latter species showed significantly longer excretion and higher opg. This was not influenced by simultaneous infections with both species. Individual patterns of faecal consistency were very variable, irrespective of the infection dose. Treatment significantly reduced both the intensity and the duration of oocysts excretion as well as diarrhoea in comparison with the infected, untreated group and thus proved to be effective against coccidiosis in experimental infections.

AB Background: Stachys piliferaBenth has long been used to treat infectious diseases as well as respiratory and rheumatoid disorders in Iranian folk medicine. Antioxidants, antitumor, and antimicrobial properties of the plant have been reported.
   Objectives: This experimental study was designed to evaluate systemic and topical anti-inflammatory effects of the hydro-alcoholic extract from aerial parts of Stachys pilifera (HESP).
   Materials and Methods: Anti-inflammatory effects of HESP was studied in four well-known animal models of inflammation, including carrageenan-or formalin-induced paw edema in rat (thirteen groups, 6 rats per each group), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)- or xylene-induced ear edema in mouse (ten groups, 6 mice per each group). The rats received HESP (50-400 mg/kg) orally 45 minutes before the subplantar injection of carrageenan or formalin. In TPA or xylene tests, HESP (1, 2.5, and 5 mg/ear) was applied topically simultaneous with these phlogistic agents on the ear mice. Finally, pathological examination of the inflamed tissues (paw and ear) was carried out.
   Results: Acute toxicity study of the extract showed that no rats were killed at 5000 mg/kg (LD50 > 5000 mg/kg). The extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly suppressed carrageenan-induced paw edema 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours after carrageenan challenge in comparison with the control group (P < 0.001). The HESP (100 and 200 mg/kg) also produced a considerable antiedematogenic effect in the formalin test over a period of 24 hours (P < 0.01). Furthermore, topical administration of the HESP (1, 2.5, and 5 mg/ear) inhibited TPA-and xyleneinduced ear edema in comparison with the control group (P < 0.001). The pathological analysis of the paws and ears revealed that HESP was capable of reducing tissue destruction, cellular infiltration, and subcutaneous edema induced by the indicated phlogistic agents.
   Conclusions: The present data confirmed systemic and topical anti-inflammatory effects of Stachys pilifera which is comparable to indomethacin.

AB Concrete with a micro-encapsulated healing agent is appealing due to its self-healing capacity. The discrete element method (DEM) is emerging as an increasingly used approach for investigating the damage phenomenon of materials at the microscale. It provides a promising way to study the microcapsule-enabled self-healing concrete. Based on the experimental observation and DEM, a three-dimensional damage-healing numerical model of microcapsule-enabled self-healing cementitious materials under compressive loading is proposed. The local healing effect can be simulated in our model, as well as the stress concentration effect and the partial healing effect. The healing variable of the DEM model is developed to describe the healing process. We examine the dependence of the mechanical properties of the microcapsule-enabled self-healing material on (a) the stiffness of the solidified healing agent, (b) the strength of the solidified healing agent, (c) the initial damage of specimens, and (d) the partial healing effect. In particular, the proposed numerical damage-healing model demonstrates the potential capability to explain and simulate the physical behavior of microcapsule-enabled self-healing materials on the microscale.

AB Limbic seizures (forepaw clonus) were induced in Lewis rats by subcutaneous injections of lithium (3 mEq/kg) followed 24 h later by a muscarinic agent. Either 7 days before, 7 days after, or on the day of seizures, rats were inoculated with a spinal cord preparation. Other groups received these preparations but served as treatment (no seizure) controls. In three separate experiments, rats in which seizures had been induced at the time of inoculation displayed significant increases in the severity of clinical symptoms 14-20 days later relative to controls while rats in which seizures had been induced 7 days after inoculation displayed less severe symptoms; the latter effect was partially simulated by multiple injections of 1 mg/kg dexamethasone. The immunofacilitation effect was much stronger than the immunosuppression and explained 25-30% of the variance in the clinical severity scores.

TI Including Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy in Medical Treatment Protocol in
   Sudden Hearing Loss is not Useful
SO JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ADVANCED OTOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID INTRATYMPANIC DEXAMETHASONE; STEROIDS; EXPERIENCE
AB Purpose: The purpose of this study is to research the effect of including the hyperbaric oxygen therapy in medical treatment protocol in sudden hearing loss (SHL).
   Materials and Methods: Seventy-three patients suffering from SHL with a loss of 30 dB and over in three successive frequencies, who were treated in our clinic were put into two groups, were included in the retrospective study. Thirty-four patients in the first group were given papaverine and corticosteroid treatment. Antiviral therapy was added to 12 patients within this group, due to a history of the existence of upper respiratory infection (URI), which had been present over the previous 14 days. Thirty-nine patients in the second group were given papaverine and corticosteroid treatment, and antiviral therapy was added to 18 patients with a history of URI that had been present over the previous 14 days. Between the 6th and 16th days, patients received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). An audiological examination of patients was carried out prior to treatment, and at five days, seven days, one month, and three months after the treatment. Patients in both groups were compared in terms of hearing gain.
   Results: In a comparison of the two groups, it was determined that both groups were correlated with each other in terms of age (p = 0.55), gender (p = 0.39), seasonal distribution (p = 0.39), duration of hearing loss (p = 0.51), presence of tinnitus (p = 0.48), and vestibular symptom existence (p = 0.82), and there was no difference between groups. A statistically significant change was determined in hearing following treatment in the first group, in comparison to the pre-treatment period (p = 0.01). A statistically significant change was also determined in hearing following treatment in the second group, in comparison to the pre-treatment period (p = 0.01). Following the comparison of hearing gain of both groups, a no statistically significant difference could found (p = 0.89)
   Discussion: It is believed that many factors exist in the etiology of SHL. Among those, vascular, immunologic, and viral factors were discussed in particular in many studies, and the role of these factors in etiology was not elucidated, although they were frequently regarded as responsible for the development of SHL. Therefore, combining the agents directed to vascular, immunologic, and viral etiology in SHL treatment became an acceptable approach. The combined treatment modality based on the principle of simultaneous usage of more than one agent in SHL treatment was also supported with the results of our study, and is thought to be a highly effective practice.
   Conclusion: It is believed that the treatment protocol including papaverine, corticosteroid, antiviral agents, and HBOT have a significant effect on the results of SHL treatment. Although including HBOT in medical treatment was observed to provide a hearing gain within the group, following the comparison of both groups, it was determined that it did not cause a statistically significant difference on the results, and more comprehensive and prospective studies are required regarding this subject.

ID PERFORMANCE; FIRMS
AB This article builds on results of the empirical research "The competitiveness of companies" done by Masaryk University in 2007 Within the group of 432 observed companies there were found interesting characteristics of family businesses (91 companies). The family business was considered to be such a company in which members of one family hold at least two strategic management functions. There were used questionnaire surveys in order to obtain detailed data from individual firms. Data were then transferred to the SPSS program, subjected to the primary analysis and correlation analysis. Characteristics of family businesses were used as inputs for the NetLogo agent-based simulation. Agent-based models can be applied in numerous problem domains, typically in computer science, biology or medicine. In case of economy, agent metaphor can be used for modelling companies, decision makers, employees, customers etc. acting in the market. Our agent-based model allowed us to observe developmental stages of two abstract companies: family business and non-family business. The simulation enables experimenting with different settings of parameters (independent variables) that describe companies. The objective of the simulation was to identify the differences between the family and non-family businesses in sense of the Greiner's theory of the organization growth. The agent-based simulation results showed that family businesses in the first phase of their development grow in terms of amounts of asset and sales. This grow is faster than grow of non-family businesses. The break occurs at the stage of leadership crisis, where family businesses are starting to lag in size behind the non-family businesses. Our findings of the simulation experiments correspond with the findings in the area of family businesses research made in other European countries and in the USA.

AB ObjectivesThis study evaluated the influence of different shades of flowable resin composite used as luting agent on the final shade of porcelain veneers of different opacities over A2 and B1 simulated dental substrate.
   Materials and MethodsOne millimeter monolithic (enamel E1.0 or dentin D1.0) and bilayer (E0.5D0.5) porcelain discs shade A2 were paired with flowable resin composite disks (0.1 mm thick) of different shades (A1, A2, B1, white opaque - WO or IL - translucent), as veneer+luting agent (n=10). The CIE L*a*b* color coordinates were measured with a spectrophotometer over white and black standard background, as well as over A2 and B1 simulated dental substrates. Translucency of all specimens and the shade matching of the pairs over the A2 and B1 substrates (E*(00)) were calculated by Translucency Parameter and CIEDE2000 methods. Data were statistically analyzed by 95% confidence interval.
   ResultsPorcelain veneer E1.0 groups were the most translucent, while the pairs veneer+luting agent WO showed the lowest translucency, and A1, A2, B1, and IL yielded little to no differences in translucency of the pairs. The overall best shade matching with A2 substrate was observed for D1.0 veneer+WO luting agent.
   ConclusionThe opacity of the porcelain veneer paired with luting agents of different shades affected the final appearance of the restorations over distinct simulated tooth substrates.
   Clinical SignificanceDistinct shades of flowable resin composites used as luting agent might yield clinically visible color differences on porcelain veneers facilitating an excellent shade match with adjacent teeth. (J Esthet Restor Dent 28:295-303, 2016)

AB The welfare of society is more and more dependent on the proper functioning of Critical Infrastructures (CIs), and crises that affect CIs usually aggravate their impact on society. Therefore, improving the resilience of CIs is the most important objective of today's crisis managers. Although several resilience frameworks can be found in the literature, their implementation is still incipient and detailed prescriptions for their implementation are lacking. Moreover, some frameworks are only limited to describing the activities performed within the boundaries of the CI, neglecting the role of external agents. This research describes a practical and holistic resilience framework for improving the resilience of CIs taking into account the external agents. The framework is composed of three elements: a set of resilience policies; an influence table that assesses the influence of policies on prevention, absorption and recovery stages; and an implementation methodology that defines the temporal order in which the policies should be implemented. Two empirical studies were undertaken in two CIs to implement this framework. The studies show that the resilience framework helps CIs to diagnose their resilience level, detect areas of potential improvement and complement their risk management approach with a transversal approach to be better prepare to deal with crises.

AB Description of the subject. Climate uncertainty is expected to have a severe impact on the economy of West African countries. The use of forecasting in agricultural production has become a priority for those working in the field of development. This article focuses on the early prediction of cotton production levels before harvesting in Senegal, using expertise from the cotton development company, SODEFITEX.
   Objectives. This paper aims to analyze the knowledge employed to predict yield, given the uncertainty about future climate conditions, and to evaluate the quality of such predictions, depending on the territorial scale of the expertise considered.
   Method. The methodology used in this study was a statistical analysis of cotton production in Senegal between 2004 and 2015, combined with a survey of 32 SODEFITEX experts.
   Results. Analysis of the survey of experts revealed that their evaluation of the cotton production was based mainly on the state of the crops and on crop management, with the planting date being the priority. For some experts, the history of production and its organizational and social environments were also important factors. A comparison of forecasts with actual production showed that the experts had systematically overestimated the levels of production when actual yields were below 1,000 kg-ha(-1), under adverse climatic conditions.
   Conclusions. Within a context of poor scientific documentation of the early estimation of production by experts, the results of the study shed light on the knowledge drawn upon and the performance of the forecasts delivered, thus paving the way for a rational criticism of the expertise employed. The diversity of points of view highlighted by the multi-criteria analysis, between hierarchical levels and between agents at the same level, underlines the need for a closer look at the knowledge being utilized, in order to bring out "what matters" in these forecasts and to move towards greater objectivity of expertise in the face of recurrent climate hazards.

AB Modem societies are becoming increasingly dependent on critical infrastructure systems (CISs) to provide essential services that support economic prosperity, governance, and quality of life. These systems are not alone but interdependent at multiple levels to enhance their overall performance. However, recent worldwide events such as the 9/11 terrorist attack, Gulf Coast hurricanes, the Chile and Japanese earthquakes, and even heat waves have highlighted that interdependencies among CISs increase the potential for cascading failures and amplify the impact of both large and small scale initial failures into events of catastrophic proportions. To better understand CISs to support planning, maintenance and emergency decision making, modeling and simulation of interdependencies across CISs has recently become a key field of study. This paper reviews the studies in the field and broadly groups the existing modeling and simulation approaches into six types: empirical approaches, agent based approaches, system dynamics based approaches, economic theory based approaches, network based approaches, and others. Different studies for each type of the approaches are categorized and reviewed in terms of fundamental principles, such as research focus, modeling rationale, and the analysis method, while different types of approaches are further compared according to several criteria, such as the notion of resilience. Finally, this paper offers future research directions and identifies critical challenges in the field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: Short-acting anesthetic agents, such its propofol and methohexital. are commonly used for ambulatory procedures in the practices of Oral and maxillofacial surgeons (OMS). This study compares the safety and anesthetic outcomes of propofol and methohexital. In addition, the study compares the safety and outcomes of these agents when administered either by an OMS Who simultaneously, provides anesthesia and performs the procedure (anesthetist/surgeon), or by a non-OMS provider of anesthesia (anesthesiologist or certified registered nurse anesthetist; CRNA) whose sole obligation is to provide anesthesia.
   Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study of anesthesia techniques used in an office-based ambulatory setting by OMS throughout the United States, in which either propofol or methohexital was used for sedation/anesthesia. The study variables included demographic information, anesthetic agent, adverse outcomes related to anesthesia, operative procedure, and provider of anesthesia. These variables were compared with the patient group that received a benzodiazepine/narcotics regimen for sedation (control group). Bivariate (contingency tables) and multivariate (logistic regression) analyses were conducted. P <= .05 was considered statistically significant.
   Results: The study included 47,7 10 patients who met the inclusion criteria: 26,147 (54.8%) patients were in the propolol group, 15,859 (33.2%) were ill the methohexital group, and 5,704 (12.0%) were in the benzodiazepine group. Among all study patients, 333 (0.7%) had an adverse event. The most common complication was nausea and vomiting without aspiration. Of the patients ill the propolol group), methohexital group, or benzodiazepine group, 0.4%, 1.1%, and 0.8% had an adverse event, respectively. The higher number of complications among patients in the methohexital group compared with patients in the other 2 groups was statistically significant. Of 26,147 patients in the propolol group, 23,799 (91.0%) received anesthesia from an anesthetist/surgeon (OMS), and 2,368 (9.1%) from an anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist (non-OMS). A total of 109 patients (0.4%) had an adverse event. The majority of patients who received anesthesia from a non-OMS were in the propofol group (2,368 of 2,404 patients; 98.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of adverse outcomes when comparing patients in the propofol group who received anesthesia front an OMS with those who received anesthesia from a non-OMS (P = .24, bivariate analysis. P = .33, multivariate analysis).
   Conclusions: There is I statistically significant increase ill adverse events related to methohexital compared with propofol or benzodiazepine/narcotics for anesthesia. Propofol appears to have the lowest risk for adverse events. There is no statistically significant difference in the number of adverse Outcomes between the administration of propofol for ambulatory surgery by OMS as an anesthetist/surgeon and anesthesiologist/nurse anesthetist. It remains critical that Our specialty maintains the highest standards, to provide safe anesthesia and to reduce adverse anesthetic events.

AB A broad range of studies of preventive measures in infectious diseases gives rise to incidence data from close contact groups. Parameters of common interest in such studies include transmission probabilities and efficacies of preventive or therapeutic interventions. We estimate these parameters using discrete-time likelihood models. We augment the data with unobserved pairwise transmission outcomes and fit the model using the EM algorithm. A linear model derived from the likelihood based on the augmented data and fitted with the iteratively reweighted least squares method is also discussed. Using simulations, we demonstrate the comparable accuracy and lower sensitivity to initial estimates of the proposed methods with data augmentation relative to the likelihood model based solely on the observed data. Two randomized household-based trials of zanamivir, an influenza antiviral agent, are analyzed using the proposed methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Quite recently, we reported the synthesis of supercharged polycations bearing pH-insensitive double-charged repeat units with either three or five methylene groups in the space between charges. The developed approach is based on the quaternization of the parent poly(4-vinylpyridine) with different alkylating agents, providing the possibility to perform the modification as a one-step reaction, which occurs in mild conditions with a controllable degree of conversion. In the present work, we used the above approach for preparing and investigating supercharged polyplexes (polyelectrolyte complexes of nucleic acids), in particular to elucidate the reason for the key feature, i.e., the clearly defined stability of the polyplexes formed by supercharged polyamines. The main findings of the experimental study were confirmed by the results of full atomic modeling, and the principal regularities responsible for the structure, stability, and properties of the supercharged polyplexes have been elucidated for the first time.

AB We report both automated rigid and flexible ligand docking simulations performed on fifty peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-gamma) agonists, namely, glitazones. The binding conformations and binding affinities of these agonists were obtained by the use of the Autodock 4.1 with Lamarckian genetic algorithm (LGA). All the 50 flexible docks are considered as well-docked as all of them were bound to the ligand binding domain of PPAR-gamma. The predicted binding affinity values (pKa) were found to have some degree of correlation with their experimental in vivo activity values. The head group hydrogen bond interactions via H323 and H449 histidine residues were found to play a significant role. The results obtained will be valuable in designing newer selective PPAR-gamma agonists.

AB With the growing need to guide decision-making in today's complex managerial environment, researchers of the Operations Research/Management Science community have shown a considerable interest in modelling complex managerial systems using the agent-based modelling and simulation technique. This paper presents an estimation-and-optimisation (ESTOPT) architecture to simulate an agent's decision-making process in black-box managerial environment. An ESTOPT agent's behaviour is considered as a two-stage process of solving its optimisation problem, some parameters of which are uncertain and need to be estimated. In the first stage, the agent collects and records information for estimation; in the next stage, it attempts to solve the optimisation problem. The solution guides the agent's actions on the environment which, in turn, provides the agent with new information and payoff as feedback. In this paper, two agent-based models are introduced to demonstrate the implementation of the ESTOPT approach. The simulation outcomes compare favourably with both empirical and theoretical results, suggesting that the ESTOPT approach can be used to simulate an agent's decision-making process in black-box managerial environment.

AB A large and still growing body of literature links urban form and individual travel behavior. It is claimed that certain urban forms, such as mixed land use, can reduce transportation needs for both work and nonwork trips. Despite the contribution of previous research efforts, two limitations remain and thus bring criticisms: first, the mechanism under which urban form affects individual travel behavior is inconclusive; and second, few efforts have investigated how individual daily behavior reshapes urban form over the long term. This paper proposes that urban form and individual behavior are interdependent, i.e., individual behavior reshapes the urban form and vice versa. To test this hypothesis, an agent-based simulation model is built to perform a set of exploratory experiments. The experiments use 31,250 simulations that are conducted on 50 artificial cities to investigate how individual shopping travel behavior shapes urban forms and then how different urban forms influence individual transportation needs. Simulation results indicate that changes in human preferences concerning store utilities and travel convenience exert a strong influence on individual transportation needs and, eventually, on changing the urban form. Additionally, a different explanation on the mechanism by which urban form affects individual transportation needs is given. The findings of this paper indicate human travel behavior should be considered as an important dimension of urban development studies. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)UP.1943-5444.0000084.

AB The best therapeutic choice in lupus nephritis remains shrouded in a body of controversial literature. The purpose of this review was to assess and compare by meta-analysis the efficacy of therapeutic agents used in the treatment of lupus nephritis using outcomes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and total mortality, An exhaustive search was performed using MEDLlNE (1970 to 1995) and manual search of bibliographic notations and nonindexed sources, Twenty prospective controlled trials with treatment allocation by random assignment or consecutive enrollment were identified using diagnostic evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus based on American Rheumatism Association (ARA) criteria and clinical/biopsy evidence of lupus nephritis. One trial was excluded, resulting in 19 trials (n = 440) using treatment groups of oral prednisone alone, azathioprine with and without concomitant prednisone, oral cyclophosphamide with prednisone, azathioprine and oral cyclophosphamide with prednisone, and intravenous cyclophosphamide with prednisone. Crude risk data was pooled. An adjusted pooled risk was calculated using the random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird, Two measures of clinical effectiveness were used to compare treatments: absolute risk differences and number needed to treat, Analysis was completed between treatment groups as follows: oral prednisone compared with all immunosuppressive agents with prednisone and all treatment groups compared with one another, When compared with oral prednisone alone, immunosuppressive agents used in conjunction with oral prednisone were found to be statistically more effective for both total mortality and ESRD (absolute risk differences, 13.2% and 12.9%, respectively). When treatment groups were compared, intravenous cyclophosphamide in conjunction with oral prednisone was found to be statistically more effective than oral prednisone alone for both total mortality and ESRD (absolute risk differences, 19.9% and 16.2%, respectively), The simultaneous use of azathioprine and oral cyclophosphamide concomitant with oral prednisone was found to be 16.9% more effective than oral prednisone alone in reducing incidence of ESRD, No difference was seen in total mortality and data represented only two studies (n = 30). No immunosuppressive agent was found to be statistically more effective than another for either total mortality or ESRD, Future prospective studies are needed to control for numerous variables and renal function changes to provide more definitive answers.

AB In natural flocks/swarms, it is very appealing that low-level individual intelligence and communication can yield advanced coordinated collective behaviors such as congregation, synchronization and migration. In the past few years, the discovery of collective flocking behaviors has stimulated much interest in the study of the underlying organizing principles of abundant natural groups, which has led to dramatic advances in this emerging and active research field. Inspired by previous investigations on the predictive intelligence of animals, insects and microorganisms, we seek in this article to understand the role of predictive mechanisms in the forming and evolving of flocks/swarms by using both numerical simulations and mathematical analyses. This article reviews some basic concepts, important progress, and significant results in the current studies of collective predictive mechanisms, with emphasis on their virtues concerning consensus improvement and communication cost reduction. Due to these advantages, such predictive mechanisms have great potential to find their way into industrial applications.

AB Strong interpersonal communication skills (ICS) are critical for educational and career success, but effective and widely accessible training systems are not available. This paper describes a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental study of an online, educational simulation for practice with the ICS of active listening. The simulation was customized for women graduate students in the natural sciences and engineering. In such environments, where gender stereotyping is common, ICS can make the difference between continued progress and discouraging setbacks. The pedagogical effects of following three instructional support variables were investigated: (1) elaborative versus simple feedback (2) presence versus absence of a static image to accompany the content delivered aurally by a human pedagogical agent, and (3) presence versus absence of instructional hints. The four outcome measures were self-reported knowledge about, skill in applying, and self-efficacy with respect to active listening, along with the usability of the simulation itself. Participants in the study included N = 137 women in the natural sciences and engineering. Results showed that the instructional support variables were significantly related to the outcome measures of knowledge, skills, and usability, but not self-efficacy with respect to active listening. A three-way interaction among all three of the instructional support variables was found to be statistically significant for both the knowledge and skills outcome variables; for both, the highest scores were obtained by participants who were presented with elaborative feedback and neither pedagogical agent image nor hints. Also, participants who received elaborative feedback reported the simulation to have significantly greater usability than those who received simple feedback.

AB Archaeologists make inferences about past human behaviour based on patterned material residues in various depositional contexts, including existing landsurfaces. These deposits are generated by processes that may obscure patterns at some observational scales while highlighting others, and interpretive differences can arise from a lack of explicit models of deposit formation. Here, an exploratory agent-based model based on the concept of the palimpsest is used to examine the effects of episodic sediment transport on the visibility and preservation of surface archaeological deposits in a fluvial context. Outcomes from the model indicate that the compound influences of preservation and visibility are capable of transforming a static radiocarbon record into one of increasing intensity towards the present, while simultaneously displaying periodic chronological gaps - features that have been used in our Australian study area to argue for demographic change driven by social or environmental factors. To differentiate between interpretations, expectations derived from the model are assessed against a second proxy from the same study area: Optically Stimulated Luminescence dates from hearth stones in surface contexts. Results indicate that patterns in the chronometric proxies from the study area are more consistent with episodic geomorphic change than explanations invoking changes in the local organization of human activity.

AB A model of type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using high-fat diet and low-dose STZ was established to assess the antidiabetic effects of Auricularia auricular polysaccharides simulated hydrolysates (0, AAPHs) obtained from the dried fruiting body of A. auricular. AAPHs were administered intragastrically (i.g.) at the dose of 0.15 g/kg b. W. to diabetic Wistar rats for 4 weeks. Results show that AAPHs was demonstrated to exhibit significant diminution in T-CHO and LDLC levels (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01) compared to the diabetic control group. In addition, the secretion level of GLP-1 were different with the diabetes model group from 0 to 30 min, and had a tendency to alleviate weight loss. The current study suggests that AAPHs might be incorporated as a supplement in diabetic agents or combined with other health-care foods.

AB Arsenic is one of the inorganic pollutants typically found in natural waters, and its toxic effects on the human body are currently of great concern. For this reason, the search for detoxifying agents that can be used in a so-called "chelation therapy" is of primary importance. However, to the aim of finding the thermodynamic behavior of efficient chelating agents, extensive speciation studies, capable of reproducing physiological conditions in terms of pH, temperature, and ionic strength, are in order. Here, we report on the acid-base properties of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) at different temperatures (i.e., T = 288.15, 298.15, 310.15, and 318.15 K). In particular, its capability to interact with As(III) has been investigated by experimentally evaluating some crucial thermodynamic parameters (Delta H and T Delta S), stability constants, and its speciation model. Additionally, in order to gather information on the microscopic coordination modalities of As(III) with the functional groups of DMSA and, at the same time, to better interpret the experimental results, a series of state-of-the-art ab initio molecular dynamics simulations have been performed. For the sake of completeness, the sequestering capabilities of DMSA-a simple dithiol ligand-toward As(III) are directly compared with those recently emerged from similar analyses reported on monothiol ligands.

AB This study computationally examines (1) how the behaviors of subjects are represented, (2) whether the classification of subjects is related to the scale of the game, and (3) what kind of behavioral models are successful in small-sized lowest unique integer games (LUIGs). In a LUIG, N (>= 3) players submit a positive integer up to M(> 1) and the player choosing the smallest number not chosen by anyone else wins. For this purpose, the author considers four LUIGs with N = {3, 4} and M = {3, 4} and uses the behavioral data obtained in the laboratory experiment by Yamada and Hanaki [1]. For computational experiments, the author calibrates the parameters of typical learning models for each subject and then pursues round robin competitions. The main findings are in the following: First, the subjects who played not differently from the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium (MSE) prediction tended to made use of not only their choices but also the game outcomes. Meanwhile those who deviated from the MSE prediction took care of only their choices as the complexity of the game increased. Second, the heterogeneity of player strategies depends on both the number of players (N) and the upper limit (M). Third, when groups consist of different agents like in the earlier laboratory experiment, sticking behavior is quite effective to win.

AB Some argue that action comprehension is intimately connected with the observer's own motor capacities, whereas others argue that action comprehension depends on non-motor inferential mechanisms. We address this debate by reviewing comparative studies that license four conclusions: monkeys and apes extract the meaning of an action (i) by going beyond the surface properties of actions, attributing goals and intentions to the agent; (ii) by using environmental information to infer when actions are rational; (iii) by making predictions about an agent's goal, and the most probable action to obtain the goal given environmental constraints; (iv) in situations in which they are physiologically incapable of producing the actions. Motor theories are, thus, insufficient to account for primate action comprehension in the absence of inferential mechanisms.

DT Article
ID HEALTH-CARE SETTINGS; STIGMA
AB Background: The use of opinion leaders is a strategy used to speed the process of translating research into practice. Much is still unknown about opinion leader attributes and activities and the context in which they are most effective. Agent-based modeling is a methodological tool that enables demonstration of the interactive and dynamic effects of individuals and their behaviors on other individuals in the environment. The purpose of this study was to develop and test an agent-based model of opinion leadership. The details of the design and verification of the model are presented.
   Methods: The agent-based model was developed by using a software development platform to translate an underlying conceptual model of opinion leadership into a computer model. Individual agent attributes (for example, motives and credibility) and behaviors (seeking or providing an opinion) were specified as variables in the model in the context of a fictitious patient care unit. The verification process was designed to test whether or not the agent-based model was capable of reproducing the conditions of the preliminary conceptual model. The verification methods included iterative programmatic testing ('debugging') and exploratory analysis of simulated data obtained from execution of the model. The simulation tests included a parameter sweep, in which the model input variables were adjusted systematically followed by an individual time series experiment.
   Results: Statistical analysis of model output for the 288 possible simulation scenarios in the parameter sweep revealed that the agent-based model was performing, consistent with the posited relationships in the underlying model. Nurse opinion leaders act on the strength of their beliefs and as a result, become an opinion resource for their uncertain colleagues, depending on their perceived credibility. Over time, some nurses consistently act as this type of resource and have the potential to emerge as opinion leaders in a context where uncertainty exists.
   Conclusions: The development and testing of agent-based models is an iterative process. The opinion leader model presented here provides a basic structure for continued model development, ongoing verification, and the establishment of validation procedures, including empirical data collection.

AB This paper introduces an economic agent-based model of an urban housing market. The RHEA (Risks and Hedonics in Empirical Agent-based land market) model captures natural hazard risks and environmental amenities through hedonic analysis, facilitating empirical agent-based land market modeling. RHEA is well grounded in economic theory and uses rich spatial data and econometric analysis. It moves beyond the existing work by explicitly simulating the emergence of property prices and their spatial distribution under adaptive price expectations of heterogeneous agents, advancing toward empirical modeling of agent-based land markets. At the same time RHEA operates in a realistic GIS landscape where realtor and households agents form ask and bid prices using empirical hedonic price functions. The simulation results demonstrate that this combination of theoretically sound micro-foundations in agents' behavior and empirical data is feasible. This opens opportunities to explore various methodological and policy-relevant research questions including exploration of abrupt non-marginal changes in markets and regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems.

AB We develop a cultural evolutionary theory of the origins of prosocial religions and apply it to resolve two puzzles in human psychology and cultural history: (1) the rise of large-scale cooperation among strangers and, simultaneously, (2) the spread of prosocial religions in the last 10-12 millennia. We argue that these two developments were importantly linked and mutually energizing. We explain how a package of culturally evolved religious beliefs and practices characterized by increasingly potent, moralizing, supernatural agents, credible displays of faith, and other psychologically active elements conducive to social solidarity promoted high fertility rates and large-scale cooperation with co-religionists, often contributing to success in intergroup competition and conflict. In turn, prosocial religious beliefs and practices spread and aggregated as these successful groups expanded, or were copied by less successful groups. This synthesis is grounded in the idea that although religious beliefs and practices originally arose as nonadaptive by-products of innate cognitive functions, particular cultural variants were then selected for their prosocial effects in a long-term, cultural evolutionary process. This framework (1) reconciles key aspects of the adaptationist and by-product approaches to the origins of religion, (2) explains a variety of empirical observations that have not received adequate attention, and (3) generates novel predictions. Converging lines of evidence drawn from diverse disciplines provide empirical support while at the same time encouraging new research directions and opening up new questions for exploration and debate.

AB Biological membranes are natural barriers to the transport of molecules and drugs within human bodies. Many antibacterial agents need to cross these membranes to reach their target and elicit specific effects. Kanamycin A belongs to the family of aminoglycoside antibiotics that target cellular RNA to inhibit bacterial and viral replication. Previous studies have shown that aminoglycosides bind to mammalian but disrupt bacterial membranes. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and infrared (IR) spectroscopy were applied to investigate the initial, first key interactions of kanamycin A, as a representative aminoglycoside, with both bacterial and mammalian lipid bilayers at the molecular level. Computational studies revealed strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the hydroxyl and amino groups of the aminoglycoside with the ester carbonyl and phosphate groups of the lipids. IR spectroscopy provided experimental verification of the important role of the lipid's ester carbonyl, phosphate and hydroxyl groups for aminoglycoside binding. The bacterial membrane became disordered upon aminoglycoside addition, whereas the mammalian membrane became stiffer and more ordered. This indicates the bacterial membrane disruption observed by previous studies.

AB Observed rate constants (k(obs)) for the imidazole-catalyzed acylation of microcrystalline cellulose by carboxylic acid anhydrides (ethanoic to hexanoic) were calculated from conductivity data. The reaction media consisted of the ionic liquid, IL, 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride and the molecular solvents, MSs, N,N-dimethylacetamide, DMAc, dimethylsulfoxide, DMSO, and sulfolane, Sulfn. The latter two carry the same dipole (S=O) and have some similar properties. Using FTIR, we showed that the acylating agent is N-acylimidazole. The reaction third order rate constants (k(3)) depend slightly on [IL] because the reactant is cellulose-IL complex. For ethanoic anhydride, values of k(3) decrease in the order: IL-DMSO > IL-DMAc > IL-Sulfn. We analyze this dependence on the nature of the MS by considering the reaction activation parameters; some macroscopic and microscopic properties of the binary solvent mixtures and cellulose solutions therein, and the results of molecular dynamics simulations. Favorable activation enthalpy; lower solution viscosity; larger empirical polarity and basicity, and stronger biopolymer-solvent interactions are responsible for the faster reaction in IL-DMSO, relative to that in IL-Sulfn. The dependence of the values of (k(3)) on the number of carbon atoms in the acyl moiety showed a complex behavior (decrease from C-2 to C-4 and then increase), similar to that observed before, probably because of enthalpy/entropy compensation.

AB background and purpose: This work explains the link between Quantum Mind and the networks of oscillators in the brain. Through Primary Waveforms neural networks and brain component processes are linked to the mind and the behavioral integral processes.
   Material and methods: Generation of Evoked Potentials through interaction of flocks of Primary Oscillators is explained. Computer simulated flock's responses are matched with experimental EP records, N400, triggered by verbal stimuli
   Results: Primary Waveforms have been recognized and extracted from EP records. Each Primary Waveform is directly related to the flock of Primary Oscillators in neural structure. EP record is related to a bundle of mental sequences, composed of overlapped Primary Waveforms. Critical parameter in Primary Waveforms is the amplitude of Sensation Elements. Dominant, quantal amplitudes lead to the clustering of Primary Waveforms.
   Conclusion: Menial process is generated by the dynamics of flocks of agents or oscillators in neural structure and regulated by the Quantum Mind barrier Experimental data as well as the computer model point to the nested levels in the barrier Each level is composed of about 7 nested waves. The resulting EP is not just a filtered sum of the activity of a large set of individual agents or oscillators. Instead the self-organization of agents space leads to dominant modes, binding the underlying oscillators. These dominant modes produce the dominant components, Primary Waveforms. Although Primary Waveforms are overlapped, it is possible to recognize them, in human and in rodent EP record.
   Applications: New research and clinical methods, based on mind-brain links, through Primary Waveforms, Mind-body cross data banks and related drug testing Direct mind-computer interfaces; mind reading machines; thinking machines.

AB Numerous stationary phases have been developed with the aim to provide desired performances during chromatographic analysis of the basic solutes in their protonated form. In this work, the procedure for the characterization of bonded stationary phase performance, when both qualitative and quantitative chromatographic factors were varied in chaotropic chromatography, was proposed. Risperidone and its three impurities were selected as model substances, while acetonitrile content in the mobile phase (20-30%), the pH of the aqueous phase (3.00-5.00), the content of chaotropic agents in the aqueous phase (10-100 mM), type of chaotropic agent (NaClO4, CF3COONa), and stationary phase type (Zorbax Eclipse XDB, Zorbax Extend) were studied as chromatographic factors. The proposed procedure implies the combination of D-optimal experimental design, indirect modeling, and polynomial-modified Gaussian model, while grid point search method was selected for the final choice of the experimental conditions which lead to the best possible stationary phase performance for basic solutes. Good agreement between experimentally obtained chromatogram and simulated chromatogram for chosen experimental conditions (25% acetonitrile, 75 mM of NaClO4, pH 4.00 on Zorbax Eclipse XDB column) confirmed the applicability of the proposed procedure. The additional point was selected for the verification of proposed procedure ability to distinguish changes in solutes' elution order. Simulated chromatogram for 21.5% acetonitrile, 85 mM of NaClO4, pH 5.00 on Zorbax Eclipse XDB column was in line with experimental data. Furthermore, the values of left and right peak half-widths obtained from indirect modeling were used in order to evaluate performances of differently modified stationary phases applying a half-width plots approach. The results from half-width plot approach as well as from the proposed procedure indicate higher efficiency and better separation performance of the stationary phase extra densely bonded and double end-capped with trimethylsilyl group than the stationary phase with the combination of end-capping and bidentate silane bonding for chromatographic analysis of basic solutes in RP-HPLC systems with chaotropic agents.

AB In this paper, a model for a spatial network evolution based on a Metropolis simulation using an energy function that depends both on the distance between the nodes and the stated preferences is studied. The agents influence their network neighbors using the CODA model, where each agent has a preference between two options based on its probabilistic assessment of which option is the best one. The algorithm generates realistic networks for opinion problems as well as temporal dynamics for those networks. The transition of a random state to an ordered situation, as temperature decreases, leads to different outcomes depending on the relative strength of the spatial and opinion components of the energy.

AB This study analyzes the diffusion of two product types using an advance selling strategy from a social network perspective. We extended the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model by adding a buyer component (SIRB) to the model and conducted an in-depth analysis of transmission probability and purchase probability when using an advance selling strategy. Agent-based simulation indicates that cost reduction and promotional effort have positive effects on profits, while lead time negatively affects them. Statistical analyses indicate that lead time has a U-shaped relationship with profits for non-durable products, but an inverted U-shaped relationship with those for durable products. For both products types, promotional effort has an inverted U-shaped relationship with profits under the condition of low-quality products and an inverted U-shaped relationship in the case of high-quality products. The reasons underlying these results are discussed, followed by implications for firms adopting advance selling strategies.

AB Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) exhibit unique magnetic properties that make them highly efficacious as MR imaging contrast agents and laboratory diagnostic tools. The complexity of SPION magnetic behavior and the multiple parameters affecting this behavior complicate attempts at fabricating particles suited for a particular purpose. A mathematical model of SPION magnetic properties derived from experimental relationships and first principles can be an effective design tool for predicting particle behavior before materials are fabricated. Here, a novel model of SPION magnetic properties is described, using particle size and applied magnetic field as the primary variable inputs. The model is capable of predicting particle susceptibility and non-linear particle magnetization as well as describing the vector magnetic field produced by a single particle in an applied field. Magnetization values produced by the model agree with recent experimental measurements of particle magnetizations. The model is used to predict the complex magnetic behavior of clustered magnetic particles in simulated in vivo environment; specifically, interactions between the clusters and water molecules. The model shows that larger particles exhibit more linear magnetic behavior and stronger magnetization and that clusters of smaller particles allow for more numerous SPION-water molecule interactions and more uniform cluster magnetizations.

AB Foundational ecological models characterize dispersal with two behavioral traits, speed and directional bias. We hypothesized that these two traits can predict the order of colonization by fishes in a heterogenous landscape. Colonization patterns following hydrological disturbance were documented from a 20-year multi-site time series of marsh fish, and we evaluated the ability of a two-parameter model to predict these patterns. The maximum aerobic swimming speed (U-CRIT) for six coexisting fish species were estimated using endurance tests; field estimates of directedness and swimming speed were previously documented using encounter samplers. We incorporated interspecific variation in speed, direction, and density into several Agent Based Models to simulate dispersal following disturbance. Six virtual "species" with varying levels of directedness, "swam" in an artificial environment to reach a refuge habitat. The time of first arrival for each species was saved at the end of each run and used to calculate the probability of arrival order. Our simulated results generated predictions on order of arrival consistent with observed colonization patterns in our long-term dataset. Swim tunnel results revealed that fast (highU(CRIT)) estimates were characteristic of early colonizing species; whereas, slow (lowU(CRIT)) estimates were characteristic of late colonizing species. Directional bias better predicted order of arrival than speed and was robust to inter-specific variation in density. This study demonstrated that two parameters were adequate to predict the order of species colonization in a complex landscape. These results support the use of relatively simple trait-based models to generate realistic community assembly dynamics.

AB Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks the sixth position among various cancers worldwide. Recent research shows that natural and dietary compounds possess many therapeutic effects. Citral is a monoterpene aldehyde that contains geranial and neral. The present study was considered to study the role of citral against N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA)-induced HCC via modulation of antioxidants and xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in vivo. NDEA-alone-administered group II animals profoundly showed increased tumor incidence, reactive oxygen species, liver marker enzyme levels, serum bilirubin levels, tumor markers of carcinoembryonic antigen, alpha-fetoprotein, proliferative markers of argyrophilic nucleolar organizing regions, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expressions, phase I xenobiotic-metabolic enzymes and simultaneously decreased antioxidants, and phase II enzymes levels. Citral (100 mg/kg b.w.) treatment significantly reverted the levels in group III cancer-bearing animals when compared to group II cancer-bearing animals. In group IV animals, citral-alone administration did not produce any adverse effect during the experimental condition. Based on the results, citral significantly inhibits the hepatocellular carcinogenesis through restoring the antioxidants and phase II xenobiotic-enzyme levels; thereby, it strongly proves as an antiproliferative agent against rat HCC.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder generally developed with aging. AD slowly hammers the memory and cognitive abilities which eventually leads to abnormal behaviour, and ultimately left with disability and dependency. It is anticipated that by the year 2050, world population will experience the incidence of 100 million AD cases. It has been more than hundred years passed since AD recognized as a dreadfull disease, but there is no effective curative agent discovered against AD to date. One of the major hallmarks of the AD development is the accumulation of extracellular amyloid-beta (Ab) plaques in the brain. In the amyloidogenic process, an extensively studied beta-secretase enzyme, known as BACE1, plays a key role in the accumulation and production of Ab fragments. Therefore, successful inhibition of BACE1 by small molecular chemical entities can be an effective approach for anti-AD drug development. Hence, the current study has been perceived to find out potential BACE1 inhibitiors by virtual screening of entire Asinex chemical library database through multi-step molecular docking methodologies. Further, sequential screening of in-silico pharmacokinetics, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations analyses along with binding free energy estimation were performed. Comparative analyses and characteristics of molecular binding interactions assessment finally suggests that five molecules (B1-B5) to be the most promising BACE1 inhibitors. Molecular interactions analyses revealed that either one or both the catalytic dyad residues (Asp32 and Asp228) of BACE1 has formed strong molecular interactions with all the proposed molecules. Not only the catalytic dyad residues are involved in the formation of molecular binding interactions but also other important non-Asp binders residues such as Gly34, Tyr71, Trp115, Arg128, Lys224, Gly230, Thr231, Thr232, Arg235, Thr329, and Val332 found to interact with the selected compounds. Moreover, the dynamic behaviour of proposed molecules and BACE1 was explored through all-atoms MD simulation study for 100 ns time span. Analysis of MD simulation trajectories explained that all identified molecules are efficient enough to retain the structural and molecular interactions integrity inside the receptor cavity of BACE1 in dynamic environment. Finally, the binding free energy of each molecule has calculated from MD simulation trajectories through MM-PBSA method and found that all molecules possess a strong binding affinity towards the BACE1. The high negative binding free energies are found to be within the range of -994.978 to -561.562 kJ/mol for the identified compounds. Henceforth, analyses of extensively studied multi-cheminformatics approaches explained that proposed molecules might be promising BACE1 inhibitors for therapeutic application in AD, subjected to experimental validation.

AB Human (occupant) behavior has been a topic of active research in the study of architecture and energy. To integrate the work of architectural design with techniques of building performance simulation in the presence of responsive human behavior, this study proposes a computational framework that can visualize and evaluate space occupancy, energy use, and generative envelope design given a space outline. A design simulation platform based on the visual programming language (VPL) of Rhino Grasshopper (GH) and Python is presented so that users (architects) can monitor real-time occupant response to space morphology, environmental building operation, and the formal optimization of three-dimensional (3D) building space. For dynamic co-simulation, the Building Controls Virtual Test Bed, Energy Plus, and Radiance were interfaced, and the agent-based model (ABM) approach and Gaussian process (GP) were applied to represent agents' self-learning adaptation, feedback, and impact on room temperature and illuminance. Hypothetical behavior scenarios of virtual agents with experimental building geometry were produced to validate the framework and its effectiveness in supporting dynamic simulation. The study's findings show that building energy and temperature largely depend on ABMs and geometry configuration, which demonstrates the importance of coupled simulation in design decision-making.

AB Agent-based modeling (ABM) allows implementing negotiated behaviors between individual agents. Little is known on how individually preferred behavioral patterns adapt within office spaces used by multiple people. Even less is known about the effect of such negotiated behaviors on the occupants' satisfaction in terms of preferred indoor thermal conditions and the level of perceived control. In order to gain insights into these processes, an experimental study in a field laboratory was conducted. The 36 subjects worked in the facility for three days: one day in a single person office, one in an office for two people, and one in an office for four people. They were allowed to tilt windows, close blinds, use a ceiling fan, or adjust their clothing levels. The data was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results suggest that perceived control is negatively affected by the number of people, neutral temperatures are negatively affected by a lack of perceived control, actions on windows are increasing and actions on blinds and fans are decreasing. Based on the results, suggestions for advancements of ABM are given. However, further studies - especially field studies - are necessary before these results can be applied to models applicable for a broader usage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Seabirds have long been thought to exploit social information when searching for their prey, the distribution of which is often patchy and variable. The fact that most seabirds breed colonially has led to speculation that colonies serve as "information centers," allowing their inhabitants to learn about the distribution of food by observing or following other successful foragers, though this hypothesis is controversial and the evidence for it is mixed. However, several recent studies have documented behaviors that suggest some seabirds do exploit social orientation cues at or near their colonies in order to orient toward food. In this paper, I explore in-depth one such social orientation behavior, which I call "visual trail following." I derived a simple model of information transfer and showed that trail following should be favored over other commonly hypothesized foraging behaviors. An individual-based simulation model was then used to test this theoretical prediction against several other foraging strategies while varying prey patchiness and colony size. The model's results showed that trail following was the optimal strategy across a wide range of conditions. Finally, I used radar data recorded at a tern colony in coastal New York to demonstrate evidence for trail following in the movements of wild seabirds. These results show that trail following and similar behaviors are effective foraging strategies that are likely important for seabirds and other colonial animals.

AB The branching copolymerization of 2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate ( HPMA) with either ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) or bisphenol A dimethacrylate (BPDMA) as the branching agent has been carried out using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) in methanol at 20 C. With EGDMA, soluble branched copolymers were obtained provided that less than one branching agent was incorporated per primary chain: higher levels of EGDMA led to gelation, as expected. Analysis of the changes in the molecular weight and polydispersity of the polymers shows that the formation of highly branched chains occurs only at high (> 90%) conversions. Chain coupling is close to the ideal behavior predicted by the Flory-Stockmayer theory, suggesting that all double bonds are equally reactive and that there is no significant cyclization, in contrast to conventional free radical polymerization. This analysis is confirmed by comparison of the consumption of the EGDMA branching agent with predictions from both theory and simulation. With BPDMA as the branching agent, similar results are obtained although branching is slightly less efficient.

TI Reaching long-term goals based on local interaction between an organism
   and the environment: Computer simulations based on adaptive behavior
SO PERCEPTUAL AND MOTOR SKILLS
LA English
DT Article
AB An agent-based computer simulation created using the adaptive-behavior approach has shown that in some cases it is possible to reach a long-term goal (defined here as a desirable place far removed from the agent in time and in space) without necessarily having an exhaustive, predefined plan of action, but rather by using a set of rules on sensorimotor couplings that govern the organism's local interaction with its environment. We used an agent-based simulation program that emulated a two-dimensional microworld in which agents interacted with their environment and other agents through a set of sensorimotor couplings to reach a long-term goal. The main hypothesis was that the sensorimotor coupling, which consisted of following other agents, led to the emergence of collective behavior that enabled the agents to attain the long-term goal. We systematically varied the sensorimotor couplings that allowed agents to follow other agents, agents' perceptual field length, and the number of obstacles. In total, there were 160 independent simulations for each design cell. Analysis supported the hypothesis and suggested that, in addition to the process of reaching long-term goals, other cognitive processes, such as categorization, memory, and reasoning, can be reconsidered bearing in mind the emergence of behavior and an approach based on interaction between the organism and its environment.

AB In marine environments, once concrete cracks aggressive ions immediately migrate into the cracks together with sea water and can cause durability problems. In this study, an innovative self-healing agent that can bind the aggressive ions from marine environments and simultaneously promote the self-healing efficiency was designed and encapsulated as artificial aggregates. As the bulk matrix cracks, the artificial aggregates were intersected. The self-healing agent was exposed to the crack surfaces and reacted with synthetic sea water to heal the crack. Experimental results show that the reaction of the healing agent with synthetic sea water and consequently the formation of Friedel's salt, ettringite, and hydrotalcite in cracks leaded to an efficient chemical binding of Cl-, SO42- , and Mg2+ ions in the synthetic sea water. Meanwhile, for cracks with an initial width of 350-450 mu m, the closure ratio due to self-healing by the healing agent was approximately 45% during the first 12 h, about 3 times that in the referenced specimens without the healing agent. Therefore, not only the aggressive ions entering into cracks can be chemically bound, but also the further ingress of aggressive ions from synthetic sea water can be hindered by the rapid crack closure due to self-healing.

AB As seen earlier POS is a general agent conversation protocol engineering formalism that has proved efficient when used in communities of software information agents. The aim of this paper is to show how much POS is simple, easy to use, and very appropriate for implementing interaction protocols in a collaborative agent setting. In order to exemplify our approach we focus on an application domain with real time constraints such as soccer robots and show how an inherently symbolic abstract system like POS can be neatly integrated with agents whose internal architecture is reactive and relies on bottom-up behavior-based techniques.
   First, we shortly discuss aspects of heterogeneity with respect to soccer robots and present the RoboCup experimental setting. Then we sketch the difficulties that arise when trying to coordinate an heterogeneous team with conventional methods. In response, we introduce some elements of the POS (Protocol Operational Semantics) model. The following sections examine several basic behaviors of the JavaSoccer simulation environment as it is later used along with TeamBots to highlight POS' capabilities, demonstrate how POS is a suited theoretical tool and leads to extremely compact and modular code due to its high expressive power, and discuss the obtained results. Finally we conclude the article with a comparison to related works as well as some perspectives about the engineering of interaction protocols.

AB Agent-based modeling is a powerful simulation technique to understand the collective behavior and microscopic interaction in complex financial systems. Recently, the concept for determining the key parameters of agent-based models from empirical data instead of setting them artificially was suggested. We first review several agent-based models and the new approaches to determine the key model parameters from historical market data. Based on the agents' behaviors with heterogeneous personal preferences and interactions, these models are successful in explaining the microscopic origination of the temporal and spatial correlations of financial markets. We then present a novel paradigm combining big-data analysis with agent-based modeling. Specifically, from internet query and stock market data, we extract the information driving forces and develop an agent-based model to simulate the dynamic behaviors of complex financial systems.

AB The electronic marketplace is a new medium for exchanging information, goods, services, and payments. It houses infrastructure, facilitates transactions, and matches buyers with sellers. A mobile-agent-based marketplace allows corporate data to be maintained by local buyers and sellers and transferred to the marketplace only when orders are matched. This provides the participating companies with autonomy and independence. This study proposes a framework for using mobile agents to demonstrate autonomous behavior in the electronic marketplace. A prototype system is developed to demonstrate the implementation of this framework. Furthermore, a simple simulation design is used to explore the performance of mobile agents using two different product-purchasing policies. Statistics regarding execution time are collected and analyzed. The results suggest that mobile agents can easily aggregate orders and shorten the execution time for matching orders.

AB The N-person snowdrift game is generalized to incorporate a third strategy. In addition to the cooperative C and non-cooperative D strategies, a strategy L representing a loner behavior is introduced. Agents taking on the L strategy (L-agents) do not contribute to the game as the C-agents do but they do not take advantage of the C-agents. Instead, they would rather settle with a fixed payoff Dynamical equations governing the time evolution of the frequencies of the strategies in a well-mixed population are derived. The dynamics and the frequencies of the steady state reveal the rich behavior resulting from the interplay between the payoff L, which promotes the non-cooperative behavior, and L. Detailed studies on how a system evolves indicated that the steady state could be an AllL, AllC, or C+D state, depending on the parameters r, L, and group size N. In contrast, only a C+D state results for r > 0 and an AllC state is possible only at r = 0 without the strategy L. With the strategy L, the AllC phase occupies a finite, though tiny, region of the r-L parameter space. The L-agents play an important role in the dynamics leading to the AllC phase. They help eliminate the D strategy in the transient and later only to be replaced by the C strategy. Phase diagrams in the r-L space are presented for different values of N. The strategy L plays two roles. It leads to an AllL phase and helps give an AllIC phase. An algorithm for simulating the model numerically is described and validated. The algorithm will be useful in studying our model in various structured populations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tropical countries lie at the nexus of three pressing issues for global sustainability: agricultural production, climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. The forces that drive forest protection do not necessarily oppose those that drive forest clearance for development. This decoupling, enhanced by the stronger economic forces compared to conservation, is detrimental for the social-ecological sustainability of forested tropical landscapes. This paper presents an integrated, and spatially-explicit, Agent-Based Model that examines the future impacts of land-use change scenarios on the sustainability of the Wet Tropics region of tropical Queensland, Australia. In particular, the model integrates Bayesian Belief Networks, Geographical Information Systems, empirical data and expert knowledge, under a land-sharing/land-sparing analysis, to study the impact of different landscape configurations on trade-offs and synergies among biodiversity and two ecosystem services (sugarcane production and carbon sequestration). Contrary to most tropical regions, model simulations show that Business As Usual is helping to reconcile these contrasting goals in the forested landscape of the Wet Tropics. The paper analyses which combination of governance and socio-economic factors is causing these positive results. This is an outstanding achievement for a tropical region, considering that most tropical areas are characterized for having stronger economic-land clearing forces compared to conservation forces, which reduce important ecosystem services for human wellbeing and the health of ecosystems.

AB This study aims at developing a non-(semi-)parametric method to extract the hidden network structure from the {0,1}-valued distribution flow data with missing observations on the links between nodes. Such an input data type widely exists in the studies of information propagation process, such as the rumor spreading through social media. In that case, a social network does exist as the media of the spreading process, but its link structure is completely unobservable; therefore, it is important to make inference of the structure (links) of the hidden network. Unlike the previous studies on this topic which only consider abstract networks, we believe that apart from the link structure, different social-economic features and different geographic locations of nodes can also play critical roles in shaping the spreading process, which has to be taken into account. To uncover the hidden link structure and its dependence on the external social-economic features of the node set, a multidimensional spatial social network model is constructed in this study with the spatial dimension large enough to account for all influential social-economic factors. Based on the spatial network, we propose a nonparametric mean-field equation to govern the rumor spreading process and apply the likelihood estimator to make inference of the unknown link structure from the observed rumor distribution flows. Our method turns out easily extendible to cover the class of block networks that are useful in most real applications. The method is tested through simulated data and demonstrated on a data set of rumor spreading on Twitter.

AB A series of eight novel podophyllotoxin derivatives were designed, synthesized and evaluated for biological activities. The antiproliferative activities were tested against a panel of human cancer cell lines (1(562, SGC, Hela and HepG) and the inhibition of tubulin polymerization was also evaluated. Compound 8e displayed significant antiproliferative activities for all four cell lines and strong levels of tubulin polymerization inhibition effect. Combined with cell apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, it demonstrated that compound 3e that effectively interfere with tubulin dynamics prevent mitosis in cancer cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and, eventually dose dependent apoptosis. All experimental measurements were also supported by molecular docking simulations of colchicine binding site, which revealed the governing forces for the binding behavior and a good relationship with anti-tubulin activity and antiproliferative activities. The synthesis and biological studies provided an interesting new class of antitubulin agents for development of lead compounds and also a direction for further structure modification to obtain more potent anti-cancer drugs.

AB The secreted mucus layer in the vaginal epithelium presents a formidable barrier to the transport of active agents for the prevention and treatment of female reproductive tract (FRT) infections. Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery has been proposed to help facilitate the transport and release of active agents through the cervicovaginal mucus (CVM) and underlying mucosa. However, both nanoparticles (NPs) and free active agents face a variety of challenges, often requiring the administration of high localized doses to circumvent leakage and poor penetration to targeted intravaginal tissue compartments. To address these challenges, "stealth" NP modifications have been investigated, due to their favorable mucus-penetrating properties, resulting in improved intravaginal active agent retention and transport. A number of other NP characteristics including size, surface modification type, ligand density, and co-modification, as well as the complexity of the FRT tissue are involved in obtaining adequate tissue penetration and, if needed, cell internalization. Studies that systematically investigate variations of these characteristics have yet to be conducted, with the goal to obtain a better understanding of what properties most impact prophylactic and therapeutic benefit. To complement the progress made with experimental evaluation of active agent transport in in vitro and in vivo, mathematical modeling has recently been applied to analyze the transport performance of agents and delivery vehicles in the FRT. Here, we build upon this work to simulate NP transport through mucus gel, epithelial, and stromal compartments, with the goal to provide a platform that can systematically evaluate transport based on NP and tissue characteristics. Model parameters such as PEG density and NP release (decay) rate from mucus gel into the epithelium, are set from previous in vitro and in vivo experimental work that assessed the transport of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs. The modeling results show that while unmodified and 2% PEG-modified NPs were retained in mucus for similar to 1-4 h, dependent upon decay constant values, and traverse to the epithelium, no NP penetration was observed in the stroma. In contrast, NPs modified with 3% PEG, exhibited prolonged retention in each compartment, remaining for similar to 4-6 h. Moreover, a significant concentration of NPs is observed in the stroma, indicating a transition in transport behavior. For NPs modified with 5,8, or 25% PEG, steady retention profiles were noted, which gradually decline over 24 h. To supplement this modeling study and to develop a more representative experimental system that may be useful in future work, we report on the feasibility of constructing single and multicellular layered (MCL) culture systems to represent the epithelial and stromal tissue of the FRT. We anticipate that a combined mathematical/experimental approach may longer term enable prediction and customization of patient tissue-specific approaches to attain effective NP-mediated drug delivery and release for the treatment of infectious disease.

AB In the rank of behavioral rules, imitation-based heuristics has received special attention in economics (see [14] and [12]). In particular, imitative behavior is considered in order to understand the evidences arising in experimental oligopolies which reveal that the Cournot-Nash equilibrium does not emerge as unique outcome and show that an important component of the production at the competitive level is observed (see e.g.[1,3,9] or [7,10]). By considering the pioneering groundbreaking approach of [2], we build a dynamical model of linear oligopolies where heterogeneous decision mechanisms of players are made explicit. In particular, we consider two different types of quantity setting players characterized by different decision mechanisms that coexist and operate simultaneously: agents that adaptively adjust their choices towards the direction that increases their profit are embedded with imitator agents. The latter ones use a particular form of proportional imitation rule that considers the awareness about the presence of strategic interactions. It is noteworthy that the Cournot-Nash outcome is a stationary state of our models. Our thesis is that the chaotic dynamics arousing from a dynamical model, where heterogeneous players are considered, are capable to qualitatively reproduce the outcomes of experimental oligopolies.

AB This study presents an experimental investigation on the bond durability of GFRP bars in concrete when subjected to harsh environments. The pullout specimens having different concrete covers were designed based on a created database to demonstrate the generality of the current experimental program. The freeze-thaw (FT) cycles, alkaline-saline (AS) solution, and both coupled effects were used to simulate environmental conditions in cold regions. The durability performance in terms of the failure mode, weight loss, relative dynamic modulus of elasticity, durability factor, as well as the bond strength, were measured and investigated accordingly. The test results revealed that the concrete cover with three times of the bar diameter was not sufficient to resist the environmental agents when exposed to weathering, including FT cycles, in which all the pullout specimens failed by concrete splitting. The coupled scenario of FT cycles and AS solution was observed to be the worst case among all the environmental conditions. Moreover, the analytical models: modified Bertero-Eligehausen-Popov (mBPE) model and CosenzaManfredi-Realfonzo (CMR) model, were calibrated by considering the environmental influences based on the experimental data to better demonstrate the degradation of GFRP-concrete bond.

AB Sonification is an open-ended design task to construct sound informing a listener of data. Understanding application context is critical for shaping design requirements for data translation into sound. Sonification requires methodology to maintain reproducibility when data sources exhibit non-linear properties of self-organization and emergent behavior. This research formalizes interactive sonification in an extensible model to support reproducibility when data exhibits emergent behavior. In the absence of sonification theory, extensibility demonstrates relevant methods across case studies. The interactive sonification framework foregrounds three factors: reproducible system implementation for generating sonification; interactive mechanisms enhancing a listener's multisensory observations; and reproducible data from models that characterize emergent behavior. Supramodal attention research suggests interactive exploration with auditory feedback can generate context for recognizing irregular patterns and transient dynamics. The sonification framework provides circular causality as a signal pathway for modeling a listener interacting with emergent behavior. The extensible sonification model adopts a data acquisition pathway to formalize functional symmetry across three subsystems: Experimental Data Source, Sound Generation, and Guided Exploration. To differentiate time criticality and dimensionality of emerging dynamics, tuning functions are applied between subsystems to maintain scale and symmetry of concurrent processes and temporal dynamics. Tuning functions accommodate sonification design strategies that yield order parameter values to render emerging patterns discoverable as well as rehearsable, to reproduce desired instances for clinical listeners. Case studies are implemented with two computational models, Chua's circuit and Swarm Chemistry social agent simulation, generating data in real-time that exhibits emergent behavior. Heuristic Listening is introduced as an informal model of a listener's clinical attention to data sonification through multisensory interaction in a context of structured inquiry. Three methods are introduced to assess the proposed sonification framework: Listening Scenario classification, data flow Attunement, and Sonification Design Patterns to classify sound control. Case study implementations are assessed against these methods comparing levels of abstraction between experimental data and sound generation. Outcomes demonstrate the framework performance as a reference model for representing experimental implementations, also for identifying common sonification structures having different experimental implementations, identifying common functions implemented in different subsystems, and comparing impact of affordances across multiple implementations of listening scenarios.

AB Commodity businesses account for more than 33% of the world trade and, simultaneously, face increasing sectoral competition and environmental pressures from both government and civil society. They are globally organized in different inter-firm configurations, and even when there are system-level goals, it does not imply that the constituent agent shares them. Notwithstanding the relevance of commodity firms, there is no systematic review of their inter-organizational configurations and impact on economic, social, and environmental terms. We review 141 papers published in management journals in the last 31 years, that simultaneously analyze a commodity firm and its inter-organizational form, to examine how commodity firms interact with each other and explore their economic, social, or environmental impact. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we identify that the network/cluster is the main inter-organizational form adopted in the commodity sector and that no research investigates a combination of both economic and environmental impacts, based on this finding, this paper contributes a consolidated framework to guide future research on inter-organizational forms of commodity firms by explicitly stating the link between inter-organizational forms and outputs; (2) we identify that almost 90% of the papers either do not mention a specific theory (45%) or use a single theory (42%) to guide their research, thus highlighting the need for theoretical development in the field; (3) given the relevance of the commodity sector in environmental challenges, this paper contributes both the conceptual and empirical base to policy design and implementation. This paper ends with contributions and suggestions for further research. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Once an epidemic outbreak has been effectively contained through non-pharmaceutical interventions, a safe protocol is required for the subsequent release of social distancing restrictions to prevent a disastrous resurgence of the infection. We report individual-based numerical simulations of stochastic susceptible-infectious-recovered model variants on four distinct spatially organized lattice and network architectures wherein contact and mobility constraints are implemented. We robustly find that the intensity and spatial spread of the epidemic recurrence wave can be limited to a manageable extent provided release of these restrictions is delayed sufficiently (for a duration of at least thrice the time until the peak of the unmitigated outbreak) and long-distance connections are maintained on a low level (limited to less than five percent of the overall connectivity).

ID INFECTION
AB In an experimental group of 200 four-month-age, male Sprague Dawley SPF rats, kept with barrier until death without any further interference, after a single intrapleural injection of a dose of suspected carcinogenic (Phalaris spp.) plant fibres given after weaning, a disease occurred. The syndrome consisted of wasting, excessive thirst, yeast smelling copious urination and inflamed prepuce. It affected increasing numbers in the colony with gradual spread. Microbiology and histology revealed a severe invasion by Candida albicans of the inflamed urogenital tract, particularly involving the kidneys, bladder and prostate. Treatment by antifungal agents could not prevent the total eventual loss of the whole experimental group, apparently due to this endemic infection. The suspected carcinogen treated animals as well as their vehicle-only controls and saline-only controls were equally affected. At the same time a group of female Wistar rats held in the same room simultaneously but on different animal racks were totally unaffected, so were further groups of male Sprague Dawley rats housed in the same area and animal rack disinfected after this incident. It appears that non-specific facultative pathogens can cause frank disease in laboratory animals under certain stress conditions. In this case the housing of males and females separately but in the same animal room could have acted as the triggering stress factor. The development of this pathological picture could have been facilitated by Pseudomonas aerugenosa, also detected microbiologically in third of the animals. The source of the infection was not considered to be of concern as many people (including animal care staff) and animals are (mostly symptomless) carriers of this organism. Therefore its entry cannot be easily prevented on open-shelf laboratory animal housing systems even in barrier protected animal units.

AB This paper investigates the effects of independent nonconformists or influencers on the behavioral dynamic of a population of agents interacting with each other based on the Sznajd model. The system is modeled on a complete graph using the master equation. The acquired equation has been numerically solved. Accuracy of the mathematical model and its corresponding assumptions have been validated by numerical simulations. Regions of initial magnetization have been found from where the system converges to one of two unique steady-state PDFs, depending on the distribution of influencers. The scaling property and entropy of the stationary system in presence of varying level of influence have been presented and discussed.

AB Development of new materials for tooth bleaching justifies the need for studies to evaluate the changes in the enamel surface caused by different bleaching protocols. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the bovine dental enamel wear in function of different bleaching gel protocols, acid etching and pH variation. Material and Methods: Sixty fragments of bovine teeth were cut, obtaining a control and test areas. In the test area, one half received etching followed by a bleaching gel application, and the other half, only the bleaching gel. The fragments were randomly divided into six groups (n=10), each one received one bleaching session with five hydrogen peroxide gel applications of 8 min, activated with hybrid light, diode laser/blue LED (HL) or diode laser/violet LED (VHL) (experimental): Control (C); 35% Total Blanc Office (TBO35HL); 35% Lase Peroxide Sensy (LPS35HL); 25% Lase Peroxide Sensy II (LPS25HL); 15% Lase Peroxide Lite (LPL15HL); and 1096 hydrogen peroxide (experimental) (EXP1OVHL). pH values were determined by a pHnneter at the initial and final time periods. Specimens were stored, subjected to simulated brushing cycles, and the superficial wear was determined (pm). ANOVA and Tukey 's tests were applied (alpha=0.05). Results: The pH showed a slight decrease, except for Group LPL15HL. Group LPS25HL showed the highest degree of wear, with and without etching. Conclusion: There was a decrease from the initial to the final pH. Different bleaching gels were able to increase the surface wear values after simulated brushing. Acid etching before bleaching increased surface wear values in all groups.

AB A vast body of literature suggests that the European Alpine Region is amongst the most sensitive socio-ecosystems to climate change impacts. Our model represents the winter tourism socio-ecosystem of Auronzo di Cadore, located in the Dolomites (Italy), which economic and environmental conditions are highly vulnerable to climate variations. This agent-based model includes eight types of agents corresponding to different winter tourist profiles based on their socio-economic background and activity targets. The model is calibrated with empirical data while results are authenticated through direct interaction of local stakeholders with the model. The model is then used for assessing three hypothetical and contrasted infrastructure-oriented adaptation strategies for the winter tourism industry, that have been previously discussed with local stakeholders, as possible alternatives to the "business-as-usual" situation. These strategies are tested against multiple future scenarios that include: (a) future weather conditions in terms of snow cover and temperature, (b) the future composition and total number of tourists and (c) the type of market competition. A set of socio-economic indicators, which are strongly coupled with relevant environmental consequences, are considered in order to draw conclusions on the robustness of the selected strategies.

AB In this paper, we attempt to use the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller to achieve the chaos synchronization for delayed discrete chaotic systems. Three PID control gains can be optimally determined by means of using a novel optimization algorithm, called the particle swarm optimization (PSO). The algorithm is motivated from the organism behavior of fish schooling and bird flocking, and involves the social psychology principles in socio-cognition human agents and evolutionary computations. It has a good numerical convergence for solving optimization problem. To show the validity of the PSO-based PID control for chaos synchronization, several cases with different initial populations are considered and some simulation results are shown.

AB Only a handful of studies have leveraged agent-based models (ABMs) to examine public health outcomes and policy interventions associated with uneven urban food environments. While providing keen insights about the role of ABMs in studying urban food environments, these studies underutilize real-world data on individual behavior in their models. This study provides a unique contribution to the ABM and food access literature by utilizing survey data to develop an empirically-rich spatially-explicit ABM of food access. This model is used to simulate and scrutinize individual travel behavior associated with accessing food in low-income neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment in Detroit (Michigan), U.S. In particular, the relationship between trip frequencies, mode of travel, store choice, and distances traveled among individuals grouped into strata based on selected sociodemographic characteristics, including household income and age, is examined. Results reveal a diversified picture of not only how income and age shape food shopping travel but also the different thresholds of tolerance for non-motorized travel to stores. Younger and poorer population subgroups have a higher propensity to utilize non-motorized travel for shopping than older and wealthier subgroups. While all groups tend to travel considerable distances outside their immediate local food environment, different sociodemographic groups maintain unique spatial patterns of grocery-shopping behavior throughout the city and the suburbs. Overall, these results challenge foundational tenets in urban planning and design, regarding the specific characteristics necessary in the built environment to facilitate accessibility to urban amenities, such as grocery stores. In neighborhoods experiencing disinvestment, sociodemographic conditions play a more important role than the built environment in shaping food accessibility and ultimately travel behavior.

AB Recent research suggests that social networks may present an avenue for intervention against obesity. By using a simulation model in which artificial individuals were nested in a social network, we assessed whether interventions targeting highly networked individuals could help reduce population obesity. We compared the effects of targeting antiobesity interventions at the most connected individuals in a network with those targeting individuals at random. We tested 2 interventions, the first "preventing" obesity among 10% of the population at simulation outset and the second "treating" obesity among 10% of the obese population yearly, each in 2 separate simulations. One simulation featured a literature-based parameter for the network spread of obesity, and the other featured an artificially high parameter. Interventions that targeted highly networked individuals did not outperform at-random interventions in simulations featuring the literature-based parameter. However, in simulations featuring the artificially high parameter, the targeted prevention intervention outperformed the at-random intervention, whereas the treatment intervention implemented at random outperformed the targeted treatment intervention. Results were qualitatively similar across network topologies and intervention scales. Although descriptive studies suggest that social networks influence the spread of obesity, policies targeting well-connected individuals in social networks may not improve obesity reduction. We highlight and discuss the potential applications of counterfactual simulations in epidemiology.

AB Purpose: To investigate the desensitizing ability of a one-bottle bonding agent and a glutaraldehyde-based HEMA formulation on sensitive tooth cervical areas for a period up to 9 months. Methods: The sample consisted of 40 patients with cervical hypersensitivity. Three sensitive teeth per patient were treated; one received One-Step (one-bottle bonding agent), the other Gluma Desensitizer (glutaraldehyde-based agent) and the third distilled water (control group). The hypersensitivity level was determined before, immediately after the desensitizing session, at 8 weeks, and 9 months post-treatment. Measurements of sensitivity were determined by the patient's response to tactile and air-blast stimuli. A verbal rating scale was used and scored as follows: 0, no discomfort; 1, discomfort but no severe pain; 2, severe pain during simulation; 3, severe pain after simulation. The results were subjected to statistical analysis by Kruskal-Wallis test (a=0.05). Results: Both treatment procedures resulted in reduction of hypersensitivity to both stimuli, for up to 9 months. No significant differences were recorded between One-Step and Gluma Desensitizer at immediate and 8-week examinations, whereas Gluma Desensitizer produced lower hypersensitivity than One-Step at the 9-month assessment. In general, a lower level of reduction was found for the 9-month interval compared to the 8-week hypersensitivity score for both agents tested. A placebo effect was observed with water treatment, ranging from 4.7 to 27.5% reduction of hypersensitivity.

AB We show that precise knowledge of epidemic transmission parameters is not required to build an informative model of the spread of disease. We propose a detailed model of the topology of the contact network under various external control regimes and demonstrate that this is sufficient to capture the salient dynamical characteristics and to inform decisions. Contact between individuals in the community is characterised by a contact graph, the structure of that contact graph is selected to mimic community control measures. Our model of city-level transmission of an infectious agent (SEIR model) characterises spread via a (a) scale-free contact network (no control); (b) a random graph (elimination of mass gatherings); and (c) small world lattice (partial to full lockdown- "social" distancing). This model exhibits good qualitative agreement between simulation and data from the 2020 pandemic spread of a novel coronavirus. Estimates of the relevant rate parameters of the SEIR model are obtained and we demonstrate the robustness of our model predictions under uncertainty of those estimates. The social context and utility of this work is identified, contributing to a highly effective pandemic response in Western Australia.

AB We investigate the performance of a variant of Axelrod's model for dissemination of culture-the Adaptive Culture Heuristic (ACH)-on solving an NP-Complete optimization problem, namely, the classification of binary input patterns of size F by a Boolean Binary Perceptron. In this heuristic, N agents, characterized by binary strings of length F which represent possible solutions to the optimization problem, are fixed at the sites of a square lattice and interact with their nearest neighbors only. The interactions are such that the agents' strings (or cultures) become more similar to the low-cost strings of their neighbors resulting in the dissemination of these strings across the lattice. Eventually the dynamics freezes into a homogeneous absorbing configuration in which all agents exhibit identical solutions to the optimization problem. We find through extensive simulations that the probability of finding the optimal solution is a function of the reduced variable F/N-1/4 so that the number of agents must increase with the fourth power of the problem size, N proportional to F-4, to guarantee a fixed probability of success. In this case, we find that the relaxation time to reach an absorbing configuration scales with F-6 which can be interpreted as the overall computational cost of the ACH to find an optimal set of weights for a Boolean binary perceptron, given a fixed probability of success.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of transcatheter embolization by forcible intraarterial injection of a, mixture of ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL) and ethanol under microballoon occlusion compared with conventional transcatheter arterial embolization methods in nontumoral swine liver.
   Materials and Methods: Nine swine were divided into three groups: embolization with EVAL/ethanol mixture (EVAL group, n = 5), with ethiodized oil (ethiodized oil group, n = 2), and with microspheres (microspheres group, n = 2). Embolization was performed at the subsegmental hepatic artery. The EVAL/ethanol mixture was injected forcibly through a microcatheter with a balloon, which was inflated to prevent backflow of the mixture during the injection. Ethiodized oil or microspheres were injected into the artery using a microcatheter without balloon occlusion. Two animals of the EVAL group were euthanized immediately after embolization, and the distribution of EVAL was assessed microscopically. The remaining seven animal were euthanized 4 weeks after embolization, and the histopathologic changes were assessed.
   Results: All procedures were technically successful. EVAL occupied > 80% of the hepatic arterial, portal venous, and sinusoidal lumens after embolization. Ischemic coagulation necrosis was observed 4 weeks after embolization in the EVAL group. Parenchymal necrosis was not observed in the ethiodized oil and microspheres groups.
   Conclusions: Transcatheter embolization by forcible intraarterial injection of an EVAL/ethanol mixture under microballoon occlusion was feasible and achieved the simultaneous embolization of hepatic artery, portal vein, and sinusoids in swine liver, resulting in complete necrosis of the segment that received embolization.

TI Agent-Based Model Forecasts Aging of the Population of People Who Inject

AB People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk for blood-borne pathogens transmitted during the sharing of contaminated injection equipment, particularly hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV prevalence is influenced by a complex interplay of drug-use behaviors, social networks, and geography, as well as the availability of interventions, such as needle exchange programs. To adequately address this complexity in HCV epidemic forecasting, we have developed a computational model, the Agent-based Pathogen Kinetics model (APK). APK simulates the PWID population in metropolitan Chicago, including the social interactions that result in HCV infection. We used multiple empirical data sources on Chicago PWID to build a spatial distribution of an in silico PWID population and modeled networks among the PWID by considering the geography of the city and its suburbs. APK was validated against 2012 empirical data (the latest available) and shown to agree with network and epidemiological surveys to within 1%. For the period 2010-2020, APK forecasts a decline in HCV prevalence of 0.8% per year from 44(+/- 2)% to 36(+/- 5)%, although some sub-populations would continue to have relatively high prevalence, including Non-Hispanic Blacks, 48(+/- 5)%. The rate of decline will be lowest in Non-Hispanic Whites and we find, in a reversal of historical trends, that incidence among non-Hispanic Whites would exceed incidence among Non-Hispanic Blacks (0.66 per 100 per years vs 0.17 per 100 person years). APK also forecasts an increase in PWID mean age from 35(+/- 1) to 40(+/- 2) with a corresponding increase from 59 (+/- 2)% to 80(+/- 6)% in the proportion of the population >30 years old. Our studies highlight the importance of analyzing subpopulations in disease predictions, the utility of computer simulation for analyzing demographic and health trends among PWID and serve as a tool for guiding intervention and prevention strategies in Chicago, and other major cities.

AB BACKGROUND The world is seeing a substantial rise in the awareness of the health benefits of concentrated fruit juices resulting from their nutritional, functional and sensory properties, which are similar to the availability of natural fresh fruits in the market. Watermelon concentrated juice is enriched with lycopene, an important ingredient used in functional foods such as energy drinks and nutraceutical supplements. Lycopene helps to combat the risk of cancer and heart disease, and has diuretic and anti-inflammatory properties. Capturing the fresh flavor of watermelon without losing its nutritional value is a real challenge using current manufacturing techniques.
   RESULTS The present investigation describes using an indigenous hydrophilized polyamide membrane for the concentration of watermelon juice by forward osmosis (FO). The process enables juice concentration by retaining the original taste, color and nutrient contents. Bench-scale experimental trials were carried out using the FO process in a countercurrent flow direction at different liquid flow rates of 1.0 to 2.0 L min(-1) and draw agent solution concentrations of 0.2 to 1.0 mol L-1 NaCl. The process ensured the recovery of 96.01% lycopene from the concentrated juice, which was found satisfactory with PRO/II simulation, by removal of 70-80% pure water from the juice.
   Conclusions The experimental results demonstrated that the lycopene concentration factor showed a 4.14-fold increase and could be stored successfully at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 30 days; the degradation of lycopene followed first-order reaction kinetics. Hence, the pure extracted lycopene can be recommended for use in food, medicine, cosmetics, nutraceuticals, coloring agents and pharmaceuticals. (c) 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).

Based on the graph theory, Lyapunov stability theory, backstepping technique and event-triggered control theory, an event-triggered protocol is proposed for the considered multiple mechanical systems. It is proved that the practical leader-following consensus can be achieved by the proposed protocol. Meanwhile, to exclude the Zeno behaviour, a positive lower bound of inter-event intervals is given. Finally, we provide a numerical simulation to illustrate the effectiveness of the given protocol.

AB Changes in electrodermal activity (EDA) correlate with arousal and stress during stimulating experiences. We hypothesized that associations exist between short-term performance gains and changes in EDA. A total of 187 combat medics were randomly assigned to simulation (S), live tissue (L), or video (V) based training in the recognition and treatment of nerve agent casualties. Change in EDA from baseline to training was quantified for tonic and phasic responses and was categorized as positive (>+10%), no change (+/- 10%), or negative (<-10%). Cognitive and psychomotor skills assessments were applied before and after the baseline/training period to quantify short-term performance changes. Statistically significant differences in both EDA arousal measures between training modalities (p < 0.001 with L>S similar to V) were observed. Notably, larger proportions of trainees experienced negative changes in tonic (67%) and phasic (21%) EDA measures in the V group when compared to the L and S groups. Regardless of training modality, negative tonic and phasic EDA responses were associated with lower psychomotor performance gains and this finding approached statistical significance (tonic: p = 0.056, phasic: p = 0.08). No significant differences were noted in pre- to post-training cognitive performance between EDA response categories. As quantified by EDA response to training, reduced arousal was associated with lower short-term psychomotor, but not cognitive, performance gains.

(Games Econ Behav 10:122-142, 1995), and anticipates a random matching of partners taking in to account adaptive agent behavior. Simulation in the NetLogo programming environment, using profile distributions obtained from empirical studies, has shown the most successful agents to posses low parameters of trust in the role of Sender and high parameters of trustworthiness in the role of Receiver.

AB Crowd simulations span a wide spectrum of application domains, most notably video games, evacuation scenarios, and the movie industry. However, it is not obligatory that all virtual populace applications have the primary objective of realistic simulation. In most instances, it is necessary and sufficient that viewers perceive the crowd as plausible. Even for a crowd consisting of agents navigating on linear trajectories without any maneuvers, visual motion illusion elicited by these trajectories might appear to be a natural consequence, causing them to be perceived as wriggling rather than straight. In this respect, we evaluate in this study whether simulated 3D human agents walking with constant, collision-free velocities, induce such a maneuvering motion illusion, aiming toward an efficient real-time crowd simulation. For this purpose, we recorded videos of virtual human crowds with different parameter combinations, such as the agent walking speed, crowd density, camera tilt angle, and camera distance. These videos were watched by human subjects who were instructed to mark the virtual agents who they thought had changed their gait directions. The analyzed results revealed that participants claimed the presence of maneuvering virtual agents in the videos, even though there were none in any of them. Spatial grouping of the markings highlighted that the participants mainly focused on the central area of the simulation environment, and spatiotemporal analysis of the click data also showed stronger evidence to such an illusion (see accompanying video). Furthermore, we found that all of the referred parameters have statistically significant main effects on the number of marked agents per watched video.

ID OPINION FORMATION; ORDERING KINETICS; DYNAMICS
AB We examine an opinion formation model, which is a mixture of Voter and Ising agents. Numerical simulations show that even a very small fraction (similar to 1%) of the Ising agents drastically changes the behavior of the Voter model. The Voter agents act as a medium, which correlates sparsely dispersed Ising agents, and the resulting ferromagnetic ordering persists up to a certain temperature. Upon addition of the Ising agents, a logarithmically slowcoarsening of theVoter model ( d = 2), or its active steady state ( d = 3), change into an Ising- type power- law coarsening.

AB Purpose: To establish how far liposomal copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), respectively, reduce radiation-induced fibrosis (RIF), using a well-characterized pig model of RIF permitting the design of a controlled laboratory experiment.
   Methods and Materials: In this model of acute localized gamma irradiation simulating accidental overexposure in humans, three groups of five large white pigs were irradiated using a collimated Ir-192 source to deliver a single dose of 160 Gy onto the skin surface (100%) of the outer side of the thigh. A well-defined block of subcutaneous fibrosis involving skin and skeletal muscle developed 6 months after irradiation. One experimental group of five pigs was then injected i.m. with 10 mg/10 kg b.wt. of Cu/Zn-SOD, twice a week for 3 weeks, and another experimental group of five was infected with 10 mg/10 kg b.wt. of Mn-SOD, three times a week for 3 weeks. Five irradiated control pigs were injected with physiological serum. Animals were assessed for changes in the density of the palpated fibrotic block and in the dimensions of the projected cutaneous surface. Block depth was determined by ultrasound. Physical and sonographic findings were confirmed by autopsy 12-14 weeks after completing SOD injections. The density, length, width, and depth of the fibrotic block, and the areas and volume of its projected cutaneous surface were compared before treatment, 1, 3, and 6 weeks thereafter, and at autopsy, 12-14 weeks after treatment ended.
   Results: The experimental animals exhibited no change in behavior and no abnormal clinical or anatomic signs. Whether they were given Cu/Zn- dr Mn-SOD, significant and roughly equivalent softening and shrinking of the fibrotic block were noted in all treated animals between the first week after treatment ended and autopsy, when mean regression was 45% for length and width, 30% for depth, and 70% for area and volume. Histologic examination showed completely normal muscle and subcutaneous tissue surrounding the residual scar. This replacement of scar tissue by normal tissue in experimental animals and the 50% decrease in the linear dimensions of the scar were comparable to the results obtained in previous clinical studies and highly significant compared to the clinical and autopsy results for the control animals.
   Conclusions: Our results are striking and comparable to the results obtained in our previous clinical study after liposomal Cu/Zn-SOD treatment. To our knowledge, this is the first time that two agents have been shown to reverse the radiation-induced fibrotic process in experimental animals and to permit the regeneration of normal tissue in a zone of well-established postirradiation fibrosis.

AB BackgroundTo evaluate the effect of distilled water, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), phosphoric acid and maleic acid on Biodentine regarding surface topography, microhardness and push-out bond strength (POBS).
   MethodsFifty-two cylindrical shaped Biodentine specimens were divided into groups: control (distilled water); EDTA (17% EDTA); PA (37% phosphoric acid); and MA (7% maleic acid). Surfaces were evaluated by topographic analysis and Vickers microhardness test. Topographic changes were evaluated qualitatively and microhardness was statistically analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test. Forty mandibular molars were used to simulate clinical conditions. The crowns were removed and a perforation was created at the furcal floor. The Biodentine was packed into the root perforations and the roots were divided into four groups (DW, EDTA, PA, MA). Samples were stored and subjected to interfacial analysis. POBS data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests.
   ResultsEthylenediaminetetraacetic acid, MA and PA changed the morphology of the Biodentine surface. PA showed microhardness similar to distilled water (P > 0.05), while MA and EDTA demonstrated reduced values when compared with PA (P < 0.05). PA improved the POBS of Biodentine in comparison with the control.
   ConclusionsChanges in the topography, microhardness and POBS of Biodentine are associated with irrigant agent used.

AB Chronic infection and inflammation have recently been implicated as important etiologic agents for atherosclerosis in general and, in particular, ischemic heart disease. Several agents have been suggested as possible candidates for the chronic inflammation including cytomegalovirus, Helicobacter pylori and Chlamydia pneumoniae. We hypothesized that a vascular infection with C. pneumoniae may induce a chronic inflammatory reaction in the host vascular tissue and activated inflammatory cells may express inflammatory mediators such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). At first, we evaluated the relationship between C. pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis indirectly by serologic study, and then, to confirm our hypothesis, we performed an immunohistochemical study of atherosclerotic plaques. The seropositive rate of anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae IgG was higher in the disease group (Group I, 59.8%, n = 254) than in the negative control group (Group III, 47.4%, n = 97) (p = 0.041), but the anci-Chlamydia pneumoniae IgA was not different in seropositivity between the two groups (Group I, 64.6%; Group III, 57.7%). The simultaneous seropositive rates of both IgG and IgA were 56.7% in Group I and 43.3% in Group III (p = 0.033). Tn subgroups without the conventional risk factors of atherosclerosis, these findings were more prominent. Furthermore, we performed immunohistochemical staining on the atherosclerotic aortic tissues obtained from patients that were seropositive to C. pneumoniae (n = 5), by using antibodies to C. pneumoniae, COX-2, and MMP-9. The immunoreactivity for COX-2 and MMP-9 increased in the atherosclerotic plaques itself, predominantly in the surrounding area of immunoreactive C. pneumoniae. These findings support our hypothesis and C. pneumoniae may participate in a pathogenetic mechanism for atherogenesis or progression of atherosclerosis. The present study may open a promising perspective concerning future therapeutic trials of chronic inflammation related atherogenesis under pathophysiological conditions.

TI Learning by collaborative and individual-based recommendation agents
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID BRAND CHOICE BEHAVIOR; CONSUMER
AB Intelligent recommendation systems can be based on 2 basic principles: collaborative filters and individual-based agents. In this work we examine the learning function that results from these 2 general types of teaming-smart agents. There has been significant work on the predictive properties of each type, but no work has examined the patterns in their learning from feedback over repeated trials. Using simulations, we create clusters of "consumers" with heterogeneous utility functions and efforful reservation utility thresholds. The consumers go shopping with one of the designated smart agents, receive recommendations from the agents, and purchase products they like and reject ones they do not. Based on the purchase-no purchase behavior of the consumers, agents learn about the consumers and potentially improve the quality of their recommendations. We characterize learning curves by modified exponential functions with an intercept for percentage of recommendations accepted at Trial 0, an asymptotic rate of recommendation acceptance, and a rate at which learning moves from intercept to asymptote. We compare the learning of a baseline random recommendation agent, an individual-based logistic-regression agent, and two types of collaborative filters that rely on K-mean clustering (popular in most commercial applications) and nearest-neighbor algorithms. Compared to the collaborative filtering agents, the individual agent (a) learns more slowly, initially, but performs better in the long run when the environment is stable; (b) is less negatively affected by permanent changes in the consumer's utility function; and (c) is less adversely affected by error in the reservation threshold to which consumers compare a recommended product's utility. The K-mean agent reaches a lower asymptote but approaches it faster, reflecting a surprising stickiness of target classifications after feedback from recommendations made under initial (incorrect) hypotheses.

AB Manipulating the plasma membrane, the gateway to the cell interior, with chemical and physical agents for genetic and pharmacological therapy, and understanding the interactions of lipid membrane components with proteins and other structural and functional elements of the cell, require a detailed biomolecular membrane model. We report here progress along one path toward such a model: molecular dynamics simulations of mixed, zwitterionic-anionic, asymmetric phospholipid bilayers with monovalent and divalent cations. With phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine systems, we identify temporal and concentration boundaries for equilibration of calcium with the bilayer and saturation of the calcium capacity of the membrane, we demonstrate the electrostatic- and entropic-driven associations of calcium and sodium ions with polar groups in the bilayer interface region, expressed in spatial distribution profiles and in changes in the orientation of the phospholipid head groups, and we describe for the first time simulations of dynamic, calcium-mediated adjustments in the conformation of mixed phospholipid species coresident in the same leaflet of the bilayer. The results are consistent with experimental observations and point the way to further refinement and increased realism of these molecular models.

LA English
DT Article
DE conversation model; agent attributes; smart event; behavior trees; crowd

ID SIMULATION; MODEL
AB Conversations between two people are ubiquitous in many inhabited contexts. The kinds of conversations that occur depend on several factors, including the time, the location of the participating agents, the spatial relationship between the agents, and the type of conversation in which they are engaged. The statistical distribution of dyadic conversations among a population of agents will therefore depend on these factors. In addition, the conversation types, flow, and duration will depend on agent attributes such as interpersonal relationships, emotional state, personal priorities, and socio-cultural proxemics. We present a framework for distributing conversations among virtual embodied agents in a real-time simulation. To avoid generating actual language dialogues, we express variations in the conversational flow by using behavior trees implementing a set of conversation archetypes. The flow of these behavior trees depends in part on the agents' attributes and progresses based on parametrically estimated transitional probabilities. With the participating agents' state, a smart event model steers the interchange to different possible outcomes as it executes. Example behavior trees are developed for two conversation archetypes: buyerseller negotiations and simple askinganswering; the model can be readily extended to others. Because the conversation archetype is known to participating agents, they can animate their gestures appropriate to their conversational state. The resulting animated conversations demonstrate reasonable variety and variability within the environmental context. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB This paper proposes a general computational framework for empirical estimation of financial agent-based models, for which criterion functions have unknown analytical form. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed nonparametric simulated maximum likelihood estimation based on kernel methods. In combination with the model developed by Brock and Hommes (1998), which is one of the most widely analysed heterogeneous agent models in the literature, we extensively test the properties and behaviour of the estimation framework, as well as its ability to recover parameters consistently and efficiently using simulations. Key empirical findings indicate the statistical insignificance of the switching coefficient but markedly significant belief parameters that define heterogeneous trading regimes with a predominance of trend following over contrarian strategies. In addition, we document a slight proportional dominance of fundamentalists over trend-following chartists in major world markets. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) characterizes a new generation of technologies capable of interacting with the environment and aiming to simulate human intelligence. The success of integrating AI into organizations critically depends on workers' trust in AI technology. This review explains how AI differs from other technologies and presents the existing empirical research on the determinants of human "trust" in AI, conducted in multiple disciplines over the last 20 years. Based on the reviewed literature, we identify the form of AI representation (robot, virtual, and embedded) and its level of machine intelligence (i.e., its capabilities) as important antecedents to the development of trust and propose a framework that addresses the elements that shape users' cognitive and emotional trust. Our review reveals the important role of AI's tangibility, transparency, reliability, and immediacy behaviors in developing cognitive trust, and the role of AI's anthropomorphism specifically for emotional trust. We also note several limitations in the current evidence base, such as the diversity of trust measures and overreliance on short-term, small sample, and experimental studies, where the development of trust is likely to be different than in longer-term, higher stakes field environments. Based on our review, we suggest the most promising paths for future research.

ID HUMANS; COMPULSIVITY; PROTECTS; CHOICES; HABITS
AB Many studies that aim to detect model-free and model-based influences on behavior employ two-stage behavioral tasks of the type pioneered by Daw and colleagues in 2011. Such studies commonly modify existing two-stage decision paradigms in order to better address a given hypothesis, which is an important means of scientific progress. It is, however, critical to fully appreciate the impact of any modified or novel experimental design features on the expected results. Here, we use two concrete examples to demonstrate that relatively small changes in the two-stage task design can substantially change the pattern of actions taken by model-free and model-based agents as a function of the reward outcomes and transitions on previous trials. In the first, we show that, under specific conditions, purely model-free agents will produce the reward by transition interactions typically thought to characterize model-based behavior on a two-stage task. The second example shows that model-based agents' behavior is driven by a main effect of transition-type in addition to the canonical reward by transition interaction whenever the reward probabilities of the final states do not sum to one. Together, these examples emphasize the task-dependence of model-free and model-based behavior and highlight the benefits of using computer simulations to determine what pattern of results to expect from both model-free and model-based agents performing a given two-stage decision task in order to design choice paradigms and analysis strategies best suited to the current question.

AB Horizontal Cooperation is emerging as a way to increase competitiveness in logistics and transportation. Its implementation, however, may be hindered by conflicts and opportunist behavior among the members of the coalition. This paper develops an agent-based simulation model studying the evolution of a coalition over time taking into account various trust-related issues. Different degrees of cooperation, rules for enlarging the coalition with new members as well as a Shapley-based methodology for allocating savings are implemented. To calculate such savings, vehicle routing solution procedures are further integrated. This enables an extensive investigation of the effects of Horizontal Cooperation from both an economic and environmental perspective. Experimental results highlight that significant savings can be achieved with the degree of cooperation and trust-related issues indicating the highest importance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB Generating replicable and empirically valid models of human decision-making is crucial for the scientific accuracy and reproducibility of agent-based models. A two-fold challenge in developing models of decision-making is a lack of high resolution and high quality behavioral data and the need for more transparent means of translating these data into models. A common and largely successful approach to modeling is hand-crafting agent decision heuristics from qualitative field interviews. This empirically-based, qualitative approach successfully incorporates contextual decision making, heterogeneous preferences, and decision strategies. However, it is labor intensive and often leads to models that are hard to replicate, thereby limiting the scale and scope over which such methods can be usefully applied. A potential solution to these problems is provided by new approaches in natural language processing, which can use textual sources ranging from field interview transcripts to unstructured data from the web to capture and represent human cognition. Here we use word embeddings, a vector-based representation of language, to create agents that reason using similarity comparison. This approach proves to be effective at mirroring theoretical expectations for human decision biases across a range of natural language decision-making tasks. We provide a proof-of-concept agent-based model that illustrates how the agents we create can be readily deployed to study cultural diffusion. The agent-based model replicates previously found results with the added benefit of qualitative interpretability. The agent architecture we propose is able to mirror human likelihood assessments from natural language and offers a new way to model agent cognitive processes for a broad array of agent-based modeling use cases.

AB This paper develops an endogenous growth model having a progressive income tax structure in which heterogeneous agents, who differ in terms of their rates of time preference, supply labor elastically. We analyze the dynamic adjustment to an increase in progressivity and show that the economy will converge to an equilibrium growth path with nondegenerate distributions of both income and wealth. The role of the endogeneity of labor supply is emphasized and shown to have a major impact on the nature of the transitional path, as a result of the impact of the progressive tax on agents' work incentives. Our theoretical analysis is supplemented with, and supported by, numerical simulations, which generally match the empirical evidence rather closely. We also show that the responses of the different income groups contrast sharply from one another so that focusing on the economy-wide average provides an incomplete picture.

AB A series of uniaxial cyclic tests were carried out on solid cylindrical specimens of an epoxy resin, Epon 826/Epi-Cure Curing Agent 9551. The focus of the study was to investigate time-dependent viscoelastic behavior of this thermosetting polymer material under cyclic loading and to develop a constitutive model with the capabilities to simulate the observed deformation response. The tests include stress-controlled or strain-controlled cyclic loading with/without mean stress or mean strain at various amplitudes and loading rates. It was found that the cyclic stress-strain response of this material is amplitude-dependent and rate-dependent, and the response to axial tension is different from that in compression. The stress-strain loops exhibit more pronounced nonlinearity with high amplitudes or low loading rates. For stress-controlled cyclic loading with mean stress, ratcheting strain is accumulated, which is of viscoelastic nature, and this is confirmed by its full recovery after load removal. For strain-controlled cyclic loading with mean strain, the mean stress relaxation occurs, which contributes to the observed longer life in comparison to the stress-controlled cyclic loading with mean stress.

AB The action of the penetration-enhancing agent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), on phospholipid monolayers was investigated at the air water interface using a combination of experimental techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Brewster angle microscopy revealed that DPPC monolayers remained laterally homogeneous at subphase concentrations up to a mole fraction of 0.1 DMSO. Neutron reflectometry of the monolayers in combination with isotopic substitution enabled the determination of solvent profiles as a function of distance perpendicular to the interface for the different DMSO subphase concentrations. These experimental results were compared to those obtained from molecular dynamic (MD) simulations of the corresponding monolayer systems. There was excellent agreement found between the MD-derived reflectivity curves and the measured data for all of the H/D contrast variations investigated. The MD provide a detailed description of the distribution of water and DMSO molecules around the phosphatidylcholine headgroup, and how this distribution changes with increasing DMSO concentrations. Significantly, the measurements and simulations that are reported here support the hypothesis that DMSO acts by dehydrating phosphatidylcholine headgroup, and as such provide the first direct evidence that it does so primarily by displacing water molecules bound to the choline group.

ID DELAUNAY
AB We present a new methodology for agent modeling that is scalable and efficient. It is based on the integration of nonlinear dynamical systems and kinetic data structures. The method consists of three layers, which together model 3D agent steering, crowds and flocks among moving and static obstacles. The first layer, the local layer employs nonlinear dynamical systems theory to models low-level behaviors. It is fast and efficient, and it does not depend on the total number of agents in the environment. This dynamical systems-based approach also allows us to establish continuous numerical parameters for modifying each agent's behavior. The second layer, a global environment layer consists of a specifically designed kinetic data structure to track efficiently the immediate environment of each agent and know which obstacles/agents are near or visible to the given agent. This layer reduces the complexity in the local layer. In the third layer, a global planning layer, the problem of target tracking is generalized in a way that allows navigation in maze-like terrains, avoidance of local minima and cooperation between agents. We implement this layer based on two approaches that are suitable for different applications: One approach is to track the closest single moving or static target; the second is to use a pre-specified vector field, which may be generated automatically (with harmonic functions, for example) or based on user input to achieve the desired output. We also discuss how hybrid systems concepts for global planning can capitalize on both our layered approach and the continuous, reactive nature of our agent steering.
   We demonstrate the power of the approach through a series of experiments simulating single/multiple agents and crowds moving towards moving/static targets in complex environments. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB There is still much that is unknown about the interactions among financial markets, and about the relationships between stock prices and exchange rates. This topic gains attention during financial crises, and many papers try to find empirical regularities emerging from financial data, or to study contagion processes. In this paper we present a study on the interplay between two stock markets and one foreign exchange market extending the framework provided by the Genoa Artificial Stock Market. There are four different trading strategies, and the agents are divided into two groups: those who trade in the stock markets and those who trade in the FOREX. We studied three market conditions: the FOREX dynamics, the behavior of the two stock markets together with the FOREX, and finally we conducted a what-if analysis for testing the effects of a inflationary monetary shock of one currency affecting all of the three markets.

AB Rodents have the capacity to periodically reach very high numbers in agricultural landscapes, reducing agricultural production, and causing considerable environmental and social problems for farmers and their families. Such rodent problems occur worldwide and have a long history. Currently mortality enhancing agents (mainly poisons) are the principal method of rodent control. This approach raises environmental, ethical and humane issues, and ignores the inherent high capacity for increase in these species. We argue that it is more appropriate to reduce reproduction than increase mortality. This paper uses house mice in Australia as a case study to explore fertility reduc tion as a potential alternative to conventional methods of control. In particular, the question of what level of fertility control is required to have a significant effect on population growth is discussed. A computer simulation, based on the life-history strategies of house mice, examined the effect of different levels of fertility control on mouse population dynamics. This simulation provides a reference for future studies of confined populations of mice used to test the effects of fertility control, refines the design of these experiments and identifies the type of data needed to be collected. Immunocontraception, the process of inducing the body's immune system to attack its own reproductive cells, is suggested as a method for reducing fertility in rodent populations. The advantages and disadvantages of immunocontraception over mortality-enhancing agents are discussed, as are the potential impacts of social structure on the efficacy of immunocontraception and the possible application of this control method to other rodent pest situations, particularly rodent pest problems in Africa.

AB In this paper, grey wolf optimization controller (GWOC) is considered as a multiobjective technique for multiple humanoid navigations. Upon activation of GWOC, the humanoids mimic the group hunting behavior of grey wolves and navigate toward the target in a collision-free manner in presence of both static and dynamic hurdles. The wolves in the pack will either diverge for searching prey or converge together for attacking the prey following the best search agent (Leader Alpha). GWOC has the ability to keep the humanoid free from being trapped in local minima whereas it facilitates it to head toward global minima. GWOC provides better results as compared to other intelligent techniques because of its five characteristics that include safe boundary, protection, following, hunting, and caring. Both simulation and experimental navigation in laboratory conditions for single as well as for multiple humanoid NAOs have been carried out. From the results of simulation and experimental data, it is confirmed that GWOC provides global minima for humanoid robots in complex environments with different shaped obstacles. A Petri-net controller is considered while navigating multiple humanoids, as during multiple humanoid navigations, one humanoid robot acts as a dynamic obstacle to other humanoids.

TI Efficiency of information spreading in a population of diffusing agents

DT Article
ID NETWORK
AB We introduce a model for information spreading among a population of N agents diffusing on a square LxL lattice, starting from an informed agent (Source). Information passing from informed to unaware agents occurs whenever the relative distance is <= 1. Numerical simulations show that the time required for the information to reach all agents scales as (N-alpha L beta), where alpha and beta are noninteger. A decay factor z takes into account the degeneration of information as it passes from one agent to another; the final average degree of information of the population I-av(z) is thus history dependent. We find that the behavior of I-av(z) is nonmonotonic with respect to N and L and displays a set of minima. Part of the results are recovered with analytical approximations.

AB We study a model of local minority game in the random Kauffman network with evolutionary strategies and propose three methods to update the strategy of poor agents, with lower points in a given generation: namely to update either the Boolean function of their strategies randomly, or their local information of randomly adjacent m agents, or the number m of randomly chosen adjacently agents. The results of extended numerical simulations show that the behaviour of strategies in the three methods may enhance significantly the entire coordination of agents in the system. It also found that a poor agent tends to use both small m strategies and correlated strategies, and the strategies of agents will finally self-organize into a steady-state distribution for a long time playing of the game.

AB Selected thermophysical properties are reported for VX (O-ethyl-S-[2(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothiolate) and its isomer, RVX (O-isobutyl-S-[2(diethylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothiolate). Several properties have been reported previously for both compounds; the focus of the current work has been the measurement of additional properties and expansion of the experimental ranges for the existing data. This report consolidates and compares physical property data measured in our laboratory for both compounds. It is important to know the physical properties of these supertoxic materials accurately to understand quantitatively the threat posed by them during military conflict, perform testing of defensive equipment, and determine the necessity to perform decontamination procedures. Knowledge of the properties of these toxic materials facilitates the selection of lower-toxicity candidates to simulate their behavior during testing where the use of the toxic agent is inappropriate. The current work has employed standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) international methods, intact and modified, to measure physical properties of VX and RVX. Properties investigated in the present work include liquid density, viscosity, surface tension, flash point, vapor pressure, heats of vaporization, and volatility. We also report correlations determined from previously available and new data, where appropriate.

SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS

DT Article
AB Considerable effort using techniques developed in statistical physics has been aimed at numerical simulations of agent-based opinion models and analysis of their results. Such work has elucidated how various rules for interacting agents can give rise to steady state behaviors in the agent populations that vary between consensus and fragmentation. At the macroscopic population level, analysis has been limited due to the lack of an analytically tractable governing macro-equation for the continuous population state. We use the integro-differential equation that governs opinion dynamics for the continuous probability distribution function of agent opinions to develop a novel nonlinear partial differential equation for the evolution of opinion distributions. The highly nonlinear equation allows for the generation of a system of approximations. We consider three initial population distributions and determine their small-time behavior. Our analysis reveals how the generation of clusters results from the interplay of diffusion and anti-diffusion and how initial instabilities arise in different regions of the population distribution.

AB In the present work, the mechanical properties of poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) such as ultimate strength, ultimate strain and shear modulus under compression were measured. Mathematical models for hyperelastic materials, which are often used to study rubbers or tyres and include the Mooney-Rivlin and neo-Hookean models, were also used to theoretically analyse mechanical nonlinear behaviour of the hydrogel. The simulations based on these models were then implemented and validated by analysis with experimental data for comparison. The accuracy of simulations using the two models was subsequently assessed and discussed in order to determine which model is a feasible representation and reflection of the true behaviour of the hydrogel. This study on the mechanical behaviour of PHEMA under compression stress will ultimately serve for optimization of the design and manufacture of multilayer microfluidic devices in terms of the distribution of pressure induced in the packaging process, since the implementation of thin PHEMA hydrogel free-standing films is required to be incorporated with harder polymeric material components, such as thermoplastics or thermoset microfabricated platforms.

AB This study evaluated the effects of simulated hydrostatic pulpal pressure (SPP) on the microtensile bond strength (mu TBS) to dentin and nanoleakage patterns produced by self-adhesive luting agents after 12 months. Three self-adhesive luting agents (RelyX Unicem [UN], RelyX U100 [UC], and Clearfil SA Luting [SA]) and three conventional luting agents (Rely X ARC [RX], Panavia F [PF], and a two-step self-etching adhesive system [Clearfil SE Bond] associated with Panavia F [PS]) were evaluated. One hundred twenty-three human molars were abraded to expose occlusal surfaces. Resin cements were used to lute cylindrical composite blocks to the teeth either subjected or not to SPP. Sixty specimens were subjected to 15 cm 1120 of SPP for 24 hours before and 24 hours or 12 months after cementation procedures. Afterward, restored teeth were serially sectioned into beams with a cross-sectional area of 1 mm(2) at the bonded interface and were tested in tension (cross-head speed of 1 mm/min). Failure mode was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data were statistically analyzed by three-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey test (p=0.05). Two additional teeth in each group were serially sectioned into 0.9-mm-thick slabs, which were submitted to a nanoleakage protocol with AgNO3 and analyzed with scanning and transmission electron microscopes. The mu TBS values of the etch-and-rinse group (RX) were negatively influenced by SPP and long-term water storage with SPP. After 12 months, UC and SA presented premature failures in all specimens when submitted to SPP. SPP increased silver deposition in most groups in both evaluation times. The hydrostatic pulpal pressure effect was material dependent. The storage time without SPP did not affect bond strength. However, long-term SPP influenced the performance of the etch-and-rinse and self-adhesive cements regarding mu TBS and nanoleakage pattern, except to UN.

TI Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate prevents deleterious effects of remote

AB Background Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) is a low-molecular-weight thiol antioxidant and potent inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation. It has been shown to attenuate local harmful effects of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in many organs. In recent animal studies, a delaying effect of remote organ I/R injury on the healing of colonic anastomoses has been demonstrated. In this study we investigated whether PDTC prevents harmful systemic effects of superior mesenteric I/R on left colonic anastomosis in rats.
   Methods Anastomosis of the left colon was performed in 40 rats randomly allocated into the following four groups: (1) Sham-operated group (group I, n = 10)-simultaneously with colonic anastomosis, the superior mesenteric artery and collateral branches divided from the celiac axis and the inferior mesenteric artery were isolated but not occluded. (2) Sham+PDTC group (group II, n = 10)-identical to sham-operated rats except for the administration of PDTC (100 mg/kg IV bolus) 30 minutes prior to commencing the experimental period. (3) I/R group (group III, n = 10)-60 minutes of intestinal I/R by superior mesenteric artery occlusion. (4) PDTC-treated group (group IV, n = 10)-PDTC 100 mg/kg before and after the I/R. On postoperative day 6, all animals were sacrificed, and anastomotic bursting pressures were measured in vivo. Tissue samples were obtained for investigation of anastomotic hydroxyproline (HP) contents, perianastomotic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), and glutathione (GSH) level.
   Results There was a statistically significant decrease in anastomotic bursting pressure values, tissue HP content and GSH level, along with an increase in MDA level and MPO activity in group III, when compared to groups I, II, and IV (p < 0.05). However, PDTC treatment led to a statistically significant increase in anastomotic bursting pressure values, tissue HP content and GSH level, along with a decrease in MDA level and MPO activity in group IV (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions This study showed that PDTC treatment significantly prevented the delaying effect of remote organ I/R injury on anastomotic healing in the colon. Further clinical studies are needed to clarify whether PDTC may be a useful therapeutic agent for increasing the safety of the anastomosis during particular operations where remote organ I/R injury occurs.

AB The viscoelastic behavior of hydrogenated nitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR) was studied over a range of temperatures and shear frequencies. Dynamic mechanical properties were studied and modelled using the generalized Maxwell model and the Williams-Landel-Ferry equation. A fitting algorithm was developed to provide the best agreement between the experimental data and the model results. In addition to dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was applied. The HNBR structure was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The developed model exhibited an excellent agreement with either isothermal or dynamic experiment data, yet only up to the rubbery plateau, after which a structure ordering occurred. This was explained by the cyano group secondary bonding and consequentially the cross-linking between HNBR chains. A molecular modeling simulation was made to confirm the cross-linking. The effect of peroxide cross-linking agents in a compound resembled the one usually observed in the filler formulated compounds.

AB It is largely acknowledged that natural languages emerge not just from human brains but also from rich communities of interacting human brains (Senghas, 2005). Yet the precise role of such communities and such interaction in the emergence of core properties of language has largely gone uninvestigated in naturally emerging systems, leaving the few existing computational investigations of this issue at an artificial setting. Here, we take a step toward investigating the precise role of community structure in the emergence of linguistic conventions with both naturalistic empirical data and computational modeling. We first show conventionalization of lexicons in two different classes of naturally emerging signed systems: (a) protolinguistic "homesigns" invented by linguistically isolated Deaf individuals, and (b) a natural sign language emerging in a recently formed rich Deaf community. We find that the latter conventionalized faster than the former. Second, we model conventionalization as a population of interacting individuals who adjust their probability of sign use in response to other individuals' actual sign use, following an independently motivated model of language learning (Yang, 2002, 2004). Simulations suggest that a richer social network, like that of natural (signed) languages, conventionalizes faster than a sparser social network, like that of homesign systems. We discuss our behavioral and computational results in light of other work on language emergence, and other work of behavior on complex networks.

AB Agent-based modelling has become an important tool to investigate socio-ecological processes. Its use is partially driven by increasing demand from decision makers to provide support for understanding the potential implications of decisions in complex situations. While one of the advantages of agent-based modelling is the ability to simulate the implications of human decision-making processes explicitly, methods for providing empirical support for the representation of the behaviour of human agents have not been structured systematically. This paper develops a framework for the parameterisation of human behaviour in agent-based models and develops twelve distinct sequences for the characterisation and parameterisation of human behaviours. Examples are provided to illustrate the most important sequences. This framework is a first step towards a guide for parameterisation of human behaviour in ABM. A structured discussion within the agent-based community is needed to achieve a more definitive guideline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We use an empirically grounded simulation model to examine how initial smoking prevalence moderates the effectiveness of potential interventions designed to change adolescent smoking behavior. Our model investigates the differences that result when manipulating peer influence and smoker popularity as intervention levers. We demonstrate how a simulation-based approach allows us to estimate outcomes that arise (1) when intervention effects could plausibly alter peer influence and/or smoker popularity effects and (2) across a sample of schools that match the range of initial conditions of smoking prevalence in U.S. schools. We show how these different initial conditions combined with the exact same intervention effects can produce substantially different outcomesfor example, effects that produce smoking declines in some settings can actually increase smoking in others. We explore the form and magnitude of these differences. Our model also provides a template to evaluate the potential effects of alternative intervention scenarios.

AB Streptococcus mutans has been identified as the major etiological agent of human dental caries. The first step in the initiation of infection by this pathogenic bacterium is its attachment (i,e., through bacterial surface proteins such as glucosyltransferases, P1, glucan-binding proteins, and fimbriae) to a suitable receptor. It is hypothesized that a mucosal vaccine against a combination of S. mutans surface proteins would protect against dental caries by inducing specific salivary immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies which may reduce bacterial pathogenesis and adhesion to the tooth surface by affecting several adhesins simultaneously. Conventional Sprauge-Dawley rats, infected,vith S, mutans at 18 to 20 days of age, were intranasally immunized with a mixture of S, mutans surface proteins, enriched for fimbriae and conjugated with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) plus free cholera toxin (CT) at 13, 15, 22, 29, and 36 days of age (group A). Control rats were either not immunized (group B) or immunized with adjuvant alone (CTB and CT [group C]), At the termination of the study (when rats were 46 days of age), immunized animals (group A) had significantly (P < 0.05) higher salivary IgA and serum IgG antibody responses to the mixture of surface proteins and to whole bacterial cells than did the other two groups (B and C), No significant differences were found in the average numbers of recovered S, mutans cells among groups. However, statistically fewer smooth-surface enamel lesions (buccal and lingual) were detected in the immunized group than in the two other groups, Therefore, a mixture of S, mutans surface proteins, enriched with fimbria components, appears to be a promising immunogen candidate for a mucosal vaccine against dental caries.

AB This study presents preliminary experimental data suggesting that sodium 4-(pyrene-1-yl) butane-1-sulfonate (PBSA), 5, an analogue of sodium pyrene-1-sulfonate (PSA), 1, enhances the stability of aqueous reduced graphene oxide (RGO) graphene dispersions. We find that RGO and exfoliated graphene dispersions prepared in the presence of 5 are approximately double the concentration of those made with commercially available PSA, 1. Quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations provide key insights into the behavior of these molecules on the graphene surface. The seemingly obvious introduction of a polar sulfonate head group linked via an appropriate alkyl spacer to the aromatic core results in both more efficient binding of 5 to the graphene surface and more efficient solvation of the polar head group by bulk solvent (water). Overall, this improves the stabilization of the graphene flakes by disfavoring dissociation of the stabilizer from the graphene surface and inhibiting reaggregation by electrostatic and steric repulsion. These insights are currently the subject of further investigations in an attempt to develop a rational approach to the design of more effective dispersing agents for rGO and graphene in aqueous solution.

AB An experimental design and statistical analysis providing information on the reliability of pooled test procedures is described. It involves estimating the relationship between the probability of a positive pooled test result (dependent variable) and the expected number of infected individuals in a pool (explanatory variable). The intercept is an estimate of the proportion of false positives (1 - pooled specificity) and pooled sensitivities can be estimated for indicative prevalences of infected individuals. Simulations for a theoretical infection are used to investigate the advantages and limitations of the approach. The approach is used to evaluate the reliability of a virus isolation and qRT-PCR test procedure detecting Salmonid alphavirus the pathogenic agent necessary for the development of Pancreas Disease in Atlantic salmon (Salmo solar).

AB Acanthamoeba species are ubiquitous, free-living protozoa that can invade the cornea and result in Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a painful progressive sight-threatening corneal disease. Disease progression in current animal models is too rapid to mimic AK in humans accurately. This study provides a novel method for establishing AK in rabbits and compared it with the conventional method with regard to pathogenesis and immune response in humans. The New Zealand white rabbits were randomly divided into two experimental groups (Groups A and B). Rabbits in the Group A (n=14) received intrastromal injections of 1 x 10(4)/100 mu L Acanthamoeba healyi trophozoites (conventional AK model). The Group B animals (n=14) received microinjections of 1 x 10(4)/10 mu L A. healyi trophozoites between the corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer, anterior to the corneal stroma (novel AK model). In addition, two rabbits were left untreated as normal controls. AK in the treated rabbits was evaluated clinically, histopathologically, and immunologically for 35 days. AK was successfully established in both the conventional and novel model groups. Compared with the Group A, AK in the Group B displayed an efficient immune response with less severe pathology. Moreover, the self-limiting but chronic nature of the infection in the Group B was strikingly similar to that of AK in humans. The novel animal model for AK described here more closely simulates the pathogenesis and immune response of Acanthamoeba corneal infection in humans than the animal models currently in use.

AB An agent-based biogeochemical model has been developed which begins with biochemical precursor molecules and simulates the transformation and degradation of natural organic matter (NOM). This manuscript presents an empirical quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) which uses the numbers of ligand groups, charge density and heteroatom density of a molecule to estimate Cu-binding affinity (K'(Cu)) at pH 7.0 and ionic strength 0.10 for the molecules in this C model. Calibration of this QSAR on a set of 41 model compounds gives a root mean square error of 0.88 log units and r(2) = 0.93. Two simulated NOM assemblages, one beginning with small molecules (tannins, terpenoids, flavonoids) and one with biopolymers (protein, lignin), give markedly different distributions of log K'(Cu). However, calculations based on these log K'(Cu). distributions agree qualitatively with published experimental Cu(II) titration data from river and lake NOM samples. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Cancers and precancerous lesions of the esophagus were efficiently induced in rats by the simulation of a clinicoepidemiological setting; that is, the administration of precursors of nitrosamine. Six week old non-inbred male Wistar rats were given 2g/kg bodyweight of sarcosine ethyl ester hydrochloride (SEEH) and concurrently 0.3g/kg bodyweight of sodium nitrite (NaNO2), precursors of N-nitrososarcosine ethyl ester (NSEE), in 2% sucrose as drinking water, Group 1 received the precursors twice a week for 6 weeks followed by 8 weeks observation, and group 2, once every 3 days for 7 weeks followed by 26 weeks observation. At the end of treatment, no tumor had developed in the esophagus of rats in group 1, but the [H-3]-thymidine labeling indices in both basal and superficial layer cells were higher than in the control group. On subsequent observation, papillomas appeared in group 1 (33.3%), and carcinomas in group 2 (33.3%), within 4 weeks. The tumors induced in group 1 were mostly papillomas and rarely carcinomas. When the observation was prolonged in group 2, 100% of the animals had cancer in week 20. The pathological changes of the lesions paralleled the sequential development of human squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Our system has the advantages in that papillomas and cancers can be induced in rats in a short time and the agents used are less toxic than preformed nitrosamines administered previously by gastric intubation. It would serve as a useful experimental tool to study premalignant lesions and cancers of the esophagus.

AB We study by Monte Carlo simulations a kinetic exchange trading model for both fixed and distributed saving propensities of the agents and rationalize the person and wealth distributions. We show that the newly introduced wealth distribution - that may be more amenable in certain situations - features a different power-law exponent, particularly for distributed saving propensities of the agents. For open agent-based systems, we analyze the person and wealth distributions and find that the presence of trap agents alters their amplitude, leaving however the scaling exponents nearly unaffected. For an open system, we show that the total wealth - for different trap agent densities and saving propensities of the agents - decreases in time according to the classical Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts stretched exponential law. Interestingly, this decay does not depend on the trap agent density, but rather on saving propensities. The system relaxation for fixed and distributed saving schemes are found to be different.

AB Using simulated short- and long-term effect studies, we evaluated the effect of ketamine anesthesia on serum cortisol, testosterone, and immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (ILH) and bioactive LH (BioLH) concentrations in adult male cynomolgus monkeys. Cortisol, testosterone, and ILH were measured by use of radioimmunoassay, and BioLH was measured by use of a radioreceptor assay method, For the acute effect, the first group (eight monkeys) was given four successive intramuscular injections of ketamine (10, 5, 5, and 5 mg/kg of body weight at 0, 30, 60, and 110 min respectively), Blood samples were taken at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min. For the long-term effect, the second group (10 monkeys) was given a single injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg) once a week for 4 consecutive weeks. Blood samples were taken 5 to 10 min after each injection, then were used to determine the variation in hormone concentrations among the monkeys (inter-individual variation) and within each monkey (intra-individual variation), There were no statistically significant differences in serum cortisol, testosterone, ILH, and BioLH values between the first blood sample (before the ketamine injection) and sequential blood samples in monkeys of the first group. Although intra-individual variation in the hormones (i.e., hormonal change within each monkey) was not statistically significant, inter-individual variation (among the monkeys) was significantly (0.00001 < P < 0.033) different in monkeys of the second group. These results indicate that an adequate number of animals must be used to minimize animal-to-animal variability. Our results confirm that ketamine is a suitable anesthetic agent to immobilize male cynomolgus monkeys in experimental studies (short- and long-term studies) aimed at elucidating hormonal changes.

ID MODEL SELECTION; METHODOLOGY; INFORMATION
AB Metamodeling refers to modeling a model. There are two metamodeling approaches for ABMs: (1) top-down and (2) bottom-up. The top down approach enables users to decompose high-level mental models into behaviors and interactions of agents. In contrast, the bottom-up approach constructs a relatively small, simple model that approximates the structure and outcomes of a dataset gathered fromthe runs of an ABM. The bottom-upmetamodelmakes behavior of theABMcomprehensible and exploratory analyses feasible. Formost users the construction of a bottom-up metamodel entails: (1) creating an experimental design, (2) running the simulation for all cases specified by the design, (3) collecting the inputs and output in a dataset and (4) applying first-order regression analysis to find a model that effectively estimates the output. Unfortunately, the sums of input variables employed by first-order regression analysis give the impression that one can compensate for one component of the system by improving some other component even if such substitution is inadequate or invalid. As a result the metamodel can be misleading. We address these deficiencies with an approach that: (1) automatically generates Boolean conditions that highlight when substitutions and tradeoffs among variables are valid and (2) augments the bottom-up metamodel with the conditions to improve validity and accuracy. We evaluate our approach using several established agent-based simulations.

AB This paper proposes modeling of artificial emotions through agents based on symbolic approach. The symbolic approach utilizes symbolic emotional rule-based systems (rule base that generated emotions) with continuous interactions with environment and an internal "thinking" machinery that comes as a result of series of inferences, evaluation, evolution processes, adaptation, learning, and emotions. We build two models for agent based systems; one is supported with artificial emotions and the other one without emotions. We use both in solving a bench mark problem; "The Orphanage Care Problem". The two systems are simulated and results are compared. Our study shows that systems with proper model of emotions can perform in many cases better than systems without emotions. We try to shed the light here on how artificial emotions can be modeled in a simple rule-based agent systems and if emotions as they exist in "real intelligence" can be helpful for "artificial intelligence". Agent architectures are presented as a generic blueprint on which the design of agents can be based. Our focus is on the functional design, including flow of information and control. With this information provided, the generic blueprints of architectures should not be difficult to implement agents, thus putting these theoretical models into practice. We build the agents using this architecture, and many experiments and analysis are shown. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB An experimental study on the strainburst characteristics of Beishan granite under different intermediate principal stress (sigma(2)) loading conditions was conducted using a servo-controlled true-triaxial rockburst test machine equipped with an acoustic emission (AE) monitoring system. The primary objective is to investigate the influence of end effect under loading in the sigma(2) direction on the strainburst behaviors of the rock. Rectangular prism specimens with dimensions of approximately 200 x 100 x 100 mm(3) were prepared and divided into two groups. For the first group, the specimens were in direct contact with platens during loading. For the second group, the specimen's two surfaces loaded by sigma(2) were daubed with a layer of anti-friction agent to reduce the end friction of the platens. In the test, a loading mode, which kept one specimen surface free and applied loads on another five surfaces of the specimen, was used to simulate the stress state of a rock element on the excavation boundary. A high-speed video camera was used to capture the failure process of the specimens. The experimental results indicate that regardless of the use of the anti-friction agent or not, strainburst characteristics of the specimens depend on the magnitude of sigma(2). With increasing sigma(2), the degree of violence during rock failure presents an increasing trend and the dynamic failure process of the free specimen surface changes from local rock ejection to full-face burst. However, the sigma(2)-dependent crack initiation, peak strength, failure mode and energy release characteristics of the lubricated specimens differ significantly from those of the non-lubricated ones. With increasing sigma(2), rock strengths increase to a peak value and then decrease, but the peak strength of the lubricated specimen is lower than that of the non-lubricated specimen under a given sigma(2). In addition, the peak strength difference between two groups increases as sigma(2) increases. Meanwhile, large end effect suppresses crack initiation of the specimens, causing crack initiation of the specimens to occur at higher stress levels, leading to higher peak strengths. Moreover, when sigma(2) = 1 MPa, the failure modes of the non-lubricated and lubricated specimens are similar. When sigma(2) is greater than 1 MPa, the number of the fractures in the surfaces loaded by sigma(2) for the lubricated specimens is larger than that for the non-lubricated specimens. In addition, the weight and the associated kinetic energy of ejected rock fragments from the lubricated specimen are higher than those from the non-lubricated specimen. The difference of the weight and the kinetic energy of the rock fragments between the non-lubricated and lubricated specimens increases with increasing sigma(2).

AB Business-to-business (B2B) exchanges are expected to bring about lower prices for buyers through reverse auctions. Analysis of such settings for seller pricing behavior often points to mixed-strategy equilibria. In real life, it is plausible that managers learn this complex ideal behavior over time. We modeled the two-seller game in a synthetic environment, where two agents use a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to change their pricing strategy over time. We find that the agents do indeed converge towards the theoretical Nash equilibrium. The results are promising enough to consider the use of artificial learning mechanisms in electronic marketplace transactions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Nonimmobilizers are agents that lack anesthetic properties, although their chemical structure is very similar to known anesthetics. The primary action site of both agents, whether at the membrane or target protein level, is still a matter of debate. However, increasing evidence points to the distinct modifications of the membrane physical properties that such agents induce. Such modification may play a role in the mechanism of anesthesia, and may therefore be related to the differences in their clinical behavior.
   Methods: Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations have been used to investigate the distribution of a nonimmobilizer, hexafluroethane (HFE, C2F6), in a lipid membrane. The biologically relevant liquid-crystal phase of a hydrated di-myristoyl phosphatidyl choline (DMPC) bilayer was used as a membrane model. Two MD simulations corresponding to HFE mole fractions of 6% and 25% have been performed at room temperature and constant ambient pressure, for a duration of 2 nanoseconds each.
   Results: The equilibrium configurations of HFE in the bilayer show that the nonimmobilizer molecules are evenly distributed along the lipid hydrocarbon chains with a slight preference for the bilayer center. This partitioning induces an expansion of the bilayer thickness and a lateral contraction of the membrane (decrease of the area per lipid). The presence of HFE has essentially no effect on the lipid acyl chain conformations in agreement with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of the chain order parameters. The partitioning of the nonimmobilizer does not influence the orientation of the lipid head-group dipole moment.
   Conclusions. The modifications induced by the presence of the nonimmobilizer HFE on a model membrane are distinct from those previously found for halothane (CF3CHBrCl), its anesthetic analogue, and appear to result from different distributions in the lipid bilayer. The results of the MD simulations show that (1) the changes in the average area per lipid and in the membrane thickness are opposite for the two agents and (2) HFE induces no change in the lipid head-group orientation, in contrast to halothane. These different effects (1) on the physical properties of the lipid bilayer and (2) on the electrostatic properties of the membrane-water interface may be linked to different clinical effects, and thus might contribute to the mechanism of general anesthesia.

AB We propose a distributed iterative algorithm in which a group of n autonomous agents self-organize the structure of their communication network in order to control the network's Laplacian eigenvalue spectrum. We assume that every agent has only access to a local ("myopic") view of the network around it and that there is no centralized coordinator. With every iteration of our algorithm, the agents share local information about their myopic views of the network in order to distributedly find the most beneficial global edge addition/deletion, defined as the one that minimizes a pseudometric defined in the space of Laplacian spectra. The proposed pseudometric is defined in terms of the Laplacian spectral moments and allows for an efficient distributed implementation. The proposed approach is greedy in nature and stable by construction, that is, it locally minimizes the distance of the network's eigenvalue spectrum to a desired spectrum. We illustrate the performance of our approach with several numerical simulations.

AB Shifting cultivation in the Nghe An Province of Vietnam's Northern Mountain Region produces a characteristic land-cover pattern of small and larger fields. The pattern is the result of farmers cultivating either individually or in spatially clustered groups. Using spatially explicit agent-based modelling, and relying on empirical data from fieldwork and observations for parameterization of variables, the level of clustering in agricultural fields observed around a study village is reproduced. Agents in the model act to maximize labour productivity, which is based on potential yield and labour costs associated with fencing of fields, and are faced with physical constraints. The simulation results are compared with land-cover data obtained from remote sensing. Comparisons are made on patterns as detected visually and using the mean nearest-neighbour ratio. Baseline simulation outputs show high degrees of spatial clustering and similarity to the land-cover data, but also a need for further calibration of model variables and controls.

AB Comparative studies of gyrodactylid monogeneans on different host species or strains rely upon the observation of growth on individual fish maintained within a common environment, summarised using maximum likelihood statistical approaches. Here we describe an agent-based model of gyrodactylid population growth, which we use to evaluate errors due to stochastic reproductive variation in such experimental studies. Parameters for the model use available fecundity and mortality data derived from previously published life tables of Gyrodactylus safaris, and use a new data set of fecundity and mortality statistics for this species on the Neva stock of Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar. Mortality data were analysed using a mark-recapture analysis software package, allowing maximum-likelihood estimation of daily survivorship and mortality. We consistently found that a constant age-specific mortality schedule was most appropriate for G. safaris in experimental datasets, with a daily survivorship of 0.84 at 13 degrees C. This, however, gave unrealistically low population growth rates when used as parameters in the model, and a schedule of constantly increasing mortality was chosen as the best compromise for the model. The model also predicted a realistic age structure for the simulated populations, with 0.32 of the population not yet having given birth for the first time (pre-first birth). The model demonstrated that the population growth rate can be a useful parameter for comparing gyrodactylid populations when these are larger than 20-30 individuals, but that stochastic error rendered the parameter unusable in smaller populations. It also showed that the declining parasite population growth rate typically observed during the course of G. safaris infections cannot be explained through stochastic error and must therefore have a biological basis. Finally, the study showed that most gyrodactylid-host studies of this type are too small to detect subtle differences in local adaptation of gyrodactylid monogeneans between fish stocks.

AB Many species of bacteria collectively sense and respond to their social and physical environment via 'quorum sensing' (QS), a communication system controlling extracellular cooperative traits. Despite detailed understanding of the mechanisms of signal production and response, there remains considerable debate over the functional role(s) of QS: in short, what is it for? Experimental studies have found support for diverse functional roles: density sensing, mass-transfer sensing, genotype sensing, etc. While consistent with theory, these results cannot separate whether these functions were drivers of QS adaption, or simply artifacts or 'spandrels' of systems shaped by distinct ecological pressures. The challenge of separating spandrels from drivers of adaptation is particularly hard to address using extant bacterial species with poorly understood current ecologies (let alone their ecological histories). To understand the relationship between defined ecological challenges and trajectories of QS evolution, we used an agent-based simulation modeling approach. Given genetic mixing, our simulations produce behaviors that recapitulate features of diverse microbial QS systems, including coercive (high signal/low response) and generalized reciprocity (signal auto-regulation) strategists - that separately and in combination contribute to QS-dependent resilience of QS-controlled cooperation in the face of diverse cheats. We contrast our in silico results given defined ecological challenges with bacterial QS architectures that have evolved under largely unknown ecological contexts, highlighting the critical role of genetic constraints in shaping the shorter term (experimental evolution) dynamics of QS. More broadly, we see experimental evolution of digital organisms as a complementary tool in the search to understand the emergence of complex QS architectures and functions.

AB Forward osmosis (FO), as an emerging technology, is influenced by different factors such as operating conditions, module characteristics, and membrane properties. The general aim of this study was to develop a suitable (flexible, comprehensive, and convenient to use) computational tool which is able to simulate osmosis through an asymmetric membrane oriented in pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) mode in a wide variety of scenarios. For this purpose, an agent-based model was created in NetLogo platform, which is an easy-to-use application environment with graphical visualization abilities and well suited for modeling a complex system evolving over time. The simulation results were validated with empirical data obtained from literature and a great agreement was observed. The effect of various parameters on process performance was investigated in terms of temperature, cross-flow velocity, length of the module, pure water permeability coefficient, and structural parameter of the membrane. Results demonstrated that the increase in all parameters, except structural parameter of the membrane and the length of module led to the increase of average water flux. Moreover, nine different draw solutes were selected in order to assess the influence of net bulk osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution (DS) and feed solution (FS) (known as the driving force of FO process) on water flux. Based on the findings of this paper, the performance of FO process (PRO mode) can be efficiently evaluated using the NetLogo platform.

AB Based on the research of the human mobilety patterns, a random-walker network model is used to explain the empirical results on the networks of mobile agents, and shows a possible evolution mechanism of these networks. The simulation results show that the degree distribution of this network takes Poisson distribution, and it exhibits the small-world behavior. Moreover, we present a numerical investigation on the displacements of the mobile agents, and find that the distribution of displacements takes power-law. Our numerical results are in good agreement with the empirical results on the human travel from the trajectories of human bank notes.

AB Good quality acoustical experiments are needed to measure microbubble behavior. An absolute calibration of the transmitted ultrasound field is possible using a calibrated hydrophone, but characterization of the received ultrasound beam is a more elaborate process and is not described in the literature. A new system based on a hydrodynamically focused flow has been used to measure echoes from single microbubbles at well specified positions in the ultrasonic field. An experimental set-up was built around a commercial scanner (Sonos5500, Philips Medical Systems) to measure the scatter from solid spheres with radii between 30 to 60 mu m. The behavior of these linear scatterers is accurately predicted by theory and software was produced to incorporate a simulation of the experimental conditions. The calibration of a phased array transducer was achieved by quantifying the receiver's spectral sensitivity for the range of receive frequencies (1.2 to 4.5 MHz). Examples of echoes from the microbubble agent Definity are used to illustrate the implementation of the calibration technique.

AB Complex problems of social interaction are usually studied within the framework of agent-based models. Some of these problems, such as issue alignment and opinion polarization, are better suited in the framework of n-dimensional opinion space. Although this kind of complex problem may be explored by numerical simulations, these simulations can hinder our ability to obtain general results. In this work, we show how, under certain conditions, a classical multidimensional opinion model such as the Axelrod model can give rise to a closed set of master equations in terms of vector similarities between agents. The analytical results fully agree with the simulations on complete networks, accurately predict the similarity distribution of the whole system in sparse topologies, and provide a good approximation of the similarity of physical links that improves when the mean degree of the system increases.

AB This article offers a literature-supported conception and empirically grounded analysis of surprise by exploring the capacity of scenario-driven, agent-based simulation models to better anticipate it. Building on literature-derived definitions and typologies of surprise, and using results from a modeled 81,000 ha study area in a wildland-urban interface of western Oregon's Willamette Valley Ecoregion, the paper explores surprise by analyzing alternative future deviations from historical fire size at multiple spatial and temporal scales. It investigates whether, how and why modeled patterns and likelihoods of surprising fires in the next half-century differ under climate change from those of the past half-century. Working from Holling's (1986) definition of surprise, we use fire history records (1960-2011) to define expectations for future fire behavior (2007-2056) as evidenced through fire size and likelihood. Using geodesign techniques, we model alternative future fires under two future climate regimes, and contrast them with expectations derived from the fire history record to identify instances when fire size and likelihood deviate from expectations in surprising ways. Data science techniques are employed to explore and characterize the landscape's alternative future trajectories in time:space envelopes that bound surprising fires. We argue that if the design and planning disciplines are to help society anticipate surprise, they must shift attention from primarily deterministic approaches to those that probabilistically explore trajectories from current to future landscapes. We conclude with general suggestions for how geodesign techniques and tools could be used to anticipate surprise in other landscapes, for phenomena other than fire. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of the present paper is to propose a framework for development of an optimal cropping pattern aimed at ground water recovery using an agent based approach. In the proposed agent-based model (ABM), the agents' learning from each other as well as their self-learning from their own behavioral feedback was studied through simulation of the behavior of agricultural agents using fuzzy inference system (FIS). Moreover, the agents' behavior were determined using linear programming in order to maximize the farmers' income. The governmental agent regulated the interactions between agricultural and environmental agents by imposing its policies in the form of scenarios. The efficiency of the presented methodology was evaluated using hydrological data of Najaf Abad region, located in Iran's central plain, on the basis of three hydrological scenarios (wet, normal, and dry) subject to governmental policy of aquifer recovery. The results showed that in a normal scenario with current groundwater withdrawal, the water level reduced by an average of 0.18 m per year. In contrast, the water level increased by an average of 0.48 m under aquifer recovery scenario. Furthermore, despite 17% reduction in water rights of agricultural agents in the study area, the total long-term agricultural income declined only by less than 4%, and in the planning horizon, their average annual income associated with these two management scenarios were estimated at 123.5 and 119 million US dollars, respectively.

AB We propose an opinion formation model which includes both the influence of internal motivation and dissipation. Active agents adopt their neighbors' opinions according to a simplified set of rules, but they may gradually lose their interests in the discussion and drop out of it. On the other hand, inert agents can become active by initial activation or internal motivation from neighbors, and participate in the discussion. The initial activation is usually due to occurrence of a social event. The internal motivation, opinion update and dissipation procedure take place simultaneously. We apply the voter rule in our model, and carry out analysis and numerical simulations. Results show if nonzero dissipation stays below a threshold value, the system evolves to a balance state where the average concentration of one opinion is equal to that of the other. With dissipation, a number of small-size opinion clusters exist in the end, but the system gains a fast relaxation rate. The final average opinion is closely related to the dissipation intensity and the length of time for initial activation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) represents a methodology with significant potential for altering archaeological analytical practice. The continued growth in the number of publications that use ABM provides evidence for the significance of this emerging approach. However, the scope of the research topics investigated has not increased accordingly. A consensus exists among ABM practitioners, that once generally accepted by the field, ABM can make revolutionary advances within the overall archaeological research paradigm. Unresolved concerns within the archaeological community center on whether ABMs are sufficiently grounded in empirical data, are aligned with theoretical trajectories, and on the difficult task of mastering the computational systems. It is worth exploring these aspects of the disjuncture between the mainstream and ABM practitioners for two reasons - to frame a discussion of qualities of ABM that make it transformative and to provide guidelines for broadening ABM's applicability. With capacity building in mind, offered here is a practical reference for the non-practitioner archaeologist considering ABM. A glossary is included of key terms used in the text to describe ABM methods and theory. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The present study is devoted to the analysis and prediction of the efficiency of air curtains. The attention is focused on improving existing semi-analytical methods with the information from CFD simulations and experimental measurements. The goal is to obtain an accurate simplified model which describes the three-dimensional behaviour of the air jet without requiring large time consuming calculations. The interaction of the air curtain with other agents, e.g. pedestrians and flying insects, is also revised. The model is validated against both experimental data and advanced LES calculations carried out by the authors. Furthermore, a parametric study shows the air curtain behaviour for different configurations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Chimera states in a network-organized public goods game with destructive

SO CHAOS
LA English
DT Article
ID STABLE STRATEGIES; DYNAMICS; COOPERATION
AB We found that a network-organized metapopulation of cooperators, defectors, and destructive agents playing the public goods game with mutations can collectively reach global synchronization or chimera states. Global synchronization is accompanied by a collective periodic burst of cooperation, whereas chimera states reflect the tendency of the networked metapopulation to be fragmented in clusters of synchronous and incoherent bursts of cooperation. Numerical simulations have shown that the system's dynamics switches between these two steady states through a first order transition. Depending on the parameters determining the dynamical and topological properties, chimera states with different numbers of coherent and incoherent clusters are observed. Our results present the first systematic study of chimera states and their characterization in the context of evolutionary game theory. This provides a valuable insight into the details of their occurrence, extending the relevance of such states to natural and social systems. Published by AIP Publishing.

AB The selection of suitable people to make up a successful work team is not a trivial decision-making process, because of the diversity and complexity of the factors that influence individual and team performance. Teams are assembled by project managers using their experience and the information they have available (although this is frequently scarce, uncertain, and dynamic) about the personal and professional characteristics of potential team members. In this paper, we introduce an agent-based model developed to support this decision-making process where a virtual team can be configured using some selected characteristics of potential team members. Fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules are used to model the interaction between team members and a given set of tasks, generating statistical information that represents possible performance by team members. More specifically, the paper focuses on the concept of trust, an important social skill that influences performance at individual (team member) and global (work team) levels. We describe the implementation of an agent-based simulation system where the user can test different team configurations to compare performance and select the best possible work team for a given project. The evaluation and validation of the model was performed through face validity and historical data validation techniques, which are based on information collected from real work teams. The results show the suitability of the model as a helpful tool in the formation and configuration of work teams for specific scenarios.

AB Active matter, which ranges from molecular motors to groups of animals, exists at different length scales and timescales, and various computational models have been proposed to describe and predict its behaviour. The diversity of the methods and the challenges in modelling active matter primarily originate from the out-of-equilibrium character, lack of detailed balance and of time-reversal symmetry, multiscale nature, nonlinearity and multibody interactions. Models exist for both dry active matter and active matter in fluids, and can be agent-based or continuum-level descriptions. They can be generic, emphasizing universal features, or detailed, capturing specific features. We compare various modelling approaches and numerical techniques to illuminate the innovations and challenges in understanding active matter. Active matter consists of energy-consuming units, which self-propel, exert forces on their neighbours and act collectively, resulting in emergent non-equilibrium behaviour. This Review surveys computational models that describe a wide range of active systems, from synthetic microswimmers to animal herds. Key pointsActive matter exhibits a wide range of emergent non-equilibrium phenomena, theoretical studies of which often require computer simulations.Active matter encompasses synthetic and living systems, including active gels and the cytoskeleton, cells and tissues, nanorobots and microrobots, synthetic and biological microswimmers, and animal herds.Active matter is characterized by out-of-equilibrium behaviour, nonlinearity, multibody interactions, lack of detailed balance or time-reversal symmetry and, generically, absence of an equation of state.The wide spectrum of systems and phenomena requires a multitude of models and simulation techniques, from agent-based to continuum-level approaches, and combinations thereof.Active agents can interact in many ways, such as volume exclusion, contact attraction, visual information and hydrodynamics. Hydrodynamic interactions are ubiquitous for self-propelled particles in an aqueous environment, which implies a classification into dry and wet active matter.

AB Representing human decisions is of fundamental importance in agent-based models. However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difficult to understand. Therefore, we expand and refine the 'ODD' (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD + D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD + D protocol also incorporates a section on 'Theoretical and Empirical Background' to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD + D protocol is illustrated with a description of a social ecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD + D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the ODD + D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included.

AB We report on research that is developing a simulation model for assessing systemic innovations, or 'transitions', of societal systems towards a more sustainable development. Our overall aim is to outline design principles for models that can offer new insights into tackling persistent problems in large-scale systems, such as the European road transport system or the regional management of water resources. The systemic nature of these problems is associated with them being complex, uncertain and cutting across a number of sectors, and indicates a need for radical technological and behavioural solutions that address changes at the systems level rather than offering incremental changes within sub-systems. Model design is inspired by recent research into transitions, an emerging paradigm which provides a framework for tackling persistent problems. We use concepts from the literature on transitions to develop a prototype of a generic 'transition model'. Our prototype aims to capture different types of transition pathways, using historical examples such as the transition from horse-drawn carriages to cars or that from sailing ships to steam ships. The model combines agent-based modelling techniques and system dynamics, and includes interactions of individual agents and sub-systems, as well as cumulative effects on system structures. We show success in simulating different historical transition pathways by adapting the model's parameters and rules for each example. Finally, we discuss the improvements necessary for systematically exploring and detailing transition pathways in empirical case-study applications to current and future transitions such as the transition to a sustainable transport system in Europe.

AB Objectives. (1) To measure the marginal and internal adaptation of different prosthetic crowns infrastructures (IS); (2) to analyze two types of methodologies (replica and weight technique) used to evaluate the adaptation of indirect restorations.
   Methods. Ceramic IS were fabricated using CAD/CAM technology and slip-casting technique, and metal IS were produced by casting (n = 10). For each experimental group, the adaptation was evaluated with the replica (RT) and the weight technique (WT), using an impression material (low viscosity silicon) to simulate the luting agent. Cross-sectional images of the silicon replica were obtained and analyzed with Image J software to measure the low viscosity silicon layer thickness at pre-determined points. The silicon layer was also weighted. Results were statistically analyzed with ANOVA and Tukey's test (alpha = 0.05). Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relation between the two types of evaluation methods.
   Results. All IS evaluated showed clinically acceptable internal and marginal adaptation. Metal IS showed the best adaptation, irrespective of the measuring technique (RT and WT). The IS produced by CAD-CAM showed greater gap values at the occlusal area than at other evaluated regions. The IS produced by the dental laboratory technician showed similar gap values at all evaluated regions. There is no correlation between RT and WT (p > 0.05).
   Significance. Different levels of adaptation were found for the different experimental groups and for the different evaluation methods.

ID DESIGN
AB Cycle mode share increase is widely desired, but highway design practitioners lack the numerical tools to deliver infrastructure, instead relying on design standards and intuition, with little literature basis. As a case in point, the US Highway Capacity Manual (which is well used internationally) has developed levels of service for cycle infrastructure that are, at their core, based on an assumption of noninteraction between multiple cyclists. This paper uses a modified implementation of the Social Force Model to test the validity of this assumption. Necessary changes such as the consideration of acceleration characteristics and minimum maintainable speed are included. The resulting model produces valid outcomes in keeping with established traffic flow properties, reflecting three-phase traffic flow theory and the ability for the stochastic elements in traffic flow to cause flow breakdown. The developed simulation indicates that there is a fundamental difference in outcome if cyclists are assumed to have a fixed speed versus one they can change given their surroundings. This difference in outcomes is found to exist within the range of literature design flow capacities for bicycle infrastructure and also yields emergent outcomes that align closely with those known behaviors of highway vehicles, which intuitively transfer to cyclists. These findings reinforce the standing need for large-scale empirical studies to determine the basic numerical and behavioral parameters for cyclists, upon which all design ultimately rests.

AB Tropical forests hold some of the world's most diverse communities of plants. Many populations of large-bodied herbivores are threatened in these systems, yet their ecological functions and contribution towards the maintenance of high levels of plant diversity are poorly known. The impact of these herbivores on plant communities through antagonistic seed and seedling predation has received much attention, whilst their relevance as seed dispersal agents has been largely overlooked in experimental studies. Here, we tested how two key and functionally distinct large generalist mammalian herbivore species (the tapir Tapirus terrestris - a solitary browser and generalist seed disperser, and the white-lipped peccary Tayassu pecari - a group-living generalist seed/seedling predator) affect spatiotemporal patterns of diversity of seedling communities in tropical forests. We conducted a long-term multi-region landscape-scale exclusion experiment across four regions of the Atlantic forest of Brazil, representing a functional gradient of defaunation where these species were either present and absent in isolation and in combination. Our results indicate that mammalian herbivores have a substantial role in regulating beta diversity in space and time. Seedling recruitment was strongly limited by the presence of the seed/seedling predator species (the peccary), but the presence of the browser and seed disperser (the tapir) had null net effects. Alpha diversity of seedlings at the community level did not respond to large herbivore exclusion at any region, whereas beta diversity decreased only where both herbivores were simultaneously excluded. Surprisingly, the synergic positive effect of both herbivore types on beta diversity was linked to increased evenness amongst dominant plant species, and a simultaneous decrease in alpha diversity of rare species. Synthesis. Together, these results challenge the common perception that large tropical forest herbivores maintain tropical forest diversity through antagonistic interactions, suggesting instead a synergistic effect of antagonistic predation and mutualistic seed dispersal on regional compositional diversity and local community assembly. We suggest that the defaunation of large-bodied herbivores with complementary functions strongly affects the structure and dynamics of plant communities through cryptic mechanisms that remain largely unexplored.

AB Syntactic and structural models specify relationships between their constituents but cannot show what outcomes their interaction would produce over time in the world. Simulation consists in iterating the states of a model, so as to produce behaviour over a period of simulated time. Iteration enables us to trace the implications and outcomes of inference rules and other assumptions implemented in the models that make up a theory. We apply this method to experiments which we treat as models of the particular aspects of reality they are designed to investigate. Scientific experiments are constantly designed and re-designed in the context of implementation and use. They mediate between theoretical understanding and the practicalities of engaging with the empirical and social world. In order to model experiments we need to identify and represent features that all experiments have in common. We treat these features as parameters of a general model of experiment so that by varying these parameters different types of experiment can be modelled.

ID SCATTERING; BUBBLES; SIGNALS; AGENTS; MODEL
AB Sub-harmonic response from ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles has been demonstrated to be an effective modality for noninvasive pressure measurement. In the present study, the dependence of ultraharmonic response on the ambient overpressure was investigated by both experimental measurements and simulations. In the measurements, the microbubbles were exposed to Gaussian pulses with varied driving frequencies and pulse lengths, at an acoustic pressure of 0.3 MPa. The amplitudes of sub-and ultra-harmonic components were measured when the ambient overpressures varied from 0-25 kPa. At the driving frequency of 1.33 MHz, the ultra-harmonic energy decreased but the sub-harmonic energy increased with the increasing overpressure; while at the driving frequency of 4 MHz, both the sub-and ultra-harmonic components showed the same tendency that the corresponding energy decreased as the overpressure was increased. A 4-MHz Gaussian pulse with 64 cycles could provide an ultra-harmonic response with both good ambient pressure sensitivity and high linearity. Furthermore, the effects of shell parameters of a microbubble on the generation of ultra-and sub-harmonic responses were discussed based on simulations using Marmottant's model. This study suggests that the ultra-harmonic response from contrast microbubbles might be applicable for noninvasive pressure measurement. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

AB In this paper we use agent-based computational modelling and computer simulations to examine the interrelationship between different selling strategies for going public. A great deal of recent empirical evidence suggests that to maximise the revenue raised from the shares sold in the public offering, it is fundamental to choose the appropriate design for the sale which, in turn, reflects the final ownership structure. This literature establishes that the market for shares is segmented and, particularly, that firms manage the sale of shares with the purpose of discriminating between relatively small and passive investors and applicants for large potentially controlling blocks. One of the key questions in this area, then, is: How and to what extent should this heterogeneity among potential investors influence the firm's strategy for selling shares ? Here we attempt to address this question from the standpoint of using agent-based computational modelling and computer simulations. Results show that the design of the sale is an important determinant of the performance of the negotiation process through which the firm is sold. A sequential sale beginning with an initial public offering of dispersed shares, followed by a negotiated sale of a controlling block is, in general, more effective than other alternative selling strategies. Changing the negotiation protocol itself can act as an effective way of impacting upon the revenue raised and the length of the process. The interrelationship between the method of sale and the performance may also depend on the degree of cognitive accuracy that characterises the negotiating agents' mental representations of their physical and social environment.

AB Anticipating the sensorimotor consequences of an action for both self and other is fundamental for action coordination when individuals socially interact. Somatosensation constitutes an elementary component of social cognition and sensorimotor prediction, but its functions in active social behavior remain unclear. We hypothesized that the somatosensory system contributes to social haptic behavior as evidenced by specific anticipatory activation patterns when touching an animate target (human hand) compared with an inanimate target (fake hand). fMRI scanning was performed during a paradigm that allowed us to isolate the anticipatory representations of active interpersonal touch while controlling for nonsocial sensorimotor processes and possible confounds because of interpersonal relationships or socioemotional valence. Active interpersonal touch was studied both as skin-to-skin contact and as object-mediated touch. The results showed weaker deactivation in primary somatosensory cortex and medial pFC and stronger activation in cerebellum for the animate target, compared with the inanimate target, when intending to touch it with one's own hand. Differently, in anticipation of touching the human hand with an object, anterior inferior parietal lobule and lateral occipital-temporal cortex showed stronger activity. When actually touching a human hand with one's own hand, activation was stronger in medial pFC but weaker in primary somatosensory cortex. The findings provide new insight on the contribution of simulation and sensory prediction mechanisms to active social behavior. They also suggest that literally getting in touch with someone and touching someone by using an object might be approached by an agent as functionally distinct conditions.

AB Chitosan-based polymeric micelles (CBPMs) are considered as promising carriers for delivery of anticancer drugs, imaging agents and genes. To optimize the physicochemical, pharmaceutical and biological properties of CBPMs, the molecular mechanisms behind the self-assembly behavior of chitosan (CHI) amphiphilic derivatives are elucidated.
   This study has two stages. In the experimental stage, dexamethasone (DEX) as a hydrophobic group is grafted to CHI in three degrees of substitution in order to obtain CHI derivatives with different degrees of hydrophobicity. These new CHI amphiphilic derivatives (CHI_DEXs) form micelles in water where their critical aggregation concentration (CAC), size and zeta potential are measured. Through comparing the results of these measurements, the change of self-assembly behavior of CHI_DEXs in response to increasing their hydrophobicity is evaluated. Correlating this evaluation with the results of the 13 MD simulations conducted on CHI_DEXs in atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation stage, reveals the molecular mechanisms behind the self-assembly behavior of CHI_DEXs.
   Our evaluation of the experimental results reveals that increasing hydrophobicity of a CHI amphiphilic derivative would not necessarily cause it to form micelles with lower CAC value, smaller size and lower zeta potential. The MD simulations reveal that there exists a balance between intra- and inter-chain interactions which is responsible for the self-assembly behavior of CHI amphiphilic derivatives.
   An increase in DS of the hydrophobic group triggers a cascade of molecular events that shifts the balance between intra- and inter-chain interactions leading to changes in the CAC, size and zeta potential of the CBPMs.

AB For the first time, this paper presents the results of electrochemical oxidation of p-aminoacetanilide in aqueous solution with different pH values. The data indicate that electrochemically generated p-quinone-diimine is unstable in acidic and alkaline solution. It is hydrolyzed in acidic (pH range of 1-6) and alkaline (pH range of 12-13) media and it is dimerized and trimerized in intermediate pH values. The observed homogeneous rate constants (k(obs)) of the coupling reaction of p-aminoacetanilide with electrochemically generated p-quinone-diimine, was estimated by comparison of the experimental cyclic voltammograms with the digital simulated results in the pH range 7-9. In addition, based on electrochemical data, a green electrochemical protocol for the synthesis of a new yellow azo dye involving electrochemical oxidation of p-aminoacetanilide in aqueous phosphate buffer and in an undivided cell, using carbon anode is described.

AB Most empirical studies on liquidity constraints classify a consumer as being constrained on the basis of a single indicator such as the asset-to-income ratio. In this analysis. we model the probability that a consumer faces liquidity constraints as a function of multiple social and economic factors. This probability function is estimated simultaneously with the degree of excess sensitivity of consumption to income in a switching regressions framework. The switching regressions apply optimal weights to the densities for the Euler equations in the two states and are less susceptible to sample misclassification. Our results based on data from the CEX confirm that liquidity-constrained consumers are excessively sensitive to variables already known to economic agents. However. there is also evidence that the unconstrained consumers exhibit behavior that is inconsistent with the theoretical predictions. Further analysis suggests that such behavior could be explained by time-nonseparable preferences.

AB PURPOSE. This in-vitro study was designed to evaluate retention forces, microleakage and plastic deformation of a prefabricated 2-implant bar attachment system (SFI-Bar, Cendres+Metaux, Switzerland). MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two SFI implant-adapters were torqued with 35 Ncm into two implant analogues. Before the tube bars were finally sealed, the inner cavity of the tube bar was filled with liquid red dye to evaluate microleakage. As tube bar sealing agents three different materials were used (AGC Cem (AGC, resin based), Cervitec Plus (CP; varnish) and Gapseal (GS; silicone based). Four groups with eight specimens each were tested (GS, GS+AGC, AGC, CP). For cyclic loading, the attachment system was assembled parallel to the female counterparts in a chewing simulator. The mean retention forces of the initial and final ten cycles were statistically evaluated (ANOVA, alpha <=.05). RESULTS. All groups showed a significant loss of retention forces. Their means differed between 30-39 N initially and 22-28 N after 50,000 loading cycles. No significant statistical differences could be found between the groups at the beginning (P=.224), at the end (P=.257) or between the loss of retention forces (P=.288). Micro leakage occurred initially only in some groups but after 10,000 loading cycles all groups exhibited microleakage. CONCLUSION. Long-term retention forces of the SFI-Bar remained above 20 N which can be considered clinically sufficient. The sealing agents in this study are not suitable to prevent microleakage.

ID LIQUID-LIQUID DISPERSIONS; AGITATED VESSELS; SUSPENSION POLYMERIZATION;
   MODEL; COALESCENCE; BREAKAGE
AB Macroscopic phenomena in suspension polymerization reactors are extremely complex, and breakage and coalescence of polymerizing monomer droplets are not well understood, especially for high dispersed-phase volume fractions. Depending on the agitation, concentration and type of surface-active agent the droplet size call exhibit a U shape variation with respect to the impeller speed. This behavior has been confirmed experimentally and theoretically as the balance between breakage and coalescence rates of monomer drops. Both processes are related to the drop surface energy, which is proportional to the interfacial tension and its variation with time. In this study die most comprehensive models describing breakage and coalescence processes in a dispersion system were incorporated into a generalized numerical algorithm to predict the steady-state drop-size distributions in a high holdup (50%) liquid-liquid dispersion system. To assess the effectiveness of the theoretical model in simulating drop-size distributions in high holdup dispersion systems, experiments were carried out with a model system of 50% n-butyl chloride in water in the presence of a surface-active agent, poly(vinyl alcohol), at different concentrations and agitation rates. The theoretical model can predict reasonably well the drop-size distribution for all experimental conditions A systematic theoretical and experimental investigation elucidates the relationships between the changing structure of PVA molecules at the monomer/water interface and their effects on breakage and coalescence frequencies at different agitation times and rates.

TI An empirical nonlinear dynamics approach to analyzing emergent behavior
   of agent-based models
SO AIP ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate the behavior of complex systems from bottom to top so that macro-scale patterns emerge from randomized micro-scale interactions among autonomous agents and their environment. However, our ability to construct complex ABMs currently exceeds our capacity to evaluate their emergent dynamics, contributing to an explainability problem in convincing policymakers that in silico experimentation with ABMs can be trusted to correspond to the real world they are charged with regulating. While there is no universally agreed-upon approach for analyzing or benchmarking ABM dynamics, past work has emphasized statistical and probabilistic analyses. Consistent with a key feature of ABMs-the macro-level order emerges from micro-level randomness-we propose a deterministic analytical framework built from nonlinear time series methods to reveal an emergent low-dimensional dynamical structure concealed in complex ABM output. In particular, embedding ABM dynamics (time series) in a nonlinear state space enables diagnosis of a low-dimensional structure, inference of causal interaction regimes among macro-level variables, extraction of a phenomenological meta-model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations, and benchmarking of ABMs against real-world systems, to establish credibility in the eyes of policymakers and stakeholders. We demonstrate the deterministic approach with a canonical model for virus outbreaks.

AB High intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) has been regarded as a promising technology for treating cancer and other severe diseases noninvasively. In the present study, dual modality magnetic ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles (MBs) were synthesized by loading the super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIOs) into the albumin-shelled MBs (referred as SPIO-albumin MBs). Then, both experimental measurements and numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the ability of SPIO-albumin MBs of enhancing HIFU-induced thermal effect. The results indicated that, comparing with regular albumin-shelled MBs, the SPIO-albumin MBs would lead to quicker temperature elevation rate and higher peak temperature. This phenomenon could be explained by the changes in MBs' physical and thermal properties induced by the integration of SPIOs into MB shell materials. In addition, more experimental results demonstrated that the enhancement effect on HIFU-induced temperature elevation could be further strengthened with more SPIOs combined with albumin-shell MBs. These observations suggested that more violent cavitation behaviors might be activated by ultrasound exposures with the presence of SPIOs, which in turn amplified ultrasound-stimulated thermal effect. Based on the present studies, it is reasonable to expect that, with the help of properly designed dual-modality magnetic MBs, the efficiency of HIFU-induced thermal effect could be further improved to achieve better therapeutic outcomes.

AB This study evaluated the cariostatic effect of antibacterial self-etching adhesive systems, by means of an in vitro bacterial caries model. Seventy-five prepared bovine slabs were randomly divided into groups (n = 15): (1) unbonded composite, no carious challenge (UNB-NC); (2) unbonded composite, carious challenge (UNB-C); (3) Clearfil SE Bond, no antibacterial agent (CSE); (4) Protect Bond, containing MDPB and fluoride (PB); and (5) Reactmer Bond, fluoride-releasing (RB). All preparations were restored with Filtek (TM) Z-250. Groups (2)-(5) were submitted to a medium containing Streptococcus mutans (ATCC - 25175) for 5 days, and Group (1) was kept in a noninoculated medium. Insoluble polysaccharides present in tooth biofilms were quantified, Knoop hardness (KHN) was measured on the enamel adjacent to restorations, and standard 35-mm polarized light photomicrographs were taken as illustrations. Polysaccharide and Knoop hardness results were analyzed with the use of ANOVA, with a split-split-plot statistical design for KHN. Except for Group (1), all groups showed similar caries formation. Biofilm over PB restorations showed the smallest amounts of polysaccharides (14.37 mu g/mg), and CSE showed the highest amounts (20.87 mu g/mg). All self-etching systems tested were unable to inhibit secondary caries in a bacterial model simulating a high caries challenge, even though there was reduced glucan synthesis provided by the adhesive system containing MDPB and fluoride.

AB In this paper, we report on the theoretical foundations, empirical context and technical implementation of an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework, that uses a high-performance computing (HPC) approach to investigate human population dynamics on a global scale, and on evolutionary time scales. The ABM-HPC framework provides an in silico testbed to explore how short-term/small-scale patterns of individual human behavior and long-term/large-scale patterns of environmental change act together to influence human dispersal, survival and extinction scenarios. These topics are currently at the center of the Neanderthal debate, i.e., the question why Neanderthals died out during the Late Pleistocene, while modern humans dispersed over the entire globe. To tackle this and similar questions, simulations typically adopt one of two opposing approaches, top-down (equation-based) and bottom-up (agent-based) models of population dynamics. We propose HPC technology as an essential computational tool to bridge the gap between these approaches. Using the numerical simulation of worldwide human dispersals as an example, we show that integrating different levels of model hierarchy into an ABM-HPC simulation framework provides new insights into emergent properties of the model, and into the potential and limitations of agent-based versus continuum models.

AB Flowers from Dendranthema x grandiflorum (Ramat.) Kitam. are grown in Brazil for floristic trade, and residues from different cultivars are generated, containing flowers, leaves and stems. These residues can be used to produce larvicidal products. To confirm this hypothesis, 27 dichloromethane extracts were produced from Dendranthema x grandiflorum agricultural residues. All were analyzed by GC-MS and FT-ICR MS with two different ionization sources, APCI and ESI. The spectra and chromatograms were converted to matrices, which were used as input for PCA analyses. Simultaneously, the extracts at concentrations of 5 and 15 ppm were submitted to larvicidal assays on Aedes aegypti larvae, the etiological agent of dengue, chikungunya and zika diseases. High larvicidal activity (larvae mortality > 80%) was found for 14 samples, medium larvicidal activity (70% > larvae mortality > 40%) for 4 samples and low larvicidal activity (larvae mortality < 40%) for 9 samples. The PCA graph for GC-MS chromatograms furnished three groups (GC1, GC2 and GC3). Group GC2 included nine of the highly active samples, and Group GC3 included seven of the less active ones. Similarly, three clusters were formed when ESI (-) FT-ICR MS data were used. Groups GC1 and GC2 included most of the highly active samples. The APCI (+) FT-ICR MS data, however, did not discriminate groups by biological activity. Such data show triterpenes and fatty acids as the classes of natural substances that most contributed to the discrimination of the samples. The highly active samples either had a fatty acid/triterpene ratio between 1 and 4 (most) or had a high concentration of triterpenes. The data suggest that triterpenes are the plant's larvicidal molecules and that fatty acids act as synergistic agents.

AB A hypothesis that simultaneous targeting cancer-related carbonic anhydrase hCA IX and hCA XII isoforms (whose overexpression is a cancer cell's defence mechanism against hypoxia) along with thioredoxin reductase (overexpressed in cancers as a defence against oxidative stress) may lead to synergistic antiproliferative effects was confirmed by testing combinations of the two inhibitor classes against pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1). Combining both pharmacophoric motifs within one molecule led to a sharp increase of cytotoxicity. This preliminary observation sets the ground for a fundamentally new approach to anticancer agent design.

AB The synchronization of fractional-order differential chaotic systems is investigated via event-triggered impulsive control(EIC), where the benefits of impulsive control and event-triggered control are adopted. The impulsive sequence is defined by certain triggering function and triggering condition, which are dependent on the states of master and slave systems. The controller is only updated at impulsive instants. As the update frequency of the controller is reduced, the consumption of communication bandwidth and computing resources by the controller can be further reduced. Furthermore, Zeno-behavior of impulsive sequence is excluded. Finally, the validity of the theoretical results is shown by a numerical example with simulation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB A major focus of recent work on the spatial patterning of health has been the study of how features of residential environments or neighborhoods may affect health. Place effects on health emerge from complex interdependent processes in which individuals interact with each other and their environment and in which both individuals and environments adapt and change over time. Traditional epidemiologic study designs and statistical regression approaches are unable to examine these dynamic processes. These limitations have constrained the types of questions asked, the answers received, and the hypotheses and theoretical explanations that are developed. Agent-based models and other systems-dynamics models may help to address some of these challenges. Agent-based models are computer representations of systems consisting of heterogeneous microentities that can interact and change/adapt over time in response to other agents and features of the environment. Using these models, one can observe how macroscale dynamics emerge from microscale interactions and adaptations. A number of challenges and limitations exist for agent-based modeling. Nevertheless, use of these dynamic models may complement traditional epidemiologic analyses and yield additional insights into the processes involved and the interventions that may be most useful.

TI EFFECT OF ALPHA-ADRENERGIC BLOCKADE ON THERMOREGULATION IN ADRENAL
   DEMEDULLATED BURNED RATS
SO BURNS
LA English
DT Article
AB This study in burned rats studied at two ambient temperatures (22 degrees and 28 degrees C) and housed at 28 degrees C was designed to investigate the role of catecholamines in the maintenance of thermal homeostasis following burn injury. Two weeks prior to burn or sham burn, animals underwent adrenal medullectomy or sham adrenal medullectomy. Between postburn days 9 and 13, simultaneous direct and indirect calorimetry was performed following administration of 2mg/kg of phentolamine (alpha adrenergic blacking agent) via a carotid arterial line. Following administration of phentolamine, heat production and body temperature decreased and heat loss increased immediately. The cooling slopes for the ham groups were significantly steeper than far the control groups, within ambient temperatures. Within ambient temper atures, the presence or absence of the adrenal medulla had no discernible effect on the cooling slope of the bums or the controls. The burned animals cooled 1.9-3.5 times faster at 22 degrees than at 28 degrees C, and controls cooled 2.0-3.9 times faster at 22 degrees than at 28 degrees C. Phentolnmine produced a several-fold increase in serum concentrations of both norephinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E), indicating a gross overlap in alpha and beta adrenergic receptor utilization for E and NE, The progressive cooling of the adrenal demedullated burn group at 22 degrees C following phentolamine administration seems to indicate that norepinephrine is calorigenic for rats under these experimental circumstances. These experimental results indicate a relatively non-essential role for catecholamines in the maintenance of thermal homeostasis within the thermal neutral zone in the rat.

AB The main objective of the Synthetic Teammate project is to develop language and task enabled synthetic agents capable of being integrated into team training simulations. To achieve this goal, the agents must be able to closely match human behavior. The initial application for the synthetic teammate research is creation of an agent able to perform the functions of a pilot for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) simulation as part of a three-person team. The agent, or synthetic teammate, is being developed in the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The major components include: language comprehension and generation, dialog management, agent-environment interaction, and situation assessment. Initial empirical results suggest that the agent-environment interaction is a good approximation to human behavior in the UAV environment, and we are planning further empirical tests of the synthetic teammate operating with human teammates. This paper covers the project's modeling approach, challenges faced, progress made toward an integrated synthetic teammate, and lessons learned during development.

AB Large collections of autonomously moving agents, such as animals or micro-organisms, are able to flock coherently in space even in the absence of a central control mechanism. While the direction of the flock resulting from this critical behavior is random, this can be controlled by a small subset of informed individuals acting as leaders of the group. In this article we use the Vicsek model to investigate how flocks respond to leadership and make decisions. Using a combination of numerical simulations and continuous modeling we demonstrate that flocks display a linear response to leadership that can be cast in the framework of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, identifying an effective temperature reflecting how promptly the flock reacts to the initiative of the leaders. The linear response to leadership also holds in the presence of two groups of informed individuals with competing interests, indicating that the flock's behavioral decision is determined by both the number of leaders and their degree of influence.

AB We extend an agent-based model of crime-pattern formation initiated in Short et al. by incorporating the effects of law enforcement agents. We investigate the effect that these agents have on the spatial distribution and overall level of criminal activity in a simulated urban setting. Our focus is on a two-dimensional lattice model of residential burglaries, where each site (target) is characterized by a dynamic attractiveness to burglary and where criminal and law enforcement agents are represented by random walkers. The dynamics of the criminal agents and the target-attractiveness field are, with certain modifications, as described in Short et al. Here the dynamics of enforcement agents are affected by the attractiveness field via a biasing of the walk, the detailed rules of which define a deployment strategy. We observe that law enforcement agents, if properly deployed, will in fact reduce the total amount of crime, but their relative effectiveness depends on the number of agents deployed, the deployment strategy used, and spatial distribution of criminal activity.
   For certain policing strategies, continuum PDE models can be derived from the discrete systems. The continuum models are qualitatively similar to the discrete systems at large system sizes.

AB Participants in trials may be randomized either individually or in groups and may receive their treatment either entirely individually, entirely in groups, or partially individually and partially in groups. This paper concerns cases in which participants receive their treatment either entirely or partially in groups, regardless of how they were randomized. Participants in group-randomized trials are randomized in groups, and participants in individually randomized group treatment trials are individually randomized, but participants in both types of trials receive part or all of their treatment in groups or through common change agents. Participants who receive part or all of their treatment in a group are expected to have positively correlated outcome measurements. This paper addresses a situation that occurs in group-randomized trials and individually randomized group treatment trialsparticipants receive treatment through more than one group. As motivation, we consider trials in The Childhood Obesity Prevention and Treatment Research Consortium, in which each child participant receives treatment in at least two groups. In simulation studies, we considered several possible analytic approaches over a variety of possible group structures. A mixed model with random effects for both groups provided the only consistent protection against inflated type I error rates and did so at the cost of only moderate loss of power when intraclass correlations were not large. We recommend constraining variance estimates to be positive and using the Kenward-Roger adjustment for degrees of freedom; this combination provided additional power but maintained type I error rates at the nominal level.

TI Modeling biological tissue growth: Discrete to continuum representations
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID EXCLUSION PROCESSES; CELL-MIGRATION; DOMAIN; DIFFUSION; MECHANISM
AB There is much interest in building deterministic continuum models from discrete agent-based models governed by local stochastic rules where an agent represents a biological cell. In developmental biology, cells are able to move and undergo cell division on and within growing tissues. A growing tissue is itself made up of cells which undergo cell division, thereby providing a significant transport mechanism for other cells within it. We develop a discrete agent-based model where domain agents represent tissue cells. Each agent has the ability to undergo a proliferation event whereby an additional domain agent is incorporated into the lattice. If a probability distribution describes the waiting times between proliferation events for an individual agent, then the total length of the domain is a random variable. The average behavior of these stochastically proliferating agents defining the growing lattice is determined in terms of a Fokker-Planck equation, with an advection and diffusion term. The diffusion term differs from the one obtained Landman and Binder [J. Theor. Biol. 259, 541 (2009)] when the rate of growth of the domain is specified, but the choice of agents is random. This discrepancy is reconciled by determining a discrete-time master equation for this process and an associated asymmetric nonexclusion random walk, together with consideration of synchronous and asynchronous updating schemes. All theoretical results are confirmed with numerical simulations. This study furthers our understanding of the relationship between agent-based rules, their implementation, and their associated partial differential equations. Since tissue growth is a significant cellular transport mechanism during embryonic growth, it is important to use the correct partial differential equation description when combining with other cellular functions.

TI Analysis of Formation of Pad Stains in Copper Chemical Mechanical
   Planarization
SO JAPANESE JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
AB A stain model was developed to simulate stain formation on the pad surface in copper chemical and mechanical planarization (CMP). The model consisted of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, the heat equation with advection, material removal rate model, a model for generation, transport and deposition of the polishing by-product that produces the stain. Slurry velocity simulations showed shear flow on the land areas and wafer-driven circulation in the grooves. The simulated temperature on the pad and the wafer surface increased gradually in the radial direction; furthermore, temperature simulations showed a 12 degrees C rise in the reaction temperature on the copper wafer surface. The simulated pad stains deposited on the copper land areas were darker in the direction of wafer rotation, suggesting that the generated staining agents were advected downstream by the slurry flow and deposited on the pad surface in the direction of the wafer rotation. Simulated stain images were in qualitative agreement with experimental results. (C) 2009 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB This paper presents an agent-based modeling framework for affordance-based driving behaviors during the exit maneuver of driver agents in human-integrated transportation problems. We start our discussion from one novel modeling framework based on the concept of affordance called the affordance-based finite state automata (AFSA) model, which incorporates the human perception of resource availability and action capability. Then, the agent-based simulation illustrates the validity of the AFSA framework for the highway-lane-driver system. Next, the comparative study between real driving data and agent-based simulation outputs is provided using the transition diagram. Finally, we perform a statistical analysis and a correlation study to analyze affordance-based driving behavior of driver agents. The simulation results show that the AFSA model well represents the perception-based human actions and drivers' characteristics, which are essential for the design viewpoint of control framework of human driver modeling. This paper is also expected to benefit a designed control for autonomous/self-driving car in the future.

AB Unexpected behaviours in simulations require explanation, so that decision-makers and subject matter experts can separate valid behaviours from design or coding errors. Validation of unexpected behaviours requires accumulation of insight into the behaviour and the conditions under which it arises. Agent-based simulations are known for unexpected behaviours that emerge as the simulation executes. To facilitate user exploration, analysis, understanding and insight of unexpected behaviours, we have developed a novel semi-automated methodology, INSIGHT. INSIGHT provides: (1) semi-automatic hypothesis testing for exploring an unexpected behaviour, and (2) automatic identification of statements in an agent-based simulation's source code which have the strongest influence on an unexpected behaviour. INSIGHT is applicable to both deterministic and stochastic agent-based simulations and extends the state of the art in agent-based simulation analysis.

AB Industrial logistics plays a key role in industrial engineering. Since battle damage assessment and repair (BDAR) process is essentially military industrial logistics process, optimal decisions for operations management of BDAR are crucial to military industrial logistics planning. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic procedure of optimal decisions for operations management of BDAR and form a framework of military industrial logistics data analytics. Based on war statistics from the collected historical real-world combat data, by classifying the damaged equipments into emergency group and non-emergency group, this study establishes three mathematical models on decision-making for operations management of BDAR, and presents resolutions to problems of optimized deployment, task allocation and selection of formation schemes for the resources in military industrial logistics system. Subsequently, an agent-based simulation model for military industrial logistics system is developed to demonstrate and verify the method. The results show that the method is feasible and effective.

AB With the gradual improvement in coal mine mechanization and automation, the dust concentration at production sites is increasing significantly as the production efficiency improves, which not only poses a substantial threat to the occupational safety and health of workers but also affects the safe production and social stability of mines. At present, wet dust removal is the most economical and effective technical dust removal measure. However, most coal seams in China have poor wettability, unclear microscopic wetting mechanisms, and poor dust removal effects. Therefore, based on experiments and numerical analysis, this paper qualitatively studies the influencing factors of surfactants on coal wettability and quantitatively constructs an innovative evaluation model of the influence of the microstructure of coal and surfactants on wettability. First, based on C-13 NMR experiments, the structural parameters of coal and several surfactants were obtained. Second, the wettability relationship between the coal and the surfactants was determined by optical titration, and the key factors affecting the wettability of coal dust and the wettability of the surfactants were selected. Then, using numerical analysis and function fitting analysis and combining the structural parameters with the coal wetting results, the relationship between the microstructure of the surfactants on different kinds of coal and the wettability of the coal samples was established. The results show that the ether group, the phenol or aromatic ether carbon, the fatty methyl group, and the aromatic methyl group in the surfactants have a substantial influence on the wettability. The research results can provide scientific guidance for the development of efficient and environmentally friendly compound dust suppressants to realize clean production in mines.

AB Inspired by behaviors of schools of fish seeking darker (shaded) regions in environments, this paper proposes a distributed source seeking strategy for a mobile sensor network. The strategy allows each sensing agent to take instantaneous measurements of the field and collectively move against the direction of spatial gradient, without explicitly estimating the gradient. For each agent, one portion of its velocity is designed to be proportional to its measurement of the field, and another portion of its velocity is devoted to keep a formation with other agents. This strategy generates a speeding-up and slowing-down (SUSD) behavior that is very similar to what has been observed in schools of fish. Convergence analysis of this SUSD strategy shows that the moving direction of the agent formation will be aligned with the opposite gradient direction so that the formation moves toward a local minimum of the field, which is referred to as the source of the field. The SUSD strategy is also robust to deterministic disturbances and stochastic noise, which is rigorously justified by proving that the resulting closed-loop system is input-to-state stable and noise-to-state stable. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the SUSD strategy.

AB The Schelling model is widely used for the study of segregation behaviour in sociodynamics, econophysics, and related disciplines. Agents of two types placed in a lattice or network are allowed to exchange their locations on the basis of a transfer rule (T(S, A)), which depends on the satisfaction that the agent already has in her/his present position (S), and the attractiveness of the future position (A). The satisfaction and the attractiveness that the agent feels are measured in terms of the fraction between the number of agents of the same type that are present in the neighbourhood of the agent under consideration and the total number of neighbours. In this work we propose a generalization of the Schelling model such that the relative influence of satisfaction and attractiveness can be enhanced or depleted by means of an exponent q, i.e. T(S, A) = (1-S)(q)A.
   We report extensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations performed for the twodimensional square lattice with initial conditions of two different types: (i) fully disordered configurations of randomly located agents; and (ii) fully segregated configurations with a flat interface between two domains of unlike agents. We show that the proposed model exhibits a rich and interesting complex behaviour that emerges from the competitive interplay between interfacial roughening and the diffusion of isolated agents in the bulk of clusters of unlike agents. The first process dominates the early time regime, while the second one prevails for longer times after a suitable crossover time. Our numerical results are rationalized in terms of a dynamic finite-size scaling ansatz.

AB Consistent evidence suggests that the way we reach and grasp an object is modulated not only by object properties (e.g., size, shape, texture, fragility and weight), but also by the types of intention driving the action, among which the intention to interact with another agent (i.e., social intention). Action observation studies ascribe the neural substrate of this 'intentional' component to the putative mirror neuron (pMNS) and the mentalizing (MS) systems. How social intentions are translated into executed actions, however, has yet to be addressed. We conducted a kinematic and a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study considering a reach-to-grasp movement performed towards the same object positioned at the same location but with different intentions: passing it to another person (social condition) or putting it on a concave base (individual condition). Kinematics showed that individual and social intentions are characterized by different profiles, with a slower movement at the level of both the reaching (i.e., arm movement) and the grasping (i.e., hand aperture) components. fMRI results showed that: (i)distinct voxel pattern activity for the social and the individual condition are present within the pMNS and the MS during action execution; (ii) decoding accuracies of regions belonging to the pMNS and the MS are correlated, suggesting that these two systems could interact for the generation of appropriate motor commands. Results are discussed in terms of motor simulation and inferential processes as part of a hierarchical generative model for action intention understanding and generation of appropriate motor commands.

AB Surveys and empirical researches have revealed that the households' perceptions of benefits play a more important role than the benefits themselves in the decision process of adopting residential photovoltaic (PV). However, it has been overlooked in previous models about the green technology diffusion. This work developed an innovation diffusion model based on a social network, which was integrated with an anecdotal information exchange process. The contributions were to model the households' evaluation, which changes with social influence, and analyze the impact of such dynamics on the adoption of residential PV. A case study was conducted for villages in Beijing. Different scenarios about policies have been considered concerning both the economic benefits and the information diffusion on social network. The results show that: (1) Providing insurance against the damage of PV to adopters for free can improve the adoption rate from 24% up to 62% (full insurance), and the new adopter acquisition cost is only 36% of that of providing additional subsidy; (2) The enhancement of communications (e.g. Bulletin Board System (BBS) and Social Networking Services (SNS)) creates an obstacle to the residential PV adoption when the majority of households have insufficient knowledge about the PV system; and (3) Information campaigns and information screening are both effective and necessary in mitigating the negative effect from the enhancement of communications at the initial stage of the residential PV market.

AB Organophosphorus compounds (OP) are part of a group of compounds that may be hazardous to health. They are called neurotoxic agents because of their action on the nervous system, inhibiting the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme and resulting in a cholinergic crisis. Their high toxicity and rapid action lead to irreversible damage to the nervous system, drawing attention to developing new treatment methods. The diisopropyl fluorophosphatase (DFPase) enzyme has been considered as a potent biocatalyst for the hydrolysis of toxic OP and has potential for bioremediation of this kind of intoxication. In order to investigate the degradation process of the nerve agents Tabun, Cyclosarin and Soman through the wild-type DFPase, and taking into account their stereochemistry, theoretical studies were carried out. The intermolecular interaction energy and other parameters obtained from the molecular docking calculations were used to construct a data matrix, which were posteriorly treated by statistical analyzes of chemometrics, using the PCA (Principal Components Analysis) multivariate analysis. The analyzed parameters seem to be quite important for the reaction mechanisms simulation (QM/MM). Our findings showed that the wild-type DFPase enzyme is stereoselective in hydrolysis, showing promising results for the catalytic degradation of the neurotoxic agents under study, with the degradation mechanism performed through two proposed pathways.

AB Genetic optimisation is used to minimise operational costs across a system of electrical loads and generators controlled by local intelligent agents and connected to the electricity grid at market rates. Experimental results in a simulated environment show that coordinated market-sensitive behaviours are achieved. A large network of 500 loads and generators, each characterised by different randomly selected parameters, was optimised using a two-stage genetic algorithm to achieve scalability.

AB In recent years, individual-based/agent-based modeling has been applied to study a wide range of applications, ranging from engineering problems to phenomena in sociology, economics and biology. Simulating such agent-based models over extended spatiotemporal domains can be prohibitively expensive due to stochasticity and the presence of multiple scales. Nevertheless, many agent-based problems exhibit smooth behavior in space and time on a macroscopic scale, suggesting that a useful coarse-grained continuum model could be obtained. For such problems, the equation-free framework [16-18] can significantly reduce the computational cost. Patch dynamics is an essential component of this framework. This scheme is designed to perform numerical simulations of an unavailable macroscopic equation on macroscopic time and length scales; it uses appropriately initialized simulations of the fine-scale agent-based model in a number of small "patches", which cover only a fraction of the spatiotemporal domain. In this work, we construct a finite-volume-inspired conservative patch dynamics scheme and apply it to a financial market agent-based model based on the work of Omurtag and Sirovich [22]. We first apply our patch dynamics scheme to a continuum approximation of the agent-based model, to study its performance and analyze its accuracy. We then apply the scheme to the agent-based model itself. Our computational experiments indicate that here, typically, the patch dynamics-based simulation needs to be performed in only 20% of the full agent simulation space, and in only 10% of the temporal domain.

AB Clinical drug resistance may be attributed to the simultaneous selection and expression of genes modulating the uptake and metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) functions as a membrane-associated drug efflux pump whose increased expression results in resistance to anthracyclines, epipodophyllotoxins, vinca alkaloids, and some alkylating agents. This type of resistance occurs as both de novo and acquired resistance to therapy for leukemia. We have studied P-gp expression and function in childhood acute leukemias by developing a series of doxorubicin- and vincristine-selected GEM, T-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines that recapitulate the low levels of expression and resistance seen clinically. These cell lines have been used to develop flow cytometric assays for the semiquantitative measurements of P-gp expression with the MRK16 monoclonal antibody and P-gp function using the enhanced retention of rhodamine 123 in the presence of verapamil, a resistance modulator, Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics, represented by the D measurement, are used to determine the difference in level of P-gp expression by comparing MRK16 staining to an IgG2a isotype control. When D is >0.09, there is an excellent correlation (R = 0.82) between P-gp expression and function. The evaluation of 107 bone marrow specimens from 84 children with lymphoblastic or myelogenous leukemia showed a statistically significant (P = .004) increase in P-gp function at relapse. P-gp expression at relapse, however, approached but did not reach a significant level (P = .097), Using this methodology, we can identify patients with levels of P-gp expression and function that we can define clinically, as well as children with discordant multidrug resistance phenotypes, This study supports the role of P-gp-mediated drug resistance in childhood leukemia and confirms that P-gp expression and function are measurable in their leukemic blasts. These assays provide the means for the in vitro testing of resistance modulators and the monitoring of in vivo response to treatment with these agents. (C) 1996 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB This study investigated the remineralization effect of experimental mint formulations containing bioactive agents (xylitol; green tea extract, GT; and amorphous calcium phosphate, ACP) in the progression of artificially induced root caries. Root caries lesions were induced by demineralization solution (pH 4.6; 96 h; 37 degrees C). The lesions were treated with mint A, mint B, mint C, xylitol, GT, ACP, or remineralization solution (RS; negative control). Specimens were pH-cycled through treatments (5x/day; 3 min) and 6 cycles of acidic (pH 5.0; 30 min) and neutral (pH 7.0; 10 min) buffers for 8 days. Bacterial collagenase (Clostridium histolyticum) was used overnight to simulate proteolytic challenge. Caries depth and porosity as well as mineral density were estimated using fluorescence microscopy (n = 15) and microcomputed tomography (n = 6). Analysis of variance (ANOVA, a = 0.05) showed no statistically significant difference in caries depth among all groups (p = 0.172). The highest fluorescence intensity decrease was observed for GT followed by mint C, with no significant difference between them (p = 0.868). There were significant differences among GT and mints A, B, and C when compared to RS (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences in fluorescence intensity were observed among ACP, xylitol, and RS (p > 0.05). The mineral density of the lesions in GT, mints A, B, and C, and ACP was statistically similar (p > 0.05) and significantly higher than that in RS (p < 0.05). No significant difference was observed between xylitol and RS (p = 0.728). The experimental mints showed remineralization action on artificial root caries, and GT was found to be the main active ingredient in the investigated formulations. (C) 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB This paper introduces a learning algorithm that allows for imitation in recursive dynamic games. The Kiyotaki-Wright model of money is a well-known example of such decision environments. In this context, learning by experience has been studied before. Here, we introduce imitation as an additional channel for learning. In numerical simulations, we observe that the presence of imitation either speeds up social convergence to the theoretical Markov-Nash equilibrium or leads every agent of the same type to the same mode of suboptimal behavior. We observe an increase in the probability of convergence to equilibrium, as the incentives for optimal play become more pronounced. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reaction coordinate for the irreversible inhibition of the HIV-1 protease by epoxy alkylating agent has been examined by ab initio HF/6-31G(d) calculations, semiempirical molecular orbital (MO) calculations, while the effect of polar macromolecular environment was included on the solvent reaction field level. The calculations, show that inhibition is specific: activation (free) energy is low when two carboxylic groups that are models for Asp-25 and Asp-125 in the HIV-1 protease active center are involved and is considerably higher when only one formate or CH3S- is present. The latter two mimick any single carboxylate side chain and cysteine side chain, respectively. inclusion of solvent reaction field slightly changes the activation free energy. The calculations confirm experimental data concerning the necessity of two-aspartate motif of the protease active center to activate the alkylating agent [Yu et al., J. Am. Chem. Sec. 118, 5856 (1996)]. The results are discussed in the context of design of nonirreversible inhibitors. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Objectives: To evaluate the effects of alprostadil (prostaglandin [PGE1] analog) and iloprost (prostacyclin [PGI2] analog) on renal, lung, and skeletal muscle tissues after ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury in an experimental rat model.
   Materials and methods: Wistar albino rats underwent 2 hours of ischemia via infrarenal aorta clamping with subsequent 2 hours of reperfusion. Alprostadil and iloprost were given starting simultaneously with the reperfusion period. Effects of agents on renal, lung, and skeletal muscle (gastrocnemius) tissue specimens were examined.
   Results: Renal medullary congestion, cytoplasmic swelling, and mean tubular dilatation scores were significantly lower in the alprostadil-treated group than those found in the I/R-only group (P<0.0001, P=0.015, and P<0.01, respectively). Polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration, pulmonary partial destruction, consolidation, alveolar edema, and hemorrhage scores were significantly lower in alprostadil- and iloprost-treated groups (P=0.017 and P=0.001; P<0.01 and P<0.0001). Polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration scores in skeletal muscle tissue were significantly lower in the iloprost-treated group than the scores found in the nontreated I/R group (P<0.0001).
   Conclusion: Alprostadil and iloprost significantly reduce lung tissue I/R injury. Alprostadil has more prominent protective effects against renal I/R injury, while iloprost is superior in terms of protecting the skeletal muscle tissue against I/R injury.

AB This study explores the use of pH stacking in conjunction with 5-aminofluorescein as a derivatization agent for the sensitive analysis of simple sugars such as glucose, lactose and maltotriose by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The derivatization agent was selected on the basis of its extremely high molar absorptivity, its compatibility with a 488 nm light-emitting diode (LED) and the fact that it has two ionizable groups making it compatible with on-line stacking using a dynamic pH junction. The influence of both acetic and formic acids at concentrations of 0.19, 0.019 and 0.0019 mol L-1 were investigated with regard to both derivatization efficiency and the ability to stack using a dynamic pH junction. Superior sensitivity and resolution was obtained in formic acid over acetic acid. Substantially lower peaks were obtained with 0.19 mol L-1 formic acid when compared to 0.019 and 0.0019 mol L-1 concentrations, which was confirmed by computer simulation studies to be due to the inadequate movement of the pH boundary for stacking. Further simulation studies combined with experimental data showed the separation with the best resolution and greatest sensitivity when the carbohydrates were derivatized with the 0.095 mol L-1 formic acid. Utilisation of stacking via dynamic pH junction mode in conjunction with LED detection enabled efficiencies of 150,000 plates and detection limits in the order of 8.5 x 10(-8) mol L-1 for simple sugars such as glucose, lactose and maltotriose hydrate. The current system also demonstrates a 515 times improvement in sensitivity when compared to using a normal deuterium lamp, and 16 times improvement over other systems using LEDs.

AB Most biological systems encountered in living organisms involve highly complex heterogeneous multi-component structures that exhibit different physical, chemical, and biological behavior at different spatial and temporal scales. The development of predictive mathematical and computational models of multiscale events in such systems is a major challenge in contemporary computational biomechanics, particularly the development of models of growing tumors in humans. The aim of this study is to develop a general framework for tumor growth prediction by considering major biological events at tissue, cellular, and subcellular scales. The key to developing such multiscale models is how to bridge spatial and temporal scales that range from 10(-3) to 10(3) mm in space and from 10(-6) to 10(7) sin time. In this paper, a fully coupled space time multiscale framework for modeling tumor growth is developed. The framework consists of a tissue scale model, a model of cellular activities, and a subcellular transduction signaling pathway model. The tissue, cellular, and subcellular models in this framework are solved using partial differential equations for tissue growth, agent-based model for cellular events, and ordinary differential equations for signaling transduction pathway as a network at subcellular scale. The model is calibrated using experimental observations. Moreover, this model is biologically-driven, from a signaling pathway, volumetrically-consistent between cellular and tissue scale in terms of tumor volume evolution in time, and a biophysically-sound tissue model that satisfies all conservation laws. The results show that the model is capable of predicting major characteristics of tumor growth such as the morphological instability, growth patterns of different cell phenotypes, compact regions of the higher cell density at the tumor region, and the reduction of growth rate due to drug delivery. The predicted treatment outcomes show a reduction in proliferation at different rates in response to different drug dosages. Moreover, the results of several 3D applications to tumor growth and the evolution of cellular and subcellular events are presented. Published by Elsevier B.V.

ID EFFICIENT ALGORITHM
AB Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm inspired by humpback whale hunting behavior. WOA has many similarities with other swarm intelligence algorithms (PSO, GWO, etc.). WOA's unique search mechanism enables it to have a strong global search capability while taking into account the strong global search capabilities. In this work, considering the the deficiency of WOA in local search mechanism, combined with the optimization methods of other group intelligent algorithms, perceptual perturbation mechanism is introduced, which makes the agent perform more detailed searches near the local extreme point. At the same time, since the WOA uses a logarithmic spiral curve, the agent cannot fully search all the spaces within its search range, even though the introduction of the perturbation mechanism may still lead to the algorithm falling into a local optimum. Therefore, the equal pitch Archimedes spiral curve is chosen to replace the classic logarithmic spiral curve. In order to fully verify the effect of the search path on the performance of the algorithm, several other spiral curves have been chosen for experimental comparison. By utilizing the 23 benchmark test functions, the simulation results show that WOA (PDWOA) with perceptual perturbation significantly outperforms the standard WOA. Then, based on the PDWOA, the effect of the search path on the performance of the algorithm has been verified. The simulation results show that the equal pitch of the Archimedean spiral curve is best.

AB The kinetics of cationic polymerization of epoxy resin has been studied. Due to multiple reaction exotherms and irregular baselines involved in this system, the ASTM E 698 method was chosen to determine the kinetic parameters of this epoxy/BF3-MEA system. The DER 332/BF3-MEA system follows the first order active chain end (ACE) reaction mechanism. The adding of the hydroxyl group into the system is prone to decrease the activation energy and shifts the curing into the activated monomer (AM) mechanism due to the stronger nucleophilicity of the hydroxyl group than the epoxide group. On the other hand, the DER 331/BF3-MEA system possesses lower activation energy because the DER 331 contains more hydroxyl groups-alpha-glycol and secondary alcohol. The former is the major contributor in lowering the activation energy. The hydroxyl group also can act as a chain transfer agent by retarding the propagation process, thus the reaction rate of the DER 332/BF3-MEA system is higher than the DER 331/BF3-MEA system. The DER 332/BF3-MEA system shows good correlation between the experimental data (FT-IR, DSC, and GPC) and the simulation curve based on ASTM E 698 before gelation, while a larger deviation is observed in the DER 331/BF3-MEA system. After gelation, the hydroxyl group also acts as an active site to react with residual epoxy monomers and obtain a more condense matrix. (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB Context: During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, computational agent-based models (ABMs) were extensively used to evaluate interventions to control the spread of emerging pathogens. However, evaluating different possible combinations of interventions using ABMs can be computationally very expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, most policy studies have examined the impact of a single policy decision. Objective: To apply a sequential experimental design method with an ABM to analyze policy alternatives composed of a combination of school closure and vaccination policies to provide a set of promising "optimal" combinations of policies to control an H1N1-type epidemic to policy makers. Methods: We used an open-source agent-based modeling system, FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamic), to simulate the spread of an H1N1 epidemic in Alleghany County, Pennsylvania, with a census-based synthetic population. We used an approach called best subset selection method to evaluate 72 alternative policies consisting of a combination of options for school closure threshold, closure duration, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices prioritization, and second-dose vaccination prioritization policies. Using the attack rate as a performance measure, best subset selection enabled us to eliminate inferior alternatives and identify a small group of alternative policies that could be further evaluated on the basis of other criteria. Results: Our sequential design approach to evaluate a combination of alternative mitigation policies leads to a savings in computational effort by a factor of 2 when examining combinations of school closure and vaccination policies. Conclusions: Best subset selection demonstrates a substantial reduction in the computational burden of a large-scale ABM in evaluating several alternative policies. Our method also provides policy makers with a set of promising policy combinations for further evaluation based on implementation considerations or other criteria.

AB The prefrontal cortex (PFC) contains a dense network of serotonergic [serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] axons, and endogenous 5-HT markedly modulates PFC neuronal function via several postsynaptic receptors. The therapeutic action of atypical antipsychotic drugs, acting mainly via 5-HT receptors, also suggests a role for serotonergic neurotransmission in cognitive functions. However, psychopharmacological studies have failed to find a consistent relationship between serotonergic transmission and cognitive functions of the PFC, including spatial working memory (SWM). Here, we built a computational network model to investigate 5-HT modulation of SWM in the PFC. We found that 5-HT modulates network's SWM performance nonmonotonically via 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, following an inverted U-shape. This relationship may contribute to blur the effects of serotonergic agents in previous SWM group-based behavioral studies. Our simulations also showed that errors occurring at low and high 5-HT concentrations are due to different network dynamics instabilities, suggesting that these 2 conditions can be distinguished experimentally based on their distinct dependency on experimental variables. We inferred specific predictions regarding the expected behavioral effects of serotonergic agents in 2 classic working-memory tasks. Our results underscore the relevance of identifying different error types in SWM tasks in order to reveal the association between neuromodulatory systems and SWM.

AB The development of nanomaterials as highly efficient contrast agents for tumor computed tomography (CT) imaging still remains a huge challenge. In this study, a novel and facile approach to fabricate unimolecular micelles-stablized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) without external reductant for in vitro targeted CT imaging was described. Amphiphilic 21-arm star-like polymers beta-cyclodextrin-g-{poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate)-poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate)-poly[poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate]) [beta-CD-g-(PDMA-b-PHEMA-b-PPEGMA)] was firstly synthesized and proved to form unimolecular core-middle layer-shell-type micelles in water through experimental and computer simulation results. Taking advantage of the reducing groups of PDMA block, AuNPs were decorated in the micellar PDMA block because of the in situ reduction of gold ions, which were absorbed by the PDMA chains in the core layer with a narrow nanoparticle size distribution. This strategy could prevent aggregation of AuNPs, which were capable of being employing as a highly effective probe for specific CT imaging in vitro. Importantly, the beta-CD-g-(PDMA-b-PHEMA-b-PPEGMA)/AuNPs incubated with HepG2 cells, displayed more intense X-ray attenuation property (>37%) than conventional iodine-based CT imaging agent (Omnipaque) and also possessed a satisfying cytocompatibility in the given concentration range.

AB Modulation of chromatin structure through historic acetylation/deacetylation is known to be one of the major mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression. Two opposing enzyme activities determine the acetylation state of histones: histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), respectively acetylating or deacetylating the F-amino groups of lysine residues located in the amino-terminal tails of the histones. In general, transcriptionally active chromatin is associated with hyperacetylated histones, whilst silenced chromatin is linked to hypoacetylated histones. A number of structurally divergent classes of HDAC inhibitors have been identified. They have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, terminal differentiation and/or apoptosis in various cancer cell lines and inhibit tumor growth in animals. In particular, the reversible HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (TSA) and its hydroxamate analogues can effectively and selectively induce tumor growth arrest at very low concentrations (nano- to micromolar range). They form a group of so-called promising antitumor agents of which some are currently under clinical trial. Since the selection of a molecule for further drug development requires a balance of biological potency, safety and pharmacokinetics, it is of paramount importance to elucidate the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of these HDAC inhibitors before they can be considered as potential new drugs. Primary hepatocytes and their cultures are well-differentiated in vitro models and can be used to study simultaneously the biological effects of HDAC inhibitors and their biotransformation. The present review provides a state-of-the-art Of Our current knowledge of the pharmacological and toxicological effects on proliferating cells of TSA and its hydroxamate-based structural analogues. Besides a theoretical basis, an overview of the experimental results, obtained by the authors using primary rat hepatocytes as an in vitro model, is given.

AB The understanding of shape control of colloidal nanoparticles is still rather limited even after well over a decade of intensive research efforts. While surface capping agents can greatly influence the growth habit of nanocrystals in solution, the formation of certain morphology can hardly be understood based on both experimental data and simulations. Without a good understanding of the origins for shape formation, deterministic approaches to the synthesis of nanostructures can be hard to realize. In this paper, we describe the synthesis and formation of PtAg alloy nanowires in the presence of oleylamine and oleic acid through the oriented attachment. Transmission electron microscopy study shows the formation of wormlike nanowires occurs largely at the composition around Pt50Ag50. Both Pt and Ag rich alloy nanostructures form sphere-like or faceted nanoparticles under the same reaction conditions. Density functional theory calculation is used to understand the interactions between the functional groups of capping agents and low index planes of PtAg alloys. The structural order of interfaces after collision between primary particles is obtained by molecular dynamic simulation. The results indicate that the formation of alloy nanowires is mostly driven by the interplay between the binding energy of capping agents on alloy surfaces and the diffusion of atoms at the interface upon the collision of primary nanoparticles.

AB Molecular imaging is essential to increase the sensitivity and selectivity of cancer diagnosis especially in the early stage of tumor. Here, we designed a novel multifunctional polymeric nanoparticle contrast agent (Anti-VEGF PLA-PEG-PLL-Gd NP) simultaneously modified with Gadolinium-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA) and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody to deliver Gd-DTPA to the tumor area and achieve the early diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The Anti-VEGF PLA-PEG-PLL-Gd NPs exhibited high T-1 relaxivity and no obvious cytotoxicity under the experimental concentrations in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. The results of in vitro cell uptake experiments demonstrated that the uptake process of NPs was both concentration and time depended. Compared with non-targeted NPs, the Anti-VEGF antibody modified NPs showed much higher cell uptake in the HepG2 cells. During in vivo studies, the targeted NPs showed significantly signal intensity enhancement at the tumor site (mouse hepatocarcinoma tumor, H22) compared with non-targeted NPs and Gd-DTPA injection in tumor-bearing mice and the imaging time was significantly prolonged from less than an hour (Gd-DTPA injection group) to 12 h. These results demonstrated that this novel MRI contrast agent Anti-VEGF PLA-PEG-PLL-Gd NPs showed great potential in the early diagnosis of liver tumors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Experimental investigation is carried out to determine the flowability and stickiness of the developed composite material for dental restoration containing low aspect ratio (AR <= 100) surface treated micro-sized glass fibres.
   Methods. Specimens are manufactured by mixing low AR (50/70/100) micro-sized glass fibres with two different weight fractions (5%/10%) into UDMA/TEGDMA based resin. Particulate filler composite (PFC) containing SS% glass fillers is used as the control group. Dynamic oscillatory strain sweep tests are conducted to analyse the linear viscoelastic behaviour. Solid-to fluidic transition behaviour of dental composites is also calculated in terms of flow and yield stresses. Furthermore, the oscillatory frequency sweep tests are conducted at three different strains (0.5%, 5% and 50%) resembling the positioning of unset paste onto restorations for different real-life clinical situations. Additionally, stickiness of dental composites with handling instrument (steel) and dentine covered with bonding agent is also evaluated.
   Results. The results suggested the all the FRC groups exhibited non-Newtonian, shearthinning behaviour. It is further established that inclusion of 5% of 50/70AR fibres into dental composites does not affect the flowability. Simultaneously, stickiness with dentine covered with bonding agent is more for these two compositions as compared to that of handling instrument (steel).
   Significance. This study suggest that visco-elastic properties of dental composites are greatly affected by the type of filler (spherical shaped particulate fillers or rod-shaped fibres) as well as fibre weight fraction/fibre AR. This phenomenon can be attributed to the varying interactions between micro-sized fibres of different AR/weight fraction, particulate fillers and monomers. (C) 2020 The Academy of Dental Materials.

AB Current research on pedestrian flows has mainly focused on evacuation optimization during or after emergencies; however, crowd management before emergencies has received little attention. This paper examines the management of a Safe Pedestrian Flow Rate, in which the Bayesian-Nash Equilibrium mimics pedestrians' decision-making, and a multiagent system is employed to reproduce pedestrians' interactions. In the model, the pedestrian tunnel is divided into cells, with each pedestrian in a cell receiving a utility depending on the distance to the exit and the number of pedestrians in the cell. Then, each pedestrian uses the Bayesian-Nash Equilibrium to search for the target cell with maximum expected utility, moves in, and makes next decision until exiting the tunnel. The simulation model is calibrated and validated from a real scenario. Finally, from the experimental data collected from different simulation scenarios, this research reaches the conclusion that the Safe Pedestrian Flow Rate increases by about 2.96ped/s as the tunnel width expanded by 1m. This paper offers a novel method for reducing potential losses caused by crowd emergencies and can be a valuable reference for managing pedestrian flows and designing public places.

AB The aim of the present study was to test a self-adhesive resin cement used as core build-up material in comparison to two commercially available core build-up materials.
   Forty human anterior teeth were endodontically treated and fiber post insertion (RelyX Fiber posts) and core build-ups were performed using two core build-up materials applied with an etch-and-rinse adhesive approach (Luxacore Dual-LC and Clearfil Core-CC) and an experimental self-adhesive resin cement (SAR) in two application modes (SAR Handmix and SAR Automix). Samples were subjected to thermo-mechanical loading. Margin integrity was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and maximum load capability (Fmax) was evaluated. Physical properties of the tested materials were also examined.
   Fmax was significantly affected by the core build-up material (p < 0.0005; one-way ANOVA). CC [481 (158) N] revealed significantly higher Fmax compared to LC [226 (80) N], SAR Hand [205 (115), and SAR Automix [197 (134) N] (p < 0.05; Tukey-B). The percentage of margin quality "continuous margin" in enamel after thermo-mechanical loading (TML) differed significantly among groups (p < 0.0005; Kruskal-Wallis); CC demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of margin quality "continuous margin" compared to the other groups. Physical properties were significantly affected by the different core materials (p < 0.0005; ANOVA); CC and LC demonstrated significantly higher flexural strength compared to both SAR groups as well as significantly higher water sorption of both SAR groups compared to CC and LC.
   Within the limitations of the present in vitro study, we conclude that the investigated experimental self-adhesive resin cement is not suitable as a core build-up material due to the lower maximum load capability, low margin quality, and the data of the mechanical properties.
   The investigated experimental self-adhesive resin cement cannot be recommended as a core build-up material.

AB The use of surfactants to alter the reservoir hydrocarbons affinity toward the injection fluids is an effective method to improve oil recovery for depleted reservoirs. However, the actual field applications of this technique are limited by economical complications such as the loss of surfactants in the reservoir rock pores. Reducing the adsorption of surfactants to the reservoir rock can be achieved through adding sacrificial agents to the injection slug. These sacrificial agents such as polymers can engage in a competitive behavior with surfactants for the adsorption on the reservoir rock surface. In this paper, a mathematical model that accounts for the interactive behaviors (adsorption and desorption) among multispecies nanoparticles in porous media was developed and validated by comparing with laboratory data to demonstrate its capability in solving adsorptive behaviors between surfactant and sacrificial polymers. An iterative solution associated with the presented model was verified by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method to prove its correctness in simulations. Three groups of computational experiments were designed, and four operational scenarios were analyzed for each group to compare various injection plans and investigate the effect of desorption rates of sacrificial polymers on relieving the loss of surfactant. Finally, the 1D solution was integrated into an in-house streamline simulator that indicates its compatibility to be integrated into streamline-based simulation procedures and its potential in solving for more complex 3D heterogeneous problems.

For this purpose, a static general-equilibrium model with a representative agent was used. Simulation results showed that raising alcohol taxes a certain amount is warranted. However, if one were to use conservative parameter values, this result is undermined. With an eye towards future research, more reliable estimates for several parameters are required in order to increase the policy relevance of the model.

AB Understanding behavioural dynamics in pigs is important to assess pig welfare in current intensive pig production systems. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is an approach to gain insight into behavioural dynamics in pigs, but its use in applied ethology and animal welfare science has been limited so far. We used ABM in a case study on tail biting behaviour in pigs to explore the use of ABM in gaining more insight into emergent injurious pig behaviour and related welfare issues in intensive production systems. We developed an agent-based model in Netlogo 5.1.0 to simulate tail biting behaviour of pigs housed in conventional pens in groups of 10. Pigs in the model started as neutral pigs (not involved in biting incidents), but could change into a biter, victim, or both biter and victim. Tail biting behaviour could emerge when pigs were unable to fulfil their internal motivation to explore. The effects of a redirected exploratory motivation, behavioural changes in victims and preference to bite a lying pig on tail biting patterns were tested in our model. The simulations with the agent-based model showed that coincidence in development of a redirected exploratory motivation can lead to tail biting behaviour in pigs and can explain the strong variations in incidence of tail biting behaviour observed in conventionally housed pigs. Behavioural changes in victims and preference to bite a lying pig seem to be of minor importance in the causation of tail biting patterns. The behavioural time budget of a pig might be an important factor in predisposing pigs to or preventing them from becoming a tail biter or a victim. ABM showed to be useful in analysing behavioural dynamics and welfare issues. An advantage for ABM in applied ethology is the availability of data from empirical studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study aimed to verify, in in vivo settings, whether quorum-sensing inhibition molecules could attenuate alveolar bone loss induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis/Fusobacterium nucleatum co-infection and reduce the bacterial colonization of periodontal tissues. In BALB/c mice, periodontitis was induced through oral inoculation with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum six times during a 42-d period. Quorum sensing inhibitors (a furanone compound and D-ribose) were administered simultaneously with bacterial infection. Linear and volumetric modifications of interproximal alveolar bone levels were compared between groups using micro-computed tomography. Total bacteria, and P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum DNA in periodontal tissues, were quantified using real-time PCR. Radiographic linear measurements demonstrated a significant reduction of alveolar bone loss, of approximately 40%, in mice treated with quorum sensing inhibitors when compared with the co-infection group. This was confirmed by a significant increase of residual bone volume in the test group. While total bacterial genes in the treatment group significantly decreased by 93% in periodontal tissue samples when quorum sensing inhibitors were administered, no significant differences of P. gingivalis DNA were found. Quorum sensing inhibitors reduced periodontal breakdown and bacterial infection in periodontal tissues after co-infection with P. gingivalis and F. nucleatum.

AB In this paper, the distributed finite-time formation tracking control problem with collision avoidance is investigated for multiple quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) subject to external disturbances. Firstly, two finite-time observers are designed to estimate the external disturbance force and torque without upper bound, respectively. Then, utilizing the precisely observed information deriving from the observers, a novel sliding mode surface-like variable based distributed position formation tracking control strategy and a fast terminal sliding mode based attitude tracking control strategy are proposed, respectively. It achieves that the multiple quadrotor UAVs can track the desired trajectory in a specific formation configuration within the safe distance and avoid dynamic obstacles. Meanwhile, the rapid attitude synchronization and tracking is also achieved. The entire multiple UAVs distributed formation tracking closed-loop control system are proved to be globally fast finite-time stable by using Lyapunov-like analysis. Finally, the effective and fine performance of the proposed schemes are demonstrated by a numerical simulation example with a group of quadrotor UAVs. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute.

AB Objective: A prospective randomized controlled study was performed for patients with a history of allergy to evaluate the effect of the induction of anesthesia with propofol against histamine release, skin reactions, hemodynamic changes and other clinical symptoms, while also comparing these parameters during the induction of anesthesia with midazolam-ketamine for patients with a history of allergy.
   Subjects: We examined 40 patients undergoing oral surgery, who had a history of allergy and/or the percentage of eosinophils in the leukocytes was more than 3%.
   Methods: Forty patients were randomly allocated into two groups and thus received either midazolam-ketamine (M-K group, n = 20) or fentanyl-propofol (propofol group, n = 20) for the induction of anesthesia. Venous blood samples (4 mi each) were obtained before induction as a control and at 0.5, 1, 3, 5 minutes after the administration of each induction agent, and then furthermore at 0.5, 1, 3, 5 minutes after tracheal intubation in order to measure the plasma histamine level by using the HPLC post-label system. In addition, the blood pressure and heart rate were also simultaneously recorded. Skin reactions were also evaluated by two anesthesiologists.
   Results: The incidence of 50% histamine release during the induction of anesthesia with propofol occurred in 15% of the patients with a history of allergy. Sixteen patients out of 20 (80%) showed a decrease in the systolic blood pressure after the administration of propofol without any evidence of histamine release. The incidence of 50% histamine release, skin reactions and an increase in the heart rate between the two groups were not statistically significant after the administration of each anesthetic agent. Moreover, some patients also demonstrated histamine release after tracheal intubation. Hemodynamic changes after tracheal intubation showed a similar tendency in both groups. No significant difference was observed regarding the incidence of histamine release, skin reactions and hemodynamic changes between both groups after tracheal intubation.
   Conclusions: Propofol was found to show a similar incidence of histamine release during the induction of anesthesia using midazolam-ketamine, and thus was also found to be a useful induction agent against histamine release for patients with a history of allergy when hydroxizine was used as a premedication.

AB We formulate a model in which agents embedded in an exogenous social network decide whether to adopt a new network product or not. In the theoretical part of the paper, we characterize the stochastically stable equilibria for complete networks and cycles. For an arbitrary network structure, we develop a novel graph decomposition method to characterize the set of recurrent communication states, which is a superset of stochastically stable equilibria of the adoption game presented in our model. In the simulation part, we study the contagion process of a network product in small-world networks that systematically represent social networks. We simulate a generalization of the Morris (Rev Econ Stud 67(1):57-78, 2000) Contagion model that can explain the chasm between early adopters and early majority. Our numerical analysis shows that the failure of a new network product is less likely in a highly cliquish network. In addition, the contagion process reaches to steady state faster in random networks than in highly cliquish networks. It turns out that marketers should work with mixed marketing strategies, which will result in a full contagion of a network product and faster contagion rates with a higher probability.

AB Fluoride is a strong, hard anion and cumulative toxic agent. The effect of fluoride intoxication on lipid peroxidation in endometrial tissue and the protective effects of combinations of vitamins E and C in rats were studied. Additionally, the apoptotic changes in er dometrial tissue were examined. Experimental groups were as follows: control group; a group treated with 100 mg/l fluoride (F group); and a group treated with 100 mg/l fluoride plus vitamins E and C (F + Vit group). The F and F + Vit groups were treated orally with fluoride for 30 days. Vitamins E and C were injected simultaneously at doses of 50 mg/kg day i.m. and 20 mg/kg day body weight i.p. Extensive formation of DNA strand breaks, the typical biochemical feature of apoptosis, was detected with the use of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick and labeling (TUNEL) method. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were determined in uterine tissue of rats. Fluoride caused a significant increase in NIDA levels (an important marker of lipid peroxidation) in the fluoride group compared with the controls (p < 0.05). Vitamins E and C significantly reduced the fluoride-induced lipid peroxidation in the F + Vit group compared with the F group (p < 0.05). Diffuse apoptosis in glandular epithelium and stromal cells was found in endometrial tissues of F treated rats by TUNEL method. The severity of these lesions was reduced by the administration of vitamins. From these results, it can be concluded that subchronic fluoride administration causes endometrial apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation may be a molecular mechanism involved in fluoride-induced toxicity. Furthermore, treatment with a combination of vitamins E and C reduced endometrial apoptosis caused by fluoride. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI VX Hydrolysis by Human Serum Paraoxonase 1: A Comparison of Experimental
   and Computational Results
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID TRANSITION-STATE DOCKING; ACTIVE-SITE; PREDICTION; STABILITY; PON1
AB Human Serum paraoxonase 1 (HuPON1) is an enzyme that has been shown to hydrolyze a variety of chemicals including the nerve agent VX. While wildtype HuPON1 does not exhibit sufficient activity against VX to be used as an in vivo countermeasure, it has been suggested that increasing HuPON1's organophosphorous hydrolase activity by one or two orders of magnitude would make the enzyme suitable for this purpose. The binding interaction between HuPON1 and VX has recently been modeled, but the mechanism for VX hydrolysis is still unknown. In this study, we created a transition state model for VX hydrolysis (VXts) in water using quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical simulations, and docked the transition state model to 22 experimentally characterized HuPON1 variants using AutoDock Vina. The HuPON1-VXts complexes were grouped by reaction mechanism using a novel clustering procedure. The average Vina interaction energies for different clusters were compared to the experimentally determined activities of HuPON1 variants to determine which computational procedures best predict how well HuPON1 variants will hydrolyze VX. The analysis showed that only conformations which have the attacking hydroxyl group of VXts coordinated by the sidechain oxygen of D269 have a significant correlation with experimental results. The results from this study can be used for further characterization of how HuPON1 hydrolyzes VX and design of HuPON1 variants with increased activity against VX.

AB Trichlorfon (TCF) is an antiparasitic agent used in aquaculture to treat external parasites and it belongs to the chemical class of organophosphates. This study was conducted to investigate the ameliorating effects of lycopene on TCF-induced toxicity in carp by evaluating haematological parameters and oxidant/antioxidant status. Fish were randomly divided into seven experimental groups. These groups were arranged as follows: control (no treatment) group, corn oil group, lycopene (10 mg kg(-1)) group, TCF-I (11 mg L-1) group, TCF-I (11 mg L-1) plus lycopene (10 mg kg(-1)) group, TCF-II (22 mg L-1) group and TCF-II (22 mg L-1) plus lycopene (10 mg kg(-1)) group. At the end of 14 days administration, blood and tissue (liver, kidney, and gill) samples were collected. Haematological changes [red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) count, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, haematocrit (Ht) level, and erythrocyte indices: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC)] were determined in the blood samples, while antioxidant parameters [(malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities] were evaluated in the liver, kidney and gill samples. The results demonstrated that all the haematological parameters were significantly decreased in the TCF-I and TCF-II groups when compared to the control group. Notable increases in the tissue MDA levels were observed in the TCF-treated groups. In contrast, significant decreases were observed in the tissue SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities and GSH levels in the TCF-I and TCF-II groups. However, simultaneous treatment with lycopene provided a marked normalisation of the haematological and oxidant/antioxidant parameters compared with the TCF-I and TCF-II groups. The findings show that dietary lycopene supplementation might be helpful in abrogation of TCF toxicity by changing haematological conditions and antioxidant status in fish.

AB Purpose In recent times, the idea of taking advantage of the benefits of simulation techniques and Six Sigma discipline altogether has led various organizations towards implementation of simulation tools within Six Sigma methodology. The purpose of this study is to provide a more comprehensive literature review on the topic exploring how this amalgamation could work both in theory and practice. This precisely entailed finding dependable studies that shows how Six Sigma (DMAIC) Methodology can be enhanced by the three prevalent simulation techniques; Agent-Based (AB), Discrete-Events (DE), System Dynamics (SD). Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was considered more fitting in research because it involves rigorous and well-defined approach compared to other forms of literature review. In this case, the literature was comprehensive, well-encompassing and involved finding Six Sigma and Simulations literatures from reputable scholarly databases. The outcome of these reviews was the identification of a set of key finding compiled and classified by topics. The study follows an inductive approach and utilises a meta-synthesis review technique. Findings As numerous studies assert, simulation techniques including AB, DE and SD are applicable tools in almost every stage of DMAIC, especially the Analyse, Improve and Control phases, because of their capability to test and identify potential bottlenecks and improvement areas. Findings show that the simulation tools such as CLDs, Group Model Building, Dynamic Balance Scorecards and Cost of poor quality all have the potential to add value to a Six Sigma methodology. Originality/value The findings of this study highlight the importance of further inquiry in this area of study. The finding of this study suggests that although the study on the integration of Six Sigma and simulations is increasing, empirical evidence on its effectiveness is still limited. Therefore, this study suggests more roadmaps and investigations aimed at merging Six Sigma methodology and various simulation technique. Moreover, studies that centre on hybrid or multi-method simulations within Six Sigma are also urgently necessitated.

AB This paper deals with a quasi-ecosystem by an evolutionary learning method for agents in the quasi-ecosystem. The quasi-ecosystem is composed of plant and herbivore agents, which are in a relationship of parasitism. The selfish behavior which satisfies themselves leads to extinction because resources in the environment are finite. Evolutionary computation is adopted to update feed rules of herbivore agents. Extinctions can be avoided by maintaining numerical balance between each species. The effectiveness of the proposal approach is demonstrated by computer simulations.

AB In this paper, we investigate the impact of agent personality on the complex dynamics taking place in financial markets. Leveraging recent findings, we model the artificial financial market as a complex evolving network: we consider discrete dynamics for the node state variables, which are updated at each trading session, while the edge state variables, which define a network of mutual influence, evolve continuously with time. This evolution depends on the way the agents rank their trading abilities in the network. By means of extensive numerical simulations in selected scenarios, we shed light on the role of overconfident agents in shaping the emerging network topology, thus impacting on the overall market dynamics.

AB Paclitaxel (PTX) is a microtubule-stabilizing agent that is widely used in cancer chemotherapy. This structurally complex natural product acts by binding to beta-tubulin in assembled microtubules. The 2'-hydroxyl group in the flexible side chain of PTX is an absolute requirement for activity, but its precise role in the drug-receptor interaction has not been specifically investigated. The contribution of the 2'-OH group to the affinity and tubulin-assembly efficacy of PTX has been evaluated through quantitative analysis of PTX derivatives possessing side chain deletions: 2'-deoxy-PTX, N-debenzoyl-2'-deoxy-PTX, and baccatin III. The affinity of 2'-deoicy-PTX for stabilized microtubules was more than 100-fold lower than that of PTX and only similar to 3-fold greater than the microtubule affinity of baccatin III. No microtubule binding activity was detected for the analogue N-debenzoy1-2'-deoxy-PTX. The tubulin-assembly efficacy of each ligand was consistent with the microtubule binding affinity, as was the trend in cytotoxicities. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the 2'-OH group of PTX can form a persistent hydrogen bond with D26 within the microtubule binding site. The absence of this interaction between 2'-deoxy-PTX and the receptor can account for the difference in binding free energy. Computational analyses also provide a possible explanation for why N-debenzoy1-2'-deoxy-PTX is inactive, in spite of the fact that it is essentially a substituted baccatin III. We propose that the hydrogen bonding interaction between the 2'-OH group and D26 is the most important stabilizing interaction that PTX forms with tubulin in the region of the C-13 side chain. We further hypothesize that the substituents at the 3'-position function to orient the 2'-OH group for a productive hydrogen bonding interaction with the protein.

AB Nanoshell-enhanced optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a novel technique with the potential for molecular imaging and improved disease detection. However, optimization of this approach will require a quantitative understanding of the influence of nanoshell parameters on detected OCT signals. In this study, OCT was performed at 1310 nm in water and turbid tissue-simulating phantoms to which nanoshells were added. The effect of nanoshell concentration, core diameter, and shell thickness on signal enhancement was characterized. Experimental results indicated trends that were consistent with predicted optical properties-a monotonic increase in signal intensity and attenuation with increasing shell and core size. Threshold concentrations for a 2-dB OCT signal intensity gain were determined for several nanoshell geometries. For the most highly backscattering nanoshells tested-291-nm core diameter, 25-nm shell thickness-a concentration of 10(9) nanoshells/ mL was needed to produce this signal increase. Based on these results, we discuss various practical considerations for optimizing nanoshell-enhanced OCT. Quantitative experimental data presented here will facilitate optimization of OCT-based diagnostics and may also be relevant to other reflectance-based approaches as well.

AB in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, the analgesic effect of oral lamotrigine (400 mg) on cutaneous sensitization induced with the heat/capsaicin sensitization model was compared with the effect of oral hydromorphone (8 mg) in healthy volunteers. In a separate session, intravenous remifentanil (0.10 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1)) and placebo were administered. This session was used as an additional reference comparator. Outcome measures were the areas of secondary hyperalgesia to brush and von Frey hair stimulation and the painfulness of noxious thermal stimulation in nonsensitized skin. Compared with placebo, both intravenous remifentanil and oral hydromorphone significantly suppressed secondary hyperalgesia and acute thermal nociception. Oral lamotrigine did not reduce secondary hyperalgesia or acute thermal nociception but produced side effects of severity comparable with that of oral hydromorphone. Although lamotrigine is efficacious in the management of some types of chronic neuropathic pain, the lack of effect of this agent on human experimental pain suggests that its analgesic effects depend on nerve injury-associated abnormalities, which cannot be simulated in healthy human volunteers.

AB Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a gas chromatographic method with flame ionization detection (GC-FID) for the measurement of ibuprofen, naproxen and ketoprofen for clinical toxicology purposes.
   Design and methods: 100 mu L of plasma was treated with methyl chloroformate and derivatized analytes were extracted with hexane. Optimal conditions of the derivatization procedure have been found using the experimental chemometric design (face-centered central composite design). The selectivity and efficiency of the procedure was confirmed by GC-MS.
   Results: The assay was linear in the concentration range of 10-400 mu gmL(-1), with adequate accuracy and precision for GC-FID (98-106.7%, CV <= 9.1%, respectively) and for GC-MS (99.3-105.5%, CV <= 9.2%, respectively).
   Conclusion: The entire sample preparation procedure is completed within 5 min and the quantitative results are available within 35 min. The method was successfully applied to quantify the selected compounds in serum of patients from emergency units. (C) 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Microcellular injection molding of neat isotactic polypropylene (iPP) and isotactic polypropylene/nano-calcium carbonate composites (iPP/nano-CaCO3) was performed using supercritical carbon dioxide as the physical blowing agent. The influences of filler content and operating conditions on microstructure morphology of iPP and iPP/nano-CaCO3 microcellular samples were studied systematically. The results showed the bubble size of the microcellular samples could be effectively decreased while the cell density increased for iPP/nano-CaCO3 composites, especially at high CO2 concentration and back pressure, low mold temperature and injection speed, and high filler content. Then Moldex 3D was applied to simulate the microcellular injection molding process, with the application of the measured ScCO2 solubility and diffusion data for iPP and iPP/nano-CaCO3 composites respectively. For neat iPP, the simulated bubble size and density distribution in the center section of tensile bars showed a good agreement with the experimental values. However, for iPP/nano(-)CaCO3 composites, the correction factor for nucleation activation energy F and the pre-exponential factor of nucleation rate f(0) were obtained by nonlinear regression on the experimental bubble size and density distribution. The parameters F and f(0) can be used to predict the microcellular injection molding process for iPP/nano-CaCO3 composites by Moldex 3D.

ID TRANSMIT PULSE COMPLEXES; CONTRAST AGENT DETECTION; MICROBUBBLE CONTRAST
AB The behavior of the propagation delays introduced in dual frequency band ultrasound imaging is discussed. In particular, the delay of reverberation noise components is examined. Using a delay corrected subtraction (DCS) method, it is possible to suppress the reverberation noise if the behavior of the propagation delays is known. Here, a signal adaptive estimation for the reverberation delay is introduced and applied through DCS to suppress reverberation noise in a numerically simulated signal. The reverberation reduction is compared to DCS suppression using a simpler delay estimation and shows that a signal based adaptive estimation yields a improved suppression of reverberation noise. The study indicates that the advantage of the adaptive estimation is highest when the medium has changing nonlinearity with depth. (C) 2015 Acoustical Society of America.

AB Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) foams blown with CO2 typically exhibit severe shrinkage problem and poor surface appearance, which makes them have to be prepared by using hydrocarbon as the blowing agent. In this work, we reported a facile method to prepare LDPE foams with good dimensional stability by simply controlling the linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) addition and the dissolved CO2 content. The rheological evaluation and foaming behaviors showed that the LDPE/LLDPE blend with a mass ratio of 90/10 possessed better foamability than LDPE and the blends of other mass ratio did. Moreover, the presence of 10 wt% LLDPE in LDPE matrix could not only facilitate the cell nucleation and the formation of open-cell structure, but also effectively solve the shrinkage problem of LDPE/LLDPE foams blown with CO2. The shrinkage behavior was further analyzed by numerical simulation of dimensional stability, and the simulation results agreed well with the experimental results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB Whether markets are efficient or not has been broadly discussed in the empirical literature since the efficient markets hypothesis was proposed by Fama and others in the 1960s. Unfortunately, they did not come to a consistent conclusion. Besides, while these studies show whether a specific market is efficient or not, little has been done to explore the issues regarding the degree of market inefficiency. This paper attempts to resolve the puzzle of the inconsistent conclusions in the empirical literature by adopting a bottom-up approach which takes market participants' interactions and coordination into consideration. By simulating an agent-based artificial stock market, this paper concludes with three main findings. First, agents' survivability is mainly decided by risk preference, and not forecasting accuracy. Survivors may have diverse forecasting accuracy. Second, because market prices are not decided by agents based on accurate predictions, markets can not be efficient. What may exist is only the difference of the degree of inefficiency between markets. Third, the more relevant to survivability the forecasting accuracy in a market is, the less inefficient the market will be. Therefore, this paper suggests that it may be better to view the divergent empirical results regarding market efficiency as a fact that markets are inefficient to a variety of degrees.

AB Motivation: In recent years, single-cell biology has focused on the relationship between the stochastic nature of molecular interactions and variability of cellular behavior. To describe this relationship, it is necessary to develop new computational approaches at the single-cell level.
   Results: We have developed AgentCell, a model using agent-based technology to study the relationship between stochastic intracellular processes and behavior of individual cells. As a test-bed for our approach we use bacterial chemotaxis, one of the best characterized biological systems. In this model, each bacterium is an agent equipped with its own chemotaxis network, motors and flagella. Swimming cells are free to move in a 3D environment. Digital chemotaxis assays reproduce experimental data obtained from both single cells and bacterial populations.

AB One of the most critical issues that developers face in developing automatic systems for electronic markets is that of endowing the agents with appropriate trading strategies. In this article, we examine the problem in the foreign exchange (FX) market, and we use an agent-based market simulation to examine which trading strategies lead to market states in which the stylized facts (statistical properties) of the simulation match those of the FX market transactions data. Our goal is to explore the emergence of the stylized facts, when the simulated market is populated with agents using different strategies: a variation of the zero intelligence with a constraint strategy, the zero-intelligence directional-change event strategy, and a genetic programming-based strategy. A series of experiments were conducted, and the results were compared with those of a high-frequency FX transaction data set. Our results show that the zero-intelligence directional-change event agents best reproduce and explain the properties observed in the FX market transactions data. Our study suggests that the observed stylized facts could be the result of introducing a threshold that triggers the agents to respond to periodic patterns in the price time series. The results can be used to develop decision support systems for the FX market.

AB A fundamental question that arises in the analysis of the noise-based synchronization of opinion dynamics with bounded confidence (BC) is what opinion structures can be synchronized by noise. In the standard Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, each agent examines the opinion values of all other agents and then selects neighbors who are appropriate for opinion updating in accordance with the BC scheme. In reality, however, people are more likely to exchange opinions with only a limited set of individuals, resulting in a predetermined local communication network as postulated in the DeGroot model. In this paper, we develop a new model of opinion formation that endows the heterogeneous HK dynamics with a time-varying communication topology, and we investigate its noise-induced synchronization both mathematically and numerically. We show that opinion dynamics in this model are noise-synchronizable if and only if the switching communication graph is uniformly jointly connected. Our rigorous mathematical analysis and simulation experiments demonstrate that connected discourse topology in combination with fair amounts of noise can lead to a quasi-consensus that is inducible from any initial state or any underlying system size. Our findings have profound implications for the design of future strategies of social control and global opinion optimization. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Explanation is an important capability for usable intelligent systems, including intelligent agents and cognitive models embedded within simulations and other decision support systems. Explanation facilities help users understand how and why an intelligent system possesses a given structure and set of behaviors. Prior research has resulted in a number of approaches to provide explanation capabilities and identified some significant challenges. We describe designs that can be reused to create intelligent agents capable of explaining themselves. The designs include ways to provide ontological, mechanistic, and operational explanations. These designs inscribe lessons learned from, prior research and provide guidance for incorporating explanation facilities into intelligent systems. The designs are derived from both prior research on explanation tool design and from the empirical study reported here on the questions users ask when working with an intelligent system. We demonstrate the use of these designs through examples implemented using the Herbal high-level cognitive modeling language. These designs can help build better agents-they support creating more usable and more affordable intelligent agents by encapsulating prior knowledge about how to generate explanations in concise representations that can be instantiated or adapted by agent developers.

AB Gastrointestinal (GI) nematode infection is a major constraint for grazing livestock production. The increasing prevalence and severity of anthelmintic-resistant nematodes in many parts of the world has led to a search for non- chemical control options. Under experimental conditions, the nematophagous fungus Duddingtonia flagrans is emerging as an alternative to chemotherapy for the control of GI nematode infection in biological production systems. Also, recent information points to the role of energy nutrition to increase the immune response against GI nematode infection. In this study the effect of D. flagrans and energy supplementation on the epidemiology of GI nematode infections is explored on grazing kids. Four groups of 10, 4-month old goats were turned out on infected pasture in the early spring and allocated to four separate paddocks where they were rotationally grazed for 16 weeks. One of these groups (F) received 0.5 x 10(6) D. flagrans spores/kg BW/d. Another group (S) was supplemented with 100 g barley grain per day. A third group (F+S) received both nematophagous fungi and barley supplement treatments simultaneously while the fourth group (C) was used as a non-treated control. Both nematophagous fungi and barley supplement had a significant effect (P < 0.01) on reducing pasture infectivity, faecal egg excretion and worm burdens at slaughter that was particularly evident for Trichostrongylus colubriformis. The combination of both treatments showed a synergistic effect on the control of gastrointestinal nematode infections. At slaughter, the average total post-mortem worm count of the F+S group was reduced by 65% compared with the non-treated control. The results herein show that D. flagrans can act as an efficient biological control agent against kid GI nematode infections on pasture, which could further improve carcass characteristics. While small amounts of energy supplement can also reduce kid infection, the effect of D. flagrans as a biological control agent appeared clearly enhanced both in magnitude and duration by energy supplementation. This has clear implications for grazing animals and provides an efficient method for the practical control of parasitic nematodes in biological production systems.

AB The nature of the solute species present in ethereal solutions of LiAlH4 is of crucial importance for understanding the mechanisms for the reduction of ketones and other functional groups by LiAlH4. We have employed a combination of theoretical and experimental techniques to investigate the structure of LiAlH4 in ethereal solutions. Using complexation agents, we measured the IR spectra of LiAlH4 and AlH4- in tetrahydrofuran (THF). Hybrid quantum-classical (QM-MM) simulations have also been carried out to compute the IR spectra of associated and dissociated LiAlH4 species and the free-energy profile for the dissociation process in solution. Our experimental estimate of the dissociation constant in THF is 0.021 +/- 0.002, while the predicted computational value corresponding to a model dimethyl ether solvent is 0.001. The free-energy profile shows only one minimum corresponding to a contact ion pair at a Li-Al separation distance of 3.0 angstrom. These results are consistent with the fact that LiAlH4 is essentially associated in ethereal solutions forming contact ion pairs.

AB Individuals of many quite distantly related animal species find each other attractive and stay together for long periods in groups. We present a mechanism for mixed-species grouping in which individuals from different-looking prey species come together because the appearance of the mixed-species group is visually confusing to shared predators. Using an artificial neural network model of retinotopic mapping in predators, we train networks on random projections of single- and mixed-species prey groups and then test the ability of networks to reconstruct individual prey items from mixed-species groups in a retinotopic map. Over the majority of parameter space, cryptic prey items benefit from association with conspicuous prey because this particular visual combination worsens predator targeting of cryptic individuals. However, this benefit is not mutual as conspicuous prey tends to be targeted most poorly when in same-species groups. Many real mixed-species groups show the asymmetry in willingness to initiate and maintain the relationship predicted by our study. The agreement of model predictions with published empirical work, the efficacy of our modelling approach in previous studies, and the taxonomic ubiquity of retinotopic maps indicate that we may have uncovered an important, generic selective agent in the evolution of mixed-species grouping.

AB To understand and predict the behavior of others, people regularly reason about others' beliefs, goals, and intentions. People can even use this theory of mind recursively, and form beliefs about the way others in turn reason about the beliefs, goals, and intentions of others. Although the evolutionary origins of this cognitively demanding ability are unknown, the Vygotskian intelligence hypothesis suggests that higher-order theory of mind allows individuals to cooperate more effectively. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis through the Tacit Communication Game. In this game, two agents cooperate to set up novel communication in which a Sender agent communicates the goal to the Receiver agent. By simulating interactions between agents that differ in their theory of mind abilities, we determine to what extent higher orders of theory of mind help agents to set up communication. Our results show that first-order and second-order theory of mind can allow agents to set up communication more quickly, but also that the effectiveness of higher orders of theory of mind depends on the role of the agent. Additionally, we find that in some cases, agents cooperate more effectively if they reason at lower orders of theory of mind. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper provides a foundation for decision making with bounded rationality in economic entities from the viewpoint of evolutionary theory. To this end, first, we conducted an investment test with participants to extract a behavioral learning model for activities with bounded rationality. We found that the decision-making model obtained from this behavioral science approach has characteristics that are frequently seen in the results of observations of instances of bounded rationality. Furthermore, the model presents some well-known biases in decision making, such as profit-and-loss asymmetry in risk avoidance, reference point dependence, and the asset effect. Next, using agent-based simulations, we examined whether our behavioral-learning model for activities had the capacity to become a stable strategy in a market environment where selection pressure exists. When, in response to maximum loss, a drawdown is set as an evaluation criterion for selection, the results of our simulations imply the following: 1) our decision-making model with bounded rationality has the capacity to become a stable evolutionary strategy and 2) entities with bounded rationality can survive in a competitive market. These results are antithetical to the evolutionary explanations used as a basis for rationality in traditional economics, and they indicate the possibility that many well-known biases in decision making can be derived evolutionarily from a single criterion.

AB Complex adaptive systems have historically been studied using simplifications that mandate deterministic interactions between agents or instead treat their interactions only with regard to their statistical expectation. This has led to an anticipation, even in the case of agents employing inductive reasoning in light of limited information, that such systems may have equilibria that can be predicted a priori, This hypothesis is tested here using a simulation of a simple market economy in which each agent's behavior is based on the result of an iterative evolutionary process of variation and selection applied to competing internal models of its environment. The results indicate no tendency for convergence to stability or a longterm equilibrium and highlight fundamental differences between deterministic and stochastic models of complex adaptive systems.

AB How to model the evolution of cooperation within the population is an important and interdisciplinary issue across the academia. In this paper, we propose an improved public goods game model with reputation effect on spatial lattices to investigate the evolution of cooperation regarding the allocation of public resources. In our model, we modify the individual utility or fitness as a product of the present payoff and reputation-related power function, and strategy update adopts a Fermi-like probability function during the game evolution. Meanwhile, for an interaction between a pair of partners, the reputation of a cooperative agent will be accrued beyond two units, but the defective player will decrease his reputation by one unit. Extensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations indicate the introduction of reputation will foster the formation of cooperative clusters, and greatly enhance the level of public cooperation on the spatial lattices. The larger reputation factor leads to the higher cooperation level since the reputation effect will be enormously embedded into the utility evaluation under this scenario. The current results are vastly beneficial to understand the persistence and emergence of cooperation among many natural, social and synthetic systems, and also provide some useful suggestions to devise the feasible social governance measures and modes for the public resources or affairs.

AB Here, the global and coordinate-free approach has been applied to study the leaderless attitude synchronisation problem of multiple rigid bodies with kinematic evolving on Lie group SO(3). A decentralised consensus law based on the gradient of a smooth cost function which depends on the relative attitude of neighbouring agents is proposed. The advantage of using this cost function lies in the fact that there is a relation between the Hessian matrix of this function in a consensus configuration and the Laplacian matrix of a graph. In addition, a new approach for analysing the attitude synchronisation problem was developed and proved that convergence to synchronisation can be achieved for any connected and undirected graph if the initial attitudes of neighbouring agents are sufficiently close. Using the critical points of the cost function, the effects of graph topology on synchronisation problem were investigated. The initial attitudes sets ensuring the convergence to synchronisation are obtained for the undirected tree, complete, and ring graphs. The initial set is more restrictive for ring graph owing to the existence of other critical points induced by graph topology. Eventually, using the appropriate Lyapunov function, sufficient condition that guarantees convergence to synchronisation for general connected graph was obtained, and numerical simulation carried out to illustrate the theoretical results.

AB Trading participators suffer from information disadvantage in China's resale housing market, where brokers are able to distort supply-demand information and thus mislead their clients in price negotiation. In this paper, we propose an agent-based resale model to examine how brokers' distorted market information affects the market performances. Experimental results show that brokers are truly able to influence market trade count, resale price per size, and the benefits and costs of buyers and sellers, We find that no matter what the actual market condition is, assisting sellers is always the dominating policy for rational brokers. We also find that both buyers and sellers are likely to gain more surplus from transactions if they sign an "Exclusive Right To Buy/Sell" agreement with the broker, but the sellers are less bothered by the increased trade time. Coupled with these findings, managerial implications are discussed for China's resale housing market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A heterogeneous nucleation model with inclusions of the line tension effect, the particle roughness effect, and the surface diffusion mechanism was presented. Effects of the particle roughness and the wetting agent on the heterogeneous nucleation behaviour were examined. The scaled nucleation barrier was analyzed and subsequently implications of the nucleation behaviour in the particulate abatement by vapour condensation were discussed. It was found that the effect of particle roughness on the nucleation behaviour was greatly affected by the line tension. There existed an optimal concentration of wetting agent at which the lowest nucleation barrier and critical saturation ratio could be obtained. The surface diffusion mechanism played an overwhelmingly important role in governing the embryo growth for hydrophilic particles with a diameter D-p > 0.1 mu m and an embryo size smaller than the critical size, otherwise the contribution of direct vapour deposition mechanism could be significant. Based on the scaled nucleation barrier, three distinct nucleation regimes, i.e. athermal heterogeneous nucleation, thermal heterogeneous-dominant nucleation, and homogeneous-dominant nucleation, have been identified. When the contact angle was large, the wetting agent might need to be added to reduce the contact angle so as to reach the athermal heterogeneous and thermal heterogeneous-dominant nucleation regimes, thus achieving efficient particulate abatement at low cost. The prediction results matched reasonably with the experimental data.

AB Telithromycin (TEL) is a ketolide antimicrobial agent with in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN), including macrolide resistant strains. The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of TEL against clinical SPN isolates with various genotypic mutations including the newly recognized ribosomal mutations. Pneumonia was induced in either immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice. Six isolates were included in the study and all were resistant to azithromycin (AZI) by MIC testing. Three oral regimens of TEL were chosen to simulate the human pharmacokinetic (PK) exposures observed in young healthy, healthy elderly (>= 65 years), and infected subjects. An additional group was given AZI in human simulated doses. Bacterial density in lung was determined after each treatment. Telithromycin administered simulating infected patients showed greater efficacy (i.e., change in log CFU) than the azithromycin treated group for all isolates except P1660008. The immune system was responsible for increased efficacy (ranging from 45-146%) for all but one of the telithromycin treatment regimens. Unlike other isolates studied in this in vivo model, P1660008 displayed a highly variable response to therapy, such that the reductions in CFU were not consistent with the microbiological and PK profiles of either compound. For all other isolates, the activity of AZI was comparable with untreated controls. Human simulated exposures of TEL displayed 0.5-3.4 log kill in vivo despite the ribosomal mutations studied. These data support the in vivo efficacy of TEL against a variety of genotypic resistance profiles observed in pneumococci, however, additional studies are required to fully characterize the killing profile of the compound against these recently determined ribosomal mutations.

AB In the paper we show how L-FABS can be applied in a partial knowledge learning scenario or a full knowledge learning scenario to approximate financial time series. L-FABS combines agent-based simulation with machine learning to model the behavior of financial time series.
   We also discuss why Partial Knowledge and Full Knowledge learning scenario are relevant to the modeling of financial time series and how they can be used to assess the robustness of a modeling system for financial time series. In a Partial Knowledge learning setting usually only the initial conditions of the time series are provided, while in a Full Knowledge learning scenario any value of the financial time series is exploited as soon as it is available.
   An extensive experimental analysis of L-FABS is reported under a variety of financial time series and time frames.

AB In this study, long term dextran sulphate sodium administration was studied to ascertain whether colorectal carcinoma could be produced in patients with long standing ulcerative colitis. Simultaneously, changes in the intestinal microflora were analysed. Low grade to high grade dysplasia was seen in three of the five hamsters treated with 1% dextran sulphate sodium solution for 100 days, while no dysplasia was detected in the eight animals concomitantly treated with metronidazole, an antianerobic microbial agent, which prevents colonic ulceration. In these two groups, none of the animals developed colorectal cancer over 100 day period. In a group treated for 180 days, seven of the eight animals had dysplasia, and one had two adenomas. Furthermore, four of the eight animals had adenocarcinoma in the transverse colon; they were protruding well differentiated adenocarcinoma in one and non-protruding lesions infiltrating into the musclaris propria in three. The three non-protruding infiltrating   adenocarcinomas were classified to be well differentiated adenocarcinoma in one and mucinous adenocarcinoma in two, resembling the type of cancer which complicates ulcerative colitis in man.

AB Background and Objective: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the inhibition of demineralization in an in vitro simulated caries model by different fluoride agents could be monitored nondestructively using polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PSOCT) on smooth enamel surfaces peripheral to orthodontic brackets.
   Materials and Methods: Sixty human molar samples used for this in vitro study were divided into four groups of fifteen. The groups consisted of a control, a fluoride releasing glass ionomer cement, an adhesive fluoride sealant, and fluoride in solution (2-ppm fluoride). The reflectivity from tooth surfaces was monitored using a PS-OCT system at different time points after exposure to a pH cycling demin/remin model at 3-day intervals for 15 days. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) was used to examine lesion depth after day 15.
   Results: PS-OCT was effective at measuring significant differences in the integrated reflectivity in depth between the control and fluoride groups (P < 0.001). The fluoride sealant demonstrated a greater protective effect than the fluoride in solution and the glass ionomer cement.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that PS-OCT is well suited for the nondestructive assessment of caries inhibition by anti-caries agents.

AB Background: As the main metabolites of ginsenosides, 20(S, R)-protopanaxadiol [PPD(S, R)] and 20(S, R)-protopanaxatriol [PPT(S, R)] are the structural basis response to a series of pharmacological effects of their parent components. Although the estrogenicity of several ginsenosides has been confirmed, however, the underlying mechanisms of their estrogenic effects are still largely unclear. In this work, PPD(S, R) and PPT(S, R) were assessed for their ability to bind and activate human estrogen receptor alpha (hER alpha) by a combination of in vitro and in silico analysis.
   Methods: The recombinant hERa ligand-binding domain (hER alpha-LBD) was expressed in E. coli strain. The direct binding interactions of ginsenosides with hER alpha-LBD and their ERa agonistic potency were investigated by fluorescence polarization and reporter gene assays, respectively. Then, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to simulate the binding modes between ginsenosides and hER alpha-LBD to reveal the structural basis for their agonist activities toward receptor.
   Results: Fluorescence polarization assay revealed that PPD(S, R) and PPT(S, R) could bind to hER alpha-LBD with moderate affinities. In the dual luciferase reporter assay using transiently transfected MCF-7 cells, PPD(S, R) and PPT(S, R) acted as agonists of hER alpha. Molecular docking results showed that these ginsenosides adopted an agonist conformation in the flexible hydrophobic ligand-binding pocket. The stereostructure of C-20 hydroxyl group and the presence of C-6 hydroxyl group exerted significant influence on the hydrogen bond network and steric hindrance, respectively.
   Conclusion: This work may provide insight into the chemical and pharmacological screening of novel therapeutic agents from ginsenosides. (C) 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

We examine the factors controlling the shape of the hairy vesicle, and report the shape to change with molecular stiffness, and dissimilarity in the hydrocarbon tail groups, along With the relative concentration of the species, and the functional group length. We also draw correspondence with experimental studies on the shape transformations of the hairy vesicles through phase diagrams of the reduced volume, the ratio of the minimum and maximum radii, and the interfacial line tension, as a function of the concentration of the hairy lipids and the hydrocarbon tail molecular chain stiffness. Results from our investigations can be used for the design and prediction of novel hybrid soft materials for applications in the encapsulation and delivery of therapeutic agents.

AB A multiscale simulation method is newly developed to investigate the competition and interplay between diffusion and crosslink reactions during the formation process of interphase in carbon fiber/epoxy composite. The simulations are conducted by using fully-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD), coarse-grained dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) and Monte Carlo-like polymerizing models in combination. The distributions of each component molecules and functional groups are predicted as function of time and of distance from the fiber surface, respectively. The concentration profiles indicate a gradient transition region in vicinity of the carbon fiber. The profiles of the unreacted functional groups demonstrate that, nearby the fiber surface, the amount of hardener agent is chemically inadequate to react with epoxide from the resin and the sizing. Therefore, the crosslink density within the interphase transition zone is much lower than that in the matrix bulk. Accordingly, width of the interphase region is estimated, and is consistent with the experimental result. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In frequency-dependent games, strategy choice may be innate or learned. While experimental evidence in the producer-scrounger game suggests that learned strategy choice may be common, a recent theoretical analysis demonstrated that learning by only some individuals prevents learning from evolving in others. Here, however, we model learning explicitly, and demonstrate that learning can easily evolve in the whole population. We used an agent-based evolutionary simulation of the producer-scrounger game to test the success of two general learning rules for strategy choice. We found that learning was eventually acquired by all individuals under a sufficient degree of environmental fluctuation, and when players were phenotypically asymmetric. In the absence of sufficient environmental change or phenotypic asymmetries, the correct target for learning seems to be confounded by game dynamics, and innate strategy choice is likely to be fixed in the population. The results demonstrate that under biologically plausible conditions, learning can easily evolve in the whole population and that phenotypic asymmetry is important for the evolution of learned strategy choice, especially in a stable or mildly changing environment.

SO INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH

ID SURFACE-ACTIVE AGENTS; MASS-TRANSFER; DROPS
AB In the presence of surface-active reagents, the flux of mass transfer into/from the droplets drastically decreases within the liquid-liquid extraction units. Therefore, particular design equations are required to incorporate the presence of contaminants in the design of industrial-scale extraction columns: In the combinatorial model of Slater, the mass-transfer coefficients for the continuous and dispersed phases are corrected with the aid of a contamination factor. However, since the latter factor in the Slater model is originally obtained from the experimental data, the Slater model is unable to predict the behavior of an extraction system where the experimental data are not available. In this research, the model of Slater, i.e., single-drop single-solvent model, was employed to simulate the experimental data of a water-acetone-toluene system in the presence of three surface-active reagents, i.e., SDS, Triton X-100, and DTMAC. These components exhibit anionic, cationic, and nonionic surfactants, respectively. The experimental data provided by Saien et al. for both directions of the mass transfer, i.e., continuous to dispersed phases and vice versa, were employed. Based on the experimental data along with the theoretical principles, an empirical model for the contamination factor was developed. The provided model predicts the mass-transfer coefficients within 4% of certainty only through the physical properties data of the phases, independent of the surfactant type. Two different mechanisms for the mass transfer within the liquid droplets, depending on the size of the droplets, have been recognized. Simulation of the extraction system by the aid of the present model, along with the combinatorial model of Slater and the terminal velocity model of Grace, predicts the experimental results satisfactorily.

TI Compliance signaling games: toward modeling the deterrence of insider

SO COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL ORGANIZATION THEORY

DE Compliance; Signaling game; Evolutionary games; Agent based models
ID EVOLUTION
AB In a typical workplace, organizational policies and their compliance requirements set the stage upon which the behavioral patterns of individual agents evolve. The agents' personal utilities, access to information, and strategic deceptions shape the signaling systems of an intricate information-asymmetric game, thus mystifying assessment and management of organizational risks, which are primarily due to unintentional insider threats. Compliance games, as discussed here, model a rudimentary version of this signaling game between a sender (employee) and a receiver (organization). The analysis of these games' equilibria as well as their dynamics in repeated game settings illuminate the effectiveness or risks of an organizational policy. These questions are explored via a repeated and agent-based simulation of compliance signaling games, leading to the following: (1) a simple but broadly applicable model for interactions between sender agents (employees) and receiver agents (principals in the organization), (2) an investigation of how the game theoretic approach yields the plausible dynamics of compliance, and (3) design of experiments to estimate parameters of the systems: evolutionary learning rates of agents, the efficacy of auditing using a trembling hand strategy, effects of non-stationary and multiple principal agents, and ultimately, the robustness of the system under perturbation of various related parameters (costs, penalties, benefits, etc.). The paper concludes with a number of empirical studies, illustrating a battery of compliance games under varying environments designed to investigate agent based learning, system control, and optimization. The studies indicate how agents through limited interactions described by behavior traces may learn and optimize responses to a stationary defense, expose sensitive parameters and emergent properties and indicate the possibility of controlling interventions which actuate game parameters. We believe that the work is of practical importance-for example, in constraining the vulnerability surfaces arising from compliance games.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a surgical delay procedure and a combined surgical and chemical delay procedure on the survival of arterialized venous flaps.
   Experimental groups included (1) a control group, (2) a surgical delay (4-day and 7-day delay) group, and (3) a combined surgical and chemical (doxazosin mesylate, nitroglycerine patch) delay group. These groups were further divided into subgroups (n = 10) depending on the delay period and the chemical agents. An arterialized venous flap was created on one ear of each rabbit. In the arterialized venous flap, arterial inflow was provided by anastomosis of the central auricular artery to the anterior branch of the central auricular vein and a venous outflow through the anterior marginal vein.
   In the control group, the arterialized venous flaps without any delay procedure shelved complete necrosis of all flaps, in the surgical delay group, the mean percentage survival of arterialized venous flaps was 36.6 percent in the 4-day delay group and,59.7 percent in the 7-day delay group. In the combined surgical and chemical delay group a S-day chemical delay followed by a 4-day: simultaneous surgical and chemical delay resulted in mean percentage survival of the arterialized venous flaps of 81.1 percent in the doxazosin mesylate group, 72.8 percent in the nitroglycerine patch group, and 92.9 percent in a combination group of doxazosin mesylate and nitroglycerine patch. A 3-day chemical delay followed by a ii-day simultaneous surgical and chemical delay resulted in mean percentage survival of the arterialized venous flaps of 94 percent in the doxazosin mesylate group, 90.2 percent in the nitroglycerine patch group, and 99 percent ill a combination group of doxazosin mesylate and nitroglycerine patch.
   In conclusion, the surgical delay procedure increased the percentage survival of the arterialized venous flaps in proportion to the delay period. The combination group of surgical and chemical delay procedures had a significantly greater percentage survival than that of the surgical delay group (p < 0.001), and the delay period could be shortened.

AB Foresee traffic conditions and demand is a major issue nowadays that is very often approached using simulation tools. The aim of this work is to propose an innovative strategy to tackle such problem, relying on the presentation and analysis of a behavioural dynamic traffic assignment.
   The proposal relies on the assumption that travellers take routing policies rather than paths, leading us to introduce the possibility for each simulated agent to apply, in real time, a strategy allowing him to possibly re-route his path depending on the perceived local traffic conditions, jam and/or time already spent in his journey.
   The re-routing process allows the agents to directly react to any change in the road network. For the sake of simplicity, the agents' strategy is modelled with a simple neural network whose parameters are determined during a preliminary training stage. The inputs of such neural network read the local information about the route network and the output gives the action to undertake: stay on the same path or modify it. As the agents use only local information, the overall network topology does not really matter, thus the strategy is able to cope with large and not previously explored networks.
   Numerical experiments are performed on various scenarios containing different proportions of trained strategic agents, agents with random strategies and non strategic agents, to test the robustness and adaptability to new environments and varying network conditions. The methodology is also compared against existing approaches and real world data. The outcome of the experiments suggest that this work-in-progress already produces encouraging results in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. This indicates that the proposed approach has the potential to provide better tools to investigate and forecast drivers' choice behaviours. Eventually these tools can improve the delivery and efficiency of traffic information to the drivers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present a method for inferring the topology of a sensor network given nondiscriminating observations of activity in the monitored region. This is accomplished based on no prior knowledge of the relative locations of the sensors and weak assumptions regarding environmental conditions. Our approach employs a two-level reasoning system made up of a stochastic expectation maximization algorithm and a higher level search strategy employing the principle of Occam's Razor to look for the simplest solution explaining the data. The result of the algorithm is a Markov model describing the behavior of agents in the system and the underlying traffic patterns. Numerical simulations and experimental assessment conducted on a real sensor network suggest that the technique could have promising real-world applications in the area of sensor network self-configuration.

AB The present work introduces an empirically ground agent-based modeling (ABM) framework to assess the spatial and temporal diffusion of rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems on existing buildings of a city district. The overall ABM framework takes into account social, technical, environmental, and economic aspects to evaluate the diffusion of PV technology in the urban context. A city district that includes 18 720 households distributed over 1 290 building blocks and a surface area of 2.47 km2 is used to test the proposed ABM framework. Results show how the underlying regulatory framework (i.e., the rules of the internal electricity market) influences the pattern and intensity of adoption, thus realizing different shares of the available potential. Policies that support the establishment of 'prosumers' within Condominiums (i.e., energy community buildings), and not in single-family houses only, is key to yield high diffusion rates. The installed capacity increases by 80% by switching from the one-to-one configuration to the one-to-many paradigm, i.e., from 5.90 MW of rooftop PV installed on single-family households and/or single PV owners to 10.64 MW in energy community buildings. Moreover, the possibility to spread the auto-generated solar electricity over the load profile of the entire population of Condominium results in self-consumption rates greater than 50% and self-sufficiency ratios above 20% for the majority of the simulated buildings.

AB Disaster risk management, and post-disaster recovery (PDR) in particular, become increasingly important to assure resilient development. Yet, PDR is the most poorly understood phase of the disaster management cycle and can take years or even decades. The physical aspects of the recovery are relatively easy to monitor and evaluate using, e.g. geospatial remote sensing data compared to functional assessments that include social and economic processes. Therefore, there is a need to explore the impacts of different dimensions of the recovery, including individual behaviour and their interactions with socio-economic institutions. In this study, we develop an agent-based model to simulate and explore the PDR process in urban areas of Tacloban, the Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Formal and informal (slum) sector households are differentiated in the model to explore their resilience and different recovery patterns. Machine learning-derived land use maps are extracted from remote sensing images for pre- and post-disaster and are used to provide information on physical recovery. We use the empirical model to evaluate two realistic policy scenarios: the construction of relocation sites after a disaster and the investments in improving employment options. We find that the speed of the recovery of the slum dwellers is higher than formal sector households due to the quick reconstruction of slums and the availability of low-income jobs in the first months after the disaster. Finally, the results reveal that the households' commuting distance to their workplaces is one of the critical factors in households' decision to relocate after a disaster.

AB This paper describes the results of simulation experiments performed on a suits of learning algorithms. We focus on games in network contexts. These are contexts in which (1) agents have very limited information about the game and (2) play can be extremely asynchronous. There are many proposed learning algorithms in the literature. We choose a small sampling of such algorithms and use numerical simulation to explore the nature of asymptotic play. In particular, we explore the extent to which the asymptotic play depends on three factors: limited information, asynchronous play, and the degree of responsiveness of the learning algorithm.

AB Investors' expectations are highly influenced by their surroundings' opinions, especially from those who are believed as gurus. These opinion leaders (i.e., gurus) may manipulate the information when the information is disseminated to their followers. It is unclear whether herding behaviors will still emerge in this situation and if so, how these behaviors would influence the market volatility. In this paper, we model agents who choose either to follow the gurus with different precisions of information, or to be a chartist based on evolutionary considerations. Numerical simulations show that increasing the quality of gurus' private information would lead to more intensive herding behavior of followers and produce a U-shaped effect on the market volatility. Besides, increasing the proportion of gurus in the market would lead to more intensive herding but would decrease the market volatility. Interestingly, the market environment also affects investors' choices. Investors are more willing to herd on gurus in boom times or in depression. This paper sheds light on how informed gurus affect investors' behavior and market volatility through direct communication.

AB Despite the relevance of collaborative problem solving (CPS), there are limited empirical results on the assessment of CPS. In 2015, the large-scale Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) first assessed CPS with virtual tasks requiring participants to collaborate with computer-simulated agents (human-to-agent; HA). The approach created dynamic CPS situations while standardizing assessment conditions across participating countries. However, H-A approaches are sometimes regarded as poor substitutes for natural collaboration, and only a few studies have identified if the collaborations with agents capture real dynamics of human interactions. To address this, we validated the original PISA 2015 CPS assessment by investigating the effects of replacing computer agents with real students in classroom tests (human-to-human; H-H). We obtained the original PISA 2015 CPS tasks from the OECD and replaced agents with real students to provide more real-life collaboration environments with less control over conversations; the H-H was less constrained than the H-A but still limited by predefined sets of possible answers from which the humans' would make selections. The interface remained nearly identical to the original PISA 2015 CPS assessment. Students were told the types of collaboration partners, namely humans versus agents. We applied structural equation modeling and multivariate analyses of variance to a sample of 386 students to identify the dimensionality of the CPS construct and compared the effects in CPS performance accuracy and number of behavioral actions. Results indicated no significant differences between type of collaboration partner. However, students performed a larger number of actions when collaborating with a human agent.

ID MODEL; DIFFUSION; NETWORKS
AB Agent-based models have improved the standards for empirical support and validation criteria in social, biological, cognitive and human sciences. Yet, the inclusion, in these models, of vertical interactions between various aggregation levels remains a challenge. We study analytically, numerically and by simulation the generic consequences of interactions between the collective and its individual components:
   the appearance of an autocatalytic loop between the dynamics of the collective and its components;
   the system, which is dominated by a limited number of factors amplified by this collective <-> individuals autocatalytic loop;
   the microscopic features, which are not involved in the autocatalytic loop and are irrelevant at the systemic level; and
   how the above clarify the interplay between macroscopic predictable features and the ones dependent on random unpredictable individual events.
   Using the social and market percolation framework, we study the dramatic effects of the collective <-> individuals autocatalytic loop on economic crisis propagation:
   the percolation transition becomes discontinuous;
   there are a few relevant regions and regimes corresponding to a quite diverse range of response policy options;
   there are stability ranges where appropriate policies can help to avoid macroscopic crisis percolation; and
   beyond those regions the systemic crisis might become unstoppable.

AB In this paper we study the cooperative behavior of agents playing the Prisoner's Dilemma game in random scale-free networks. We show that the survival of cooperation is enhanced with respect to random homogeneous graphs but, on the other hand, decreases when compared to that found in Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks. We show that the latter decrease is related to the structure of cooperation. Additionally, we present a mean field approximation for studying evolutionary dynamics in networks with no degree-degree correlations and with arbitrary degree distribution. The mean field approach is similar to the one used for describing the disease spreading in complex networks, making a further compartmentalization of the strategists partition into degree-classes. We show that this kind of approximation is suitable to describe the behavior of the system for a particular set of initial conditions, such as the placement of cooperators in the higher-degree classes, while it fails to reproduce the level of cooperation observed in the numerical simulations for arbitrary initial configurations.

AB Ion mobility and molecular modeling methods were used to examine the gas-phase conformational properties of POSS (polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes) siloxane oligomers. MALDI generated the sodiated dimers (Cy7T8)(2)O center dot Na+ and (Cp7T8)(2)O center dot Na+ and the trimer ion [Cy7T8O-Cy8Si8O11-OCy7T8] Na+ (T = SiO1.5, Cy = cyclohexyl, and Cp = cyclopentyl); their collision cross sections were measured in helium using ion mobility based methods. Experimental results are consistent with one observed conformer for each of the dimers and the exo-exo isomer for the trimer (formed by retention of configuration at silicon during synthesis). For the cyclopentyl dimer, theory predicts two separate conformer families based on whether the substituents on the POSS cages are staggered (sigma(calc) = 357 angstrom(2)) or eclipsed (sigma(calc) = 365 angstrom(2)); experiment fits the staggered conformation best (sigma(expt) = 355 angstrom(2)). For the cyclohexyl dimer, on the other hand, folding of the Cy groups seems to be important: (sigma(calc) = 402 angstrom(2) vs unfolded sigma(calc) = 421 angstrom(2) or partially folded sigma(calc) = 407 angstrom(2)). Similar to the Cy dimer, for the trimer theory indicates that a low-energy exo-exo family of structures fits the experimental cross section (sigma(expt) = 557 angstrom(2)) only if several Cy groups are folded (sigma(calc) = 557 angstrom(2)) as compared to unfolded structures (average sigma(calc) = 570 angstrom(2)). Modeling shows the nonbonded interactions of the capping Cp and Cy groups stabilize POSS cage packing leading to compact structures being lowest in energy. Modeling also suggests that two POSS cages bonded together by a single oxygen atom gives a benchmark 8.3-8.5 angstrom cage-cage center distance which may be used to evaluate cage packing in other POSS oligomers. X-ray crystal structures at 100 and 298 K for (Cy7T8)(2)O were carried out which show that solid state cage-cage intermolecular distances are perfectly consistent with the modeled POSS-PMA dimer and trimer structures. At room temperature there is considerable unresolved disorder of the cyclohexyl R groups in the X-ray structure due to rapid boat-chair interconversion.

AB To further clarify the interaction between opioid and dopaminergic systems, the effects of simultaneous administration of morphine hydrochloride (1.25 or 2.5 mg/kg) and haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) on aggressive behavior of male mice were explored. Isolated male mice (experimental animals)were confronted in a neutral area with anosmic, group-housed conspecifics (standard opponents) 30 min after injection of both compounds, and aggression was evaluated by estimation of times allocated to II different behavioral categories. In the first experiment (which functioned as a pilot study), the two doses of morphine were explored. In the second one, incorporating a more complete experimental design, only the lowest morphine dose was used and the animals were preselected by a previous aggression test. In attack behavior, morphine added to haloperidol counteracted, at least partially, the antiaggressive effect of the neuroleptic. In contrast, the impairing effects of haloperidol on motor activity were increased by the addition of morphine. These results show that the behavioral effects of dopaminergic antagonists are modulated by opioid influences and that opiates and dopaminergic agents interact in a different manner on motor and on aggressive behaviors.

It is shown asymptotically and numerically how the chemical inhibits the invasion of a moving front for the second species and how stable steady states, which depend on the chemical concentration, can be reached. The results qualitatively explain experimental observations by Swain and Ray [1] showing that colonies of bacteria produce metabolite agents which prevent the invasion of fungi.

AB Purpose - The securities transaction tax (STT) has been theoretically considered as an important regulation device for decades. However, its role and effectiveness in financial markets is still not well understood both theoretically and empirically. By use of agent-based modeling method, the purpose of this paper is to present a new artificial stock market model with self-adaptive agents, which allows the assessment of the impacts from various levels of STTs in distinctive market environments and thus a comprehensive understanding of the effects of STTs is achieved.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the model, agents are allowed to employ the strategies used by the following five types of investors: contrarians, random traders, momentum traders, fundamentalists and exit strategy holders. Specifically, the authors start with the investigation of the dynamics of a tax free benchmark market; then the patterns of market behaviors and the behaviors of various types of investors are discussed with different levels of STTs in markets with mild and high fluctuations.
   Findings - The simulation results consistently show that a moderate transaction tax does contribute to market stabilization in terms of reducing market volatility while with a price of mild decrease of market efficiency and liquidity. The findings suggest that a balance between market stability and efficiency could be reached if regulatory authorities introduce STTs to markets discreetly.
   Originality/value - This paper enriches the comprehensive understanding of the effects of STT, and gives good explanation about the controversy between Tobin's proponents and anti-Tobin group.

AB Purpose To investigate the influence of food-simulating agents on the shear bond strength between direct hard liners and denture base acrylic resin. In addition, mode of failure was evaluated. Materials and Methods One hundred fifty cylindrical columns of denture base resin were fabricated and bonded to three types of hard reline materials (Hard GC Reline, Tokuyama Rebase II Fast, TDV Cold Liner Rebase). Specimens of each reline material were divided into five groups (n = 10) to undergo 12-day immersion in distilled water, 0.02 N citric acid aqueous solution, heptane, and 40% ethanol/water solution at 37 degrees C. The control group was not immersed in any solution. The shear bond strength test was performed, and the failure mode was determined. Statistics were analyzed with two-way ANOVA and chi-square test (alpha = 0.05). Results Significant interaction was found between the hard liners and food simulating agents (p < 0.001). The shear bond strength of Tokuyama in 40% ethanol and TDV in heptane decreased significantly (p = 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively); however, none of the solutions could significantly affect the shear bond strength of Hard GC Reline (p = 0.208). The mixed failure mode occurred more frequently in Hard GC Reline compared with the other liners (p < 0.001) and was predominant in specimens with higher bond strength values (p = 0.012). Conclusions Food simulating agents did not adversely affect the shear bond strength of Hard GC Reline; however, ethanol and heptane decreased the bond strength of Tokuyama and TDV, respectively. These findings may provide support to dentists to recommend restricted consumption of some foods and beverages for patients who have to use dentures relined with certain hard liners.

AB The variability in Southern California's marine climate is dominated by the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, with cycling between El Nino events (characterized by warm water, low productivity, and frequent storms) and La Nina events (which exhibit the opposite conditions). Relative to the mainland and other Channel Islands, San Miguel Island (SMI) consistently maintains cooler water temperatures and supports significant populations of red abalone Haliotis rufescens, presumably owing to increased food production and diminished expression of the bacterial disease known as withering syndrome. We conducted a laboratory experiment to examine the effects of La Nina and El Nino conditions on the health and survival of red abalone from SMI. Six replicate tanks per treatment, each containing six abalone, were subjected to one of the following three temperature regimes (treatments): Bodega Bay, California ambient (AMB; mean, 11.4 degrees C), SMI La Nina regime (LAN; mean, 13.8 degrees C), and SMI El Nino regime (ELN; mean, 16.5 degrees C). After 328 d, survival in the ELN treatment was significantly lower than in the AMB and LAN groups. A body condition index was significantly lower in the ELN group than in the AMB group, and the LAN group was in between. A visual score of body shrinkage was significantly higher in both the LAN and ELN groups than in the AMB group. Other clinical signs of withering syndrome and the prevalence and infection intensity of the causative agent, Candidatus Xenohaliotis californiensis, increased as temperature increased in the three treatment groups from AMB to LAN to ELN, although the differences were not statistically significant. Generally, we found that increased temperature resulted in elevated disease expression, although less than observed in previous studies that used farmed abalone and higher, less variable temperature regimes. Water temperature modulates the effect of withering syndrome in wild red abalone, and very strong El Nino events are predicted to result in significant mortality at San Miguel Island.

AB After the onset of myocardial infarction, extensive coronary thrombus and oxygen supply insufficiency lead to severe myocardial damage and heart failure. Recently, ultrasound-irradiated phase-change nanoparticles have been recognized for their cardiovascular thrombolysis potential. Therefore, we sought to establish a novel treatment method using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/perfluoropentane (PFP) phase-change nanoparticles with low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) for the simulation of acute coronary thrombolysis and myocardial preservation. There were three groups in our study: Group A consisted of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as the blank control, group B consisted of SonoVue microbubbles and group C consisted of H2O2/PFP phase-change nanoparticles. The H2O2/PFP phase-change nanoparticles were prepared using a double-emulsification process. The in vitro experiments were conducted in an artificial circulatory system connected to an LIFU system and dissolved oxygen detector. Thrombolysis efficiency and oxygen release efficiency were compared among the groups. H2O2/PFP nanoparticles with 3% H2O2 (average size: 456.7 +/- 31.2 nm, charge: -37.5 +/- 5.22 mV) was the optimal selection in group C because of the stable loading capacity and stable low-dose oxygen release efficiency in the in vitro experiments. Thrombolytic weight loss and loss rates in group C (322.0 +/- 40.8 mg, 54.8 +/- 5.7%) were significantly higher than those in group A (36.2 +/- 18.1 mg, 5.5 +/- 2.5%) and group B (91.0 +/- 11.9 mg, 14.3 +/- 2.4%) (p < 0.01). The innovative method using H2O2/PFP phase-change nanoparticles with LIFU exhibited high thrombolytic efficiency and stable low-flow oxygen supply in the artificial circulatory system, providing a solid experimental foundation for the establishment of a novel treatment method for acute myocardial infarction.

AB Collective behavior, and swarm formation in particular, has been studied from several perspectives within a large variety of fields, ranging from biology to physics. In this work, we apply Projective Simulation to model each individual as an artificial learning agent that interacts with its neighbors and surroundings in order to make decisions and learn from them. Within a reinforcement learning framework, we discuss one-dimensional learning scenarios where agents need to get to food resources to be rewarded. We observe how different types of collective motion emerge depending on the distance the agents need to travel to reach the resources. For instance, strongly aligned swarms emerge when the food source is placed far away from the region where agents are situated initially. In addition, we study the properties of the individual trajectories that occur within the different types of emergent collective dynamics. Agents trained to find distant resources exhibit individual trajectories that are in most cases best fit by composite correlated random walks with features that resemble Levy walks. This composite motion emerges from the collective behavior developed under the specific foraging selection pressures. On the other hand, agents trained to reach nearby resources predominantly exhibit Brownian trajectories.

AB Empirical studies have pointed out that monetary policy may significantly affect income and wealth inequality. To investigate the distributive properties of monetary policy the authors resort to an agent-based macroeconomic model where firms, households and one bank interact on the basis of limited information and adaptive rules-of-thumb. Simulations show that the model can replicate fairly well a number of stylized facts, especially those relative to the business cycle. The authors address the issue using three types of computational experiments, including a global sensitivity analysis carried out through a novel methodology which greatly reduces the computational burden of simulations. The result emerges that a more restrictive monetary policy increases inequality, even though this effect may differ across groups of households. In addition, it appears to be attenuated if the bank's willingness to lend is lower. The overall analysis suggests that inequality can constitute valuable information also for central banks.

AB We study risk-taking behavior in a simple two person tournament in a theoretical model as well as a laboratory experiment. First, a model is analyzed in which two agents simultaneously decide between a risky and a safe strategy and we allow for all possible degrees of correlation between the outcomes of the risky strategies. We show that risk-taking behavior crucially depends on this correlation as well as on the size of a potential lead of one of the contestants. We find that the experimental subjects acted mostly quite well in line with the derived theoretical predictions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Behavior of polymer at different pH (1-10) at 28 degrees C was studied. Also interactions with collagen were ascertained in order to understand the polymers' response towards secondary structures of collagen. Leather made using the experimental syntan demonstrated higher temperature resistance of 3 +/- 0.5 degrees C compared to control syntan treated leathers (1 +/- 0.5 degrees C) when exposed to heat under artificial simulation. Experimental leathers exhibited better strength and organoleptic properties. These smart leathers find its application in extreme climatic conditions of heat or cold.

AB Electrostatics and hydrodynamics in the fluidized bed are mutually affected, and excess accumulation of electrostatic charges has a severe impact on hydrodynamics. However, there is a serious lack of experimental investigation of electrostatic effect on hydrodynamics. This work provides a first insight into the electrostatic effects on bubble behaviors experimentally by injecting a trace of liquid antistatic agents (LAA) into a fluidized bed. Different amounts of LAA (0-50 ppm) were injected to make the electrostatic charges vary in a wide range and the bubble behaviors were investigated simultaneously. Results showed that the charges on particles decreased with increasing amount of LAA, which resulted in larger bubble sizes, stronger fluctuations of dynamic bed height, and less wall sheeting, respectively. The maximum reduction ratio of bubble sizes due to electrostatic effect was 21%. When particles were charged, the bubble sizes were significantly smaller than those estimated from the classical correlation. This discrepancy was attributed to the neglect of electrostatic effect in classical correlation. (C) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

TI Informal risk-sharing between smallholders may be threatened by formal
   insurance: Lessons from a stylized agent-based model
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
AB Microinsurance is promoted as a valuable instrument for low-income households to buffer financial losses due to health or climate-related risks. However, apart from direct positive effects, such formal insurance schemes can have unintended side effects when insured households lower their contribution to traditional informal arrangements where risk is shared through private monetary support. Using a stylized agent-based model, we assess impacts of microinsurance on the resilience of those smallholders in a social network who cannot afford this financial instrument. We explicitly include the decision behavior regarding informal transfers. We find that the introduction of formal insurance can have negative side effects even if insured households are willing to contribute to informal risk arrangements. However, when many households are simultaneously affected by a shock, e.g. by droughts or floods, formal insurance is a valuable addition to informal risk-sharing. By explicitly taking into account long-term effects of short-term transfer decisions, our study allows to complement existing empirical research. The model results underline that new insurance programs have to be developed in close alignment with established risk-coping instruments. Only then can they be effective without weakening functioning aspects of informal risk management, which could lead to increased poverty.

AB This paper investigates the dynamic coverage control problem for a group of agents with unknown density function. A cost function, depending on a certain metric and the density function, is defined to describe the performance of coverage network. Since the optimal deployment of agents is closely depending on the density function, we employ the Bayesian prediction approaches to estimate the density function. Moreover, a novel coverage-control-customized algorithm is proposed to acquire the Bayesian parameters. The merits of this Bayesian-based spatial estimation algorithm are the consideration of measurement noise and the capability of dealing time-varying density function. However, the estimated density function from Bayesian framework follows normal distribution, which leads the cost function to a stochastic process. To deal with this type of cost function, a discrete control scheme is proposed to steer the agents approaching to a near-optimal deployment. The mean-square stability of the proposed coverage system is further analyzed. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

AB The influenza A (H5N1) virus attracts a worldwide attention and calls for the urgent development of novel antiviral drugs. In this study, explicitly solvated flexible docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to study the interactions between the H5N1 sub-type hemagglutinin (HA) and various catechin compounds, including EC ([-]-epicatechin), EGC ([-]-epigallocatechin), ECG ([-]-epicatechin gallate) and EGCG ([-]-epigallocatechin gallate). The four compounds have respective binding specificities and their interaction energies with HA decrease in the order of EGCG (-133.52) > ECG (-111.11) > EGC (- 97.94) > EC (-83.39). Units in kcal mol(-1). Residues IleA267, LysA269, ArgB68 and GluB78 play important roles during all the binding processes. EGCG has the best bioactivity and shows potential as a lead compound. Besides, the importance was clarified for the functional groups it was revealed that the C5' hydroxyl and trihydroxybenzoic acid groups are crucial for the catechin inhibitory activities, especially the latter. Combined with the structural and property analyses, this work also proposed the way to effectively modify the functional groups of EGCG. The experimental efforts are expected in order to actualize the catechin derivatives as novel anti-influenza agents in the near future.

AB Fire hazards are a big threat to human life and property safety. The U.S. fire statistics reveal that, in 2017 alone, 1,319,500 fires caused 3400 deaths and 14,670 injuries, which resulted in a loss of $23 billion [1]. Effective evacuation planning in densely occupied buildings should be primarily put in place if both the number of injuries/fatalities and the level of property loss are to be minimized. However, it is not realistic, and is unethical to study human evacuation performance under a burning building. For this reason, computational tools tend to be the best approach for simulating fire growth as well as human response to fire hazards. This study aims to develop a BIM-based simulation framework that implements the Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and agent-based modeling (ABM) for simulating fire growth and evacuation performance for different building layout scenarios. An experimental implementation is conducted to validate the proposed framework, which verified the benefits of (1) using BIM to offer a platform for conducting simulation design and visualizing the simulation results of (a) hazardous fire zones and (b) effective escape routes; (2) simulating fire growth using the FDS tool; (3) developing an agent-based model that accounts for the critical factors affecting evacuation performance; and (4) applying a statistical analysis for investigating the effects of influential parameters from the proposed model. As a result, the simulation outputs can be used to optimize the building design and to investigate the influential factors on human evacuation efficiency. The proposed framework contributes to building fire safety management by enabling to minimize both injuries/fatalities and property loss.

AB Background. Paediatric cardiac surgery is associated with some degree of myocardial injury. Ischaemic preconditioning (IP) has been investigated widely in the adult population. Volatile agents have been shown to simulate IP providing extra protection to the myocardium during adult cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) while propofol seems to act through different mechanisms. IP has not been investigated in the paediatric population to the same extent. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a reliable marker of myocardial injury in neonates and children. We have investigated the relationship between three anaesthetic agents, midazolam, propofol, and sevoflurane, and postoperative production of cTnT.
   Methods. Ninety patients undergoing repair of congenital heart defect with CPB were investigated in a prospective randomized study. cTnT was measured four times during the first 24 h following admission to the paediatric intensive care unit. Other variables measured included arterial blood gases, lactate, fluid balance, use of inotropic drugs, Pa-o2/Fi(o2) ratio and ventilator hours.
   Results. cTnT was elevated in all three groups throughout the study period. The differences between the three groups were not statistically significant. Eight hours after admission to the intensive care unit cTnT concentrations tended to be higher in the midazolam group [mean (95% confidence intervals)]; 2.7 (1.9-3.5) ng ml(-1). Patients receiving a propofol-based anaesthesia had similar concentrations 2.6 (1.7-3.5) ng ml(-1) while those receiving sevoflurane tended to have a lower cTnT production 1.7 (1.3-2.2) ng ml(-1).
   Conclusions. Midazolam, propofol, and sevoflurane appear to provide equal myocardial protection in paediatric cardiac surgery when using cTnT as a marker of myocardial damage.

ID AGENT-BASED SIMULATION; SOCIAL FORCE MODEL; CROWD EVACUATION; VALIDATION
AB Interactions between pedestrians and robots are becoming more commonplace. In public areas, for example, robots may be used for information dissemination, security, or patrol tasks. Based upon existing literature in the field of human-robot interaction, the ISAPT simulation system was revised to model individual pedestrian behavior in the presence of a mobile robot. Using an agent-based modeling approach, pedestrians are statistically assigned one of six reported behaviors when a robot is encountered: interact, watch, curious, ignore, cautious, and avoid. The modeling methods for incorporating these behaviors include modifying a pedestrian's existing agenda and/or their perception of the threat represented by the non-humanoid robot, while the pedestrian continues to make navigation decisions based on their overall utility function. This paper discusses the implementation of this capability and presents results on ISAPT's ability to reproduce the different behaviors reported in the literature. Data collected in a field study are used to further validate the system by comparing measures from observed behaviors to simulation output. Validation measures included lateral distance to robot and lateral path deviation. These results illustrate this approach is an effective means for adding this capability to microsimulation modeling systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper reports on a survey capturing modelers' perspectives of Modeling and Simulation (M&S). The survey was completed by a total of 283 respondents from the M&S community with 167 fully completed surveys and 151 respondents identified as model builders. Participants include people from government, academia, and industry in varied roles ranging from researchers to business developers. Respondents also represent a diverse educational background ranging from oceanography, social sciences, and engineering. The survey focuses on three dimensions namely: (a) models and simulations, (b) participants, and (c) how participants interact with models/simulations. We provide six observations from the data analysis: there is no dominating paradigm in M&S, the agent-based community is distinct from the discrete-event community, conceptual modeling is the art of M&S, simulation verification is mostly a trial and error activity, validate by all means necessary, and model accreditation is still too uncommon. A key finding from these observations is the identification of an over-reliance on informal methods for conceptualization and verification in M&S. We posit that this over-reliance on informal methods challenges model/simulation validity.

AB Decontamination of sensitive electronics exposed to chemical contaminants such as chemical warfare agents (CWA) is incompatible with existing water-based/corrosive methods. The development of new chemistries to tackle this challenge is of great interest. In this paper we investigate the effectiveness of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) to degrade organophosphorus compounds in non-aqueous environments, via a combined experimental-molecular modeling study. Emphasis is placed on understanding the effect of framework characteristics (metal identity and linker functional group) on the methanolysis of these toxic chemicals, along with identifying reactivity trends for relevant sarin (GB) simulants. Several representative materials based on a hexanuclear metal cluster were judiciously selected, including the well-known catalytically active MOF, UiO-66. Complementary insights into the vibrational and structural properties of these materials were provided by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Findings indicate that Zr is a more effective metal center to support the degradation of organophosphorus compounds in methanol, as compared to Eu and Y. Detailed investigation into the reactivity of three relevant simulant candidates (diethyl chlorophosphate, DECP, dimethyl 4-nitrophenylphosphate, DMNP, and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, DFP), revealed that nitroand fluorophosphates are better surrogates to mimic the reactivity of GB in methanol, as compared to chlorophosphate-based molecules. Importantly, experimental results on the MOF based degradation of GB in methanol are reported here for the first time. Additionally, this is the first study that systematically investigates the effectiveness of using MOFs for the solvolysis of organophosphorus compounds, providing valuable insights for materials design and simulant downselection.

AB An agent-based simulation model (ABM) is developed and implemented using Python to explore the emergence of intragenerational and intergenerational skill inequality at the societal level that results from differences in parental investment behavior at the household level during early stages of the life course. Parental behavior is modeled as optimal, heuristic-based, or norm-oriented. Skills grow according to the technology of skill formation developed in the field of economics, calibrated with empirically estimated parameters from existing research. Agents go through a simplified life course. During childhood and adolescence, skills are produced through parental investments. In adulthood, individuals find a partner, give birth to the next generation, and invest in offspring. Number and spacing of children and available resources are treated as exogenous factors and are varied experimentally. Simulation experiments suggest that parental decisions at the household level play a role in the emergence of inequality at the societal level. Being egalitarian or not is the most important distinction in parental investment behavior, while optimizing parents generate similar results as egalitarian parents. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff between equality at home and inequality at the macro-level. Changes in the environment reduce or exacerbate inequality depending on parental investment behavior. One prediction of the model on intragenerational inequality in cognitive skills was validated with the use of empirical data. The simulation can best be described as a middle-range model, informed by research on skill formation and the intrahousehold allocation of resources. It is a first step toward more complex ABMs on inequality from a life course perspective. Possible model extensions are suggested. The Overview, Design Concepts, and Details (ODD) protocol and Design of Experiments (DOE) were used to document the model and set up the experimental design respectively.

AB Social distancing reduces the risk of people becoming infected with the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). When passengers are transported from an airport terminal to an airplane using apron buses, safe social distancing during pandemic times reduces the capacity of the apron buses and has led to the practice of airlines keeping the middle seats of the airplanes unoccupied. This article adapts classical boarding methods so that they may be used with social distancing and apron buses. We conduct stochastic simulation experiments to assess nine adaptations of boarding methods according to four performance metrics. Three of the metrics are related to the risk of the virus spreading to passengers during boarding. The fourth metric is the time to complete boarding of the two-door airplane when apron bus transport passengers to the airplane. Our experiments assume that passengers advancing to their airplane seats are separated by an aisle social distance of 1 m or 2 m. Numerical results indicate that the three variations (adaptations) of the Reverse pyramid method are the best candidates for airlines to consider in this socially distanced context. The particular adaptation to use depends on an airline's relative preference for having short boarding times versus a reduced risk of later boarding passengers passing (and thereby possibly infecting) previously seated window seat passengers. If an airline considers the latter risk to be unimportant, then the Reverse pyramid - Spread method would be the best choice because it provides the fastest time to board the airplane and is tied for the best values for the other two health risk measures.

AB We develop an agent-based model to assess the cumulative number of deaths during hypothetical Covid-19-like epidemics for various non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies. The model simulates three interrelated stochastic processes: epidemic spreading, availability of respiratory ventilators and changes in death statistics. We consider local and non-local modes of disease transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modelled as a discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The following assumptions are made. The basic reproduction number is R0=2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately ten days. Infections lead to severe acute respiratory syndrome in about one percent of cases, which are likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an appropriate medical treatment. The healthcare system capacity is simulated by the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory ventilators per 100,000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare 'do-nothing' strategy with mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We study epidemics in the pre-vacine era, where immunity is obtained only by infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but increase the duration of the epidemic. In particular, a hybrid strategy where lockdown is held for some time and is then completely released, is inefficient.

AB Why are in-kind transfers a prominent feature of the U.S. social safety net, and why is such a significant fraction of these benefits given to individuals who do not actively supply labor in the market? This paper presents home production as a novel rationalization for such transfers. It first shows that in a broad class of dynamic Mirrleesian models that include only market production, the optimal allocation features undistorted marginal rates of substitution between goods whenever agents are not working, and thus in-kind benefits provided to these agents do not help decentralize an optimal allocation. However, adding home production drastically changes the nature of the optimal allocation. In particular, if goods and labor are substitutes in home production and home and market productivity are positively correlated, in-kind benefits in the form of goods used in home production, such as groceries, energy, and housing capital, should be provided to agents who do not work. A numerical simulation shows that the optimal in-kind program for disabled workers in a plausibly calibrated version of the home production model is consistent with the scale of SNAP and other programs that provide home production goods in the U.S.

AB Human phospholipase A(2) (hPLA(2)) of the IIA group (HGIIA) catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids, producing arachidonic acid and originating potent inflammatory mediators. Therefore, molecules that can inhibit this enzyme are a source of potential anti-inflammatory drugs, with different action mechanisms of known anti-inflammatory agents. For the study and development of new anti-inflammatory drugs with this action mechanism, snake venom PLA(2) (svPLA(2)) can be employed, since the svPLA(2) has high similarity with the human PLA(2) HGIIA. Despite the high similarity between these secretory PLA(2)s(,) it is still not clear if these toxins can really be employed as an experimental model to predict the interactions that occur with the human PLA(2) HGIIA and its inhibitors. Thus, the present study aims to compare and evaluate, by means of theoretical calculations, docking and molecular dynamics simulations, as well as experimental studies, the interactions of human PLA(2) HGIIA and two svPLA(2)s(,)Bothrops toxin II and Crotoxin B (BthTX-II and CB, respectively). Our theoretical findings corroborate experimental data and point out that the human PLA(2) HGIIA and svPLA(2) BthTX-II lead to similar interactions with the studied compounds. From our results, the svPLA(2) BthTX-II can be used as an experimental model for the development of anti-inflammatory drugs for therapy in humans.

AB The energetics for binding of a diphenyl diamidine antitrypanosomal agent CGP 40215A to DNA have been studied by spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance biosensor methods. Both amidines are positively charged under experimental conditions, but the linking group for the two phenyl amidines has a pK(a) of 6.3 that is susceptible to a protonation process. Spectroscopic studies indicate an increase of 2.7 pKa units in the linking group when the compound binds to an A/T minor-groove site. Calorimetric titrations in different buffers and pH conditions support the proton-linkage process and are in a good agreement with spectroscopic titrations. The two methods established a proton-uptake pro. le as a function of pH. The exothermic enthalpy of complex formation varies with different pH conditions. The observed binding enthalpy increases as a function of temperature indicating a negative heat capacity change that is typical for DNA minor-groove binders. Solvent accessible surface area calculations suggest that surface burial accounts for about one-half of the observed intrinsic negative heat capacity change. Biosensor and calorimetric experiments indicate that the binding affinities vary with pH values and salt concentrations due to protonation and electrostatic interactions. The surface plasmon resonance binding studies indicate that the charge density per phosphate in DNA hairpins is smaller than that in polymers. Energetic contributions from different factors were also estimated for the ligand/DNA complex.

AB his paper studies how smart recommendation agents (those that filter and integrate information and offer feedback to customers) influence consumer decision making in online stores, in comparison to recommendation agents that are merely "knowledgeable" of the alternative options that exist in a product assortment. The cognitive cost model is used to propose hypotheses that link information search and alternative evaluation with two shopping environment influences that are typical of online settings. A study that simulates search and evaluation in a Web-based choice environment is conducted to test the hypotheses. The results offer insights into how the "feedback" provided by a recommendation agent on the product options available may have an effect on search and evaluation in an online store.

AB This paper provides a review of the analysis and modeling of human spatial planning, perception, and learning based on the dynamics of agent-erivironmeht interactions. The approach stems from an analysis and modeling framework that was previously conceived using interaction patterns emerging from system-wide interactions as the basic unit of analysis. The paper first discusses the nationals for using patterns in agent-environment interactions as units of organization of behavior, and as functional; units of the modeling framework. These concepts are then illustrated through two applications using experimental data from a first-person flight simulator that implements agile obstacle navigation tasks. The first application focuses on the analysis of the formation and evolution of interaction patterns over successive trials, and the use of these patterns as basic elements of the task environment representation, enabling the evaluation of the learning process and assessment of the operator performance. The second application focuses on the analysis of interaction patterns as functional units supporting the modeling of the underlying perceptual guidance and control mechanisms. These examples demonstrate the relevance of dynamics in agent-environment interactions for studying a Wide range of functions across the human control hierarchy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has brought infectious diseases again to the forefront of global public health concerns. In this EML webinar (Gao, 2020), we discuss some recent work on simulation-assisted discovery of membrane targeting nanomedicine to counter increasing antimicrobial resistance and potential application of similar ideas to the current pandemic. A recent report led by the world health organization (WHO) warned that 10 million people worldwide could die of bacterial infections each year by 2050. To avert the crisis, membrane targeting antibiotics are drawing increasing attention due to their intrinsic advantage of low resistance development. In collaboration with a number of experimental groups, we show examples of simulation-assisted discovery of molecular agents capable of selectively penetrating and aggregating in bacterial lipid membranes, causing membrane permeability/rupture. Through systematic all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and free energy analysis, we demonstrate that the membrane activity of the molecular agents correlates with their ability to enter, perturb and permeabilize the lipid bilayers. Further study on different cell membranes demonstrates that the selectivity results from the presence of cholesterol in mammalian but not in bacterial membranes, as the cholesterol can condense the hydrophobic region of membrane, preventing the penetration of the molecular agents. Following the molecular penetration, we establish a continuum theory and derive the energetic driving force for the domain aggregation and pore growth on lipid membrane. We show that the energy barrier to membrane pore formation can be significantly lowered through molecular aggregation on a large domain with intrinsic curvature and a sharp interface. The theory is consistent with experimental observations and validated with coarsegrained molecular dynamics simulations of molecular domain aggregation leading to pore formation in a lipid membrane. The mechanistic modelling and simulation provide some fundamental principles on how molecular antimicrobials interact with bacterial membranes and damage them through domain aggregation and pore formation. For treating viral infections and cancer therapy, we discuss potential size- and lipid-type-based selectivity principles for developing membrane active nanomedicine. These studies suggest a general simulation-assisted platform to accelerate discovery and innovation in nanomedicine against infectious diseases.

AB In this article, we develop a navigation strategy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for mobile robots. Because of the large difference between simulation and reality, most of the trained DRL models cannot be directly migrated into real robots. Moreover, how to explore in a sparsely rewarded environment is also a long-standing problem of DRL. This article proposes an end-to-end navigation planner that translates sparse laser ranging results into movement actions. Using this highly abstract data as input, agents trained by simulation can be extended to the real scene for practical application. For map-less navigation across obstacles and traps, it is difficult to reach the target via random exploration. Curiosity is used to encourage agents to explore the state of an environment that has not been visited and as an additional reward for exploring behavior. The agent relies on the self-supervised model to predict the next state, based on the current state and the executed action. The prediction error is used as a measure of curiosity. The experimental results demonstrate that without any manual design features and previous demonstrations, the proposed method accomplishes map-less navigation in complex environments. Through a reward signal that is enhanced by intrinsic motivation, the agent explores more efficiently, and the learned strategy is more reliable.

AB We show how the prevailing majority opinion in a population can be rapidly reversed by a small fraction p of randomly distributed committed agents who consistently proselytize the opposing opinion and are immune to influence. Specifically, we show that when the committed fraction grows beyond a critical value p(c) approximate to 10%, there is a dramatic decrease in the time T-c taken for the entire population to adopt the committed opinion. In particular, for complete graphs we show that when p < p(c), T-c similar to exp[alpha(p)N], whereas for p > p(c), T-c similar to ln N. We conclude with simulation results for Erdos-Renyi random graphs and scale-free networks which show qualitatively similar behavior.

AB With the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely applied to portfolio management. However, shortcomings remain. Specifically, because the training environment of an RL-based portfolio optimization framework is usually constructed based on historical price data in the literature, the agent potentially 1) violates the definition of a Markov decision process (MDP), 2) ignores their own market impact, or 3) fails to account for causal relationships within interaction processes; these ultimately lead the agent to make poor generalizations. To surmount these problems-specifically, to help the RL-based portfolio agent make better generalizations-we introduce an interactive training environment that leverages a generative model, called the limit order book-generative adversarial model (LOB-GAN), to simulate a financial market. Specifically, the LOB-GAN models market ordering behavior, and LOB-GAN's generator is utilized as a market behavior simulator. A simulated financial market, called Virtual Market, is constructed by the market behavior simulator in conjunction with a realistic security matching system. Virtual Market is then leveraged as an interactive training environment for the RL-based portfolio agent. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves out-of-sample portfolio performance by 4%, which is superior to other generalization strategies.

TI Integration of coal pyrolysis process with iron ore reduction: Reduction
   behaviors of iron ore with benzene-containing coal pyrolysis gas as a
   reducing agent
SO CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
DE Coal pyrolysis; Iron reduction; Integration; Tar effect
ID TAR; DECOMPOSITION; TEMPERATURE
AB An integrated coal pyrolysis process with iron ore reduction is proposed in this article. As the first step, iron oxide reduction is studied in a fixed bed reactor using simulated coal pyrolysis gas with benzene as a model tar compound. Variables such as reduction temperature, reduction time and benzene concentration are studied. The carbon deposition of benzene results in the retarded iron reduction at low temperatures. At high temperatures over 800 degrees C, the presence of benzene in the gas can promote iron reduction. The metallization can reach up to 99% in 20 min at 900 degrees C in the presence of benzene. Significant increases of hydrogen and CO/CO2 ratio are observed in the gas. It is indicated that iron reduction is accompanied by the reforming and decomposition of benzene. The degree of metallization and reduction increases with the increasing benzene concentration. Iron oxide can nearly completely be converted into cementite with benzene present in the gas under the experimental conditions. No sintering is found in the reduced sample with benzene in the gas.

AB Objectives When it comes to interviewing suspected terrorists, global evidence points to harsh interrogation procedures, despite the likelihood of false positives. How can the state maintain an effective counterterrorism policy while simultaneously protecting civil rights? Until now, the shroud of secrecy of "national security" practices has thwarted attempts by researchers to test apparatuses that engender fair interrogation procedures. The present study aims to test one approach: the use of a "procedural justice checklist" (PJ Checklist) in interviews of suspected terrorists by counterterrorism police officers in port settings. Methods Using a clustered randomized controlled field test in a European democracy, we measure the effect of implementing Procedural Justice (PJ) Checklists in counterterrorism police settings. With 65 teams of officers randomly-assigned into treatment and control conditions, we compare post-interrogation surveys of suspects (n = 1418) on perceptions of legitimacy; obligations to obey the law; willingness to cooperate with the police; effectiveness of counterterrorism measures; distributive justice; feelings of social resistance to the state; and PJ. A series of multi-level linear, logistic, and ordered logit regression models are used to estimate the treatment effect, with Hedges' g and odds ratios used for effect sizes. Results When compared with control conditions, implementing a policy of PJ Checklist causes statistically significant and large enhancement in all measured dimensions, including the willingness of suspects to obey the law (g = 1.022 [0.905, 1.138]), to cooperate with the police (g = 1.118 [0.999, 1.238]), distributive justice (g = 0.993 [0.880, 1.106]), effectiveness (g = 1.077 [0.959, 1.195]), procedural justice (g = 1.044 [0.930, 1.158]), and feelings of resistance towards the state (g = - 0.370 [- 0.259, - 0.482]). Conclusions PJ checklists offer a simple, scalable means of improving how state agents interact with terrorism suspects. The police can use what is evidently a cost-effective tool to enhance legitimacy and cooperation with the police, even in a counterterrorism environment.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS

AB Background: Modelling travel time to services has become a common public health tool for planning service provision but the usefulness of these analyses is constrained by the availability of accurate input data and limitations inherent in the assumptions and parameterisation. This is particularly an issue in the developing world where access to basic data is limited and travel is often complex and multi-modal. Improving the accuracy and relevance in this context requires greater accessibility to, and flexibility in, travel time modelling tools to facilitate the incorporation of local knowledge and the rapid exploration of multiple travel scenarios. The aim of this work was to develop simple open source, adaptable, interactive travel time modelling tools to allow greater access to and participation in service access analysis.
   Results: Described are three interconnected applications designed to reduce some of the barriers to the more wide-spread use of GIS analysis of service access and allow for complex spatial and temporal variations in service availability. These applications are an open source GIS tool-kit and two geo-simulation models. The development of these tools was guided by health service issues from a developing world context but they present a general approach to enabling greater access to and flexibility in health access modelling. The tools demonstrate a method that substantially simplifies the process for conducting travel time assessments and demonstrate a dynamic, interactive approach in an open source GIS format. In addition this paper provides examples from empirical experience where these tools have informed better policy and planning.
   Conclusion: Travel and health service access is complex and cannot be reduced to a few static modeled outputs. The approaches described in this paper use a unique set of tools to explore this complexity, promote discussion and build understanding with the goal of producing better planning outcomes. The accessible, flexible, interactive and responsive nature of the applications described has the potential to allow complex environmental social and political considerations to be incorporated and visualised. Through supporting evidence-based planning the innovative modelling practices described have the potential to help local health and emergency response planning in the developing world.

AB Recent clinical trials have shown that combination therapy using an alpha-receptor antagonist and an antimuscarinic is more effective than either agent alone in improving quality of life and objective urodynamic variables in men with bladder outflow obstruction. There appear to be no negative effects on bladder function. The mode of action of this combination is unknown but presumed to be an antimuscarinic reduction in detrusor overactivity and the alpha-receptor antagonist reduced outflow tract resistance. We have shown with in vitro experiments that in smooth muscles influencing outflow tract resistance (prostate, trigone) there is a profound contractile synergy between adrenergic and muscarinic pathways. We propose the hypothesis that both arms of the combination therapy reduce contractile tone of the outflow tract and that their simultaneous attenuation has a disproportionately large effect on outflow tract resistance. Our data from trigone muscle suggest that adrenergic and muscarinic receptor activation increase the intracellular [Ca2+] but the adrenergic pathway also operates through Ca2+-sensitisation of the contractile apparatus, primarily through a PKC-dependent pathway.

ID DENSITY; MODELS; AGENTS; GAMES
AB Crowd simulation addresses algorithmic approaches to steering, navigation, perception, and behavioral models. Significant progress has been achieved in modeling interactions between agents and the environment to avoid collisions, exploit empirical local decision data, and plan efficient paths to goals. We address a relatively unexplored dimension of virtual human behavior: thermal perception, comfort, and appropriate behavioral responses. Thermal comfort is associated with the ambient environment, agent density factors, and interpersonal thermal feedback. A key feature of our approach is the temporal integration of both thermal exposure and occupant density to directly influence agent movements and behaviors (e.g., clothing changes) to increase thermal comfort. Empirical thermal comfort models are incorporated as a validation basis. Simple heat transfer models are used to model environment, agent, and interpersonal heat exchange. Our model's generality makes it applicable to any existing crowd steering algorithm as it adds additional integrative terms to any cost function. Examples illustrate distinctive emergent behaviors such as balancing agent density with thermal comfort, hysteresis in responding to localized or brief thermal events, and discomfort and likely injury produced by extreme packing densities.

AB We study the time evolution of stock markets using a statistical physics approach. We consider an ensemble of agents who sell or buy a good according to several factors acting on them: the majority of the neighbors, the market atmosphere, the variation of the price and some specific measure applied at a given time. Each agent is represented by a spin having a number of discrete states q or continuous states, describing the tendency of the agent for buying or selling. The market atmosphere is represented by a parameter T which plays the role of the temperature in physics: low T corresponds to a calm market, high T to a turbulent one. We show that there is a critical value of T, say T-c, where strong fluctuations between individual states lead to a disordered situation in which there is no majority: the numbers of sellers and buyers are equal, namely the market clearing. The specific measure, by the government or by an economic organization, is parameterized by H applied on the market at the time t(1) and removed at the time t(2). We have used Monte Carlo simulations to study the time evolution of the price as functions of those parameters. In particular we show that the price strongly fluctuates near T-c and there exists a critical value H-c above which the boosting effect remains after H is removed. Our model replicates the stylized facts in finance (time-independent price variation), volatility clustering (time-dependent dynamics) and persistent effect of a temporary shock. The second part of the paper deals with the price variation using a time-dependent mean-field theory. By supposing that the sellers and the buyers belong to two distinct communities with their characteristics different in both intra-group and inter-group interactions, we find the price oscillation with time. Results are shown and discussed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The identification of the thrombin receptor has promoted the interest for the development of new therapeutic agents capable of selectively inhibiting unwanted biological effects of thrombin on various cell types. In this study we have designed and synthesized two series of new thrombin receptor antagonists based on the thrombin receptor motif sequence S42FLLR46, one possessing two (Phe/Arg) pharmacophoric groups and the other possessing three (Phe/Arg/NH2). N-(6-Guanidohexanoyl)-N'-(phenylacetyl)piperazine (1), N-(phenylacetyl)-4-(6-guanidohexanoylamidomethyl)piperidine (2), and N-(phenylacetyl)-3-(6-guanidohexanoylamido)pyrrolidine (3) (group A) carry the two pharmacophoric side chains of Phe and Arg residues incorporated on three different templates (piperazine, 4-aminomethylpiperidine, and 3-aminopyrrolidine). Compounds with three pharmacophoric groups (group B) were built similarly to group A using the same templates with the addition of an extra methylamino group leading to (S)-N-(6-guanidohexanoyl)-N'-(2-amino-3-phenylpropionyl)piperazine (4), (S)-N-(2-amino-3-phenylpropionyl)-4-(6-guanidohexanoylamidomethyl)piperidine (5), and (S)-N-(2-amino-3-phenylpropionyl)-3-(6-guanidohexanoylamido)pyrrolidine (6). Compounds were able to inhibit thrombin-induced human platelet activation even at low concentrations. In particular, among compounds in group A, compound 3 was found to be the most powerful thrombin receptor activation inhibitor, showing an IC50 of approximately 0.11 mM on platelet aggregation assay. Among compounds in group B, compound 4 was the most powerful to inhibit thrombin-induced platelet aggregation, showing an IC50 of approximately 0.09 mM. All compounds were also found to act as agonists in the rat aorta relaxation assay. Interestingly, the order or potency of these compounds as agonists of the endothelial thrombin receptor was the inverse of the order of potency of the same compounds as antagonists of the platelet thrombin receptor. Such compounds that are causing vasodilation while simultaneously inhibiting platelet aggregation would be very useful in preventing the installation of atherosclerotic lesions and deserve further investigation as potential drugs for treating cardiovascular diseases. The above findings coupled with computational analysis molecular dynamics experiments support also our hypothesis that a cluster of phenyl, guanidino, and amino groups is responsible for thrombin receptor triggering and activation.

AB Objectives: To determine the effects of intrinsic wetness on the formation of dentin bonding interfaces of four resin cement systems bonded to dentin under different pulpal pressures.
   Methods: Thirty-six freshly extracted third molars were selected and processed for dentin mu TBS. The teeth were randomly assigned into 12 experimental groups, according to the adhesive luting system [Adper Single Bond Plus (3 M ESPE) combined with two luting agents RelyX ARC (3 M ESPE) and heated Filtek Z250 Universal Restorative (3 M ESPE), Clearfil CD Bond (Kuraray) combined with Clearfil Esthetic Cement (Kuraray), and RelyX Unicem 2 Automix (3 M ESPE)] and pulpal pressure (0, 5, and 20 cm of simulated pulpal pressure). Leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic slabs (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) of 3 mm thickness were bonded to dentin. The samples were stored in distilled water for 24 h and then sectioned in X/Y directions across the adhesive interface to obtain specimens with a cross section of 0.8 +/- 0.2 mm(2). All sticks were fractured by tension at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/min and the data were submitted to Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney Tests (alpha=0.05). Ultrastructural analysis of the interfaces was performed using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM).
   Results: The statistical analyses showed that pulpal pressure decreased mu TBS for all groups. Significantly higher mu TBS values were obtained in heated Z250 group restored without any pulpal pressure. CLSM showed that the uptake of water through the dentin tubuli and their anastomosis of lateral branches during the adhesive luting procedures prevented adequate formation of the dentin bonding interfaces. SEM showed that the luting film created is material-dependent and all adhesive failure occurred at the resin-dentin interface.
   Conclusion: The constant intrinsic wetness replenishment prevents adequate formation of the hybrid layer.
   Clinical significance: Intrinsic moisture during adhesive luting procedures significantly affects the interaction between luting materials and dentin subtract and decreases the quality and bonding strength of the resin-dentin bond. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The main aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive numerical analysis on the efficiency of various reinforcement learning (RL) techniques in an agent-based soccer game. The SoccerBots is employed as a simulation testbed to analyze the effectiveness of RL techniques under various scenarios. A hybrid agent teaming framework for investigating agent team architecture, learning abilities, and other specific behaviours is presented. Novel RL algorithms to verify the competitive and cooperative learning abilities of goal-oriented agents for decision-making are developed. In particular, the tile coding (TC) technique, a function approximation approach, is used to prevent the state space from growing exponentially, hence avoiding the curse of dimensionality. The underlying mechanism of eligibility traces is evaluated in terms of on-policy and off-policy procedures, as well as accumulating traces and replacing traces. The results obtained are analyzed, and implications of the results towards agent teaming and learning are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: We developed a porcine grade 5 renal laceration damage control model to evaluate the hemostatic efficacy of FloSeal gelatin matrix (Baxter Healthcare, Corp., Deerfield, III).
   Methods: Ten commercial swine underwent celiotomy, contralateral nephrectomy, and cooling to 32 degrees C after a well-established hypothermia protocol to simulate a damage control scenario. Following prospective randomization, a complex grade 5 renal injury was uniformly produced on the remaining kidney. Control animals (group 1, n = 5) were treated with direct manual compression with a gelatin sponge. Experimental animals (group 2, n = 5) were treated by application of FloSeal gelatin matrix followed by direct compression with a gelatin sponge. Operative blood loss and efficacy of hemostasis were compared. Creatinine levels were obtained daily until postoperative day 7. Abdominal computed tomography was performed at 10 days.
   Results: Use of FloSeal gelatin matrix hemostatic sealant resulted in significantly less mean blood loss than gelatin sponge bolster compression alone (202.4 mL vs. 540.4 mL, respectively, p = 0.016). Hemostasis was complete in 60% (three out of five) of experimental animals after 2 minutes, but was incomplete in all control animals. After an initial increase, serum creatinine approached baseline by postoperative day 7 in all animals. Axial imaging 10 days postoperatively revealed no evidence of significant delayed perirenal hemorrhage.
   Conclusions: FloSeal gelatin matrix performed well as a rapidly deployable, effective hemostatic agent in a hypothermic grade 5 renal injury damage control model. The absence of delayed bleeding and nephrotoxicity suggests a possible increased role for FloSeal in the treatment of devastating renal injuries in damage control surgery.

AB The core principles of the evolutionary theories of emotions declare that affective states represent crucial drives for action selection in the environment and regulated the behavior and adaptation of natural agents in ancestrally recurrent situations. While many different studies used autonomous artificial agents to simulate emotional responses and the way these patterns can affect decision-making, few are the approaches that tried to analyze the evolutionary emergence of affective behaviors directly from the specific adaptive problems posed by the ancestral environment. A model of the evolution of affective behaviors is presented using simulated artificial agents equipped with neural networks and physically inspired on the architecture of the iCub humanoid robot. We use genetic algorithms to train populations of virtual robots across generations, and investigate the spontaneous emergence of basic emotional behaviors in different experimental conditions. In particular, we focus on studying the emotion of fear, therefore the environment explored by the artificial agents can contain stimuli that are safe or dangerous to pick. The simulated task is based on classical conditioning and the agents are asked to learn a strategy to recognize whether the environment is safe or represents a threat to their lives and select the correct action to perform in absence of any visual cues. The simulated agents have special input units in their neural structure whose activation keep track of their actual "sensations" based on the outcome of past behavior. We train five different neural network architectures and then test the best ranked individuals comparing their performances and analyzing the unit activations in each individual's life cycle. We show that the agents, regardless of the presence of recurrent connections, spontaneously evolved the ability to cope with potentially dangerous environment by collecting information about the environment and then switching their behavior to a genetically selected pattern in order to maximize the possible reward. We also prove the determinant presence of an internal time perception unit for the robots to achieve the highest performance and survivability across all conditions.

AB Sensor technology, particularly disposable, field-deployable devices offer considerable promise for addressing major security demands, in general, and in particular the urgent needs for selective and rapid field detection of highly toxic G-type organophosphate (OP) nerve agents. Herein, we report on the first example of a disposable electrochemical biosensor chip for decentralized field detection of diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP), as the simulant compound of G-type nerve agents (e.g., Sarin and Soman), based on the integration of an all-solid-state fluoride potentiometric transducer with the enzyme organophosphorus acid anhydrolase (OPAA) in connection to a hand-held potentiometric analyzer. Such solid-contact fluoride ion-selective electrodes were realized by comparing different fluoride ionophores to select the bis(fluorodioctylstannyl)methane molecule, along with systematic optimization of the experimental parameters. This first solid-contact fluoride detection chip displayed a favorable analytical performance, with near-Nernstian behavior at neutral pH in different buffers, high selectivity against various anions along with excellent reproducibility. Combining such desirable merits of the new fluoride sensor with the selective biocatalytic hydrolysis via an immobilized OPAA, to break the P-F bond of G-type neurotoxins and release detectable fluoride ions, thereby enabled an attractive analytical performance. Both the fluoride and the nerve-agent recognition layers have thus been systematically optimized. The resulting biosensor chip thus displays a fast, sensitive and selective response towards DFP (including efficient discrimination against OP pesticides), along with a wide dynamic range of 250-3000 mu M. Key challenges towards developing the nerve-agent detection chip were carefully addressed, including the pH incompatibility of the enzymatic and detection processes. By providing effective discrimination against common OP pesticides and minimizing related false alarms, the resultant disposable potentiometric biochip platform is expected to provide an instantaneous reliable warning of chemical attack and exposure towards a timely countermeasure action, and hence, would dramatically advance the protection of our military personnel.

AB This paper explores imparting self-healing characteristics to metal matrices similar to what are observed in biological systems and are being developed for polymeric materials. To impart self-healing properties to metal matrices, a liquid healing method was investigated; the met hod consists of a container filled with low melting alloy acting as a healing agent, embedded into a high melting metal matrix. When the matrix is cracked; self-healing is achieved by melting the healing agent allowing the liquid metal to flow into the crack. Upon cooling, solidification of the healing agent occurs and seals the crack. The objective of this research is to investigate the fluid flow and heat transfer to impart self-healing property to metal matrices. In this study, a dimensionless healing factor, which may help predict the possibility of healing is proposed. The healing factor is defined as the ratio of the viscous forces and the contact area of liquid metal and solid which prevent flow, and volume expansion, density, and velocity of the liquid metal, gravity, crack size and orientation which promote flow. The factor incorporates the parameters that control self-healing mechanism. It was observed that for lower values of the healing factor, the liquid flows, and for higher values of healing factor, the liquid remains in the container and healing does not occur. To validate and identify the critical range of the healing factor, experiments and simulations were performed for selected combinations of healing agents and metal matrices. The simulations were performed for three-dimensional models and a commercial software 3D Ansys-Fluent was used. Three experimental methods of synthesis of self-healing composites were used. The first method consisted of creating a hole in the matrices, and liquid healing agent was poured into the hole. The second method consisted of micro tubes containing the healing agent, and the third method consisted of incorporating micro balloons containing the healing agent in the matrix. The observed critical range of the healing factor is between 407 and 495; only for healing factor values below 407 healing was observed in the matrices.

AB In open railway markets, coordinating train schedules at an interchange station requires negotiation between two independent train-operating companies to resolve their operational conflicts. This paper models the stakeholders as software agents and proposes an agent negotiation model to study their interaction. Three negotiation strategies have been devised to represent the possible objectives of the stakeholders, and they determine the behavior of the stakeholders in proposing offers to other stakeholders. Empirical simulation results confirm that the use of the proposed negotiation strategies lead to outcomes that are consistent with the objectives of the stakeholders.

AB The increasing use of computer simulation modelling brings with it epistemological questions about the possibilities and limits of its use for understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of social and environmental systems. These questions include how we learn from simulation models and how we most appropriately explain what we have learnt. Generative simulation modelling provides a framework to investigate how the interactions of individual heterogeneous entities across space and through time produce system-level patterns. This modelling approach includes individual- and agent-based models and is increasingly being applied to study environmental and social systems, and their interactions with one another. Much of the formally presented analysis and interpretation of this type of simulation resorts to statistical summaries of aggregated, system-level patterns. Here, we argue that generative simulation modelling can be recognised as being 'event-driven', retaining a history in the patterns produced via simulated events and interactions. Consequently, we explore how a narrative approach might use this simulated history to better explain how patterns are produced as a result of model structure, and we provide an example of this approach using variations of a simulation model of breeding synchrony in bird colonies. This example illustrates not only why observed patterns are produced in this particular case, but also how generative simulation models function more generally. Aggregated summaries of emergent system-level patterns will remain an important component of modellers' toolkits, but narratives can act as an intermediary between formal descriptions of model structure and these summaries. Using a narrative approach should help generative simulation modellers to better communicate the process by which they learn so that their activities and results can be more widely interpreted. In turn, this will allow non-modellers to foster a fuller appreciation of the function and benefits of generative simulation modelling. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Buckling resistance of solid shell bubbles under ultrasound

ID CONTRAST MICROBUBBLES; DESTRUCTION; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB Thin solid shell contrast agents bubbles are expected to undergo different volume oscillating behaviors when the acoustic power is increased: small oscillations when the shell remains spherical, and large oscillations when the shell buckles. Contrary to bubbles covered with thin lipidic monolayers that buckle as soon as compressed: the solid shell bubbles resist compression, making the buckling transition abrupt. Numerical simulations that explicitly incorporate a shell bending modulus give the critical buckling pressure and post-buckling shape, and show the appearance of a finite number of wrinkles. These findings are incorporated in a model based on the concept of effective surface tension. This model compares favorably to experiments when adjusting two main parameters: the buckling tension and the rupture shell tension. The buckling tension provides a direct estimation of the acoustic pressure threshold at which buckling occurs. (C) 2011 Acoustical Society of America. [DOI: 10.1121/1.3543943]

TI BIO-LGCA: A cellular automaton modelling class for analysing collective

SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

ID EQUATION MODELS; SIMULATION; SINGLE; RULES
AB Collective dynamics in multicellular systems such as biological organs and tissues plays a key role in biological development, regeneration, and pathological conditions. Collective tissue dynamics-understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells-can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments.
   Author summary Pattern formation during embryonic development and pathological tissue dynamics, such as cancer invasion, emerge from individual inter-cellular interactions. In order to study the impact of single cell dynamics and cell-cell interactions on tissue behaviour, one needs to develop space-time-dependent on- or off-lattice agent-based models (ABMs), which consider the behaviour of individual cells. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models also known as cellular automata fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. Here, we present the rule- and lattice-based BIO-LGCA modelling class which allows for (i) rigorous derivation of rules from biophysical laws and/or experimental data, (ii) mathematical analysis of collective migration, and (iii) computationally efficient simulations.

AB Hydroxyurea (HU) and 6-mercaptopurine riboside (6-MPr) are used as cytostatic chemotherapeutics. Their teratogenic potential in experimental animals has been well known for several decades. Generally, it is assumed that the toxicity of both agents is due to an interference with enzymes of DNA synthesis. In the case of 6-MPr, it was speculated that the teratogenicity in rodents might be paralleled by or even correlated to an incorporation of 6-thioguanine into the DNA of the embryos, in this study, the interaction between these two compounds with regard to teratogenicity in NMRI mice was investigated. Dose-response data of 6-MPr (s.c.-treatment) were published earlier. First, a dose-response study with HU alone (i.p.-treatment) was performed. From these data, the doses for the combination study were derived: HU 250 mg/kg (NOAEL dose) and 6-MPr 16 mg/kg (strongly teratogenic dose). In all experimental groups the substances were administered to the dams once on day 11 of gestation. Combination effects were investigated applying various dosing regimens. In group I treatment was simultaneous, in group II HU was administered 2 h before 6-MPr, in group LU 2 h after 6-MPr. The differences in the overall frequency of gross structural abnormalities were moderate. However, when analysing the effects in more detail (single abnormalities), group III exhibited great differences: 1) 6-MPr co-treatment increased the frequency of HU effects (skull defects) and 2) HU co-treatment decreased the frequency of 6-MPr effects (limb defects) when compared to the findings of the dose-response studies. In addition, the influence of HU on the 6-MPr-induced DNA modification was determined by measuring the incorporation of 6-thioguanine into the DNA of day-ii embryos. As expected, the HU co-treatment corresponding to the group III dosing regimen of the teratogenicity experiment decreased the incorporation rate by ca. 40%. This was in parallel to the decrease in the frequency of 6-MPr effects in the teratogenicity III group. This finding may be considered as a further indication that in the case of 6-MPr, DNA modification is accompanying teratogenicity. Teratogenesis Carcinog. Mutagen. 19:223-232, 1999.

AB Re-using faecal sludge (FS) to generate value has the potential to contribute towards solving the issue of long term sanitation solutions in growing urban areas across sub-Saharan Africa; however, hitherto, no design tools have been available that are capable of simulating a system involving economic factors, complex social issues and environmental circumstances. We hypothesized that Agent-Based Modelling (ABM), when deployed with appropriate rigour, can provide such a tool. Extensive field work was carried out in a Malawian city, investigating the adoption of Skyloo above-ground composting toilets by households, and the operation of the municipal FS site. 65 semi-structured interviews and 148 household interviews, together with observations, were carried out to characterize these processes, with the data acquired being used to construct two separate ABMs. The Skyloo ABM was run for various scenarios of start-up capital for business and payback of loans against the toilet cost to households. The municipal FS Site ABM was run for different patterns of dumping fee and enforcement structure. The field work demonstrated that there is potential for further expansion of FS reuse, with a market for agricultural application. The Skyloo ABM identified the significance of start-up capital for a business installing the toilet technology; the municipal FS Site ABM showed that existing fees, fines and regulatory structure were insufficient to reduce illegal dumping of FS to any useful degree, but that a monthly permit system would provide enhanced revenue to the city council compared with per-visit charging of disposal companies at the municipal FS site. Whilst each ABM ideally requires some additional data before full application, we have, for the first time, shown that ABM provides a basis for the simulation-based design of FS management systems, including complex social, economic and environmental factors.

AB Further increasing grain production and rural household income is a major challenge for rural development in China, and the current small scale of farming operations is an important factor limiting progress on both. The Chinese central government's recent approach to promoting rural development addresses the role of land rental markets in facilitating larger-scale farming operations. We use an agent-based model that represents livelihood decision-making of rural households to explore the effects of an alternative policy that subsidizes rural households that rent out their land-use rights for long terms in comparison with the current policy of subsidizing grain producers. The model is built upon our empirical analysis of social surveys and interviews in eight villages around Poyang Lake. We consider policy impacts in terms of economic performance and equality. The modeling results suggest that policy responses differ considerably between villages with poor, average, and good farmland resources, and the rental-subsidy policy is expected to be most effective at stimulating land rental markets in villages with average farmland resources. The rental subsidies are likely to move the agricultural system to a more productive state with more growth potential and less cost in most places. The rental-subsidy policy can also make every household in farmland-poor places better off and may be used to further address inequality in farmland resources. However, both policies show limited effects on increasing rural income, suggesting rural development will continue to depend on urbanization. We discuss how the government may use the rental subsidy as an instrument to facilitate urbanization to best benefit all rural households. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The conformational behavior of a giant DNA mediated by condensing agents in the bulk solution has been investigated through experimental and theoretical approaches. Experimentally, a pronounced conformational hysteresis is observed for folding and unfolding processes, by increasing and decreasing the concentration of condensing agent (polyethylene glycol) (PEG), respectively. To elucidate the observed hysteresis, a semiflexible chain model is studied by using Monte Carlo simulations for the coil-globule transition. In the simulations, the hysteresis loop emerges for stiff enough chains, indicating distinct pathways for folding and unfolding processes. Also, our results show that globular state is thermodynamically more stable than coiled state in the hysteresis loop. Our findings suggest that increasing chain stiffness may reduce the chain conformations relevant to the folding pathway, which impedes the folding process.

AB This paper aims to contribute to developing better ways for incorporating essential human elements in decision making processes for modelling of complex socio-ecological systems. It presents a step-wise methodology for integrating perceptions of stakeholders (qualitative) into formal simulation models (quantitative) with the ultimate goal of improving understanding and communication about decision making in complex socio-ecological systems. The methodology integrates cognitive mapping and agent based modelling. It cascades through a sequence of qualitative/soft and numerical methods comprising: (1) Interviews to elicit mental models; (2) Cognitive maps to represent and analyse individual and group mental models; (3) Time-sequence diagrams to chronologically structure the decision making process; (4) All-encompassing conceptual model of decision making, and (5) computational (in this case agent-based) Model. We apply the proposed methodology (labelled ICTAM) in a case study of viticulture irrigation in South Australia. Finally, we use strengths-weakness-opportunities-threats (SWOT) analysis to reflect on the methodology. Results show that the methodology leverages the use of cognitive mapping to capture the richness of decision making and mental models, and provides a combination of divergent and convergent analysis methods leading to the construction of an Agent Based Model.

AB The objective of this study is to examine the effects of the endogenous ligands leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) on seizure generation, the oxidant/antioxidant balance, and cytokine levels, which are a result of immune response in a convulsive seizure model. With this goal, Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups Group 1: Saline, Group 2: Saline + PTZ (65 mg/kg), Group 3: leptin (4 mg/kg) + PTZ, Group 4: ghrelin (80 mu g/kg) + PTZ, and Group 5: NPY (60 mu g/kg) + PTZ. All injections were delivered intraperitoneally, and simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) records were obtained. Seizure activity was scored by observing seizure behavior, and the onset time, latency, and seizure duration were determined according to the EEG records. At the end of the experiments, blood samples were obtained in all groups to assess the serum TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, FGF-2, galanin, nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) levels. The electrophysiological and biochemical findings (p < 0.05) of this study show that all three peptides have anticonvulsant effects in the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced generalized tonic-clonic convulsive seizure model. The reduction of the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytoldnes TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6 caused by leptin, ghrelin, and NPY shows that these peptides may have anti-inflammatory effects in epileptic seizures. Also, leptin significantly increases the serum levels of the endogenous anticonvulsive agent galanin. The fact that each one'of these endogenous peptides reduces the levels of MDA and increases the serum levels of GSH leads to the belief that they may have protective effects against oxidative damage that is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Our study contributes to the clarification of the role of these peptides in the brain in seizure-induced oxidative stress and immune system physiology and also presents new approaches to the etiology and treatment of tendency to epileptic seizures.

ID FLUID; PERMEABILITY; COMPOSITES
AB Purpose: To evaluate the influence of two perfusion solutions, saline and human plasma, on tensile bond strengths of five different light-curing materials in an in vitro investigation. Methods: 150 human third molars were used. All teeth were prepared in a special manner allowing the simulation of intrapulpal pressure and dentin perfusion. Dentin specimens with a thickness of 3.5 mm were obtained under standardized conditions. The specimens were randomly assigned to 10 experimental groups. Five groups were perfused with physiologic saline while with the other five with human plasma under constant hydrostatic pressure of 30 cm H2O was used for at least I hour. Tensile bond strength of the different dentin bonding agents and composite or compomer materials (A: Syntac/Tetric, B: Prime & Bond NT/Spectrum TPH, C: Solobond Plus/Arabesk, D: Compoglass SCA/Compoglass, E: Dyract PSA/Dyract) was evaluated using an Zwick Universal testing machine 10 minutes after light-curing. Results: Pairwise comparison showed a significant increase of bond strengths in all human plasma perfused subgroups (P < 0.05; Wilcoxon). The influence of the different dentin adhesives was significant (P < 0.001; ANOVA). The significantly highest values were observed for the composite groups Syntac/Tetric and Solobond Plus/Arabesk (P < 0.05; closed test procedure). The compomer Group D (Compoglass SCA/Compoglass) showed significantly decreased values compared to all other groups (P < 0.05; closed test procedure). Within the limitations of an in vitro study, it can be concluded that the use of human plasma might result in higher tensile bond strength compared to saline.

TI Message spreading in networks with stickiness and persistence: Large
   clustering does not always facilitate large-scale diffusion
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID EMERGENCE; DYNAMICS
AB Recent empirical studies have confirmed the key roles of complex contagion mechanisms such as memory, social reinforcement, and decay effects in information diffusion and behavior spreading. Inspired by this fact, we here propose a new agent-based model to capture the whole picture of the joint action of the three mechanisms in information spreading, by quantifying the complex contagion mechanisms as stickiness and persistence, and carry out extensive simulations of the model on various networks. By numerical simulations as well as theoretical analysis, we find that the stickiness of the message determines the critical dynamics of message diffusion on tree-like networks, whereas the persistence plays a decisive role on dense regular lattices. In either network, the greater persistence can effectively make the message more invasive. Of particular interest is that our research results renew our previous knowledge that messages can spread broader in networks with large clustering, which turns out to be only true when they can inform a non-zero fraction of the population in the limit of large system size.

AB The deleterious effects of nerve agents over the enzymes acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) turned these compounds into the most dangerous chemical weapons known. Among the antidotes in use today against these agents, oximes in combination with other drugs are the only treatment with any action. HI-6 and 2-PAM are cationic oximes proved to be effective for the reactivation of AChE inhibited by the nerve agents VX and sarin (GB). However, when it comes to reactivation of AChE inside the central or peripheral nervous systems, charged molecules present low diffusion due to low penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Uncharged oximes appear as an interesting alternative to solve this problem, but the development and enhancement of more efficient uncharged oximes capable of reactivating human ACIIE is still necessary. Given the limitations for in vivo and in vitro experimental studies with nerve agents, modeling is an important tool that can contribute to a better understanding of factors that may affect the efficiency of uncharged oximes. In order to investigate the interaction and behavior of cationic and uncharged oximes, we performed here molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding energies calculations of the known cationic oximes HI-6 and 2-PAM plus four uncharged oximes found in the literature, complexed with human AChE (HssACHE) conjugated with the nerve agents VX and GB. The uncharged oximes showed different behaviors, especially RS194B, which presented stability inside AChE-VX, but presented free binding energy lower than cationic oximes, suggesting that structural alterations could favor its interactions with these complexes. In contrast, HI-6 and 2-PAM showed higher affinities with more negative binding energy values and larger contribution of the amino acid Asp74, demonstrating the importance of the quaternary nitrogen to the affinity and interaction of oximes with AChE-GB and AChE-VX conjugates.

AB Collective behaviour has been studied in various fields of science. As an example, we may consider the patterns observed in living systems, whose aggregates form organized groups such as flocks of birds, herds of mammals and schools of fish. These aggregates may be formed as a consequence of an external stimulus or due to the local interaction among nearby specimens. As an example of the latter case one may think about a school of-fish, where each individual bases its behaviour on its perception of the position and velocity of its nearest neighbours. As a result of these interactions, global collective behaviour may emerge, originating and maintaining the cohesion of the aggregate. In this work, we model the collective movement of a school of fish using an agent-based model which follows biologically motivated behavioural rules previously proposed. The distributions of nearest neighbour distance and relative orientations between neighbouring fishes are measured and the results are found to be in good agreement with previous experimental measurements.

Design features include detailed tax return characteristics, taxpayer learning, social networks, and tax agency enforcement measures. The taxpayer's compliance reporting decision is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process that takes into account taxpayers' heterogeneous risk profiles and non-stationary beliefs about the expected costs associated with alternative reporting strategies. In order to comply with legal requirements prohibiting the disclosure of taxpayer information, artificial taxpayers are created using data from the Statistics of Income (SOI) Public Use File (PUF). Misreported amounts for major income and offset items are imputed to tax returns are based on examination results from random taxpayer audits. A hypothetical case study illustrates how IRCM can be used to compare alternative taxpayer audit selection strategies.

AB Due to the distributed nature of Denial-of-Service attacks, it is tremendously challenging to identify such malicious behavior using traditional intrusion detection systems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In the current paper, a bio-inspired method is introduced, namely the cooperative-based fuzzy artificial immune system (Co-FATS). It is a modular-based defense strategy derived from the danger theory of the human immune system. The agents synchronize and work with one another to calculate the abnormality of sensor behavior in terms of context antigen value (CAV) or attackers and update the fuzzy activation threshold for security response. In such a multi-node circumstance, the sniffer module adapts to the sink node to audit data by analyzing the packet components and sending the log file to the next layer. The fuzzy misuse detector module (FMDM) integrates with a danger detector module to identify the sources of danger signals. The infected sources are transmitted to the fuzzy Q-learning vaccination modules (FQVM) in order for particular, required action to enhance system abilities. The Cooperative Decision Making Modules (Co-DMM) incorporates danger detector module with the fuzzy Q-learning vaccination module to produce optimum defense strategies. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) was simulated using a network simulator. The model was subsequently compared against other existing soft computing methods, such as fuzzy logic controller (FLC), artificial immune system (AIS), and fuzzy Q-learning (FQL), in terms of detection accuracy, counter-defense, network lifetime and energy consumption, to demonstrate its efficiency and viability. The proposed method improves detection accuracy and successful defense rate performance against attacks compared to conventional empirical methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In the evolutionary minority game (EMG), agents compete for a limited resource and are rewarded if they correctly select the minority behaviour. At each time step, agents make their decision based on the aggregate history of past moves and an internal parameter-the probability that the individual follows the given strategy. In this study, the effects of strategic imitation among agents are examined. Here, I combine and extend previous work using local information transmission mechanisms to promote coordination in the population. Extensive numerical simulations using different network architectures, ranging from regular lattices to random networks, are used to investigate the population dynamics. The results suggest that agents sharing information in small-world networks can coordinate their behaviour more effectively than agents playing the standard EMG. However, both the network re-wiring probability and level of imitation significantly impact on performance. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The significant progress in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experienced over the last 3 decades has been driven mainly by the empirical combination of antileukemic drugs in highly intensive therapies. Further progress in the management of ALL is currently limited, however, by our incomplete understanding of the molecular pathways involved in leukemia pathogenesis and by the lack of useful prognostic markers for most patients. ne recent development of microarray technology, which allows the simultaneous analysis of gene expression levels for thousands of transcripts, has accelerated significantly the rate of progress in our understanding of the molecular basis of ALL. During the last few years, analysis of ALL samples with DNA arrays has facilitated the recognition of molecularly distinct leukemia groups, advanced our knowledge of the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to chemotherapy, generated novel prognostic prediction tools, and identified new targets for the development of molecularly tailored antileukemic agents. Thus, the introduction of microarray gene expression profiling has opened the opportunity for accelerated progress in the diagnosis and therapy of ALL, which will ultimately result in the development of novel highly effective and less toxic treatments for this disease.

   Adsorption at the Air-Water Interface
SO LANGMUIR
LA English
DT Article
AB Surfactants are centrally important in many scientific and engineering fields and are used for many purposes such as foaming agents and detergents. However, many challenges remain in providing a comprehensive understanding of their behavior. Here, we provide a brief historical overview of the study of surfactant adsorption at the air-water interface, followed by a discussion of some recent advances in this area from our group. The main focus is on incorporating an accurate description of the adsorption layer thickness of surfactant at the air-water interface. Surfactants have a wide distribution at the air-water interface, which can have a significant effect on important properties such as the surface excess, surface tension, and surface potential. We have developed a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (MPB) model to describe this effect, which we outline here. We also address the remaining challenges and future research directions in this area. We believe that experimental techniques, modeling, and simulation should be combined to form a holistic picture of surfactant adsorption at the air-water interface.

AB The aim of the research presented in this paper is to develop a simulation testbed to support businesses in their decision-making about the potential use of electronic matching mechanisms. Matching mechanisms are used to match supply and demand of independent selling and buying organizations, each having their own goals, requirements and interests. The autonomous characteristics of agent-based systems and process orientation of discrete-event simulation are combined in our agent-based simulation testbed. In this way both the autonomous trading behavior of organizations and their business processes can be simulated. Several predefined components containing the behavior of various kinds of matching mechanism have been developed. These components can be further customized to model an empirical situation more closely. The approach is illustrated with a case study in the computer market. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

ID MONOCULAR SLAM
AB Object-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a more natural and robust way for agents to interact with their surrounding environment. However, it introduces a problem of semantic objects association. Correct object association is the key factor to achieve a successful object SLAM system because object association and SLAM are inherently coupled and have not been well tackled yet. A novel formulation of the object association problem based on a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is proposed. Through the HDP, we can hierarchically associate the grouped object measurements. This can improve the object association accuracy and computation efficiency. Thanks to the novel formulation, the proposed method is also able to correct failure object associations according to its sampling inference algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce object poses to the processing of pose optimization. The object association and pose optimization are then solved in a tightly coupled way, by which both aspects can promote each other. The proposed method is evaluated on indoor and outdoor datasets and the experimental results show a very impressive improvement with respect to the traditional SLAM.

ID FRAGMENTATION-CHAIN-TRANSFER; FREE-RADICAL POLYMERIZATION; POLYMERS
AB This work has demonstrated that for the first time a single RAFT agent (i. e., difunctional) can be used in conjunction with a radical initiator to obtain a desired M-n and PDI with controlled rates of polymerization. Simulations were used not only to verify the model but also to provide us with a predictive tool to generate other MWDs. It was also shown that all the MWDs prepared in this work could be translated to higher molecular weights through chain extension experiments with little or no compromise in the control of end group functionality. The ratio of monofunctional to difunctional SdC(CH2Ph)S- end groups, XPX and XP (where X) S=C(CH2Ph) S-), can be controlled by simply changing the concentration of initiator, AIBN. Importantly, the amount of dead polymer is extremely low and fulfils the criterion as suggested by Szwarc (Nature 1956) that to meet "living" requirements nonfunctional polymeric species formed by side reactions in the process should be undetectable by analytical techniques. In addition, this novel methodology will allow the synthesis of AB, ABA, and statistical multiblock copolymers with predetermined ratios to be produced in a one-pot reaction.

AB The karyotypic features of cancer cells have not been a particular focus of anticancer drug targeting either as guidance for treatment or as specific drug targets themselves. Cancer cell lines typically have considerable, characteristic, and variable chromosomal aberrations. Here, we consider small-molecule screening data across the National Cancer Institute's 60 tumor cell line drug screening panel (NCI-60) analyzed for specific association with karyotypic variables (numerical and structural complexity and heterogeneity) determined for these same cell lines. This analysis is carried out with the aid of a self-organizing map allowing for a simultaneous assessment of all screened compounds, revealing an association between karyotypic variables and a unique part of the cytotoxic response space. Thirteen groups of compounds based on related specific chemical structural motifs are identified as possible leads for anticancer drug discovery. These compounds form distinct groups of molecules associated with relatively unexplored regions of the NCI-60 self-organizing map where anticancer agents currently standard in the clinic are not present. We suggest that compounds identified in this study may represent new classes of potential anticancer agents.

AB Sublingual laser blood irradiation (SLBI) was applied into a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), aimed at inducing disease remission. 105 children with JIA, without an adequate response to classical treatment, were administrated a disease modifying drug (Methotrexate) and were randomly assigned to three groups. Group I (36 patients) received SLBI with the Weberneedle Lasershower Mouth Applicator with three wavelengths (635 nm, 536 nm, and 405 nm), 5 mW maximum output power each, in continuous mode, simultaneously, for 20 minutes daily, 7 successive sessions per month, repeated every 7 weeks, for three times. Group II (36 patients) received placebo SLBI. Group III (33 patients) received only treatment with Methotrexate. Evaluation was performed using American College of Rheumatology Pediatric criteria (ACR Pedi) at study enrollment and at 8, 16, 24, and 48 weeks. At the end of study, there was an improvement of the ACR Pedi 30 by 86.11% in SLBI group compared to only 61.11% in Group II, respectively, and 60.6% in Group III (P = 0.001), with significant statistical differences. SLBI has reduced the pain, lowered the number of articulations with movement limitation, increased the quality of life, and made it possible to avoid the administration of biological agents.

AB Background: The epidural administration of local anaesthetic agents was advocated for use in any surgical procedure caudal to the diaphragm in dogs but was superior for procedures involving the pelvis, hind limbs, and perineal area. The aim of this study was to determine anaesthetic profiles of bupivacaine (BP) and levobupivacaine (LP) in epidural anaesthesia (EA) and to compare their effects on hemodynamics, blood gases, hematological and biochemical parameters in conscious dogs.
   Materials, Methods & Results: In this study, a total of 20 adult male dogs from different breeds referred to our clinics for castration purposes were used and allocated into two groups; 10 dogs in BP and 10 dogs in LP groups. In this study, each animal received a 0.5% of either BP or LP epidurally, (a fixed total volume of 0.2 mL/kg) followed by 0.3 mL saline solution to flush the dead space in the valve and catheter. Throughout the epidural anaesthesia, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial blood pressure, and body temperature were monitored. Similarly, during the study, haematological measurements at 0th, 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th h and biochemical measurements at 0th, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 24th h in blood samples were examined. Simultaneously, blood gases, and Na+ and K+ levels in arterial blood samples were measured at 0th, 30th, 60th, 120th and 240th min. Nocifensive and motor block status were qualitatively assessed at regular intervals: baseline, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120 min and every 30 min thereafter. Duration of the analgesia was 124.9 +/- 28.6 min in the BP group and 77.5 +/- 16.8 min in the LP group (P < 0.05). Motor block duration was determined as 248.2 +/- 44.2 min for the BP group and 185.9 +/- 38.08 min for the LP group (P > 0.05). Motor and sensory block time was longer in the BP group than in the LP group, and similarly, BP generated sensory and motor block in a shorter period of time. While complete motor block was not observed in two animals in the LP group, complete motor block was seen in all the animals in the BP group. Motor block level was determined as 2.8 +/- 0.4 in the LP group and 3 +/- 00 in the BP group. There were no statistically significant differences between the levels of motor block. In both groups, decreased heart rate and arterial blood pressure were seen following EA. This decline was higher in the BP group. After epidural anaesthesia, slight decline in respiratory rate and body temperature were observed in both groups. There were no significant differences between the groups regarding cardiopulmonary data. Within each group, statistically significant changes in respiratory rates, body temperatures and blood pressures with regards to times were observed in both groups (P < 0.05).
   Discussion: Similar to the data in the literature, the duration of analgesia and motor block were longer with BP than with LP, and both agents showed close initiation analgesia and motor blockade. The reason for longer motor block by BP may be attributed to its higher lipophilic nature and penetration ability to the myeliniated motor fibrils. In present study, arterial blood pressure dropped, and this was higher in the BP group than in the LP group. These drops were attributed to the ability of sympathetic blockade of BP and LP.

AB The theoretical literature from 1985 to the present on the evolution of learning strategies in variable environments is reviewed, with the focus on deterministic dynamical models that are amenable to local stability analysis, and on deterministic models yielding evolutionarily stable strategies. Individual learning, unbiased and biased social learning, mixed learning, and learning schedules are considered. A rapidly changing environment or frequent migration in a spatially heterogeneous environment favors individual learning over unbiased social learning. However, results are not so straightforward in the context of learning schedules or when biases in social learning are introduced. The three major methods of modeling temporal environmental change coevolutionary, two-timescale, and information decay are compared and shown to sometimes yield contradictory results. The so-called Rogers' paradox is inherent in the two-timescale method as originally applied to the evolution of pure strategies, but is often eliminated when the other methods are used. Moreover, Rogers' paradox is not observed for the mixed learning strategies and learning schedules that we review. We believe that further theoretical work is necessary on learning schedules and biased social learning, based on models that are logically consistent and empirically pertinent. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB Radiation-engineered poly(N-vinyl pyrrolidone) nanogels are very interesting biocompatible nanocarriers for i.v. administration of therapeutics and contrast agents for bioimaging. The manufacturing process is fast and effective, it grants excellent control of particle size and simultaneous sterilization of the formed nanogels. Interestingly, primary amino groups and carboxyl groups, useful for (bio) conjugation, are also formed in a dose-dependent fashion. In this paper, by means of both numerical simulations and experiments, the origin of nanogel size control and functionalization is investigated. This understanding offers a new dimension for the design and production of radiation-sculptured multifunctional nanocarriers from aqueous solutions of polymers.

AB Preoperative MRI of the breasts has been proven to be the most sensitive imaging modality in the detection of multifocal or multicentric tumor manifestations as well as simultaneous contralateral breast cancer. The aim of the presented retrospective study was to evaluate the benefit of preoperative MRI for patients with breast cancer. Preoperative MRI performed in 121 patients (group A) were compared to 225 patients without preoperative MRI (group B). Patients of group A underwent contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the breast using a 2D FLASH sequence technique (TR/TE/FA 336 ms/5 ms/90degrees; 32 slices of 4-mm thickness, time of acquisition 1:27 min, contrast agent dosage 0.1 mmol Gd-DTPA/kg bw). All patients had histologically verified breast cancer and follow-up for more than 20 months (mean time group A: 40.3 months, group B: 41 months). Both groups received the same types of systemic treatment after breast conserving surgery. The in-breast tumor recurrence rate in group A was 1/86 (1.2 %) compared to 9/133 (6.8 %) in group B. Contralateral carcinoma were detected within follow-up in 2/121 (1.7 %) in group A vs. 9/225 (4 %) in group B. All results were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Based on these results, preoperative MRI of the breasts is recommended in patients with histopathologically verified breast cancer for local staging.

AB Cyclochiral resorcinarenes, that maintain their cyclochirality by means of hydrogen bonds, were synthesized by a sequence of reactions involving the Mannich reaction, removal of the N,O-acetal bridge and subsequent N-substitution with an RCO group. During this study it was found that ethyl nitroacetate is a mild and very efficient agent for N, O-acetal bridge removal. The resulting resorcinarenes 4a - j exist in cyclochiral/inherently chiral kite conformations ( resembling 4-bladed propellers) that are stabilized by eight hydrogen bonds ( in both solid state and solution). It is shown that the cycloisomerization process is characterized by the relatively high racemization barrier (14.6 - 18.5 kcal mol(-1) as determined by 2D EXSY) and thus it can be concluded that the transformation of one cycloconformer into the other requires the simultaneous rupture of all eight hydrogen bonds. For derivatives with additional stereogenic centers two cyclodiastereoisomeric conformations were detected ( diastereomeric excess in the range of 72% up to > 95%). The experimental results are additionally supported by AM1 semi-empirical calculations.

AB This study was carried out to test the effect of chlorthalidone (Chlor) treatment on the vascular responsiveness to acetylcholine (Ach) and adenosine disphosphate (ADP) under different extracellular calcium concentrations (Ca-e(2+)) in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats. Half of the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats were simultaneously given Chlor (8 mg day(-1), p.o.), after the twentieth day of DOCA, until the fortieth day. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was reduced (P<0.01) in DOCA-salt-Chlor (121+/-3 mmHg) compared to DOCA-salt (175+/-3 mmHg) rats. Chlor reduced the high plasma sodium of DOCA-salt to levels of the normotensive groups. The basal perfusion pressure of the isolated mesenteric vascular bed (MVB) was not modified by Ca-e(2+) changing or previous addition of ouabain. At normal and low Ca-e(2+) the vasodilator effect of Ach in the MVB was reduced (P<0.01) in DOCA-salt and less (P<0.05) in the salt-control rats, Chlor shifted the curve of DOCA-salt backward to control group curves. In high Ca-e(2+) the vasodilator responses to Ach were reduced (P<0.01) both in normal-control and DOCA-salt+Chlor but not in salt-control and DOCA-salt group. The vasodilator effect of ADP to different Ca-e(2+) was similar in presence of normal and low Ca-e(2+) in normal-control rats and it was reduced (P<0.01) in presence of high Ca-e(2+) in the DOCA-salt group. Chlor restored the responses to ADP to normal-control level. Under ouabain-treatment, the vasodilatation duration was reduced (P<0.05) in all groups. It was shorter (P<0.01) in DOCA-salt than in the other ones. Chlor completely abolished this difference. The MAP reduction in DOCA-salt rats by chlor could also be associated with a restored normal responsiveness of endothelial cells to endogenous vasodilator, for example Ach and ADP, since sodium nitroprusside did not exhibit differences among the various treatments. This diuretic agent seems to elicit its effect through a reduction in plasma sodium content of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. (C) 1996 The Italian Pharmacological Society

AB Resolutions higher than the optical diffraction limit are often desired in the context of cellular imaging and the study of disease progression at the cellular level. However, three-dimensional super-resolution imaging without reliance on exogenous contrast agents has so far not been achieved. We present nanoscale photoacoustic tomography (nPAT), an imaging modality based on the photoacoustic effect. nPAT can achieve a dramatic improvement in the axial resolution of the photoacoustic imaging. We derive the theoretical resolution and sensitivity of nPAT and demonstrate that nPAT can achieve a maximum axial resolution of 9.2 nm. We also demonstrate that nPAT can theoretically detect smaller numbers of molecules (similar to 273) than conventional photoacoustic microscopy due to its ability to detect acoustic signals very close to the photoacoustic source. We simulate nPAT imaging of malaria-infected red blood cells (RBCs) using digital phantoms generated from real biological samples, showing nPAT imaging of the RBC at different stages of infection. These simulations show the potential of nPAT to nondestructively image RBCs at the nanometer resolutions for in vivo samples without the use of exogenous contrast agents. Simulations of nPAT-enabled functional imaging show that nPAT can yield insight into malarial metabolism and biocrystallization processes. We believe that the experimental realization of nPAT has important applications in biomedicine. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB Peripheral arterial occlusive disease is a chronic pathology affecting at least 8-12 million people in the USA, typically treated with a vein graft bypass or through the deployment of a stent in order to restore the physiological circulation. Failure of peripheral endovascular interventions occurs at the intersection of vascular biology, biomechanics, and clinical decision making. It is our hypothesis that the majority of endovascular treatment approaches share the same driving mechanisms and that a deep understanding of the adaptation process is pivotal in order to improve the current outcome of the procedure. The postsurgical adaptation of vein graft bypasses offers the perfect example of how the balance between intimal hyperplasia and wall remodeling determines the failure or the success of the intervention. Accordingly, this work presents a versatile computational model able to capture the feedback loop that describes the interaction between events at cellular/tissue level and mechano-environmental conditions. The work here presented is a generalization and an improvement of a previous work by our group of investigators, where an agent-based model uses a cellular automata principle on a fixed hexagonal grid to reproduce the leading events of the graft's restenosis. The new hybrid model here presented allows a more realistic simulation both of the biological laws that drive the cellular behavior and of the active role of the membranes that separate the various layers of the vein. The novel feature is to use an immersed boundary implementation of a highly viscous flow to represent SMC motility and matrix reorganization in response to graft adaptation. Our implementation is modular, and this makes us able to choose the right compromise between closeness to the physiological reality and complexity of the model. The focus of this paper is to offer a new modular implementation that combines the best features of an agent-based model, continuum mechanics, and particle-tracking methods to cope with the multiscale nature of the adaptation phenomena. This hybrid method allows us to quickly test various hypotheses with a particular attention to cellular motility, a process that we demonstrated should be driven by mechanical homeostasis in order to maintain the right balance between cells and extracellular matrix in order to reproduce a distribution similar to histological experimental data from vein grafts.

AB In this paper, the researcher introduces a new chain coding mechanism that employs a predator-prey agent-based modeling simulation with some modifications and simplifications and uses it in compression. In the proposed method, an image is ultimately represented by a virtual world consisting of three agent types: wolves, sheep, and paths. While sheep and paths do not change their locations during the program execution, wolves search for sheep to prey on. With each step, a wolf can determine its path by choosing between seven pertinent moves depending on the encountered information. The algorithm keeps track of the wolves' initial locations and their movements and uses this as a new image representation. Additionally, the researcher introduces the 'Lengthy Advance Move,' the purpose of which is to group particular consecutive codes and further reduce the chain. This, in turn, allows the researcher to experiment with different variations of the algorithm. Finally, the researcher applies arithmetic coding on the series of movements for extra compression. The experimental results reveal that the current algorithm generates higher compression ratios than many standardized algorithms, including JBIG family algorithms. Most importantly, paired-sample t-tests reveal significant differences between the findings of the wolf-sheep predation algorithm and the other algorithms used as benchmarks for comparisons.

AB A quantitative flow measurement method that utilizes a sequence of photoacoustic images is described. The method is based on the use of gold nanorods as a contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging. The peak optical absorption wavelength of a gold nanorod depends on its aspect ratio, which can be altered by laser irradiation (we establish a wash-in flow estimation method of this process). The concentration of nanorods with a particular aspect ratio inside a region of interest is affected by both laser-induced shape changes and replenishment of nanorods at a rate determined by the flow velocity. In this study, the concentration is monitored using a custom-designed, high-frame-rate photoacoustic imaging system. This imaging system consists of fiber bundles for wide area laser irradiation, a laser ultrasonic transducer array, and an ultrasound front-end subsystem that allows acoustic data to be acquired simultaneously from 64 transducer elements. Currently, the frame rate of this system is limited by the pulse-repetition frequency of the laser (i.e., 15 Hz). With this system, experimental results from a chicken breast tissue show that flow velocities from 0.125 to 2 mm/s can be measured with an average error of 31.3%.

AB The objective of this study was the utilisation of Cucumis melo biomass as a new precursor to produce highly efficient activated carbons by chemical activation method using phosphoric acid (H3PO4) as the activating agent and their evaluation with high removal efficiency (%) values of SN, BPA and Cr (VI). The effects of four factors controlling the activation process, such as time of activation (1-3 h), the temperature of activation (300-500 degrees C), the concentration of H3PO4 (1.5-2.5 mol/L) and contact time (60-90 min) were used. In order to reduce the number of experiments, full factorial experimental design at two levels (2(4)) were carried out in order to achieve simultaneously optimal preparation conditions and high removal of SN, BPA and Cr (VI). The experimental results showed that the removal efficiency of SN and BPA onto activated carbons was more influenced by the temperature of activation and time of activation with a positive effect. Further, and in same as, the interaction between time of activation and temperature of activation had a negative effect on the SN and BPA removal. While the factors influenced the chromium removal are the H3PO4 concentration and the temperature of activation with a positive effect. Moreover, the interaction between the temperature of activation and H3PO4 concentration had a negative impact for chromium ions removal. Based on the statistical data, the best conditions for the removal of SN, BPA and Cr (VI) by the prepared activated carbon samples were investigated. The maximum removal efficiency of SN, BPA and Cr (VI) obtained under these experimental conditions were 94.20%, 94.14% and 96.80% respectively. Thus, the characterisation results showed that the surface of cucumis melo activated carbon has acidic nature and have a large amount of acidic functional groups with a BET surface area of 407.94 m(2)/g.

AB Wet granulation process requires the addition of a coating agent or binder, typically composed of surfactants such as hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose (HPMC), water and a small amount of filler such as stearic acid (SA). In dry granulation however, the coating agent is added to the system in the form of fine solid particles. In both cases, a successful granulation requires good affinity between host and guest particles. In this study, we compare two approaches to predict the binder-substrate affinity in dry and in aqueous media, one based on the work of adhesion and the other based on the ideal tensile strength (Rowe, 1988). The novelties of this paper are four folds. First, the equations used in both approaches are generalized and rewritten as a function of the Hildebrand solubility parameter delta. delta is obtained from molecular simulations or predicted from HSPiP group contribution method. Secondly, a correlation between delta and the experimental surface tension gamma is established for cellulose derivative (such as HPMC and ethyl cellulose). Thirdly, the concept of ideal tensile strength, originally formalized by Gardon (1967) for binary systems, is extended to ternary systems and applied for granulation in aqueous media. Fourthly, the approaches are tested for various systems and compared to experimental observations. For dry binary systems, predicted adhesive and cohesive properties agree with literature experimental observations, but the work of adhesion approach performs better than the ideal tensile strength approach. Both approaches predict that HPMC is a good binder for microaystalline cellulose (MCC). The results also indicate that polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG400) has a good affinity with HPMC and stearic acid. For ternary aqueous systems, the results fully agree with the observations of Laboulfie et al. (2013). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB H-1 and C-13 NMR spectra of trypsin and ribonuclease, stabilized by chemical modification with a hydrophilic polymer, have been obtained over a wide pH range (1-11). The spectral features, referred to some nuclei of the catalytic sites (the ''catalytic triad'' for trypsin and the His-12-His-119 pair for ribonuclease), have been identified using different NMR techniques as well as chemical modification with selective reagents. It is found that monoprotonation of these systems leads to symmetrical (or quasi-symmetrical) H-bonds formed between the basic groups. This allows us to explain the discrepancies between experimental data obtained by different authors on the protonation sites in these catalytic systems. The simulation of the catalytic triad by a N-15 labeled low molecular weight model has led us to the conclusion that external agents do not cause any discrete proton transfers but do cause a smooth shift of the bridging protons from one basic atom to another, with the quasi-symmetrical H-bonds being formed in intermediate cases. On the basis of these experimental data, a new concept has been proposed for the mechanism of acid base catalysis performed by the pairs of weak basic groups like His-Im and Asp(Glu)-COO- (pK(a) 3-7) which are not capable of proton abstraction from alcoholic or water OH groups (pK(a) > 13). This catalysis may consist on the one hand of changing the charge densities on reacting groups due to strong H-bonding and, on the other hand, of facilitating the free movement of a proton in the field of several basic atoms when going along the reaction coordinate. The energy of the very strong H-bonds thus formed diminishes the activation energy of the reaction.

AB PURPOSE. To evaluate the efficacy of a biodegradable polymeric scleral plug containing the immunosuppressive agent, FK506, in a rabbit model for experimental uveitis.
   METHODS. The scleral plugs were prepared by dissolving poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide; PLGA) and FK506 (weight, 8.5 mg; length, 5 mm; 1% FK506). The release of FK506 was evaluated in vitro by spectrophotometry on days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 35. In vivo, FK506 concentrations of the vitreous were measured by high performance liquid chromatography 2 and 4 weeks after intravitreous plug implantation in pigmented rabbits. Sixteen pigmented rabbits were immunized twice subcutaneously with 10 mg of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra antigen. Twelve days later, the right eyes of all rabbits were challenged with an intravitreal injection of 50 mug of antigen. After the first challenge, the 16 eyes of 16 pigmented rabbits were divided into two groups. Scleral plugs were implanted into the vitreous of the right eye of eight rabbits. Eight control rabbi's received a sham device. The aqueous protein concentrations and cell counts were determined on postchallenge days 7, 14, and 28. To simulated chronic inflammation, the eyes were rechallenged with intravitreal antigen on day 14 and were observed for 1 month. Inflammation of the anterior chamber and the vitreous were graded clinically by two masked observers. Retinal function was evaluated by electroretinography (ERG) and histologic examination.
   RESULTS. Clinical scores (anterior chamber cells, flare, and vitreous opacity) showed that treated eyes had significantly less inflammation than untreated eyes (P < 0.001). Quantitative analysis of inflammatory cells (P < 0.001) and protein concentrations (P < 0.0001) in the anterior chamber showed significant decreases in treated eyes. Histopathologic examination showed marked inflammation and tissue disorganization in the untreated eyes. No retinal toxicity was detected, histopathologically and electroretinographically. After antigen rechallenge, inflammation in experimental eyes was still less than in control eyes.
   CONCLUSIONS. Intravitreal sustained-release of FK506 from a biodegradable polymeric scleral plug was highly effective in suppressing the inflammation of experimental uveitis in a rabbit model for at least 6 weeks. This device may be useful in the management of patients with severe chronic uveitis.

AB Different from a large number of existing studies in the literature, this paper addresses two important issues in managing production lines, the problems of line balancing and model sequencing, concurrently. A novel hybrid agent-based ant colony optimization-genetic algorithm approach is developed for the solution of mixed model parallel two-sided assembly line balancing and sequencing problem. The existing agent-based ant colony optimization algorithm is enhanced with the integration of a new genetic algorithm-based model sequencing mechanism. The algorithm provides ants the opportunity of selecting a random behavior among ten heuristics commonly used in the line balancing domain. A numerical example is given to illustrate the solution building procedure of the algorithm and the evolution of the chromosomes. The performance of the developed algorithm is also assessed through test problems and analysis of their solutions through a statistical test, namely paired sample t test. In accordance with the test results, it is statistically proven that the integrated genetic algorithm-based model sequencing engine helps agent-based ant colony optimization algorithm robustly find significantly better quality solutions.

AB A financial agent-based time series model is developed and investigated by the stochastic contact systems. Multicolor contact system, as one of statistical physics systems, is applied to model a random stock price process for investigating the fluctuation dynamics of financial market. The interaction and dispersal of different types of investment attitudes in a financial market is imitated by viruses spreading in a multicolor contact system, and we suppose that the investment attitudes of market participants contribute to the volatilities of financial time series. We introduce a volatility duration analysis to detect the duration and intensity relationship of time series for both SSECI and the financial model. Furthermore, the empirical research is also presented to study the nonlinear behaviors of returns for the actual data and the simulation data.

AB Purpose
   Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in urinary tract infection (UTI) has spread worldwide; one cause is overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolone antibacterials. To improve antimicrobial agent administration, this study aimed to calculate a probability prediction formula to predict the organism strain causing UTI in real time from dip-stick testing and flow cytometry.
   Methodology
   We examined 372 outpatient spot urine samples with observed pyuria and bacteriuria using dip-stick testing and flow cytometry. We performed multiple logistic-regression analysis on the basis of 11 measurement items and BACT scattergram analysis with age and sex as explanatory variables and each strain as the response variable and calculated a probability prediction formula.
   Results
   The best prediction formula for discrimination of the bacilli group and cocci or polymicrobial group was a model with 5 explanatory variables that included percentage of scattergram dots in an angular area of 0-25 degrees (P< 0.001), sex (P< 0.001), nitrite (P = 0.002), and ketones (P = 0.133). For a predicted cut-off value of Y = 0.395, sensitivity was 0.867 and specificity was 0.775 (cross-validation group: sensitivity = 0.840, specificity = 0.760). The best prediction formula for P. mirabilis and other bacilli was a model with percentage of scattergram dots in an angular area of 0-20 degrees (P< 0.001) and nitrite (P = 0.090). For a predicted cut-off value of Y = 0.064, sensitivity was 0.889 and specificity was 0.788 (cross-validation group: sensitivity = 1.000, specificity = 0.766).
   Conclusion

AB Objective: To evaluate short- and long-term shear bond strengths of 4 luting agents to zirconia following different surface treatments.
   Method and Materials: A total of 320 ceramic specimens fabricated from a commercial zirconium oxide ceramic (Lava) were randomly divided into 4 groups: left untreated (NOT), airborne-particle abraded (SND), Rocatec tribochemical silica/silane coated (ROC), or ground and polished (GRD). Resin composite cylinders were bonded to the zirconia specimens with resin composite luting agent RelyX ARC (ARC), universal adhesive resin composite RelyX Unicem (UNI), adhesive-phosphatemonomer-containing resin composite Panavia F (PAN), or the hybrid glass-ionomer cement RelyX Luting (LUT). Subgroups of 10 specimens were stored in distilled water (37 degrees C) for 3 days (ST) or stored for 180 days and thermocycled for 12,000 cycles (LT/TC) before shear bond strength was tested. Statistical analyses included Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon 2-sample rank sum test (u =.01).
   Results: Short-term shear bond strengths were higher with ROC than with SND, which were both greater than GRD or NOT UNI revealed higher shear bond strengths than PAN, ARC, and LUT. LT/TC significantly decreased shear bond strength values. GRD and NOT produced the lowest shear bond strengths. SND and ROC significantly increased bond strength. ROC generally yielded the highest long-term shear bond strength, especially with UNI, PAN, or ARC. These were similar to SND and PAN, which revealed the highest long-term shear bond strengths.
   Conclusions: Surface treatment, luting agent, and storage conditions significantly influence shear bond strengths to zirconia. Artificial aging significantly reduces shear bond strengths. Airborne-particle abrasion combined with a resin composite containing adhesive phosphate monomers or tribochemical silica/silane coating combined with any of the tested resin composite luting agents provides superior long-term shear bond strength values.

AB This study combines the disciplines of behavioral finance and an extension of econophysics, namely the concepts and mathematical structure of quantum physics. We apply the formalism of quantum theory to model the dynamics of some correlated financial assets, where the proposed model can be potentially applied for developing a long-term prognosis of asset price formation. At the informational level, the asset price states interact with each other by the means of a "financial bath". The latter is composed of agents' expectations about the future developments of asset prices on the finance market, as well as financially important information from mass-media, society, and politicians. One of the essential behavioral factors leading to the quantum-like dynamics of asset prices is the irrationality of agents' expectations operating on the finance market. These expectations lead to a deeper type of uncertainty concerning the future price dynamics of the assets, than given by a classical probability theory, e.g., in the framework of the classical financial mathematics, which is based on the theory of stochastic processes. The quantum dimension of the uncertainty in price dynamics is expressed in the form of the price-states superposition and entanglement between the prices of the different financial assets. In our model, the resolution of this deep quantum uncertainty is mathematically captured with the aid of the quantum master equation (its quantum Markov approximation). We illustrate our model of preparation of a future asset price prognosis by a numerical simulation, involving two correlated assets. Their returns interact more intensively, than understood by a classical statistical correlation. The model predictions can be extended to more complex models to obtain price configuration for multiple assets and portfolios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We introduce a novel scheme for automatically deriving synthetic walking (locomotion) and movement (steering and avoidance) behavior in simulation from simple trajectory samples. We use a combination of observed and recorded real-world movement trajectory samples in conjunction with synthetic, agent-generated, movement as inputs to a machine-learning scheme. This scheme produces movement behavior for non-sampled scenarios in simulation, for applications that can differ widely from the original collection settings. It does this by benchmarking a simulated pedestrian's relative behavioral geography, local physical environment, and neighboring agent-pedestrians; using spatial analysis, spatial data access, classification, and clustering. The scheme then weights, trains, and tunes likely synthetic movement behavior, per-agent, per-location, per-time-step, and per-scenario. To prove its usefulness, we demonstrate the task of generating synthetic, non-sampled, agent-based pedestrian movement in simulated urban environments, where the scheme proves to be a useful substitute for traditional transition-driven methods for determining agent behavior. The potential broader applications of the scheme are numerous and include the design and delivery of location-based services, evaluation of architectures for mobile communications technologies, what-if experimentation in agent-based models with hypotheses that are informed or translated from data, and the construction of algorithms for extracting and annotating space-time paths in massive data-sets.

AB The evolution of public opinion using tools and concepts borrowed from Statistical Physics is an emerging area within the field of Sociophysics. In the present paper, a Statistical Physics model was developed to study the evolution of the ideological self-positioning of an ensemble of agents. The model consists of an array of L components, each one of which represents the ideology of an agent. The proposed mechanism is based on the "voter model", in which one agent can adopt the opinion of another one if the difference of their opinions lies within a certain range. The existence of "undecided" agents (i.e. agents with no definite opinion) was implemented in the model. The possibility of radicalization of an agent's opinion upon interaction with another one was also implemented. The results of our simulations are compared to statistical data taken from the Latinobarometro databank for the cases of Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Uruguay in the last decade. Among other results, the effect of taking into account the undecided agents is the formation of a single peak at the middle of the ideological spectrum (which corresponds to a centrist ideological position), in agreement with the real cases studied.

AB The use of apron buses for transporting passengers from the airport terminal to the airplane has become common practice for a series of airports worldwide. Airline companies have become increasingly aware of this practice and have added information to their boarding passes to suggest the airplane door passengers should use while boarding the airplane. In contrast, many of the literatures methods to reduce boarding time assume the presence of a jet-bridge connecting the airplane to the terminal. These boarding methods are by seat and by group methods. The use of the apron buses for passengers transport limits the usage of these methods because, in most cases now, only two apron buses are needed for transporting the passengers. With two apron buses, boarding control is limited to deciding on which passengers to assign to each of the two buses. We propose 15 new methods that we tested against the previously published Back-to-front method adapted for the apron buses case, by considering 7 luggage situations. An agent-based model in NetLogo is created based on field trials and considerations made in the literature, and we used this model for simulations. Experimental results show that the best performing proposed methods combine aspects of the WilMA and Reverse Pyramid boarding methods adapted for apron buses. The best proposed method can reduce boarding time by up to 39.2 when compared to the benchmark Back-to-front method.

AB Objective:To evaluate the convective transport characteristics of glucose and the effect of high glucose and insulin during experimental peritoneal dialysis in rat.
   Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 300 - 400 g were used in this study. Mannitol (5%) was used as osmotic agent. Glucose was added to dialysis solution to yield a concentration of 100 mg/dL (group 1) or 300 mg/dL (group 2). Mannitol solution (5%) containing the same concentration of electrolytes and lactate but without glucose was used as control (group 3). In group 2, blood sugar was maintained at approximately 300 mg/dL by continuous intravenous infusion of 25% glucose solution and 0.9% NaCl solution. A 2-hour dwell study was performed with 30 mt of test solutions. Intraperitoneal volume was calculated by volume marker (18.5 kBq of I-131-human radioiodinated serum albumin, RISA) dilution with corrections made for the elimination of RISA from the peritoneal cavity (K-E) and sample volume. The diffusive mass transport coefficient (K-BD) and sieving coefficient (S-BRF) were calculated by using the Babb-Randerson-Farrell model. S was also calculated directly by using isocratic methods (S-I). The peritoneal fluid absorption rate (K-E) was taken into account for the calculation of S-I.
   Results: Intraperitoneal volume was significantly higher in group 2 compared with groups 1 and 3. Peritoneal fluid absorption rate, K-E, was similar in all three groups. S-BRF and S-I for glucose were significantly lower in group 2 compared with groups 1 and 3. S-BRF for glucose in group 2 was below zero and S-I near zero. K-BD for glucose was significantly higher in group 2 than in groups 1 and 3. Plasma and dialysate concentrations of insulin increased during the initial hour and then decreased to the baseline value in groups 1 and 3, while in group 2 it continuously increased.
   Conclusion: Significantly lower sieving coefficients for glucose in the high glucose and high insulin group suggest that transport mechanisms other than simple passive transport are involved in peritoneal glucose transport, and that high glucose per se and/or high insulin may be important factors that determine glucose transport characteristics.

ID SPONTANEOUS EMERGENCE; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; DYNAMICS;
   BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS
AB We analyze the critical behavior of a class of discrete opinion models in the presence of disorder. Within this class, each agent opinion takes a discrete value (+/- 1 or 0) and its time evolution is ruled by two terms, one representing agent-agent interactions and the other the degree of conviction or persuasion (a self-interaction). The mean-field limit, where each agent can interact evenly with any other, is considered. Disorder is introduced in the strength of both interactions, with either quenched or annealed random variables. With probability p (1 - p), a pairwise interaction reflects a negative (positive) coupling, while the degree of conviction also follows a binary probability distribution (two different discrete probability distributions are considered). Numerical simulations show that a nonequilibrium continuous phase transition, from a disordered state to a state with a prevailing opinion, occurs at a critical point p(c) that depends on the distribution of the convictions, with the transition being spoiled in some cases. We also show how the critical line, for each model, is affected by the update scheme (either parallel or sequential) as well as by the kind of disorder (either quenched or annealed).

AB The goal of this study was to compare in vitro and in vivo efficacy of moxifloxacin and liposomal amphotericin B (Amp-B) monotherapies and combination treatment against Candida albicans in an exogenous endophthalmitis model in rabbit eyes. Microplate dilution tests and checkerboard analysis were performed to detect in vitro efficacies. Endophthalmitis was induced by intravitreal injection of C. albicans in 40 rabbit eyes with simultaneous intravitreal drug injection according to prophylactic treatment groups. Group 1 (control group) received 0.1 mL of balanced salt solution, group 2 (moxi group) 100 mg moxifloxacin/0.1 mL, group 3 (Amp-B group) 10 mu g liposomal Amp-B/0.1 mL, and group 4 (combi group) both 100 mg moxifloxacin/0.05 mL and 10 mu g liposomal Amp-B/0.05 mL intravitreally. Clinical examination, quantitative analysis of microorganisms, and histopathologic examination were performed as in vivo studies. The minimum inhibitory concentration of liposomal Amp-B against C. albicans was found to be 1 mu g/mL. Moxifloxacin showed no inhibition of in vitro C. albicans growth. The minimum inhibitory concentration values of liposomal Amp-B for C. albicans were reduced two-to eightfold with increasing concentrations of moxifloxacin in vitro. In vivo, there was no C. albicans growth in the combi group (zero of eight eyes), whereas three eyes (37.5%) showed growth in the Amp-B group. Vitreous inflammation, retinal detachment, focal retinal necrosis, and outer nuclear layer loss were found to be lower in the moxi group compared with the control group. Ganglion cell and inner nuclear layer loss was observed in all eyes (100%) in both the moxi and combi groups, whereas only in 25% (two of eight eyes) in the Amp-B group. Moxifloxacin strongly augments the efficacy of liposomal Amp-B against C. albicans in vitro, although it has no in vitro antifungal activity when used alone. It is interesting that we found a synergistic effect for in vitro tests but failed to demonstrate it in vivo. When 100 mu g moxifloxacin/0.1 mL is given intravitreally, it has some toxic effects that are limited to the inner retinal layers.

AB Recently, some new leaching agents without ammonium, such as magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and aluminum sulfate [Al-2(SO4)(3)], have been developed to eliminate ammonia nitrogen pollution in in situ mining process of the weathered crust elution-deposited rare earth ore (WCED-REO), but they might cause heavy metal contamination. In this study, characteristics and mechanisms of different fractions of lead (Pb) released by (NH4)(2)SO4, MgSO4 and Al-2(SO4)(3) leaching agents were investigated using batch experiments and column leaching tests. The experimental results showed that the amounts of Pb released by the different leaching agents followed the trend of Al-2(SO4)(3) > (NH4)(2)SO4 > MgSO4 under the same total cationic charge, and both the acid extractable and reducible fractions of Pb were released. The release of acid extractable fraction Pb was related to the cation hydration radius of NH4+, Mg2+, and Al3+, whereas the release of reducible fraction Pb was mainly influenced by the concentration of H+, especially at pH < 4.0. Furthermore, column leaching tests indicated that pH has little effect on the Pb contents of different fractions released by (NH4)(2)SO4 and MgSO4 in leaching the WCED-REO. Although Al-2(SO4)(3) released the largest contents of rare earth and Pb in leachate, the content of residual acid extractable fraction Pb in soil was the most after water injection (simulating the cleaning process after mining). This work can provide a scientific method and theoretical basis for comprehensively assessing the environmental impact of new leaching agents on WCED-REO mining.

AB Homogeneous dispersion of graphene into thermoplastic polymer matrices during melt-mixing is still challenging due to its agglomeration and weak interfacial interactions with the selected polymer matrix. In this study, an ideal dispersion of graphene within the PA66 matrix was achieved under high shear rates by thermokinetic mixing. The flow direction of graphene was monitored by the developed numerical methodology with a combination of its rheological behaviors. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) produced from waste-tire by upcycling and recycling techniques having high oxygen surface functional groups were used to increase the compatibility with PA66 chains. This study revealed that GNP addition increased the crystallization temperature of nanocomposites since it acted as both a nucleating and reinforcing agent. Tensile strength and modulus of PA66 nanocomposites were improved at 30% and 42%, respectively, by the addition of 0.3 wt% GNP. Flexural strength and modulus were reached at 20% and 43%, respectively. In addition, the flow model, which simulates the injection molding process of PA66 resin with different GNP loadings considering the rheological behavior and alignment characteristics of GNP, served as a tool to describe the mechanical performance of these developed GNP based nanocomposites.

AB Ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction (UTMD) is essential for targeted drug delivery but currently there is no agreed gold standard for its real-time monitoring. This study used a clinical diagnostic ultrasound scanner to quantify the destruction effects of different values of mechanical index (MI) on microbubble. This was achieved by measuring the signal intensity of peripheral vessels, which is representative of systemic microbubble concentration. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats and SonoVue contrast agent were used for this study, six for the determination of signal saturation and 18 for the study of microbubble destruction. In the first part of the experiment, four different SonoVue doses (200, 400, 600 and 800 mu L/kg) were injected into each of six rats and the signal intensity in their right femoral arteries were recorded using a diagnostic ultrasound scanner. This data was used to plot time-intensity curves (TIC) to determine at which concentration the signal reaches saturation. Then UTMD studies were performed using the 400 mu L/kg dose as its peak signal intensity (PSI) was safely within the linear portion of the intensity-concentration curve. The remaining 18 rats were divided into three MI groups (0.2, 0.6 and 1.0) and for each rat, the following was performed: TIC recording of a sham exposure without sonication was performed first using the same scanner from signal saturation study. Simultaneously, another ultrasound scanner was applied to the adductor muscles of left hind limb for sonication later. Then, a sonication TIC recording was performed, with both ultrasound scanners activated. A TIC recording of second sonication was also obtained for comparison. The TICs showed that the area under the curve and the enhancement duration were reduced after sonication in the groups MI = 0.6 and MI = 1.0 but not for the group MI 5 0.2. The PSI in the groups with MI of 0.6 and 1.0 were slightly lowered after sonication, although it is not statistically significant. No significant difference of TIC exists between the first and the second sonication for each group. Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with estimated concentration-time curve derived from TIC curve and found that SonoVue had faster clearance and decreased half-life in the groups MI = 0.6 and MI = 1.0. In conclusion, this study shows that sonographic signal measured from peripheral vessels is a feasible indicator of systemic microbubble concentration and may be used to quantify ultrasound-triggered microbubble destruction at target site.

AB The UV/Vis absorption characteristics of newly synthesized pyridino[3,4-c] coumarins in different neat solvents were investigated experimentally and computationally. It is noted that the nitro-substituted pyridocoumarins can exhibit spectral features with characteristic band in the visible region, which in turn is solvent's polarity dependent with negative solvatochromic behavior. Using the Kamet-Taft approach, the obtained results (R = 0.991) revealed that this negative solvatochromic behavior is dominantly influenced by the solvents' polarizability and hydrogen bonding capability. The experimental results of the spectral properties in solution were interpreted at the molecular level with aid of the DFT and TD-DFT/CAM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d) computational methods with IEFPCM implicit solvation approach. Per benchmarking the TD-DFT simulated spectra with the experimental one, it is demonstrated that the nitro group can induce an intramolecular charge transfer to afford two resonance structures of distinctive spectral features. Such difference in spectral features is interpreted in terms of molecular orbitals, where the two potential resonance structures exhibit different natures for the frontier molecular orbitals, namely the HOMO and LUMO with a significant difference in the corresponding energy gaps. Moreover, the electrostatic potential surfaces of both structures indicate relatively different accessibility toward intermolecular hydrogen bonding with the solvent molecules. The achieved results would provide valuable insights concerning the noteworthy influence of the substituents of pyridocoumarins on their spectral properties and correspondingly their solvatochromic behaviors at the molecular level in different media.

AB Agent-based models can predict system-level properties of populations from stochastic simulation of fine-scale movements. One important application to conservation lies in their ability to consider the impact of individual variation in movement and decision-making on populations under future landscape changes. Here, we present a spatially explicit agent-based simulation of a population of jaguars (Panthera onca) in a mixed forest and farmland landscape in Central America that demonstrates an application of least-cost modelling, a description of the way that agents move through their environment, to equilibrium population dynamics. We detail the construction and application of the model, and the processes of calibration, sensitivity analysis and validation with empirical field data. Simulated jaguars underwent feeding, reproduction, and mortality events typical of natural populations, resulting in realistic population dynamics and home range sizes. jaguar agents located inside protected forest reserves exhibited higher fitness (fecundity, energy reserves, age and age of mortality) as well as lower energy- and habitat-related mortality than jaguar agents located outside these reserves. Changes in fecundity directly affected the dynamics of simulated populations to a larger degree than either mortality or agent-agent interactions. Model validation showed similar patterns to camera traps in the field, in terms of landscape utilisation and the spatial distribution of individuals. The model showed less sensitivity to socially motivated and fine-scale moven-lents, apart from those directed towards feeding and reproduction, but reflected the interactions and movement of naturally occurring populations in this region. Applications of the model will include testing impacts on population dynamics of likely future changes in landscape structure and connectivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In the current work, beta-CD-TiO2-Ag nanoparticles have been synthesized by modifying TiO2 nanoparticles with beta-cyclodextrin and Ag elementary substance through building the bridge of coupling agent respectively. TEM was used to observe the morphology of nanoparticles. Crystalline structure of nanopartides and functional groups of the surface of nanoparticles were tested by X-ray powder diffraction analysis and FT-IR spectrometer respectively. Two-steps method was applied to manufacture beta-CD-TiO2-Agantifreeze-based nanofluids as novel antifreeze. And TLAB dispersion stability analyzer, Zeta PALS 190 Plus were used to test the stability of nanofluids. An important part of the present study focuses on the thermo-physical properties of beta-CD-TiO2-Ag nanofluids. The experimental results indicated that the thermal conductivity enhancement of nanofluids compared to base fluids was evident because that the effect of thermal vibration intensity of antifreeze molecules in suspension increased and the intensity of micro motion of nanoparticles which is the main medium of energy transfer in nanofluids increased. Simultaneously, different thermal conductivity and rheological models have been compared with experimental data. It showed that the change trend was basically the same but there is a distance between them mainly because the ratio of water to ethylene glycol in base fluids was different and modified nanoparticles affect. This research will play an important role in application of functionalized nanoparticles in antifreeze. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Flow behaviors of particles and power-law fluids were numerically simulated by means of Euler-Euler model with kinetic theory of granular flow in liquid-solid fluidized beds, and effects of flow behavior index (n) and consistency coefficient (K) were studied. The simulation results were compared with the experimental measurements, and good agreements were achieved. The effective viscosity of the shear-thinning fluid decreases as it flows through the expanded bed due to the increase in fluid strain rate. Unlike the homogeneous distributions of particles in Newtonian liquid fluidized beds, four regions for particle flow were observed along the bed height when a non-Newtonian fluid acts as the fluidizing agent, which indicates the non-uniformity of particles distribution. With the decrease of n, the enhancement of shear-thinning characteristics of the fluidizing agent thickens the relative inlet region and enhances the non-uniformity of particles along the bed height. The increase of n accelerates the circulation of particles in the fluidized bed, which speeds up the renewal of the particulate materials throughout the reactor space. The increase in K increases the apparent viscosity of the fluidizing agent. The bed height increases and the average solid volume fraction decreases. However, the influence of K on the nonuniformity of particles in the bed is less significant than that of n. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Since they can provide a natural and flexible description of nonlinear dynamic behavior of complex system, Agent-based models (ABM) have been commonly used for immune system simulation. However, it is crucial for ABM to obtain an appropriate estimation for the key parameters of the model by incorporating experimental data. In this paper, a systematic procedure for immune system simulation by integrating the ABM and regression method under the framework of history matching is developed. A novel parameter estimation method by incorporating the experiment data for the simulator ABM during the procedure is proposed. First, we employ ABM as simulator to simulate the immune system. Then, the dimension-reduced type generalized additive model (GAM) is employed to train a statistical regression model by using the input and output data of ABM and play a role as an emulator during history matching. Next, we reduce the input space of parameters by introducing an implausible measure to discard the implausible input values. At last, the estimation of model parameters is obtained using the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) by fitting the experiment data among the non-implausible input values. The real Influeza A Virus (IAV) data set is employed to demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, and the results show that the proposed method not only has good fitting and predicting accuracy, but it also owns favorable computational efficiency.

AB Fas (APO-1/CD95) is a cell surface receptor that initiates apoptotic pathway. Fas-stimulated ROS generation may play important role in Fas-mediated apoptosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of interferon-alpha on oxidative stress parameters in Fas-induced renal apoptosis in mice kidney. Subjects and methods. One-month-old Balb C male mice were used for the study. The animals were divided in four groups: group I were the controls, group 2 mice were treated with anti-Fas antibody i.p., group 3 mice were treated wit IFN-alpha, and group 4 mice were treated with both agents simultaneously. The mice were killed 48 h afterwards, and kidneys were homogenized. TBA reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione content, and reactive carbonyl group (RCG) were measured. Results. The results showed a statistically significant increase of TBARS (p < 0.05) and RCG (p < 0.05) concentration in the group treated with anti-Fas antibody versus control. IFN-a decreased the concentration of TBARS and RCG after anti-Fas antibody administration (p < 0.05). There is no significant difference in glutathione content between investigated groups. Conclusion. IFN-alpha might be considered as a new target for therapeutic intervention in FasL/Fas induced renal injury.

LA English

DE boron; ignition; laser diode; propellants; pyrotechnic mixtures
AB The ignition, by means of a laser diode, of boron pyrotechnic mixture was carried out under various experimental conditions. The ignition system is composed of two lenses which focus the laser beam on the surface of the energetic material. A sapphire port-hole, juxtaposed with the pyrotechnic composition, protects the optical system. This setup was used to determine the sensitivity of B/KNO3 and B/KClO4 mixtures. Energy thresholds and ignition delays were measured for each batch test using a Langlie statistical method. Among the various parameters, which influence the ignition condition, the ratio of boron and the porosity of the pellet were predominant. The ignition thresholds decrease for the higher values of these parameters. The influence of an opacifier agent mixed with the mixture was found rather negligible. Boron mixture prepared with a KNO3 oxidant is much less sensitive than a pyrotechnic compound based on KClO4 oxidizer. Moreover, potassium nitrate is suspected to be unfavorable to the ignition process. Intrinsic parameters, linked to the experimental device, also have great influence. Among these the power density seems to be predominant. With the B/KNO3 mixture, a particular behaviour was observed because of the increase of the energy of ignition when the laser power is rising. It is possible to find an optimum value of the laser diameter, for a given power density. This experimental and parametric study has shown that, on such devices, it is possible to find the best conditions of the ignition of boron pyrotechnic mixture. In order to connect and explain the influence of these various parameters, a numerical model of the ignition process was completed. In the case of the B/KClO4 mixture, there is a good agreement between the numerical calculation and the experimental result. On the contrary, in the case of the B/KNO3 mixture, the agreement is acceptable until the power density reaches 2.5 kW.m(-2). Beyond this value, the numerical simulation gives very low values of the ignition thresholds of energy when compared to the experiment. The explanation of such a difference is attributed to the existence of BN particles in a gaseous medium which surrounds the pellet surface.

AB This paper addresses the synchronization problem of coupled harmonic oscillators by event-triggered control. A centralized event-triggered control strategy is first developed and is further extended to a decentralized counterpart, in which the control protocol and event-triggering conditions only require local information. With the event-triggered control strategies, controllers update at the discrete instants when the related measurement errors exceed some proper state-dependent thresholds, which can reduce the computation and transmission costs. By the tools from nonsmooth analysis, it is shown that the proposed event-triggered control strategies synchronize asymptotically all oscillator states. Furthermore, a decentralized event-triggered strategy with a fixed threshold is proposed for the sake of excluding the Zeno behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed strategies is illustrated by numerical simulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Maternal gratitude positively affected medical team performance, with most of this effect explained by the positive impact of such gratitude on team information sharing.
   BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Exposure to negative social interactions (such as rudeness) has robust adverse implications on medical team performance. However, little is known regarding the effects of positive social interactions. We hypothesized that expressions of gratitude, a prototype of positive social interaction, would enhance medical teams' effectiveness. Our objective was to study the performance of NICU teams after exposure to expressions of gratitude from alternative sources. METHODS: Forty-three NICU teams (comprising 2 physicians and 2 nurses) participated in training workshops of acute care simulations. Teams were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 conditions: (1) maternal gratitude (in which the mother of a preterm infant expressed gratitude to NICU teams, such as the one that treated her child), (2) expert gratitude (in which a physician expert expressed gratitude to teams for participating in the training), (3) combined maternal and expert gratitude, or (4) control (same agents communicated neutral statements). The simulations were evaluated (5-point Likert scale: 1 = failed and 5 = excellent) by independent judges (blind to team exposure) using structured questionnaires. RESULTS: Maternal gratitude positively affected teams' performances (3.9 +/- 0.9 vs 3.6 +/- 1.0; P = .04), with most of this effect explained by the positive impact of gratitude on team information sharing (4.3 +/- 0.8 vs 4.0 +/- 0.8; P = .03). Forty percent of the variance in team information sharing was explained by maternal gratitude. Information sharing predicted team performance outcomes, explaining 33% of the variance in diagnostic performance and 41% of the variance in therapeutic performance. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-expressed gratitude significantly enhances medical team performance, with much of this effect explained by enhanced information sharing.

AB Empirical data Of Supermarket sales show stylised facts that are similar to stock markets, with a broad (truncated) Levy distribution of weekly sales differences in the baseline sales [R.D. Groot, Physica A 353 (2005) 501]. To investigate the cause of this, the influence of social interactions and advertisements are studied in an agent-based model of consumers in a social network. The influence of network topology was varied by using a small-world network, a random network and a Barabasi-Albert network. The degree to which consumers value the opinion of their peers was also varied.
   On a small-world and random network we find a phase transition between an open market and a locked-in market that is similar to condensation in liquids. At the critical point, fluctuations become large and buying behaviour is strongly correlated. However, on the small world network the noise distribution at the critical point is Gaussian, and critical slowing down occurs which is not observed in supermarket sales. On a scale-free network, the model shows a transition between a gas-like phase and a glassy state, but at the transition point the noise amplitude is much larger than what is seen in supermarket sales.
   To explore the role of advertisements, a model is studied where imprints are placed on the minds of consumers that ripen when a decision for a product is made. The correct distribution of weekly sales returns follows naturally from this model, as well as the noise amplitude, the correlation time and cross-correlation of sales fluctuations. For particular parameter values, simulated sales correlation shows power-law decay in time. The model predicts that social interaction helps to prevent aversion, and that products are viewed more positively when their consumption rate is higher. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Dynamic mathematical modelling and stochastic simulation of disease-host systems for the purpose of epidemiological analysis offer great opportunities for testing hypotheses, especially when field experiments are impractical or when there is a need to evaluate multiple experimental scenarios. This, combined with the ever increasing computer power available to researchers, has contributed to the development of many mathematical models for epidemic simulations, such as the individual-based model (IBM). Nevertheless, few of these models undergo extensive validation and proper assessment of intrinsic variability. The Ontario rabies model (ORM) will be used here to exemplify some advantages of appropriate model behaviour validation and to illustrate the use of a simple geometric procedure for testing directional bias in distributed stochastic dynamic model of spread of diseases. Results were obtained through the comparison of 10000 epizootics resulting from 100 epidemic simulations started using 100 distinct base populations. The analysis results demonstrated a significant directional bias in epidemic dispersion, which prompted further verification of the model code and the identification of a coding error, which was then corrected. Subsequent testing of the corrected code showed that the directional bias could no longer be detected. These results illustrate the importance of proper validation and the importance of sufficient knowledge of the model behaviour to ensure the results will not confound the objectives of the end-users.

AB A reinforcement learning agent that autonomously explores its environment can utilize a curiosity drive to enable continual learning of skills, in the absence of any external rewards. We formulate curiosity-driven exploration, and eventual skill acquisition, as a selective sampling problem. Each environment setting provides the agent with a stream of instances. An instance is a sensory observation that, when queried, causes an outcome that the agent is trying to predict. After an instance is observed, a query condition, derived herein, tells whether its outcome is statistically known or unknown to the agent, based on the confidence interval of an online linear classifier. Upon encountering the first unknown instance, the agent queries the environment to observe the outcome, which is expected to improve its confidence in the corresponding predictor. If the environment is in a setting where all instances are known, the agent generates a plan of actions to reach a new setting, where an unknown instance is likely to be encountered. The desired setting is a self-generated goal, and the plan of action, essentially a program to solve a problem, is a skill. The success of the plan depends on the quality of the agent's predictors, which are improved as mentioned above. For validation, this method is applied to both a simulated and real Katana robot arm in its blocks-world environment. Results show that the proposed method generates sample-efficient curious exploration behavior, which exhibits developmental stages, continual learning, and skill acquisition, in an intrinsically-motivated playful agent.

AB The influence of a series of sympathomimetic agents on the liver content of non protein bound thiol groups (NP-SH), mainly representing glutathione, has been assessed in the male rat.  The rats were intravenously and/or subcutaneously infused over 6 h at different dosages either with dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, terbutaline, or phentolamine, or simultaneously with dopamine and phentolamine, or with epinephrine and phentolamine.  Besides NP-SH, total sulfhydryl group content was measured in liver cytosol, while glucose and insulin concentrations were determined in the serum.
   Liver NP-SH content was significantly decreased by epinephrine.  This decrease was abolished and even inverted to an increase, when appropriate doses of phentolamine were infused simultaneously.  Dopamine caused a rise in NP-SH content at a dose rate of 7.5-mu-g/kg . min, while lower and higher dose rates of dopamine exerted not any influence on liver NP-SH.  When phentolamine was concomitantly infused with 15-mu-g/kg . min of dopamine, NP-SH was significantly elevated.  Phentolamine, when infused exclusively, increased NP-SH as well, while it was not influenced, however, by terbutaline or dobutamine at any dosage.  Cytosolic total sulfhydryls were found to be unaltered across all experimental groups.
   When the NP-SH values are related to the corresponding serum insulin levels, a close and linear relationship becomes evident.  The study demonstrates, that some sympathomimetic agents can exert a considerable influence on hepatic non protein bound thiol content.  The data suggest, that the varying liver NP-SH content under adrenergic drugs is primarily related to changes in serum insulin concentration.  The study does not support the concept of a direct influence upon liver NP-SH regulation by adrenergic stimulation of the rat hepatocytes.

AB Three charged substituted beta-cyclodextrins (beta-CDs), sulfobutylether-beta-(SBE-beta-CD), degree of substitution (DS) 4 and 7), and sulfated-beta-(S-beta-CD) cyclodextrins, were compared as chiral additives in capillary electrophoresis for the enantiomeric separation of basic spirobenzopyran derivatives (pK(a) 9.9) which differ from each other by an N-alkyl group. The number of sulfobutylether groups attached to the cyclodextrin moiety significantly influences the enantioseparation of the basic drugs. SBE-beta-CD (DS 7) which is more strongly bound to cationic analyte than SBE-beta-CD (DS 4.6), requires smaller concentrations to achieve the same resolution. Besides, better enantioresolutions were obtained with S-beta-CD rather than with SBE-beta-CDs though higher concentrations are required, which led to high current values. However, both pairs of enantiomers cannot be resolved using S-beta-CD while SBE-beta-CDs make it possible to resolve simultaneous enantioseparation of such solutes slightly differing in hydrophobicity. This supports the hypothesis that hydrophobic interactions (outside of the CD cavity) between the butyl group attached to SBE-beta-CD and the N-alkyl group of spirobenzopyran play a role in the enantioseparation. On the other hand, the sulfate group of S-beta-CD was directly attached to the CD moiety which means that the S-beta-CD-drug complexation mechanism arises through the combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic (inside the CD cavity) interactions. Finally, enantiomers of spirobenzopyran drugs were satisfactorily resolved by CE using a 20 mg/mL S-beta-CD concentration (resolution 4.0), 7 mg/mL SBE-beta-CD DS 4 (resolution 1.3), or 5 mg/mL SBE-beta-CD DS 7 (resolution 3.3) added to the phosphate buffer (pH 2.6, 50 mM ionic strength).

AB Purpose: To evaluate the effect of nanohydroxyapatite (nHAP) associated with photobiomodulation (PBM) in the control of dentin hypersensitivity (DH). Methods: 32 subjects with 83 hypersensitive teeth were randomized into four groups (N = 8): GPlacebo - simulated PBM (without light emission) followed by the application of nHAP-free toothpaste; GLaser - PBM followed by the application of nHAP-free toothpaste; GnHAP - simulated PBM followed by the application of nHAP; GLasernHAP - PBM followed by the application of nHAP. A visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure DH after a tactile and evaporative stimulus. DH evaluations were performed at four times: baseline, 1st, and 2nd treatment sessions, and 1 month. A questionnaire was used to evaluate the risk factors associated with DH intensity. Mixed-design ANOVA followed by Tukey test and logistic regression were used. Results: The mechanical stimulus showed a significant reduction in DH in all experimental groups (P < 0.05) at the 2nd treatment session. For the evaporative stimulus, the GLasernHAP group presented a significant reduction in DH at the 1st treatment session (P < 0.05). Intragroup analysis showed that only the GnHAP group showed regression of DH at 1 month for the two applied stimuli. The variables of parafunctional habits, diets rich in acidic drinks and anxiety had significant relationships with the intensity of DH (P < 0.05).

AB Pancreas disease (PD) is an important cause of losses in farmed salmonids in Norway, the United Kingdom and Ireland. As the spread of salmonid alphavirus (SAV), the causal agent, to naive populations is of major concern to the farming industry, it is important to uncover the transmission routes of the virus. This study was conducted to investigate the potential for vertical transmission of SAV subtype 3. Progeny of broodstock with signs of late-stage PD and persistent RT-PCR signals for SAV were followed from fertilization to smoltification in an experimental facility. Fertilized ova were either not disinfected or taken through one of three different disinfection regimes. Also, ova and milt from uninfected broodfish from a different population were exposed to a cell-cultured strain of SAV 3 immediately before fertilization to simulate a viraemic phase in parent fish. A group of uninfected controls were also included in the study. Fertilized ova from bath exposed and negative control groups were double disinfected. Following fertilization, experimental fish went through a normal freshwater phase. However, fry were stressed at first feeding to enhance replication of possibly latent virus. Smoltification was induced by an artificial light regime, and experimental fish were followed to the late smoltification phase. Selected samples were investigated by real-time RT-PCR for SAV, by histology for evidence of PD and by serology for neutralising antibodies against SAV. All analysed samples of progeny were negative. This result shows that SAV 3 is not readily transmitted vertically from parents to offspring. Additional negative PCR results from salmon sampled in commercial hatcheries support these findings. Also, recent studies have shown that risk factors for the horizontal transmission route explain the vast majority of PD outbreaks in Norway. It is concluded that if it happens at all, vertical transmission is of minor importance in the spread of SAV 3.

AB To further investigate the role of serotonin (5-HT) in anxiety, two tests were used in human subjects. The first was the conditioning of skin conductance response (CSCR) that associates a tone to a loud noise. The second was simulated public speaking (SPS), which is believed to represent unconditioned fear. In healthy volunteers the 5-HT2A receptor blocker and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor nefazodone reduced subjective anxiety and the number of spontaneous fluctuations of skin conductance during CSCR, but enhanced anxiety induced by SPS. Opposite effects had been reported with the 5-HT releasing and uptake-inhibiting agent D-fenfluramine. Panic patients behaved like controls in the CSCR. However, they had a higher level of baseline anxiety and were insensitive to SPS. This profile resembles the reported effect of the non-selective 5-HT receptor blocker metergoline in healthy volunteers. Therefore, panic patients seem to process unconditioned fear abnormally, which may be due to lack of 5-HT inhibition in brain structures commanding flight from proximal danger stimuli.

AB We investigate coarse equilibrium states of a fine-scale, stochastic, agent-based model of consumer lock-in in a duopolistic market. In the model, agents decide on their next purchase based on a combination of their personal preference and their neighbors' opinions. For agents with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) parameters and all-to-all coupling, we derive an analytic approximate coarse evolution-map for the expected average purchase. We then study the emergence of coarse fronts when the agents are split into two factions with opposite preferences. We develop a novel Newton-Krylov method that is able to compute accurately and efficiently coarse fixed points when the underlying fine-scale dynamics is stochastic. The main novelty of the algorithm is in the elimination of the noise that is generated when estimating Jacobian-vector products using time-integration of perturbed initial conditions. We present numerical results that demonstrate the convergence properties of the numerical method and use the method to show that macroscopic fronts in this model destabilize at a coarse symmetry-breaking bifurcation.

AB We developed a new climate-sensitive vegetation state-and-transition simulation model (CV-STSM) to simulate future vegetation at a fine spatial grain commensurate with the scales of human land-use decisions, and under the joint influences of changing climate, site productivity, and disturbance. CV-STSM integrates outputs from four different modeling systems. Successional changes in tree species composition and stand structure were represented as transition probabilities and organized into a state-and-transition simulation model. States were characterized based on assessments of both current vegetation and of projected future vegetation from a dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM). State definitions included sufficient detail to support the integration of CV-STSM with an agent-based model of land-use decisions and a mechanistic model of fire behavior and spread. Transition probabilities were parameterized using output from a stand biometric model run across a wide range of site productivities. Biogeographic and biogeochemical projections from the DGVM were used to adjust the transition probabilities to account for the impacts of climate change on site productivity and potential vegetation type. We conducted experimental simulations in the Willamette Valley, Oregon, USA. Our simulation landscape incorporated detailed new assessments of critically imperiled Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana) savanna and prairie habitats among the suite of existing and future vegetation types. The experimental design fully crossed four future climate scenarios with three disturbance scenarios. CV-STSM showed strong interactions between climate and disturbance scenarios. All disturbance scenarios increased the abundance of oak savanna habitat, but an interaction between the most intense disturbance and climate-change scenarios also increased the abundance of subtropical tree species. Even so, subtropical tree species were far less abundant at the end of simulations in CV-STSM than in the dynamic global vegetation model simulations. Our results indicate that dynamic global vegetation models may overestimate future rates of vegetation change, especially in the absence of stand-replacing disturbances. Modeling tools such as CV-STSM that simulate rates and direction of vegetation change affected by interactions and feedbacks between climate and land-use change can help policy makers, land managers, and society as a whole develop effective plans to adapt to rapidly changing climate.

AB Residential location choice modeling is one of the substantial components of land use and transportation models. While numerous aggregated mathematical and statistical approaches have been developed to model the residence choice behavior of households, disaggregated approaches such as the agent-based modeling have shown interesting capabilities. In this article, a novel agent-based approach is developed to simulate the residential location choice of tenants in Tehran, the capital of Iran. Tenants are considered as agents who select their desired residential alternatives according to their characteristics and preferences for various criteria such as the rent, accessibility to different services and facilities, environmental pollution, and distance from their workplace and former residence. The choice set of agents is limited to their desired residential alternatives by applying a constrained NSGA-II algorithm. Then, agents compete with each other to select their final residence among their alternatives. Results of the proposed approach are validated by comparing simulated and actual residences of a sample of tenants. Results show that the proposed approach is able to accurately simulate the residence of 59.3% of tenants at the traffic analysis zone level.

AB In this paper, we detected the fractal/multifractal and asymmetric properties in a simple financial market model which is an analog of the Ising model. We introduced the virtual market with heterogeneous agents characterized by agents with bounded rationality, by which we mean that agents only have local information, and a market maker who is responsible for market liquidity. To investigate the heterogeneity and psychological factors in real financial market, we designed the parameters of individual expectations of agents to this model. Applying fractal/multifractal and Zipf techniques, we conducted many simulations under different scenarios and then analyzed the generated time series of this virtual market. We acquired some nontrivial findings: first, the virtual price returns generated by our model display fractal and multifractal features; secondly, we found that the price have the asymmetric behaviors; finally, our findings have qualitative similarities with many empirical results, which imply that although our toy model is seemingly simple, it can generate complex dynamics and thus can be a useful tool to investigate complex market behaviors and phenomena.

AB Concretes with micro-encapsulated healing agents are very appealing due to the advantages of self-healing and the potential for controllable quantifiable healing on a large scale with little initial damage. Based on experimental observation and Taylor's model, a two-dimensional micromechanical damage-healing model of microcapsule-enabled self-healing cementitious materials under tensile loading has been proposed. The healing effect on microcrack-induced damage can now be predicted quantitatively by its microscopic healing mechanism. The kinetic equations of damage-healing evolution and the formulations of compliance after healing are developed. Subsequently, simple and efficient numerical simulations are presented and different system parameters of microcapsule-enabled self-healing concretes, such as the radius and volume fraction of microcapsules, fracture toughness of healing agents and initial damage degree, are investigated. In particular, the proposed micromechanical damage-healing model demonstrates the potential capability to explain and simulate the physical behavior of microcapsule-enabled self-healing materials on the mesoscale.

AB Here, ultrathin cobalt carbide (Co2C) nanosheets are firstly illustrated as effective and robust catalysts toward photothermal degradation of sulfur mustard simulants (e.g., 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide, CEES) under solar light. Under the optimal conditions, the degradation rate of CEES by Co2C nanosheets is up to 98 %, which is much higher than the widely used P25 and anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. Moreover, the degradation performance is comparable or even better than those typical photothermal catalysts, including MnO2, MnOx-TiO2 and Co3O4, under identical conditions. Experimental evidences and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the superior activity is attributed to three main reasons: (i) the high photo-to-heat conversion efficiency of Co2C enables an elevated surface temperature for chemical bond breaking, (ii) the feasible binding of CEES on Co2C surface via Co-S and Co-Cl coordination promotes the process of degradation, and (iii) the surface hydroxyl groups (-OH) on Co2C nanosheets favor the degradation of CEES. Obviously, this work provides new insights into practical and large-scale application of transition metal carbides (TMCs) as novel photothermal catalysts in the decontamination of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) under ambient conditions (i.e., solar light and room temperature).

AB This paper is concerned with the problem of designing a decentralized consensus protocol for platooning of non-identical vehicles in the presence of heterogeneous time-varying communication delays. The proposed control protocol makes use of a state feedback and to this aim drivetrain dynamics are modeled as third-order linear systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence and exponential stability, derived by using an appropriate Krasovskii functional, demonstrate the ability of the platoon in reaching the required regime with an exponentially bounded behavior. The proposed LMI-based approach allows to estimate both delay margin and decay rate. Moreover, convergence is proven under switching communication network topologies by means of a Lyapunov-Razumikhin function, and the assessment of a string stable behavior has been also theoretically investigated. High-fidelity simulations with PLEXE show the effectiveness of the theoretical results in different driving conditions and in the presence of external disturbances and communication impairment. Different communication channel models are used in the validation stage to further prove robustness of the proposed methodology with respect hard delay and packets losses. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

ID UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR; ORGANIZATIONS; INDIVIDUALS; PERCEPTIONS; PROGRAMS
AB Current empirical studies of moral behavior of healthcare professionals are almost entirely focused on self-reports, usually collected under the assumption that an ethical disposition characterizes individuals across various contexts. It is well known, however, that individuals adjust their behavior to what they see being done by those in their peer group. That presents a methodological challenge to traditional research within a community of peers because the behavior of each individual is both the result of norms and a contributor to the norms of others. Computer simulations can be used to address this methodological challenge. A Markov replicator model that runs on an Excel spreadsheet was used to investigate a community with four agent types in the dental community: devious practitioners, ethical practitioners who avoid involvement in the poor ethics of others, ethical practitioners who accept it as part of their professional responsibility to challenge colleagues who act unprofessionally, and those who enforce ethical standards. A panel of leaders in the profession independently estimated parameters for the model and criteria for a possible distribution of agent types in the community. The simulation converged on distributions of the agent types that were very similar to the expectations of the panel. The simulation suggests the following characteristics of such moral communities: The structure of such communities is robust across a wide distribution. It appears that reduction in unethical behavior is more sensitive to the way ethical practitioners interact with each other than to sanctions the enforcement community imposes on unethical practitioners, and that large external interventions will be short lived.

AB Research on indoor fire emergency evacuations is crucial for hazard mitigation purposes, and dynamic indoor environments examined in this field demand a flexible solution. Current approaches separately address spatial and human elements of evacuations, producing superficial evacuation analysis results. In this paper, we employ a hierarchical structure to efficiently organize indoor accessible space and combine it with agents to simulate the indoor evacuation process. Thus, analysis functions from both accessible space and agent perspectives may be fused to thoroughly investigate simulation results. The experiment shows that this simulation model can be used to efficiently analyze evacuation characteristics of buildings for fire emergencies.

AB Background This study sought to test the hypothesis that simultaneous central blood pressure elevation and potent vasodilation can mitigate pial collateral-dependent infarct growth in acute ischemic stroke. Methods Twenty mongrel canines (20-30 kg) underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Eight subjects received continuous infusion of norepinephrine (0.1-1.5200 mu g/kg/min; titrated to a median of 34 mmHg above baseline mean arterial pressure) and hydralazine (20 mg) starting 30 min following MCAO. Pial collateral recruitment was scored prior to treatment and used to predict infarct volume based on a previously reported parameterization. Serial diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions tracked infarct volumes over a 4-hour time frame. Infarct volumes and infarct volume growth between treatment and control groups were compared with each other and to predicted values. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI), and necropsy findings were included in the evaluation. Results Differences between treatment and control group varied by pial collateral recruitment based on indicator-variable regression effects analysis with interaction confirmed by regression model fit. Benefit in treatment group was only in subjects with poor collaterals which had 35.7% less infarct volume growth (P=0.0008; ANOVA) relative to controls. Measured infarct growth was significantly lower than predicted by the model (linear regression partial F-test, slope P<0.001, intercept=0.003). There was no evidence for cerebral hemorrhage or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Conclusion Our results indicate that a combination of norepinephrine and hydralazine administered in the acute phase of ischemic stroke mitigates infarct evolution in subjects with poor but not good collateral recruitment.

AB The mechanical parameters of the periodontal ligament (PDL) in rat specimens were investigated in a combined experimental and numerical approach. Tooth mobility of the rat mandibular first molar was measured in vitro using a high precision experimental set-up. Finite element models (FEM) were developed, based on histological sections of the measured specimens, to simulate tooth mobility numerically under the same force systems as used in the experiment. Force/deflection curves from the measurements showed a significant non-linear behaviour of elastic stiffness of the PDL. A bilinear material parameter set was assumed to simulate tooth deflections. The numerical force/deflection curves were fitted to the experimental curves by repeatedly calculating theoretical tooth deflections and varying the parameters describing the non-linearity. Mean values of E-1 = 0.15 MPa, E-2 = 0.60 MPa and an ultimate strain of epsilon(12) = 6.3 per cent were derived for the elastic behaviour of the rat PDL. Comparing fresh specimens and those frozen in a 0.9 per cent saline solution, differences between the measurements were significant. Using the agent, Periston, for freezing significantly reduced the deviation. The results indicated that strains in the PDL with a maximum of 14 per cent at the furcation were 10(4) times higher than strains in the bone, while the variability of stress values in both PDL and bone was not significant.

AB The wavenumbers, molecular structure, molecular electrostatic potential, nonlinear optical properties and natural bond orbital analysis of a thiourea derivative, 1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-3-[3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl]thiourea (ANF-6) were reported. For the title molecule, HOMO is all over the molecule except the CF3 group and LUMO is over the 1,3-substituted phenyl ring PhII, CF3 group and C-S group. The most reactive sites of the molecule are identified with the help of MEP plot analysis. The first hyper-polarizability of the title compound is 38.69 times that of the standard NLO material urea. This study also encompassed the investigation of local reactivity properties by calculation of average local ionization energies and Fukui functions, which values have been mapped to the electron density surface. Bond dissociation energies have been calculated for all single acyclic bonds in order to assess the possibilities for autoxidation process and to determine where degradation could start. Radial distribution functions after molecular dynamics simulations have been calculated in order to determine the atoms with the most pronounced interactions with water. Within Marcus semi-empiric approach, charge hopping properties of the title molecule have been assessed and compared with urea and thiourea molecules. From the molecular docking study, the docked title compound forms a stable complex with cytochrome reductase and got a binding affinity value of 63 kcal/mol and hence the title compound can be a lead compound for developing new antifungal agent.

AB A computational model of organizational adaptation in which change occurs at both the strategic and the operational level is presented. In this model, simulated annealing is used to alter the organization's structure even as the agents within the organization learn. Using this model a virtual experiment is run to generate hypotheses which can be tested in multiple venues. The results suggest that, although it may not be possible for organizations of complex adaptive agents to locate the optimal form, they can improve their performance by altering their structure. Moreover, organizations that most successfully adapt over time come to be larger, less dense, with fewer isolated agents, and fewer overlooked decision factors. These results have implications for organizations of both humans and non-humans. For example, they suggest that organizational learning resides not just in the minds of the personnel within the organization, but in the connections among personnel, and among personnel and tasks. These results suggest that collections of non-humans may come to seem more intelligent (i.e., show improved performance) even if the agents remain unchanged if the system simply develops duplicate copies of some of the artificial agents and if the connections among agents are dynamically altered.

AB Experimental work was undertaken to investigate the effect of rotation speed on the solidification microstructure of AZ91D alloy using a twin-screw slurry maker. Then numerical simulation was used to investigate the effect of rotation speed on the flow filed and temperature field of the melt It was found that increasing the rotation speed could give rise to substantial grain refinement, which can be attributed to the increase of effective nucleation rate caused by the extremely uniform temperature and dispersing any potential clusters of nucleation agents in the bulk liquid under dispersive mixing.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of intrapulpal pressure and dentin depth on bond strengths of an etch-and-rinse and a self-etching bonding agent to dentin in vitro and in vivo. Twenty-four pairs of premolars were randomly divided into four groups (n = 6) according to the dentin bonding agent, Single Bond and Clearfil SE Bond, and intrapulpal pressure, null or positive. Each tooth of the pair was further designated to be treated in vivo or in vitro. The intrapulpal pressure was controlled in vivo by the delivery of local anesthetics containing or not a vasoconstrictor, while in vitro, it was achieved by keeping the teeth under hydrostatic pressure. Class I cavities were prepared and the dentin bonding agents were applied followed by incremental resin restoration. For the teeth treated in vitro, the same restorative procedures were performed after a 6 month-storage period. Beams with I mm 2 cross-sectional area were prepared and, microtensile tested. Clearfil SE Bond was not influenced by any of the variables of the study, while bond strengths produced in vitro were significatly higher for Single Bond. Overall, lower bond strengths were produced in deep dentin, which reached statistical significance when Single Bond was applied under physiological or simulated intrapulpal pressure. In conclusion, in vitro bonding may overestimate the immediate adhesive performance of more technique-sensitive dentin bonding systems. The impact of intrapulpal pressure on bond strength seems to be more adhesive dependent than dentin morphological characteristics related to depth. (C) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The application of recently developed criteria for the design and optimization of SMB units allows us to understand and rationalize the experimental results, as well as to indicate how to optimize the separation performances. A three-step procedure to determine the adsorption isotherms needed to apply these criteria is proposed: it is reliable and may be applied also where pure components are not available.

AB Persistence of motion is the tendency of an object to maintain motion in a direction for short time scales without necessarily being biased in any direction in the long term. One of the most appropriate mathematical tools to study this behavior is an agent-based velocity-jump process. In the absence of agent-agent interaction, the mean-field continuum limit of the agent-based model (ABM) gives rise to the well known hyperbolic telegraph equation. When agent-agent interaction is included in the ABM, a strictly advective system of partial differential equations (PDEs) can be derived at the population level. However, no diffusive limit of the ABM has been obtained from such a model. Connecting the microscopic behavior of the ABM to a diffusive macroscopic description is desirable, since it allows the exploration of a wider range of scenarios and establishes a direct connection with commonly used statistical tools of movement analysis. In order to connect the ABM at the population level to a diffusive PDE at the population level, we consider a generalization of the agent-based velocity-jump process on a two-dimensional lattice with three forms of agent interaction. This generalization allows us to take a diffusive limit and obtain a faithful population-level description. We investigate the properties of the model at both the individual and population levels and we elucidate some of the models' key characteristic features. In particular, we show an intrinsic anisotropy inherent to the models and we find evidence of a spontaneous form of aggregation at both the micro- and macroscales.

AB The advent of specific molecular markers and probes employing optical reporters has encouraged the application of in vivo diffuse tomographic imaging at greater spatial resolutions and hence data-set volumes. This study applied singular-value analysis (SVA) of the fluorescence tomographic problem to determine optimal source and detector distributions that result in data sets that are balanced between information content and size. Weight matrices describing the tomographic forward problem were constructed for a range of source and detector distributions and fields of view and were decomposed into their associated singular values. These singular-value spectra were then compared so that we could observe the effects of each parameter on imaging performance. The findings of the SVA were then confirmed by examining reconstructions of simulated and experimental data acquired with the same optode distributions as examined by SVA. It was seen that for a 20-mm target width, which is relevant to the small-animal imaging situation, the source and detector fields of view should be set at approximately 30 mm. Equal numbers of sources and detectors result in the best imaging performance in the parallel-plate geometry and should be employed when logistically feasible. These data provide guidelines for the design of small-animal diffuse optical tomographic imaging systems and demonstrate the utility of SVA as a simple and efficient means of optimizing experimental parameters in problems for which a forward model of the data collection process is available.

TI Differential protective effects of anaesthesia with sevoflurane or
   isoflurane An animal experimental model simulating liver transplantation
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIOLOGY

AB BACKGROUND The mechanisms involved in organ protection by volatile anaesthetics are not completely understood. In the liver transplant setting, there is a lack of information in the literature about whether sevoflurane anaesthesia has a superior hepatoprotective effect when compared with isoflurane.
   OBJECTIVE To compare the antioxidant and protective effects of isoflurane and sevoflurane.
   DESIGN A randomised, comparative, experimental study.
   SETTING The study was performed in the Animal Experimentation Unit of Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Brazil. Twenty male Wistar rats weighing between 350 and 450 g were randomly assigned to one of two groups.
   INTERVENTION Each group consisted of 10 animals that were exposed to one of two different volatile anaesthetics (sevoflurane or isoflurane). In both groups, five rats were used as 'donors' and another five as 'recipients'. In order to evaluate the effects of each anaesthetic agent, the same anaesthetic technique was used during procurement and reperfusion operations.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Samples of the preservation solution were collected during cold ischaemia to measure aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations. After 15 min of reperfusion, blood samples were taken to measure the levels of aminotransferases, LDH and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The concentrations of TBARS, catalase and nitric oxide derivatives were measured in the liver tissue after reperfusion.
   RESULTS Rats in the sevoflurane group had significantly lower concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and LDH in the samples obtained from the preservative solution after 6 h of cold ischaemia (P<0.05). Serum TBARS concentrations were significantly lower in the group exposed to sevoflurane anaesthesia (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in the tissue concentrations of TBARS and catalase (P=0.089 and P=0.24, respectively). However, the concentration of nitric oxide was significantly higher in the liver tissue of the rats exposed to sevoflurane anaesthesia (P<0.05).
   CONCLUSION These results suggest that sevoflurane anaesthesia seems to have superior protective and antioxidant effects to isoflurane anaesthesia, not only during cold preservation but also in the early phase of liver reperfusion.

ID MARKET ENTRY GAMES; ENDOGENOUS FLUCTUATIONS; COORDINATION; ROUTE;

AB We introduce a framework to analyze the interaction of boundedly rational heterogeneous agents repeatedly playing a participation game with negative feedback. We assume that agents use different behavioral rules prescribing how to play the game conditionally on the outcome of previous rounds. We update the fraction of the population using each rule by means of a general class of evolutionary dynamics based on imitation, which contains both replicator and logit dynamics. Our model is analyzed by a combination of formal analysis and numerical simulations and is able to replicate results from the experimental and computational literature on these types of games. In particular, irrespective of the specific evolutionary dynamics and of the exact behavioral rules used, the dynamics of the aggregate participation rate is consistent with the symmetric mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, whereas individual behavior clearly departs from it. Moreover, as the number of players or speed of adjustment increase the evolutionary dynamics typically becomes unstable and leads to endogenous fluctuations around the steady state. These fluctuations are robust with respect to behavioral rules that try to exploit them.

AB Separation of chemical warfare agents, specially sulfur mustard, is one of the most critical issues in environmental and military objects. Investigating the ability of some porous materials to separate mustard gas is the main aim of this work, and for this purpose, molecular simulation was selected. Dreiding model has been utilized for intra-molecule and van der Waals potentials of mustard gas and ab-initio calculations have been carried out to estimate partial charge of the atoms. The model was validated by comparison between liquid density and heat of vaporization obtained from molecular simulation and experimental values. Zn4O(3,5-dimethyl-4-carboxypyrazolato)(3) and Cu(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate) are chosen in this work due to high active metal sites and previous studies which have reported high adsorption for mustard and similar molecules (i.e. diethyl sulfide). Moreover, two porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs), with and without NO2 functional group, which have different pore sizes have been studied to intensify the performance of mustard separation. The adsorption isotherm of water on PAFs has been also calculated by grand canonical Monte Carlo simulation to inspect the influence of humid condition on the separation process.

AB Information is crucial to effective decision making, but too much information can be as detrimental as too little. Pooling information allows group-living organisms to benefit from the 'wisdom of the crowds', but could also increase the risk of information overload if not complemented by increased information processing capacity. In this study I use an agent-based model and empirical tests to explore the influence of group-size on information accumulation, and the impact of this on collective decision-making. Larger groups were more effective at sampling the environment in simulations and empirical trials. Simulations suggest this this could render them more susceptible to information overload in candidate-rich environments, in which larger groups suffered delays to decision making because of poorly focussed information sharing. However, the cost of excessive information could be ameliorated if individuals are 'fussy' and filter information by withholding information on poor candidates. This may explain observations from empirical trials, in which higher rates of information accumulation in larger groups did not have a clear impact on decision making. These results suggest groups face a potential collective burden of choice from excessive novel information in complex environments. However, collective information-filtering mechanisms analogous to those in the brains of unitary organisms could allow groups to exploit the wisdom of the crowds without suffering from information overload.

AB Purpose: To assess the fracture strength of dentin-bonded crowns placed on cores of amalgam, resin composite and viscous glass-ionomer. Methods: 40 sound maxillary premolar teeth were selected. These were mounted in acrylic resin in stainless steel molds. The palatal cusp of each tooth was removed in a standardized manner to simulate a core build-up preparation. Teeth were randomly divided into four groups, and each group was allocated a core material. For Group A, the core was pin-retained amalgam, for Group B the core was bonded amalgam, for Group C the core material was resin composite and for Group D the core material was high-viscosity glass-ionomer material. Cores were then constructed to the original tooth dimensions. A standardized crown preparation was made, impressions taken and an all-ceramic crown constructed in feldspathic porcelain. The crowns were luted in position using a dentin-bonding agent/dual cure resin-composite cement and the completed specimens subjected to compressive loading in a Universal Testing machine at 1 mm/minute. Results: The mean forces to produce fracture of the crowns were 1.58 kN (+/-0.41), 1.35 kN (+/-0.44), 1.25 kN (+/-0.24), and 1.12 kN (+/-0.25) respectively for groups A, B, C and D. Statistical analysis by ANOVA indicated that the pinned amalgam group performed significantly better than the glass-ionomer group (P > 0.05).

AB Many patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) also require percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The aim of the study was to identify whether combined treatment of patients with aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease (CAD) with TAVI and PCI has comparable results to treatment of patients with no CAD or with CAD with non-significant lesions who receive only TAVI.
   Between April 2008 and August 2013, 730 consecutive patients underwent transapical TAVI at our institution. In our study population of 593 patients, 285 (48.1%) had no CAD and received TAVI only (Group I); 232 (39.1%) presented with CAD but no highly significant coronary artery lesion(s) and also received TAVI only (Group II), and 76 (12.8%) had CAD and highly significant coronary lesion(s) and underwent combined, single-staged TAVI and PCI (Group III). Three transapical TAVI patients who received PCI because of iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction during TAVI and 134 transapical TAVI patients with previous CABG were excluded from this study.
   Group II showed a calculated mean SYNTAX score of 5.7 +/- 7.4. However, Group III showed a statistically significantly higher mean SYNTAX score of 8.0 +/- 5.7 than Group II (P < 0.001) before the combined procedure. Combined TAVI and PCI reduced the mean SYNTAX score significantly from 8.0 +/- 5.7 to 3.0 +/- 4.9 (P < 0.001) in those patients presenting with severe aortic stenosis and highly significant CAD (Group III). The thirty-day all-cause mortality rate was 5.3, 3.9 and 2.6% for Group I, II and III, respectively (P = 0.609). Patients with highly significant CAD undergoing TAVI and PCI had similar survival up to 3 years as patients without CAD undergoing TAVI only. Radiation time and amount of contrast agent were higher during combined treatment in Group III (P < 0.05). However, no difference in acute kidney injury post-procedurally was observed.
   Single-stage combined treatment of severe aortic stenosis and highly relevant coronary lesions is a safe and feasible procedure. Early survival and survival up to 3 years are comparable to that observed in patients presenting without CAD who received TAVI only. PCI effectively reduces the complexity of coronary lesions. Although more contrast agent is applied during the combined treatment, the rate of acute kidney injury was not higher.

AB We analyze the asymptotic behavior of a partial differential equation (PDE) model for hematopoiesis. This PDE model is derived from the original agent-based model formulated by Roeder (Nat. Med. 12(10):1181-1184, 2006), and it describes the progression of blood cell development from the stem cell to the terminally differentiated state.
   To conduct our analysis, we start with the PDE model of Kim et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 246(1):33-69, 2007), which coincides very well with the simulation results obtained by Roeder et al. We simplify the PDE model to make it amenable to analysis and justify our approximations using numerical simulations. An analysis of the simplified PDE model proves to exhibit very similar properties to those of the original agent-based model, even if for slightly different parameters. Hence, the simplified model is of value in understanding the dynamics of hematopoiesis and of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and it presents the advantage of having fewer parameters, which makes comparison with both experimental data and alternative models much easier.

AB One way to decrease the reducing agent rate in a blast furnace (BF) is the lowering of thermal reserve zone (TRZ) temperature by using self-reducing pellets (SRP). The lower strength requirement of raw materials for small BFs allows the charging of SRP. In the scope of the current study, the behavior of SRP under the TRZ simulated conditions has been investigated. Coal, charcoal, and coke breeze were used as embedded reducing agents. The reduction experiments have been performed under different iso- and non-isothermal scenarios. A Tammann furnace laboratory rig and a simultaneous Thermogravimetric/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA) experimental set were used for investigations. Mass loss, reduction degree, metallization degree, volume change, and reaction heat flow were examined. The results from experiments with TRZ condition show that embedded reducing agents, especially charcoal, promote iron oxide reduction in pellets. The crushing strengths of SRPs after both methods of hardening, fire-hardening and cement-bonded curing, and the reduction of cement-bonded SRP after curing have been investigated as well.

AB Wood-plastic composite foams (WPCFs), consisting of polypropylene and bagasse as wood fiber, were produced using tandem extrusion. The simultaneous effects of different material parameters including bagasse loading and particle size, melt viscosity of the used thermoplastic, type and content of chemical blowing agent on the microstructure, and physical properties of the obtained composite foams have been evaluated. Special sandwich morphology has been observed for these foams. Void fraction of WPCFs was measured and optimized using an experimental design method, response surface methodology. The maximum determined void fraction of the prepared WPCFs was 54%, which was obtained at the middle values of blowing agent content and bagasse particle size. Employing a mixture of endothermic-exothermic blowing agents has also caused the optimum amount of void fraction. Moreover, thermal behavior of wood-plastic composites was studied and the effects of all material parameters on decomposition behavior of polymer and bagasse fibers were investigated. The results verify that both bagasse content and bagasse particle size considerably influence the thermal stability of the microcomposites.

AB Agent based distillations (ABD's) are low-resolution simulations used principally to explore Army operations, though potentially have a wider role which includes the air and maritime environments. Movement of agents within the EINSTein and MANA ABD's is based on a simple attraction-repulsion weighting system and an associated numerical penalty function. This paper analyzes these movement algorithms to find unexpected behaviour and suggests an alternative penalty function based on relative distances, a cumulative functional and simulated annealing.

SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B

ID ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS; TRANSITIONS; COMPETITION; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB A co-evolving and adaptive Rock (R)-Paper (P)-Scissors (S) game (ARPS) in which an agent uses one of three cyclically dominating strategies is proposed and studied numerically and analytically. An agent takes adaptive actions to achieve a neighborhood to his advantage by rewiring a dissatisfying link with a probability p or switching strategy with a probability 1-p. Numerical results revealed two phases in the steady state. An active phase for p < p(c) has one connected network of agents using different strategies who are continually interacting and taking adaptive actions. A frozen phase for p > p(c) has three separate clusters of agents using only R, P, and S, respectively with terminated adaptive actions. A mean-field theory based on the link densities in co-evolving network is formulated and the trinomial closure scheme is applied to obtain analytical solutions. The analytic results agree with simulation results on ARPS well. In addition, the different probabilities of winning, losing, and drawing a game among the agents are identified as the origin of the small discrepancy between analytic and simulation results. As a result of the adaptive actions, agents of higher degrees are often those being taken advantage of. Agents with a smaller (larger) degree than the mean degree have a higher (smaller) probability of winning than losing. The results are informative for future attempts on formulating more accurate theories.

ID MODEL
AB We describe an evaluation of spoken dialogue strategies designed using hierarchical reinforcement learning agents. The dialogue strategies were learnt in a simulated environment and tested in a laboratory setting with 32 users. These dialogues were used to evaluate three types of machine dialogue behaviour: hand-coded, fully-learnt and semi-learnt. These experiments also served to evaluate the realism of simulated dialogues using two proposed metrics contrasted with 'Precision-Recall'. The learnt dialogue behaviours used the Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) model, and we report the first evaluation of this model in a realistic conversational environment. Experimental results in the travel planning domain provide evidence to support the following claims: (a) hierarchical semi-learnt dialogue agents are a better alternative (with higher overall performance) than deterministic or fully-learnt behaviour; (b) spoken dialogue strategies learnt with highly coherent user behaviour and conservative recognition error rates (keyword error rate of 20%) can outperform a reasonable hand-coded strategy; and (c) hierarchical reinforcement learning dialogue agents are feasible and promising for the (semi) automatic design of optimized dialogue behaviours in larger-scale systems.

AB Background: Patient follow-up is an essential part of hospital ward management. With the development of deep learning algorithms, individual follow-up assignments might be completed by artificial intelligence (AI). We developed an AI-assisted follow-up conversational agent that can simulate the human voice and select an appropriate follow-up time for quantitative, automatic, and personalized patient follow-up. Patient feedback and voice information could be collected and converted into text data automatically.
   Objective: The primary objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up to manual follow-up of patients after surgery. The secondary objective was to compare the feedback from AI-assisted follow-up to feedback from manual follow-up.
   Methods: The AI-assisted follow-up system was adopted in the Orthopedic Department of Peking Union Medical College Hospital in April 2019. A total of 270 patients were followed up through this system. Prior to that, 2656 patients were followed up by phone calls manually Patient characteristics, telephone connection rate, follow-up rate, feedback collection rate, time spent, and feedback composition were compared between the two groups of patients.
   Results: There was no statistically significant difference in age, gender, or disease between the two groups. There was no significant difference in telephone connection rate (manual . 2478/2656, 93.3%; AI-assisted: 249/270, 92.2%; P=.50) or successful follow-up rate (manual: 2301/2478, 92.9%; AI-assisted: 231/249, 92.8%; P=.96) between the two groups. The time spent on 100 patients in the manual follow-up group was about 9.3 hours. In contrast, the time spent on the AI-assisted follow-up was close to 0 hours. The feedback rate in the AI-assisted follow-up group was higher than that in the manual follow-up group (manual: 68/2656, 2.5%; AI-assisted: 28/270, 10.3%; P<.001). The composition of feedback was different in the two groups. Feedback from the AI-assisted follow-up group mainly included nursing, health education, and hospital environment content, while feedback from the manual follow-up group mostly included medical consultation content.
   Conclusions: The effectiveness of AI-assisted follow-up was not inferior to that of manual follow-up. Human resource costs are saved by AI. AI can help obtain comprehensive feedback from patients, although its depth and pertinence of communication need to be improved.

ID SEQUESTRATION
AB This paper proves the soundness of supercritical CO2 displacement for enhancing gas recovery of a tight gas reservoir via laboratory investigations and compositional modeling. First, a novel phase behavior experimental device with a screened supercritical CO2 dyeing agent were first presented to better understand the mixture characteristics between supercritical CO2 and natural gas. The mass transfer between two vapor phases was also measured. Then, based on experimental results, the compositional model considering the influence of CO2 diffusion on the gas recovery and critical property adjustment of supercritical CO2 was established. The miscibility process and mixing properties, such as density, viscosity, and the flowing velocity vector, of supercriticalCO(2) and natural gas were visualized through a 3D display, which obtained a better understanding of the flooding mechanism of Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) via supercritical CO2. Finally, with experiments and numerical simulations, the main benefits of CO2 EGR were shown, which were partial miscibility between CO2 and natural gas, pressure maintenance, and CO2 displacement as a gas cushion. In general, experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that CO2 EGR can be seen as a promising way of prolonging the productive life and enhancing recovery of tight gas reservoirs.

AB The scope of our work has been the development of a new type of coupling agent by which processing of long carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites by conventional injection moulding can be possible. The experimental additive was expected to hinder fibre breakage and to simultaneously improve the mechanical properties of the composites. Resistance of LLDPE reinforced with 1-10wt% long carbon fibres against tensile, flexure and impact stresses has been investigated. Tensile strength of carbon fibre/LLDPE composites has increased by 10-30%; flexure strength has gained 15-90% related to the neat polymer depending on the fibre concentration. The effect of a blowing agent on the mechanical properties has also been investigated. At least 20% higher yield strength has been measured for the foamed sample with 5% carbon fibre related to the nonfoamed one with the same fibre content. The higher the fibre content was, the higher the improvements in the mechanical properties became. Fibre-matrix interaction has been studied on scanning electron microscopy graphs where a well-connected polymer layer has been observed to the fibre surface.

AB Emotion plays an important role in thinking. In this article we study affective control of the amount of simulated anticipatory behavior in adaptive agents using a computational model. Our approach is based on model-based reinforcement learning (RL) and inspired by the simulation hypothesis (Cotterill, 2001; Hesslow, 2002). The simulation hypothesis states that thinking is internal simulation of behavior using the same sensory-motor systems as those used for overt behavior. Here, we study the adaptiveness of an artificial agent, when action-selection bias is induced by an affect-controlled amount of simulated anticipatory behavior. To this end, we introduce an affect-controlled simulation-selection mechanism that uses the predictions of the agent's RL model to select anticipatory behaviors for simulation. Based on experiments with adaptive agents in two nondeterministic partially observable grid-worlds we conclude that (1) internal simulation has an adaptive benefit and (2) affective control can reduce the amount of simulation needed for this benefit. This is specifically the case if the following relation holds: positive affect decreases the amount of simulation towards simulating the best potential next action, while negative affect increases the amount of simulation towards simulating all potential next actions. In essence we use artificial affect to control mental exploration versus exploitations. Thus, agents "feeling positive" can think ahead in a narrow sense and free up working memory resources, while agents "feeling negative" must think ahead in a broad sense and maximize usage of working memory. Our results are consistent with several psychological findings on the relation between affect and learning, and contribute to answering the question of when positive versus negative affect is useful during adaptation.

ID VARIABILITY
AB We develop a spatially explicit individual-based model which imitates the population dynamics of the Arctic fox on Mednyi Island. In the Red Data Book of the Russian Federation, the Mednyi Arctic fox is listed as an endangered species. The developed model is based on data collected during 19 years of fieldwork. Annual marking of cubs in the study area allowed us to identify up to 80% of animals individually and to collect their life-history data. As a result, we identify the mortality rates of males and females of all age groups, the probabilities of breeding, litter sizes, the sex ratios of animals in different age classes, social structures, dispersal distances, and the patterns of making decisions in the selection of social partners and habitat patches. The model is spatially explicit, i.e., the heterogeneity of the habitat patches is defined in an explicit form. The model works with a time step of one year. In simulations, such demographic parameters as population dynamics, population age structure, sex ratio in different age classes, and the structure and size of families conformed to the empirical data. An analysis of the model sensitivity to the variations of mortality rates in different age groups showed that the sensitivity to the shift of cubs' mortality is much higher compared to adults of all age classes. Through increasing the cub mortality rate to 95% over a period of one to five years, we simulated the effect of otodectic mange epizootic which was observed in the real population of Mednyi Arctic fox. The population recovery time after the end of the impact in the simulation was significantly longer compared to field data. We suggest that in reality, with a low population size, the productivity of the population increases, and the mortality of cubs may decrease. This feedback which accelerates population recovery has not yet been introduced into the model.

AB Measuring the exercise of market power has always been a fundamental problem in electricity markets. According to a well-known economic definition, a seller's market power is defined as "the ability to maintain prices profitably above competitive levels for a significant period of time". This standard definition implies that market power has a fuzzy nature, which leads to the development of a fuzzy system for estimating the exercised market power. As understood from the definition, both duration and magnitude of market power play key roles in the measurement of the exercised market power. The fuzzy estimator gathers these two relevant aspects in a unified framework and uses them to assign a unique measure to the exercised market power. The fuzzy estimator is applied to measure each power supplier's market power in an agent-based computational framework of the considered electricity market. In this agent-based simulation, the power suppliers use Q-learning to learn how to respond to competitors' behavior and market conditions. The experimental results confirm the capability of the proposed fuzzy estimator to monitor and diagnose the exercise of market power.

AB Motion planning is an important problem in character animation and interactive simulation. However, few planning methods have considered domain-specific knowledge that governs the agent's behaviors, and none of them is capable of planning the interactive task in which the agent interacts with the objects in the virtual environment. This paper presents a novel method to plan the interactive task based on Q-learning for intelligent characters. The approach can be described as a three-phase framework: data preprocessing phase, controller learning phase, and motion-synthesis phase. In the data preprocessing phase, we abstract the motion clips as high-level behaviors and construct the interactive behavior graph (IBG) to define the interactive capabilities of the agent in terms of interactive features. For the controller training phase, with IBG, Q-learning algorithm is employed to train the control policy in the discrete domain with interactive features. In the motion-synthesis phase, the optimal motion sequences can be generated by following the policy to accomplish the interactive task finally. The experimental results demonstrate that the uniform framework can generate reasonable and realistic motion sequences to plan interactive task in complex environment.

The plant exhibited significant property to act as an anti inflammatory agent. In experimental design, inflammation was produced by carrageenan in rats and compare with saline treated and Aspirin treated group. Simultaneously the drug was also observed for its antiulcer response and found effective enough (these two activities were observed at the dosage of 300mg/kg and 500mg/kg). The anti ulcer activity was observed 41.2% as a dosage of 500mg/kg. Neuropharmacological activities (open field, head dip, rearing traction and forced swimming test) were also observed at 300 and 500mg/kg of C. rotundus extract. The crude extract showed mild decreased in all test and exhibited slight muscle relaxant effect. Powder drug studies and FTIR analysis were performed for the authentication of C. rotundus.

AB Experimental evidence indicates that human brain cancer cells proliferate or migrate, yet do not display both phenotypes at the same time. Here, we present a novel computational model simulating this cellular decision-process leading up to either phenotype based on a molecular interaction network of genes and proteins. The model's regulatory network consists of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), its ligand transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), the downstream enzyme phospholipaseC-gamma (PLC gamma) and a mitosis-associated response pathway. This network is activated by autocrine TGFa secretion, and the EGFR-dependent downstream signaling this step triggers, as well as modulated by an extrinsic nutritive glucose gradient. Employing a framework of mass action kinetics within a multiscale agent-based environment, we analyse both the emergent multicellular behavior of tumor growth and the single-cell molecular profiles that change over time and space. Our results show that one can indeed simulate the dichotomy between cell migration and proliferation based solely on an EGFR decision network. It turns out that these behavioral decisions on the single cell level impact the spatial dynamics of the entire cancerous system. Furthermore, the simulation results yield intriguing experimentally testable hypotheses also on the sub-cellular level such as spatial cytosolic polarization of PLC gamma towards an extrinsic chemotactic gradient. Implications of these results for future works, both on the modeling and experimental side are discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A newly developed mechanochemical process for the simple aqueous phase synthesis of crystalline magnetite nanoparticles has been experimentally investigated. In this process, a suspension of ferric hydroxide precursor is milled at room temperature using a horizontal tumbling ball mill consisting of a stainless steel pot and balls. Ferric hydroxide is transformed to magnetite without the use of a reducing agent. As a model starting material for the investigation, a pH-adjusted suspension of crystalline goethite was used. As the milling time increased, goethite disappeared along with the simultaneous formation of magnetite. A single phase of magnetite was obtained after 16 h of milling. A reaction mechanism for the formation of magnetite has been proposed based on oxidation-reduction reactions, in which the corrosion of iron in the pot and balls plays an important role. Free electrons are generated by the release of ferrous ions from the stainless steel in an anodic reaction, which then reduce goethite to ferrous hydroxide in a cathodic reaction. The solid phase reaction between ferrous hydroxide and goethite produces magnetite. Not only could the mechanochemical effect induced by the collision of balls accelerate the corrosion even under alkaline conditions, it can also promote the formation and crystallization of magnetite.

AB In the present work, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was applied to study the solubility of two water-insoluble drugs, fenofibrate and nimodipine, in a series of micelle-forming PEO-b-PCL block copolymers with combinations of blocks having different molecular weights. The solubility predictions based on the MD results were then compared with those obtained from solubility experiments and by the commonly used group contribution method (GCM). The results showed that Flory-Huggins interaction parameters computed by the MD simulations are consistent with the solubility data of the drug/PEO-b-PCL systems, whereas those calculated by the GCM significantly deviate from the experimental observation. We have also accounted for the possibility of drug solubilization in the PEO block of PEO-b-PCL.

This article presents the application of the turning bands (TB) method to discover knowledge about the client-perceived spatiotemporal web performance. The TB method is used to study spatial or spatiotemporal phenomena. We conducted an experimental study to apply this technique. The MWING system was used to collect performance measurement for four clients, each monitoring the same group of web servers during several weeks of observations. In this article we present TB-based web performance prediction for an agent localized in Wroclaw, Poland, and monitoring European web servers. The results of the spatial prediction of the total download web page times within a forecast of a two-week period showed that the TB simulation is efficient.

AB Real world markets display power-law features in variables such as price fluctuations In stocks. To further understand market behavior. we have conducted a series of market experiments on our web-based prediction market platform which allows us to reconstruct transaction networks among traders From these networks, we are able to record the degree of a trader, the size of a community of traders, the transaction time interval among traders and other variables that are of interest The distributions of all these variables show power-law behavior on the other hand, agent-based models have been proposed to study the properties of real financial markets We here study the statistical properties of these agent-based model sand compare them with the results from our web-based market experiments In this work, three agent-based models are studied, namely, zero-intelligence (ZI), zero-intelligence-plus (ZIP) and Gjerstad-Dickhaut (GD). Computer simulations of variables based on these three agent-based models were carried out. We found that although being the most naive agent-based model, ZI indeed best describes the properties observed in real markets Our study suggests that the basic ingredient to produce the observed properties from real world markers could in fact be the result of a Continuously evolving dynamical system with basic features similar to the ZI model (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB Despite success in theory formulation and prediction of quantities and patterns in nature, traditional modeling approaches have not proven particularly valuable as ''surrogate experimental systems'' in applied ecology. Theoretical models, while useful as embodiments of ecological theory, are too simplistic to be effective surrogate systems. Although simulation models can represent systems of realistic complexity, they are limited by factors which arise from the way in which they are built. We propose an alternative paradigm for modeling biotic systems which promises to enhance their usefulness as surrogate experimental systems. This paradigm is based on the premise that dynamic behavior in biotic systems emerges from the low-level interactions of independent agents. It forms the basis for the new field of artificial life (ALife), which involves the study of life-like behavior in artificial systems. In an ALife model, the target biological system is modeled as a population of independent computer programs called machines. The complete behavioral repertoire of each individual, including its interaction with others, is specified within the entity itself. A spatially-referenced ''environment'' is provided within which the machines interact with each other and their local environment. There is no overall controlling program or agent. Thus, the overall behavior of the system emerges from local interactions between independent agents. In this paper, we examine the premises upon which ALife is based (including the concept of emergence) and discuss several examples of ALife models at ecological scales, which we call ''artifical ecosystems''. We next introduce LAGER, an environment for producing and running artificial ecosystems. Finally, we present PARE, a host/parasitoid dynamics model built in LAGER, and compare its behavior to two similar systems in the literature.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate individual units within a system, such as the bacteria in a biological wastewater treatment system. This paper outlines past, current and potential future applications of ABMs to wastewater treatment. ABMs track heterogeneities within microbial populations, and this has been demonstrated to yield different predictions of bulk behaviors than the conventional, "lumped'' approaches for enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) completely mixed reactors systems. Current work included the application of the ABM approach to bacterial adaptation/evolution, using the model system of individual EBPR bacteria that are allowed to evolve a kinetic parameter (maximum glycogen storage) in a competitive environment. The ABM approach was successfully implemented to a simple anaerobic-aerobic system and it was found the differing initial states converged to the same optimal solution under uncertain hydraulic residence times associated with completely mixed hydraulics. In another study, an ABM was developed and applied to simulate the heterogeneity in intracellular polymer storage compounds, including polyphosphate (PP), in functional microbial populations in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) process. The simulation results were compared to the experimental measurements of single-cell abundance of PP in polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), performed using Raman microscopy. The model-predicted heterogeneity was generally consistent with observations, and it was used to investigate the relative contribution of external (different life histories) and internal (biological) mechanisms leading to heterogeneity. In the future, ABMs could be combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models to understand incomplete mixing, more intracellular states and mechanisms can be incorporated, and additional experimental verification is needed.

AB The Winfree model is the first mathematical model for synchronization of weakly coupled oscillators. Compared to the well-known Kuramoto model, the Winfree model does not conserve the total phase. This leads to rich dynamic features compared to those produced by other phase models. In this paper, we study the emergent dynamics of the Winfree model on a locally coupled static network. A randomly chosen phase configuration undergoes several dynamic phase transitions such as incoherence, partial locking, complete locking, partial oscillator death, and complete oscillator death, as the coupling strength increases. We provide several rigorous analytical results on the emergence of these dynamic features. We also provide several numerical simulations and compare their results to the analytical results.

AB This paper presents a new general framework for adaptive event-triggered control strategy to extend average inter-event interval, while maintaining the performance of the system. The proposed event-triggering mechanism is acquired from input to state stability conditions, which is defined in terms of system states as well as an adaptation parameter. Under the Lipschitz assumption, a positive lower bound on sampling durations is also established that is essential to restrain the Zeno behavior. Applying the proposed method to linear time-invariant systems, leads to sufficient conditions to guarantee asymptotic stability in the form of matrix inequalities. Moreover, it is shown that there exist more degrees of freedom to improve the performance criterion from theoretical aspects. Finally, in order to show capability of the proposed method and its better performance compared with some recent works, numerical simulations are presented.

AB Chiral resolution is a fundamental problem in pharmaceutics or agrochemicals, so a great effort has been made to generate experimental techniques capable of producing mechanical separation of a mixture of enantiomers. Unlike other techniques that are usually employed, such as chiral resolving agents or chiral chromatography, we propose a new technique which is directly applicable in solution and without further processing. This technique is based on optical forces, since we show that with the proper design of the polarization states of the incident beams and temporal dephasing, a chiral sensitive optical conveyor can be obtained that is able to transport enantiomers in opposite directions. The implementation of such an optical conveyor with the required focused optical fields produces a well-defined trapping region for each enantiomer, since theoretical simulations over a large number of chiral particle trajectories show that it is possible to reach values of enantiomeric excess of over 99%.

AB Maritime piracy has been a major issue for the international community in the last decade and affected the global economy. As a reaction to this issue, international organizations have deployed naval forces to protect maritime transportation in the affected regions. In this study, we present a simulation-based analysis tool to evaluate the effectiveness of operations to prevent piracy. In our model, we consider three stakeholders' views (pirates, maritime transporters, and naval forces) and modelled their behaviours separately, using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) approaches. Our hybrid DES and ABS model is used to simulate hypothetical scenarios on the Gulf of Aden for understanding the cause and effect relationship between naval resource allocation and piracy prevention. Our experimental results showed that, first, helicopters are most valuable in prevention and, second, either patrolling or escorting naval ships must carry a helicopter for effective prevention.

ID SELF-ETCHING ADHESIVE; GASEOUS OZONE; DENTIN
AB Ozone is an important disinfecting agent, however its influence on enamel adhesion has not yet been clarified. Objective: Evaluate the influence of ozone pretreatment on the shear strength of an etch-and-rinse and a self-etch system to enamel and analyze the respective failure modes. Material and Methods: Sixty sound bovine incisors were used. Specimens were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (n=15): Group G1 (Excite (R) with ozone) and group G3 (AdheSE (R) with ozone) were prepared with ozone gas from the HealOzone unit (Kavo (R)) for 20 s prior to adhesion, and groups G2 (Excite (R)) and G4 (AdheSE (R)) were used as control. Teeth were bisected and polished to simulate a smear layer just before the application of the adhesive systems. The adhesives were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions to a standardized 3 mm diameter surface, and a composite (Synergy D6, Coltene Whaledent) cylinder with 2 mm increments was build. Specimens were stored in 100% humidity for 24 h at 37 degrees C and then subjected to a thermal cycling regimen of 500 cycles. Shear bond tests were performed with a Watanabe device in a universal testing machine at 5 mm/min. The failure mode was analyzed under scanning electron microscope. Means and standard deviation of shear bond strength (SBS) were calculated and difference between the groups was analyzed using ANOVA, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Levene and Bonferroni. Chi-squared statistical tests were used to evaluate the failure modes. Results: Mean bond strength values and failure modes were as follows: G1- 26.85 +/- 6.18 MPa (33.3% of adhesive cohesive failure); G2 - 27.95 +/- 5.58 MPa (53.8% of adhesive failures between enamel and adhesive); G3 - 15.0 +/- 3.84 MPa (77.8% of adhesive failures between enamel and adhesive) and G4 - 13.1 +/- 3.68 MPa (36.4% of adhesive failures between enamel and adhesive). Conclusions: Shear bond strength values of both adhesives tested on enamel were not influenced by the previous application of ozone gas.

AB In this paper, we present an experimental trial involving the use of a complex spatial simulation platform to support a planning decision process in the city of Besancon (eastern France). In medium-sized towns across France, households with children are leaving to settle in periurban areas, and Besancon is no exception. Under those circumstances, the political objective of the Besancon City authority is to keep middle- and high-income households with children within the city. The simulation platform MobiSim was used in this context to explore the possible outcomes of spatial planning policies, set by both the Greater Besancon authority (Besancon and the surrounding periurban communities) and the city of Besancon, on residential migrations over a 20 year period. MobiSim integrates several models representing demographic, social, economic, and spatial processes. Modelled entities are individuals and dwellings. Rules determine how individuals form households. Other rules locate dwellings in buildings.
   The experimental trial began in October 2012. It involved two researchers in geography and planning from the University of Franche-Comte (Besancon, France) and two planning practitioners working in Besancon city council's planning service: the Department of Planning, Projects and Forward Planning. The first stage of the trial was the collective definition and simulation of a baseline position simply extending existing trends from 2010 to 2030: the 'Business as usual' scenario. The second stage was a collective reflection on possible modifications to some of the variables and parameters of this scenario in order to simulate a pro-active policy of housing construction in the medium term.
   Under the conditions represented in the model, the 'Pro-active housing construction' scenario in Besancon allows an overall reduction of migration flows from Besangon to the surrounding periurban areas. More single parent families choose to reside in Besancon during the whole simulation time. Couples with children, however, choose preferentially to reside in Besancon until 2022 only. At this date, the controlled housing developments become less numerous.
   This experimental trial gave the researchers and the planning actors involved in it the occasion to exchange their scientific knowledge and their empirical knowledge. The simulation of the 'Business as usual' scenario was, as it were, a means to thoroughly explore one possible future. This then led the group to discuss possible planning actions designed to reduce migration flows of households with children out of Besancon into periurban areas.
   The trial also shows some limitations: it highlights that this kind of PSS makes the planning actors heavily dependent on the expertise of the researchers for every stage of the process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Subsurface tomography with diffuse light has been investigated with a noncontact approach to characterize the performance of absorption and fluorescence imaging. Using both simulations and experiments, the reconstruction of local subsurface heterogeneity is demonstrated, but the recovery of target size and fluorophore concentration is not linear when changes in depth occur, whereas the mean position of the object for experimental fluorescent and absorber targets is accurate to within 0.5 and 1.45 mm when located within the first 10 mm below the surface. Improvements in the linearity of the response with depth appear to remain challenging and may ultimately limit the approach to detection rather than characterization applications. However, increases in tissue curvature and/or the addition of prior information are expected to improve the linearity of the response. The potential for this type of imaging technique to serve as a surgical guide is highlighted. (c) 2007 Optical Society of America.

AB The demand planning process in semiconductor supply chains faces many challenges. In this process, individuals, their properties such as sensing capabilities and their interactions play a crucial role. This paper shows how agent-based modelling (ABM) can provide a computational testbed to investigate these aspects with respect to forecast accuracy. Based on the requirements of the demand planning context, we develop an empirically validated agent-based model of the demand planning process. In this model, we incorporate different concepts from behavioural science and the distributed cognition perspective. We show the usefulness of this agent-based computational testbed by using a case study from the semiconductor industry. Our model shows that demand planning accuracy does not depend on the planning capabilities of planners alone, but that the interactions of the individuals, emerging from the planning process design, may both positively and negatively affect accuracy.

AB This paper is helpful for understanding interactive-agent economies. It presents a user-friendly framework for exploring the implications of economic interaction, and demonstrates its wide applicability. Agents repeatedly face binary choices and receive i.i.d. shocks; payoffs depend upon one's own action and shocks, as well as upon the actions of a subset of other agents. Simulations explore how properties change as the number of agents, the number of neighbors, and the degree of interaction change. Key results in this framework include the following: The law of large numbers can readily be postponed or defeated, stationarity and ergodicity are trivial to deduce, any equilibrium distribution may be attained in "globally interactive" economies, continuous- and discrete-time analogues generally behave very similarly, dynamics can be sensitive to details of the interaction structure (implying that popular mean-field approximations are not always appropriate), and substantial persistence is typical.

AB A simultaneous polymerization/crosslinking method for preparing polyacrylamide - based hydrogels is proposed. The influence of different experimental parameters (chemical nature of the crosslinking agent, pH, monomer and initiator concentration, temperature and reaction time) on crosslinked polymer yield and its swelling behavior was studied. Both polymer yield and network structure - as reflected by its swelling capacity - depend on synthesis conditions and mainly on monomer concentration in the initial monomer solution.

AB An agent-based financial stock price model is developed and investigated by a stochastic interacting epidemic system, which is one of the statistical physics systems and has been used to model the spread of an epidemic or a forest fire. Numerical and statistical analysis are performed on the simulated returns of the proposed financial model. Complexity properties of the financial time series are explored by calculating the correlation dimension and using the modified multiscale entropy method. In order to verify the rationality of the financial model, the real stock market indexes, Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Component Index, are studied in comparison with the simulation data of the proposed model for the different infectiousness parameters. The empirical research reveals that this financial model can reproduce some important features of the real stock markets. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the synchronization problem of the Kuramoto-oscillator network with nonidentical oscillators. The fixed-time event-triggered synchronization control strategies are developed for phase agreement and frequency synchronization under both continuous and intermittent communication. With the developed fixed-time controller, the synchronization can be achieved within a pre-defined time for any initial phase of each oscillator. The event-triggered mechanism avoids continuous controller update and data transmission, which significantly saves the computation and communication resources. Furthermore, theoretical analysis shows that the fixed-time convergence can be guaranteed and the Zeno behavior is avoided by the proposed methods. The numerical simulations of each situation also verify the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization control strategies. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article presents an agent-based travel demand model, where agents react to transport supply across all mobility choices. Long-term choices include mobility tool ownership and work locations. Daily travel patterns are simulated at the individual level by sequentially combining activity frequency, activity durations and destinations as well as a rule-based time-of-day scheduling. A key to success in this novel approach is balancing individual preferences of travelers with system constraints. The model incorporates two types of constraints: 1) capacity constraints of the transport infrastructure. 2) natural time and space constraints during the execution of individual 24-hour day plans. Model results are validated against empirical observations of travel demand in Switzerland. The article concludes with a perspective for further research and development in the field of applied agent-based modeling.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) plays a role in the mechanism of acute "classic" as well as acute remote ischemic preconditioning (IP). Thirtytwo male Wistar rats were divided into five experimental groups. The rat cremaster flap in vivo microscopy model was used for assessment of ischemia/reperfusion injury. In the control group (CG, n = 8), a 2-hr flap ischemia was induced after preparation of the cremaster muscle. The animals of group NO (n = 6) received 500 nmol/kg of the NO-donor spermine/nitric oxide complex (Sper/NO) intravenously 30 min prior to ischemia. The group LN + P (L-NAME + preclamping, n = 6) received 10 mg/kg N(i)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) intravenously before preclamping of the flap pedicle (10-min cycle length, 30-min reperfusion). L-NAME (10 mg/kg) was administered in group LN + T (L-NAME + tourniquet, n = 6) before ischemia of the right hindlimb was induced, using a tourniquet for 10 min after flap elevation. The limb was then reperfused for 30 min. Thereafter, flap ischemia was induced in each group as in group CG. In vivo microscopy was performed after 1 hr of flap reperfusion in each animal. Group NO demonstrated a significantly higher red blood cell velocity (RBV) in the first-order arterioles and capillaries, a higher capillary flow, and a decreased number of leukocytes adhering to the endothelium (stickers) of the postcapillary venules by comparison to all other groups (P < 0.05). The average capillary RBV and capillary flow were still higher in the CG than in the groups receiving L-NAME (P < 0.05). The data show that NO plays an important role in the mechanism of both acute "classic" as well as acute remote IP, since the administration of a NO-donor previous to ischemia simulates the effect of IP, whereas the nonspecific blocking of NO synthesis by L-NAME abolishes the protective effect of flap preconditioning.

AB Introduction: We aimed to identify the entropy levels that would correspond to bispectral index (BIS) levels during general anaesthesia induction in patients who will undergo elective lumbar disc surgery.
   Material and methods: 30 cases in American Society of Anesthesiology classification groups I-II who underwent lumbar disc surgery under general anaesthesia were included in our study between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2005. BIS and entropy electrodes were applied at the same time in 30 cases in the study group. Non-invasive mean arterial pressures (NMAP), heart rates (HR) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) were measured in all cases before induction. During induction, measurements of these parameters every 30 seconds were also recorded. In order to assess the level of sedation during anaesthesia, 'Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation' (OAA/S) scale was used. BIS, entropy and OAA/S values were recorded simultaneously.
   Results: Induction OAA/S scores were in correlation with BIS and entropy values. Together with the decreases in OAA/S scores, BIS and entropy values decreased as well, but the decrease in entropy values was more rapid. A significant difference was found between BIS and entropy induction values (p<0.05). Induction MAP and HR values at 30, 60, 90, 120 seconds were lower than the values of the control, which was statistically significant (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: During the induction of general anaesthesia, we found entropy values to be more sensitive and they demonstrated a more rapid decrease than BIS. Based on this observation, induction agents that might cause severe hypotension could be more safely administered under entropy monitoring.

AB Textile industry has become an essential part of modern society, and waste production is an inevitable outcome of the developmental activities. Present paper outlines a direct approach toward a real problem of managing spinney waste fibers generated during textile industry. Simultaneously, shortage in landfill disposal space is another trouble associated with dumping of these hazardous wastes. Direct incorporation of these wastes into cementitious materials faces some disadvantages, so a partial oxidative degradation treatment was performed for those wastes in laboratory-scale experiments. Slurry resulted from the degradation process was incorporated into a mixture of cement/sand as hydrating agent to produce a mortar composite. Mechanical integrity and weight stability of the mortar composite produced were evaluated at the end of setting and hardening period under different variables. Based on the experimental results, the nominated mortar composite could be considered as an added-value product suitable for various applications, for example inert matrix for immobilization of some low and intermediate levels radioactive wastes, decorative tiles, building bricks, light concrete.

TI REAL-TIME ACTION MODEL LEARNING WITH ONLINE ALGORITHM 3SG
SO APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB An action model, as a logic-based representation of action's effects and preconditions, constitutes an essential requirement for planning and intelligent behavior. Writing these models by hand, especially in complex domains, is often a time-consuming and error-prone task. An alternative approach is to let the agents learn action models from their own observations. We introduce a novel action learning algorithm called 3SG (Simultaneous Specification, Simplification, and Generalization), analyze and prove some of its properties, and present the first experimental results (using real-world robots of the SyRoTek platform and simulated agents in action computer game Unreal Tournament 2004). Unlike the majority of available alternatives, 3SG produces probabilistic action models with conditional effects and deals with action failures, sensoric noise, and incomplete observations. The main difference, however, is that 3SG is an online algorithm, which means it is rather fast (polynomial in the size of the input) but potentially less precise.

AB This paper presents the experimental procedure to develop air lime-based injection grouts, including polymeric superplasticizers, a water repellent agent and pozzolanic agents as additives. Our research focuses on the development of grouts to improve various characteristics simultaneously by combining different additions and admixtures. Aiming to improve the injectability of the grouts, in this study, different polymeric superplasticizers were added, namely polycarboxylated-ether derivative (PCE), polynaphthalene sulfonate (PNS) and condensate of melamine-formaldehyde sulfonate (SMFC). As a water-repellent agent, sodium oleate was used to reduce the water absorption. The enhancement of the strength and setting time was intended by using microsilica and metakaolin as pozzolanic mineral additions. Compatibility between the different admixtures and action mechanism of the different polymers were studied by means of zeta potential and adsorption isotherms measurements. Diverse grout mixtures were produced and investigated by assessing their injectability, fluidity, stability, compressive strength, hydrophobicity and durability. This research led to several suitable mixtures produced by using more than one component, to enhance efficiency and to provide better performance of grouts. According to the results, the grout composed of air lime, metakaolin, sodium oleate and PCE was found to be the most effective composition, improving the mechanical strength, injectability and hydrophobicity.

AB Given the complex and multidimensional nature of human evolution, we need to develop theoretical and methodological frameworks to account for and model the dynamic feedbacks between co-operational biological and cultural evolutionary systems to better understand the processes that produced modern human behavior. Equally important is the generation of explicit theory-based models that can be tested against the empirical paleoanthropological record. We present a case study that examines evidence for culturally-driven behavioral change among Late Pleistocene hominins that altered the social niche occupied by hominins in western Eurasia, with consequences for subsequent biological and cultural evolution. We draw on a large sample of 167 Pleistocene assemblages across western Eurasia and employ mathematical and computational modeling to explore the feedbacks between cultural and biological inheritance. Shifts in land-use strategies changed the opportunities for social and biological interaction among Late Pleistocene hominins in western Eurasia with a cascade of consequences for cultural and biological evolution, including the disappearance of Neanderthals from the fossil and archaeological records, and the acceleration of cultural evolution among ancestors of modern humans.

AB This paper examines the emergence of complex volatility in dynamic asset markets when there are heterogeneous agents. A discrete formulation is studied with two categories of market participants, fundamentalist traders who buy when the asset price is below the fundamental value and sell when it is above and noise traders who use moving average technical trading rules that can lead them to chase trends. Agents switch from one type of strategy to the other according to relative returns. A variety of outcomes are studied using numerical simulation, including variation of market price responsiveness to changes in excess demand, in switching behavior, and the introduction of noise. Bifurcation analysis of certain parameters is presented.

ID SENSITIVITY; UNCERTAINTY
AB Background: The propagation of communicable diseases through a population is an inherent spatial and temporal process of great importance for modern society. For this reason a spatially explicit epidemiologic model of infectious disease is proposed for a greater understanding of the disease's spatial diffusion through a network of human contacts.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to develop an agent-based modelling approach the integrates geographic information systems (GIS) to simulate the spread of a communicable disease in an urban environment, as a result of individuals' interactions in a geospatial context.
   Methods: The methodology for simulating spatiotemporal dynamics of communicable disease propagation is presented and the model is implemented using measles outbreak in an urban environment as a case study. Individuals in a closed population are explicitly represented by agents associated to places where they interact with other agents. They are endowed with mobility, through a transportation network allowing them to move between places within the urban environment, in order to represent the spatial heterogeneity and the complexity involved in infectious diseases diffusion. The model is implemented on georeferenced land use dataset from Metro Vancouver and makes use of census data sets from Statistics Canada for the municipality of Burnaby, BC, Canada study site.
   Results: The results provide insights into the application of the model to calculate ratios of susceptible/infected in specific time frames and urban environments, due to its ability to depict the disease progression based on individuals' interactions. It is demonstrated that the dynamic spatial interactions within the population lead to high numbers of exposed individuals who perform stationary activities in areas after they have finished commuting. As a result, the sick individuals are concentrated in geographical locations like schools and universities.
   Conclusion: The GIS-agent based model designed for this study can be easily customized to study the disease spread dynamics of any other communicable disease by simply adjusting the modeled disease timeline and/or the infection model and modifying the transmission process. This type of simulations can help to improve comprehension of disease spread dynamics and to take better steps towards the prevention and control of an epidemic outbreak.

AB Uncertainties and non-linearities between processes involved in rural dynamics pose a challenge to planners and policymakers. Numerical models minimize the risk of making an inappropriate decision and assist planners with making informed policy decisions. In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of the social, economic and demographic dimensions of rural dynamics using a system dynamics approach. The resulting model (RUSEM: RUral Socio-Economic Model) consists of four main modules that reproduce the main characteristics of the rural areas, with a focus for the European case. The economic module contains the most important variables in the dynamics of local economies - for example, the provision of key services, the availability of public services, and local economic structure. The social and demographic modules use large age groups to analyse the labour market and population dynamics. The attractiveness module summarises push-pull factors affecting rural migration. The model is used to evaluate thirty-six socio-economic scenarios of rural Spain. The results show that very small villages could be incapable to stop rural decline because the absence of "critical mass" while mid-sized villages require targeted actions to reinforce the positive feedbacks of local economy. RUSEM has two goals: to offer computational support enabling robust decision-making in policy formulation in conditions of deep uncertainty and to integrate the socio-economic dimension into Earth System Models (ESMs) providing a numerical model that can be embedded into ESMs at a relatively cheap computational cost.

AB Micelles formed by nonionic fluorocarbon surfactant N-(diethyleneglycol) perfluorooctane amide as a foaming agent due to its excellent foaming performance in aqueous solution were studied through surface tension, dynamic light scattering, isothermal titration calorimetry, and dissipative particle dynamic simulation. The surface activity, adsorption, and thermodynamic parameters (Delta G(m)(0), Delta G(ads)(0), Delta H-m(0), Delta S-m(0), Delta H-m(A), Delta C-p,m(0)) of micellization were systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that this nonionic fluorocarbon surfactant had superior surface activity and the micelle formation was entropydriven. The micelle formation was also demonstrated by dynamic light scattering and isothermal titration calorimetry. Furthermore, to better understand the micelle formation, dissipative particle dynamic (DPD) simulation was conducted to simulate the whole formation process.

AB Empirical studies have revealed remarkable perceptual organization in neonates. Newborn behavioral distinctions have often been interpreted as implying functionally specific modular adaptations, and are widely cited as evidence supporting the nativist agenda. In this theoretical paper, we approach newborn perception and attention from an embodied, developmental perspective. At the mechanistic level, we argue that a generative mechanism based on mutual gain control between bilaterally corresponding points may underly a number of functionally defined "innate predispositions" related to spatial-configural perception. At the computational level, bilateral gain control implements beamforming, which enables spatial-configural tuning at the front end sampling stage. At the psychophysical level, we predict that selective attention in newborns will favor contrast energy which projects to bilaterally corresponding points on the neonate subject's sensor array. The current work extends and generalizes previous work to formalize the bilateral correlation model of newborn attention at a high level, and demonstrate in minimal agent-based simulations how bilateral gain control can enable a simple, robust and "social" attentional bias.

AB A novel chemical self-healing system based on microcapsule technology for cementitious composites is established. The key issue for such a system is how to release the healing agent and how to activate the healing mechanism. The present study focuses on the release behavior. The smart release behavior of the healing agent in the microcapsule is characterized by the EDTA (Ethylene Diamine Tetra-acetic Acid) titration method. The experimental results show that the release of the corrosion inhibitor covered with polystyrene resin (PS) is a function of time, and is controlled by the wall thickness of the microcapsule. Moreover, the pH value affects the release rate of the corrosion inhibitor; the release rate remarkably increases with the decreasing pH value. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates exponential stabilization of continuous-time dynamic systems (CDSs) via event-based impulsive control (EIC) approaches, where the impulsive instants are determined by certain state-dependent triggering condition. The global exponential stability criteria via EIC are derived for nonlinear and linear CDSs, respectively. It is also shown that there is no Zeno-behavior for the concerned closed loop control system. In addition, the developed event-based impulsive scheme is applied to the synchronization problem of master and slave memristive neural networks. Furthermore, a self-triggered impulsive control scheme is developed to avoid continuous communication between the master system and slave system. Finally, two numerical simulation examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed event-based impulsive controllers.

AB Bilateral conflicts, e.g., common pool resource allocation, pollution prevention, collusion of markets, or share transboundary water, often involve more than one issue that requires solution. The theoretical literature suggests that linking conflictive issues opens new opportunities for cooperation. We present a new experimental setting of bilateral conflicts, in which each issue is modeled as a separate Prisoner's Dilemma game. In two experiments, the effect of issue-linkage on cooperation is evaluated by comparing a treatment in which the two games are played sequentially (isolated treatment) with one where they are played simultaneously (linked treatment). Specifically, in the linked treatment each agent observes the payoffs from playing the different paths across games (e.g., cooperate in game1 but defect in game2) and then acts accordingly by committing to one of these paths. We differentiate the case where issue linkage implies symmetrical payoffs across games (Experiment 1), from the asymmetric case where one agent receives higher benefits from issue-linkage (Experiment 2). We find that issue linkage increases mutual cooperation and decreases mutual defection. Asymmetry reduces the level of cooperation in both isolated and linked games, yet issue linkage facilitates cooperation even when payoffs are asymmetric.

AB In cancer research, two-stage designs are usually used to assess the effect of a new agent in phase II clinical trials. Optimal two-stage designs with two co-primary endpoints have been proposed to assess the effects of new cancer treatments, such as cytostatic or molecularly targeted agents (MTAs), based on both response rate and early progression rate. Accurate estimation of response and early progression rates based on the data from the phase II trials conducted according to the optimal two-stage designs would be very useful for further testing of the agents in phase II trials. In this paper, we derive some estimation procedures, which include both standard and biascorrected maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) and uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimate (UMVUE), for two binomial probabilities which are used to define the hypotheses for two co-primary endpoints tested in a two-stage phase II clinical trial. Simulation studies were performed to evaluate the performance of these procedures. These procedures are also applied to analyze the data from a phase II trial conducted by the Canadian Cancer Trials Group.

AB Within the framework of the determination of pesticides of the carbamate family, the isocyanates prove to be excellent derivatizing agents of the hydrolysis products of pesticide residues. The optimum conditions for derivatization require the use of an aqueous organic solution (water-acetonitrile) with the presence of triethylamine. Under these conditions, the derivatives formed (ureas or carbamates) must be stable to enable a reliable and representative determination. Our objective, therefore, was to study the parameters, such as solvent, structure of the derivatizing agent, pH, nature of the catalyst, and the optimum conditions needed for stability. The kinetic and statistical analysis of 24 compounds (an analysis of variance based on 142 measurements) demonstrate that neither the effects of pH, nor of the group introduced by the derivatizing agent make it possible to simultaneously stabilize all of the formed derivatives. To ensure reliable and repeatable determination of the carbamate (obtained after derivatization), it is necessary to expulse the carbamate, in the organic phase, by adding NaCl to the aqueous-organic medium.

AB Situations characterised by the presence of a high density of pedestrians involved in negative interactions (e.g. flows in opposite directions) often represent a problematic scenario for simulation models, especially those taking a discrete approach to the representation and management of spatial aspects of the environment. While these situations can be relatively infrequent, and even if architects, event organisers and crowd managers actually try to prevent them as much as possible, they simply cannot be neglected and they actually represent interesting situations to be analysed by means of simulation. The paper presents specific extensions to a floor-field Cellular Automata pedestrian model that are specifically aimed at supporting the simulation of high density situations comprising negative interactions among pedestrians without incurring in the traditional limits of discrete approaches. The models are formally described and experimented in experimental and real world situations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Goal-directed pedestrian movement behavior is extensively studied by researchers from varied fields, but pedestrian's movement actions such as 'impulse stops' resulting from exploratory movement behavior receive little attention. To understand this, an effective tool that can reveal the attractive interactions between pedestrians and attractors in the environment is needed. This study introduces an agent-based microscopic pedestrian simulation model-CityFlow-U. To determine whether a pedestrian would stop for visual attractors, factors of attractor's attractiveness, distance to the attractor as well as the visibility of the attractor from current location of the agent are considered. By analyzing the parameters in this model, we have successfully revealed different pedestrian movement modes, attractor preferences and movement trajectories in a notional setting. The reliability of the model is then demonstrated with a simulation scenario targeting at a circulation region of a shopping mall in Hong Kong. Observational data is used for model input and the number changes of attracted pedestrians in front of a major attractor are compared between simulation results and empirical video data. Results from the parameter analysis and simulation scenario show that the model is flexible and can benefit in real applications such as shop arrangement as well as street furniture placement.

AB In this work we develop an agent-based model that offers an alternative to standard, computable general equilibrium integrated assessment models (IAMs). The Dystopian Schumpeter meeting Keynes (DSK) model is composed of heterogeneous firms belonging to capital-good, consumption-good and energy sectors. Production and energy generation lead to greenhouse gas emissions, which affect temperature dynamics. Climate damages are modelled at the individual level as stochastic shocks hitting workers' labour productivity, energy efficiency, capital stock and inventories of firms. In that, aggregate damages emerge from the aggregation of losses suffered by heterogeneous, interacting and boundedly rational agents. The model is run focusing on a business-as-usual carbon-intensive scenario consistent with a Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5. We find that the DSK model is able to account for a wide ensemble of micro- and macro-empirical regularities concerning both economic and climate dynamics. Simulation experiments show a substantial lack of isomorphism between the effects of micro- and macro-level shocks, as it is typical in complex system models. In particular, different types of shocks have heterogeneous impact on output growth, unemployment rate, and the likelihood of economic crises, pointing to the importance of the different economic channel affected by the shock. Overall, we report much larger climate damages than those projected by standard IAMs under comparable scenarios, suggesting possible shifts in the growth dynamics, from a self-sustained pattern to stagnation and high volatility, and the need of urgent policy interventions.

AB Aggregate shocks affect most households' and firms' decisions. Using three stylized models, we show that inference based on cross-sectional data alone generally fails to correctly account for decision making of rational agents facing aggregate uncertainty. We propose an econometric framework that overcomes these problems by explicitly parameterizing the agents' decision problem relative to aggregate shocks. Our framework and examples illustrate that the cross-sectional and time-series aspects of the model are often interdependent. Therefore, estimation of model parameters in the presence of aggregate shocks requires the combined use of cross-sectional and time-series data. We provide easy-to-use formulas for test statistics and confidence intervals that account for the interaction between the cross-sectional and time-series variation. Lastly, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that highlight the properties of the proposed method and the risks of not properly accounting for the presence of aggregate shocks.

AB [1] Recent observations of ultrafine aerosol production in the atmosphere support the hypothesis of ions acting as nucleation agents. We use a numerical model of ion-induced aerosol formation based on experimental cluster ion thermodynamics to study the production of ultrafine aerosol in the troposphere and its response to variations in background ionization. An analytical model is used to explain the findings. Our results show a considerable ultrafine particle and surface area production due to ion-induced nucleation. Both particle and surface area production readily respond to variations in ionization, such as resulting from the modulation of the galactic cosmic ray intensity by the 11 year solar cycle. However, this response may be positive or negative, depending on ambient conditions. We explain the mechanism responsible for this behavior. The large particle production seen in our simulations suggests that ion-induced nucleation is an important atmospheric process, which may promote the solar cycle signal to the troposphere.

AB Drugs and their effects on olfactory learning processes in rats were tested using a modified version of the runway apparatus developed by Ades. Rats were first exposed to a conspecific urine sample and 24 h later were exposed to the same stimulus in the runway. Observations recorded the time spent investigating the urine and the number of sniffs at the site, these being considered to be indices of memory. Diazepam-treated rats (4 or 6 mg/kg) and scopolamine-treated rats (0.5 or 1 mg/kg) showed increases for both parameters. When both drugs were administered simultaneously, the impairing effect was potentiated. However, no changes in learning responses were observed in rats treated with physostigmine (0.125, 0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (0.3, 0.5, 1 mg/kg), although the administration of physostigmine or methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate was shown to antagonize the impairing effect of diazepam or scopolamine respectively. These observations support the hypothesis of interactions existing between cholinergic agents and benzodiazepine receptor ligands and of such interactions affecting olfactory acquisition processes. The runway apparatus appears to be a valid candidate model to be used for the assessment of pharmacological influences on olfactory learning in rats. (C) Elsevier, Paris.

AB The development of cost effective, cleanup technologies for organophosphorus contaminants continue to be a high priority for environmental restoration research. Such development involves the coordination of experimental and theoretical investigations to understand and integrate both technological and fundamental aspects of key processes. Although the major processes affecting the natural and engineered treatment of organophosphates have been appreciated qualitatively, many questions remain regarding their reaction mechanisms. Unique properties of clay minerals and metal oxides such as high adsorption and catalytic ability have resulted in their applications as natural adsorbents and catalysts in the development of cleanup technologies. An understanding of the physical and chemical characteristics of the contaminants, adsorption sites of selected catalytic materials, details of sorption of contaminants on soil, on soil in water solution, and also their distribution within the environment is of particular interest. Application of computational chemistry can provide deeper insight into the aforementioned characteristics of organophosphorus compounds as is discussed in this article. Theoretical models were developed that explain and predict how clay minerals and metal oxides, their type and size, and adsorption site can affect the adsorption and decomposition of selected nerve agents and their simulants, and the influence on many factors including the presence of cations, water, and different used computational methods and techniques was analyzed. Several different initial positions and orientations of organophosphate molecules on models of metal oxides and clays were tested. The results show that the small fragments of metal oxides and clay minerals are much more reactive toward the adsorption of organophosphates which under certain conditions can lead to their decomposition. On the other hand, decrease in ionicity of metal oxides results in lowering of the binding affinity toward such compounds. (C) 2010 American Vacuum Society [DOI: 10.1116/1.3271148]

TI Non-Markovian majority-vote model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
AB Non-Markovian dynamics pervades human activity and social networks and it induces memory effects and burstiness in a wide range of processes including interevent time distributions, duration of interactions in temporal networks, and human mobility. Here, we propose a non-Markovian majority-vote model (NMMV) that introduces non-Markovian effects in the standard (Markovian) majority-vote model (SMV). The SMV model is one of the simplest two-state stochastic models for studying opinion dynamics, and displays a continuous order-disorder phase transition at a critical noise. In the NMMV model we assume that the probability that an agent changes state is not only dependent on the majority state of his neighbors but it also depends on his age, i.e., how long the agent has been in his current state. The NMMV model has two regimes: the aging regime implies that the probability that an agent changes state is decreasing with his age, while in the antiaging regime the probability that an agent changes state is increasing with his age. Interestingly, we find that the critical noise at which we observe the order-disorder phase transition is a nonmonotonic function of the rate beta of the aging (antiaging) process. In particular the critical noise in the aging regime displays a maximum as a function of beta while in the antiaging regime displays a minimum. This implies that the aging/antiaging dynamics can retard/anticipate the transition and that there is an optimal rate beta for maximally perturbing the value of the critical noise. The analytical results obtained in the framework of the heterogeneous mean-field approach are validated by extensive numerical simulations on a large variety of network topologies.

AB In this study, distributed dynamic event-triggered controller containing Markov switching topologies is proposed in Markovian Complex Networks (MCNs). It is proved that the Zeno-behavior is avoided. Considering that the time delay and the controller vary with different modes in practical applications, two terms of the controller are designed to contain Markov switching. And mode-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functions (LKFs) are constructed, whereby the time-varying delay with Markov switching in the controller is perfectly processed. And by constructing a pair of LKFs, some summation terms containing the transition probability are eliminated. In addition, two synchronization criteria for MCNs with input mode delay and Markovian directed communication are established. Finally, numerical simulations are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Underworking (i.e. shirking) and overworking of employees can have detrimental effects for the individual and the organisation. We develop a computational model to investigate how work structure, specifically the way in which managers distribute work tasks amongst employees, impacts work intensity and working time. The model draws on theories from economics, psychology and management, and on empirical observations. The simulations show that when managers correctly estimate task difficulty, but undervalue the employee's competence, opportunities for shirking are provided due to longer deadlines. Similarly, if managers overvalue the employee's competence, they set tighter deadlines leading to overwork. If task difficulty is misjudged, initially only influence on employee working time is observed. However, it gradually generates competence misjudgements, indirectly impacting the employee's effort level. An interaction between competence misjudgement and task uncertainty slows the manager's ability to correctly estimate employee competence and prolongs initial competence misjudgements. The study highlights the importance of applying dynamic modelling methods, which allows for testing theory assumptions in silico, generating new hypotheses and offers a foundation for future research. Practitioner summary: A computational model was developed to investigate how the structure of work allocation influences opportunities for shirking and overworking by employees. The paper demonstrates how dynamic modelling can be used to explain workplace phenomena and develop new hypotheses for further research.

AB The tensile behavior of low density polyethylene/polydimethylsiloxane immiscible blends was investigated with respect to morphological variation of the blends. Experimental data of elastic modulus was compared with theoretical predictions of parallel model (mixing rule), as the upper bound of modulus, Halpin-Tsai model, and a two-parameter equivalent mechanical model proposed by Kolarik, which takes into account the continuity of minor phase. As the predictions of these models were not in good quantitative agreement with experiment, some modifications were made to the Kolarik model. Furthermore, a new approach for determining equivalent mechanical model parameters was proposed based on the calculation of phase continuity parameters as a function of composition. Using this approach, the values predicted for elastic modulus were found to be in good agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the influence of a peroxide curing agent on the tensile properties of the blends was studied. The improvement of the tensile properties of the blends could have resulted from two contributions: the effect of curing reaction on the tensile properties of constituents and the better interfacial adhesion, because of possible interfacial reaction, as indicated by morphological observation.

TI VALFRAM: Validation Framework for Activity-based Models

LA English

DE agent-based modelling; activity based model; transport; validation;
   methodology; simulation
AB Activity-based models are a specific type of agent-based models widely used in transport and urban planning to generate and study travel demand. They deal with agents that structure their behaviour in terms of daily activity schedules: sequences of activity instances (such as work, sleep or shopping) with assigned start times, durations and locations, and interconnected by trips with assigned transport modes and routes. Despite growing importance of activity-based models in transport modelling, there has been no work focusing specifically on statistical validation of such models so far. In this paper, we propose a six-step Validation Framework for Activity-based Models (VALFRAM) that exploits historical real-world data to quantify the model's validity in terms of a set of numeric metrics. The framework compares the temporal and spatial properties and the structure of modelled activity schedules against real-world origin-destination matrices and travel diaries. We demonstrate the usefulness of the framework on a set of six different activity-based transport models.

AB Purpose: Perfluorocarbon (PFC) microdroplets, called phase-change contrast agents (PCCAs), are a promising tool in ultrasound imaging and therapy. Interest in PCCAs is motivated by the fact that they can be triggered to transition from the liquid state to the gas state by an externally applied acoustic pulse. This property opens up new approaches to applications in ultrasound medicine. Insight into the physics of vaporization of PFC droplets is vital for effective use of PCCAs and for anticipating bioeffects. PCCAs composed of volatile PFCs (with low boiling point) exhibit complex dynamic behavior: after vaporization by a short acoustic pulse, a PFC droplet turns into a vapor bubble which undergoes overexpansion and damped radial oscillation until settling to a final diameter. This behavior has not been well described theoretically so far. The purpose of our study is to develop an improved theoretical model that describes the vaporization dynamics of volatile PFC droplets and to validate this model by comparison with in vitro experimental data.
   Methods: The derivation of the model is based on applying the mathematical methods of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics to the process of the acoustic vaporization of PFC droplets. The used approach corrects shortcomings of the existing models. The validation of the model is carried out by comparing simulated results with in vitro experimental data acquired by ultrahigh speed video microscopy for octafluoropropane (OFP) and decafluorobutane (DFB) microdroplets of different sizes.
   Results: The developed theory allows one to simulate the growth of a vapor bubble inside a PFC droplet until the liquid PFC is completely converted into vapor, and the subsequent overexpansion and damped oscillations of the vapor bubble, including the influence of an externally applied acoustic pulse. To evaluate quantitatively the difference between simulated and experimental results, the L2-norm errors were calculated for all cases where the simulated and experimental results are compared. These errors were found to be in the ranges of 0.043-0.067 and 0.037-0.088 for OFP and DFB droplets, respectively. These values allow one to consider agreement between the simulated and experimental results as good. This agreement is attained by varying only 2 of 16 model parameters which describe the material properties of gaseous and liquid PFCs and the liquid surrounding the PFC droplet. The fitting parameters are the viscosity and the surface tension of the surrounding liquid. All other model parameters are kept invariable.
   Conclusions: The good agreement between the theoretical and experimental results suggests that the developed model is able to correctly describe the key physical processes underlying the vaporization dynamics of volatile PFC droplets. The necessity of varying the parameters of the surrounding liquid for fitting the experimental curves can be explained by the fact that the parts of the initial phospholipid shell of PFC droplets remain on the surface of vapor bubbles at the oscillatory stage and their presence affects the bubble dynamics.

AB To evaluate failure loads of teeth restored by use of alumina-coping, and to assess the effects of different amounts of residual tooth structure and different cements, standardized artificial alumina copings were fabricated on seventy-two molars. 24 of the copings were cemented by use of an adhesive resin cement (P-group), n=24 by use of glass-ionomer cement (K-group), and n=24 by use of a self-adhesive modified composite resin-cement (R-group). After artificial ageing (10,000 thermal-cycles between 6.5 and 60 degrees C; 1,200,000 chewing cycles with F-max=64 N), the specimens were loaded until failure (cross-head-speed: 0.5 mm/min). In the K-group 83% of the specimens failed during chewing simulation. Statistical analysis included chi-squared-test, unpaired-to-sample-t-test, and ANOVA. For severely damaged teeth, loads to failure in the P-group (384 N) were significantly (p=0.03) higher than in the R-group (295 N). For severely damaged teeth, use of composite resin cement resulted in higher loads to failure than use of other cements.

AB This paper presents an agent-based human behavioral modeling framework to analyze probable human actions, in emergency situations, considering both physical and psychological dimensions, in emergency situations. Human's prospective controls suggest that the environment can offer certain physical and psychological conditions to opt for a finite number of feasible human actions that lead to desired system states. A set of possible human actions is then generated and updated from the affordance-effectivity duals in a spatial-temporal dimension. In this paper, a reward and cost-based dynamic affordance-based agent model is built upon physical and psychological constraints that are inserted for the agents' decision-making processes. The model employs Markov Decision Process (MDP), and NASA-TLX (Task Load Index) is used as cost and reward estimates. The action selection process of human agents, i.e., triggering of state transitions, is stochastically modeled in accordance with the action-state cost (load) values. A series of affordance-based numerical values are calculated for predicting prospective actions in the system. Finally, an evacuation simulation example based on the proposed model is illustrated to verify the proposed human behavioral modeling framework. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In an attempt to investigate the nonlinear dynamic mechanism of financial market microstructure, a stochastic interacting epidemic system is applied to establish an agent-based financial price dynamics, in which the spread of viruses and the physical condition of humans in the interacting epidemic system are, respectively, utilized to imitate the dispersal of the information and the investment attitude of the investors in a stock market. Combined with the ensemble empirical mode decomposition, the composite multiscale entropy analysis is applied to analyze the fluctuation complexity of financial time series, including the proposed model data and seven real stock indices. Further, the Zipf fluctuation behaviors of these time series are also investigated. The comparatively empirical results of the real indices and the simulation data show the similar fluctuation behaviors, indicating that this agent-based financial model can imitate some important properties of stock markets.

AB Selective noncatalytic reduction of NO with ammonia (NH3) as a reducing agent and methane (CH4) and propane (C3H8) as gaseous additives was studied using bench- and pilot-scale experimental setups. The performances of the two additives and their injection pathways were investigated and compared. As indicated by the bench-scale experiments, the NO conversion efficiency was significantly enhanced above 700 degrees C upon addition of CH4 and C3H8. The temperature window for high NOx conversion efficiency was extended downward from 900 to 750 degrees C and from 900 to 700 degrees C in the presence of CH4 (alpha = 0.5) and C3H8 (alpha = 0.2), respectively. When the additives and NH3 were injected simultaneously at the same location, the de-NO efficiency increased as much as 20% due to the formation of a reducing atmosphere, subsequently accelerating the generation of hydroxyl groups after the addition of additives, which induce the dehydrogenation of NH3 and accelerate the combination of NO with NH2 to generate N-2 and H2O.

AB Increasing the adoption of energy efficient technologies by households is one of the formulated strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a systematic review of agent-based modelling studies on the adoption of energy efficiency by households. It starts with an overview of barriers for adoption, of energy efficiency policies, energy efficiency model types. Afterwards, an analysis is given of technologies modelled, policies simulated, decision-making theories included, and the use of empirical data. An overview is presented of how technologies, barriers and policies relate in the models. Furthermore, the core policy recommendations from existing models are presented. The analysis shows that the reviewed studies predominantly focus on a subset of barriers - a lack of capital, a lack of information, high upfront cost, ignorance, inertia and other priorities. So far, agent-based models have focused on how subsidies, technology bans and information campaigns influence energy efficiency adoption. There is ample opportunity for future agent-based modelling research on energy efficiency adoption policy by studying other residential technologies, other barriers, and other policies that fit the agent-based modelling paradigm well.

AB Agent-based modeling is increasingly being used for computer simulation of complex biological systems. An agent-based model (ABM) is a bottom-up simulation where the bulk dynamics of the model result from the local interactions of its individual constituents or agents. However, due to emergent qualities of ABMs, bulk behaviors may be sensitive to the size of the model as determined by the population of individuals. Therefore, in certain circumstances it may be critical to closely match the simulation size with the actual system. This may be particularly true in biological systems, where multiple large-scale heterogeneous populations can range into millions or even billions of individual cells/agents. Most existing ABM simulation toolkits are designed for serial computing and cannot effectively simulate such mega-scale systems from a run-time standpoint. In this paper, we investigate data-parallel ABM implementations on graphics processing units to address the scalability issue of ABMs. As an example, we have implemented an abstracted version of the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome ABM. We also implemented a serial version to confirm statistical accuracy. Our results show that parallelization on graphics processing units offers a substantial gain in performance without a loss in accuracy.

AB We have used density functional theory and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to pursue an accurate description of the hydrazine water system adsorbed on low-index surfaces of copper. Experimental evidence suggests that shape control in the reverse micelle synthesis of nanoparticles may be affected by differences in interactions of the reducing agent (hydrazine) with the surfaces. First, we have modeled the competitive adsorption of single molecules of water and hydrazine from the gas phase, which, however, shows no preference for selective adsorption. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations of a system of hydrazine cooperatively adsorbed with a hydration shell reveals a strong influence on the adsorption behavior from the network of hydrogen bonding. A comparison of the thermodynamics of simulations with and without hydrazine adsorbed at the surface suggests that hydrazine will adsorb on the (111) surface but not on the (100) surface. These findings explain the experimental crystal shapes induced by reducing agent through a mechanism of binding to and accelerating the growth of the (111) faces.

ID SARS-COV-2 TRANSMISSION; DYNAMICS
AB SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the world, causing high mortality and unprecedented restrictions on social and economic activity. Policymakers are assessing how best to navigate through the ongoing epidemic, with computational models being used to predict the spread of infection and assess the impact of public health measures. Here, we present OpenABM-Covid19: an agent-based simulation of the epidemic including detailed age-stratification and realistic social networks. By default the model is parameterised to UK demographics and calibrated to the UK epidemic, however, it can easily be re-parameterised for other countries. OpenABM-Covid19 can evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions, including both manual and digital contact tracing, and vaccination programmes. It can simulate a population of 1 million people in seconds per day, allowing parameter sweeps and formal statistical model-based inference. The code is open-source and has been developed by teams both inside and outside academia, with an emphasis on formal testing, documentation, modularity and transparency. A key feature of OpenABM-Covid19 are its Python and R interfaces, which has allowed scientists and policymakers to simulate dynamic packages of interventions and help compare options to suppress the COVID-19 epidemic.
   Author summary Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, computational modelling has been used to inform key uncertainties facing policymakers such as the number of cases and deaths, hospital capacity, tests and contact tracers. Models need to be: sufficiently complex to yield realistic predictions; computationally efficient to allow calibrations; and easy to use so that various policy mixes can be evaluated. OpenABM-Covid19 is a detailed epidemic model of the spread of COVID-19, simulating every individual in a population. Our model enables scientists and policymakers to quickly compare the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns, testing, quarantine, and digital and manual contact tracing. The model considers a hypothetical city with a default population of 1 million people whose ages and contact patterns are parameterised according to UK demographics. All of the parameters are openly documented and modifiable so that they can be adapted to fit other countries' data, and refined to match our understanding of COVID-19 as the epidemic progresses. The computer model simulates people's movement between their homes, workplaces, schools, and social interactions. OpenABM-Covid19 is open source and has been developed collaboratively by teams from academia and industry. Its modularity, documentation, testing framework, and accessibility via Python and R have provided validation, invited contributions, and encouraged wide adoption.

ID ASPHALT MIXTURES; PERFORMANCE
AB The amount of produced asphalt mixtures incorporating reclaimed asphalt has been steadily increasing in the past years and so has the use of recycling agents. Some countries in Europe and elsewhere have already come into contact with repeatedly recycled materials. This study, therefore, investigated the influence of long-term ageing on multiple recycled binder blends and thereby simulated a repeated recycling process. In order to be able to understand the behaviour and well describe the characteristics of recycled binder blends, the obtained results were compared to the behaviour (results) of paving bitumens and reclaimed binders (binders extracted from Reclaimed Asphalt). Each binder group was then described by empirical tests as specified in the harmonised standard for paving bitumens (EN 12591) as well as by performance parameters for assessing long-term embrittlement such as viscoelastic temperature (V-ET) and the Glover-Rowe (G-R) parameter. It was found that recycled binder blends exhibited similar or higher penetration compared to paving bitumens upon recycling as well as after ageing, but the softening point shifted to a higher temperature domain. Likewise, reclaimed binders' properties were rather similar to long-term aged paving bitumens than to recycled binder blends. Furthermore, it was confirmed that a strong correlation between V-ET and G-R exists although different binder groups manifested different durability thresholds. Additionally, a relationship was found between V-ET, G-R and softening point. It was proved that usage of empirical tests can in some cases provide asphalt engineers with equivalent information about binder rheology as modern functional parameters in case of non-modified binders.

AB Invadopodia or invasive feet, which are actin-rich membrane protrusions with matrix degradation activity formed by invasive cancer cells, are a key determinant in the malignant invasive progression of tumors and represent an important target for cancer therapies. In this work, we presented a microfluidic 3D culture device with continuous supplement of fresh media via a syringe pump. The device mimicked tumor microenvironment in vivo and could be used to assay invadopodia formation and to study the mechanism of human lung cancer invasion. With this device, we investigated the effects of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor, GM6001 on invadopodia formation by human non-small cell lung cancer cell line A549 in 3D matrix model. This device was composed of three units that were capable of achieving the assays on one control group and two experimental groups' cells, which were simultaneously pretreated with EGF or GM6001 in parallel. Immunofluorescence analysis of invadopodia formation and extracellular matrix degradation was conducted using confocal imaging system. We observed that EGF promoted invadopodia formation by A549 cells in 3D matrix and that GM6001 inhibited the process. These results demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling played a significant role in invadopodia formation and related ECM degradation activity. Meanwhile, it was suggested that MMP inhibitor (GM6001) might be a powerful therapeutic agent targeting invadopodia formation in tumor invasion. This work clearly demonstrated that the microfluidic-based 3D culture device provided an applicable platform for elucidating the mechanism of cancer invasion and could be used in testing other anti-invasion agents.

AB In this paper we present a formal model of distributed building inspired by wasp colonies. We characterize a set of distributed stigmergic algorithms that allow a swarm of simple agents to build coherent nest-like structures. The agents that constitute the swarm of builders move randomly on a 3D lattice and can deposit elementary bricks. The agents do not communicate, have no global representation of the architecture they are building, do not possess any plan or blueprint and can only perceive the local configuration of matter surrounding them. Only a few of these configurations are stimulating, that is, trigger a building action. The aim of this paper is not to prove that this model is an accurate model of how wasps behave, but rather to show (i) that such behavioural algorithms can produce coherent biological-like architectures, (ii) that these architectures, if they are to be generated with these behavioural algorithms, require algorithms with specific ''coordination'' properties, and (iii) finally that algorithms possessing these specific properties produce in turn only very specific, coherent architectures. In effect, we found an empirical one to one correspondence between biological-like architectures and ''coordinated algorithms''. Coordinated algorithms rely on a partition of the shape to be built into modular subshapes: if a swarm of agents is to build a given coherent architecture, the shape has to be decomposed into a finite number of building steps, with the necessary condition that the local stimulating configurations that are created at a given stage differ from those created at a previous or a forthcoming building stage so as to avoid disorganization of the whole building activity. Moreover, shapes generated with non-coordinated algorithms, for instance when stimulating configurations corresponding to the subshapes overlap and may subsequently affect the overall building process, are unstable, the same given rule table will produce very dissimilar architecture in different simulations. Finally, architectures generated under such conditions were found not to resemble any known biological architecture. We believe that our study constitutes a first step towards a deeper understanding of the origins of natural shapes in terms of the logical constraints that may have affected the evolutionary path.

   MECHANISM
AB Background. - The presence of intron 25S allows to divide the Candida albicans species into three subclasses (A, B, C). Intronless and intron harboring strains were reported to have different susceptibility to some drugs, for example to flucytosine and bleomycin.
   Objectives. - In this paper we tested the activity of selected antineoplastic agents, bleomycin, mitomycin C, dactinomycin and fluorouracil as well as antifungal drug flucytosine against 49 C albicans isolates. Twenty-four strains used in this work contained intron, whereas twenty-five were intronless.
   Methods. - The minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the standard microdilution method according to EUCAST.
   Results. - All of the tested agents showed antifungal activity. Bleomycin was the strongest with an average minimal inhibitory concentration [MIC] of 15.5 mg/L (range: 2-32), while the highest MIC was found for dactinomycin: 172.14 mg/L (range: 128-256). Intron harboring strains seem to be more susceptible to bleomycin and flucytosine; however, differences were not statistically significant. The only two strains with elevated MICs for flucytosine were intronless. In contrast, the MIC of 5-fluorouracil was more than two times lower in intron harbouring strains comparing to intronless strains (Pvalue = 0.0124). We found that the addition of folinate significantly increased the susceptibility of intronless strains to fluorouracil. MIC of fluorouracil decreased in this group from 58.24 (range: 16-256) to 16,78 mg/L (2-64) after the supplementation of folinate.
   Conclusion. - The antifungal potential of tested substances, especially the simultaneous action of fluorouracil and folinate (combination used in oncology), is encouraging further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Contribution: This paper presents the "PBL classroom model," an agent-based simulation (ABS) that allows testing of several scenarios of a project-based learning (PBL) application by considering different levels of soft-skills, and students' perception of the methodology.
   Background: While the community has made great advances in conducting engineering education studies, achieving goals of meaningful learning is still difficult. In this context, each new teaching methodology should be field tested, which can be time consuming. Introducing a simulation that can pre-test methodologies to check their efficiency can assist in the methodological building process.
   Research questions: The proposed simulation environment helps in understanding the differences in the learning rate of a group of agents (students) with different levels of humanization and instruction.
   Methodology: Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) was used to build the causal relationship between the students and a PBL methodology, to generate the input data for the simulation. Based on the analysis of the responses to a survey performed over five consecutive semesters, it was possible to generate some cause-effect data parameters to be used as the input for a hybrid type of ABS, known as PLS agent.
   Findings: The use of the proposed model, based on a computational approach, to study the educational process was validated; the simulation outcomes indicate that higher levels of self-esteem, self-realization, and cooperation result in better learning experiences.

AB Objective To determine the influence of propofol or methohexital, with and without doxapram, on the examination of laryngeal function in dogs. Study design Experimental study. Animals Forty healthy dogs randomly assigned to 4 groups: propofol with saline (n = 10), propofol with doxapram (n = 10), methohexital with saline (n = 10), or methohexital with doxapram (n = 10). Methods Propofol and methohexital were administered to effect. Investigators examined laryngeal function (initial) simultaneously with video laryngoscopy. Doxapram or saline was administered, and laryngeal function was reevaluated (second). Laryngeal motion, quality of laryngeal exposure, and the degree of swallowing, laryngospasm, and jaw tone were scored at each evaluation. Adverse events were recorded. Initial and second videos were evaluated by a masked observer, and still images obtained from both evaluations were evaluated for change in rima glottidis size by 2 masked observers. Results Administration of doxapram and saline was delayed with propofol (P = .001). Laryngeal function did not differ between dogs receiving propofol or methohexital, irrespective of doxapram administration. Doxapram improved breathing scores in both groups (P < .001). Jaw tone increased with propofol during the second evaluation (P = .049). Swallowing was more prevalent at initial examination (P = .020). Methohexital resulted in an increased heart rate (P < .001) compared with propofol. Twenty-five percent of dogs receiving methohexital developed seizure-like activity (n = 5/20). Conclusion Evaluation of laryngeal function did not differ between healthy dogs anesthetized with propofol or methohexital. Methohexital provided shorter examination times with less jaw tone but was associated with adverse events.
   Clinical significance: This study provides evidence to recommend propofol over methohexital as an induction agent for laryngeal function examination.

AB The kinetics of reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer ( RAFT), R-group approach star polymerizations have been studied via a combined experimental and theoretical approach. From the improved understanding herein developed, design criteria have been suggested to aid in future syntheses of RAFT, R-group approach star polymer. The suggested criteria are as follows. To minimize the quantity of linear polymer in the system, it is important to have a high rate of monomer propagation but a small delivery of radicals to the system. Crucial to the prevention of star-star coupling and resulting molecular weight distribution (MWD) broadening is the minimization of radical termination events between star molecules. Noting that the number of termination events is directly correlated to the number of decomposed initiator molecules, this might be achieved via several methods. A slow rate of initiator decomposition, a fast rate of propagation, or use of a rate-retarding RAFT agent can all lead to a reduction in star-star coupling events. Additionally, simulations reported herein demonstrate that the use of a star-forming RAFT agent substrate which has a fewer number of arms will lead to a reduction in the concentration of star-star coupled products. Ab initio calculations have been used to study intramolecular RAFT equilibria occurring early in the preequilibrium. These calculations have shown that highly stable intramolecular adduct radicals might be formed due to the close proximity of radicals and SdC bonds. The effect of these on the kinetics is studied.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of aqueous solutions of different concentrations of titanium tetrafluoride (TiF4) on dentin matrix stability up to six months.
   Design: Dentin specimens prepared from fifteen nonerupted molars were demineralized and randomly distributed into groups: 2.5% TiF4, 4% TiF4, 1000 ppm NaF, and control (distilled water). The modulus of elasticity (ME) and dry masses of the dentin matrix were determined at baseline, and up to 6 months following treatment. Collagen solubilization was estimated by hydroxyproline (HYP) quantification in the simulated body fluid used to store the dentin specimens.
   Results: The 2.5% TiF4 group presented higher ME immediately after treatment, and at 3 and 6 months storage, whereas 4% TiF4 showed higher means at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed among the groups over time (p = 0.9325). However, the 2.5% TiF4 group showed significantly higher ME than the control group, immediately after treatment. All the groups presented significantly higher mass change immediately, compared with 3 and 6 months (p < 0.0001). Except for the 4% TiF4 group, HYP release was higher in the first quarter (p = 0.0152), when no significant differences were found among the groups. In the second quarter, the means were significantly higher in the 2.5% TiF4 and 4% TiF4 groups. The group treated with 2.5% TiF4 had a statistically higher HYP release than the control group.
   Conclusion: An aqueous solution of 2.5% TiF4 increases the immediate stiffness values, but does not stabilize the collagenous dentin matrix.

AB The effects of dual infection of 1-day-old broiler chicks with a chicken isolate of avian pneumovirus (APV) and a pool of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains were studied by supraconjunctival application of the bacteria simultaneously with the virus, or at 4, 7 or 11 days afterwards. When the agents were given together, the clinical disease was significantly more severe than that caused by the virus alone, but when the bacterium was given later the signs were less severe. None of the infections resulted in swollen head syndrome by 32 days. All mixed infections caused moderate to severe congestion in the turbinates, when birds were examined at 32 days of age, at which time no such lesions were present in birds having been infected with APV alone. E. coli was isolated from almost 100% of birds with mixed infections, while rates of those given only E. coli isolation varied between 56 and 67%. Furthermore, E. coli colony counts were consistently higher from mixed infection groups. Virus persistence in the choanal cleft was slightly prolonged in birds with the simultaneous mixed infection. Although the pool of E. coli included O2, O78 and O18 serotypes, only those of the O2 serotype and a small number of untypable strains were re-isolated from selected mixed and single E. coli-infected groups. Mixed APV and E. coli infection did not affect APV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay antibody titres at 21 or 32 days. Thus, experimental infection of broiler chicks with APV and E. coli, simultaneously or at intervals afterwards, demonstrated a synergistic effect between the two agents, but none of the infection protocols caused swollen head syndrome.

AB Fusarium fujikuroi, the causative agent of bakanae disease in rice, produces many kinds of secondary metabolites. Recently, two phylogenetic subgroups (F and G groups) of Japanese F. fujikuroi have been identified and found to have differences in their gibberellin (GA) and fumonisin production. G-group F. fujikuroi produces large amounts of GA, but is a fumonisin nonproducer. F-group produces large amounts of fumonisin, but is a GA low or nonproducer. We investigated the cause of low GA production in the F-group. Genetic mapping suggests that low GA production in the F-group strain Gfc0825009 is due to a GA gene cluster for GA biosynthesis. Analysis of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the genes in the GA gene cluster showed >98.4% homology between the F-group strain Gfc0825009 and the G-group strain Gfc0801001. Following a 7-day culture under low nitrogen conditions, we found that expression of P450-1, P450-4, and P450-2 in the cluster increased in the G-group strain and not in the F-group strain. We hypothesized that complementation by GA genes in the G-group strain would be required to increase GA production in the F-group strain. However, we found that this occurred with a single gene complementation of DES, P450-1, P450-4, or P450-2. Simultaneous increase in the expression of P450-1, P450-4, and P450-2 were detected in the complementary transformants. Moreover, the same phenomenon was observed by reintegration of its own P450-1. Our results suggest the presence of unknown regulatory mechanisms of the GA gene cluster in F. fujikuroi.

AB Purpose: The toxic effects of excess vitamin A (VA) intake deserve increased attention. Nigella sativa (NS) seed possesses physiological and pharmacological actions and protects against toxic agents. This work investigated the availability of NS seed oil as a protective agent against the effects of hypervitaminosis A (HVA) on liver function and immunity. Methods: Fifty adult albino rats were used and divided into five groups: (G1) control; (G2) experimental HVA rats administered extreme doses (10,000 IU/kg body weight) of VA oil orally, daily for 6 weeks; (G3) rats treated with NS seed oil (800 mg/kg) orally, daily for 6 weeks; (G4) HVA rats simultaneously treated with NS seed oil at the same doses and periods; and (G5) HVA recovery group. Liver function, immunoglobulin (IgG and IgM) levels, and lysosome activity were measured in serum. Results: HVA rats revealed marked elevations in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities. This is the first study to demonstrate that NS seed oil possesses significant hepatoprotective activity against HVA. NS seed oil was a potent inducer of IgG and IgM in rat serum either alone or with high doses of VA. Conclusions: These findings may be considered the initial steps of the physiological and humoral immune responses for NS seed oil against HVA, but further studies examining longer periods are needed prior to recommending the use of NS seed oil as an alternative medicine for hepatic and immune diseases.

AB Distorted 3D hexagonal (space group R-3m) mesoporous titania thin films with high visible-light transparency are produced by introducing a small amount of 1-butanol into sol-gel coating sols containing P123 as the primary pore template. The mesostructure of the titania thin films identified by grazing incidence small angle x-ray scattering (GISAXS), transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy has rhombohedral symmetry (space group R-3m) with the [111] direction normal to the substrate. In the absence of butanol at the ratio of P123:titania used, poorly ordered films which may contain 2D or 3D hexagonal domains form, but introducing as little as a 1:10 ratio (by mass) of 1-butanol to P123 (with ethanol as coating solvent) leads to a well-defined 3D hexagonal structure in the resulting films. Simulated GISAXS patterns obtained using the NANODIFT program confirm the assignment of the experimental patterns to this structure. The characterization results indicate that over a 1-butanol:P123 mass ratio of 0.1 to 2, the films are composed of ordered arrays of cage-like cavities, and that in contrast to the hypothesized role of butanol as a swelling agent, the pore size decreases with an increase in the ratio of 1-butanol to P123.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB When an earthquake occurs, disaster relief is an urgent, complex and critical mission. High on the list is communication network recovery within the disaster area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are often used in this regard. Some of them are used as collective repeaters to provide the required network coverage. Their timely, efficient, and collaborative deployment to specific locations is a big challenge. To meet this challenge, this paper formalizes and solves the problem of UAV deployment for signal relays via group role assignment (GRA). The minimum spanning tree algorithm is used to model a rapidly deployed optimal relay network. It can help establish the minimum number of relay points necessary to ensure communication stability. In this scenario, UAVs (agents) adopt roles as communication relays. The task of distributing UAVs to relay points can be solved quickly via the assignment process of GRA, which can solve the x-ILP problem with the help of the PuLP package of Python. Results from thousands of experimental simulations indicate that. our solutions are effective, robust and practical. The process can be used to establish an optimal, efficient, and collaborative relay network using UAVs. Their rapid deployment can be a significant contribution to earthquake disaster relief.

AB To elucidate the role of environmental conditions in molecular-level dynamics and to study their impact on macroscopic brain tumor growth patterns, the expression of the genes Tenascin C and PCNA in a 2D agent-based model for the migratory trait is calibrated using experimental data from the literature, while the expression of these genes for the proliferative trait is obtained as the model output. Numerical results confirm that the gene expression of Tenascin C is indeed consistently higher in the migratory glioma cell phenotype and show that the expression of PCNA is consistently higher among proliferating tumor cells. Intriguingly, the time series of the tumor cells' gene expression exhibit a sudden change in behavior during the invasion of the tumor into a nutrient-abundant region, showing a robust positive correlation between the expression of Tenascin C and the tumor's diameter, yet a strong negative correlation between the expression of PCNA and the diameter. These molecular-level dynamics correspond to the emergence of a structural asymmetry in the form of a bulging tumor rim in the nutrient-abundant region. The simulated time series thus supports the critical role of the migratory cell phenotype during both the tumor system's overall macroscopic expansion and the evolvement of regional growth patterns, particularly in the later stages. Furthermore, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) suggests that for prediction purposes, the simulated gene expression profiles of Tenascin C and PCNA that were determined separately for the migrating and proliferating phenotypes exhibit lesser predictability than those of the phenotypic mixture combining all viable tumor cells typically found in clinical biopsies. Finally, partitioning the tumor into distinct geographic regions of interest (ROI) reveals that the gene expression profile of tumor cells in the quadrant close to the nutrient-abundant region is representative for the entire tumor whereas the expression profile of tumor cells in the geographically opposite ROI is not. Potential implications of these modeling results for experimental and clinical cancer research are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The influence of dopamine administration upon peripheral triiodothyronine (T3) production from thyroxine (T4) has been investigated at the subcellular level in the liver.  Using an in vivo-in vitro experimental design, 60 thyroidectomized and T4-substituted rats were treated over a period of 6 h either with dopamine at different dosages (2.5, 7.5, 15, 30, and 60-mu-g/kg.min), or with terbutaline (1-mu-g/kg.min), or with phentolamine (12-mu-g/kg.min), or simultaneously with dopamine and phentolamine (15/8 and 15/12-mu-g/kg.min, resp.).  Thereafter, in the liver T4-to-T3 deiodinating activity (5'-DA), T4-to-reverse T3 deiodinating activity, and cytosolic non protein sulfhydryl groups and in the serum insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were determined.
   Dopamine increased 5'-DA, when given at 7.5-mu-g/kg.min, while it decreased 5'-DA at higher dosages.  When the alpha-adrenergic blocker phentolamine was administered simultaneously, the depressing effect of dopamine was abolished or reversed to an increase of 5'-DA, according to the phentolamine dose applied. Phentolamine, when given exclusively, as well as the beta-adrenergic stimulating agent terbutaline increased 5'-DA.  Intracellular reverse T3 production was not affected by any of the adrenergic agents administered.  Concomitant changes of serum glucose and insulin and of cytosolic non protein sulfhydryl groups were not likely to account for the dopamine action upon T3 production.
   The data demonstrate, that dopamine acts on hepatic intracellular T3 production divergently, according to the dosage applied.  The study strongly suggests that the effects of dopamine on 5'-DA are due to alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation, respectively.  This mechanism may contribute to the disturbance of thyroid hormone regulation under dopamine treatment.

AB This paper addresses passivity-based motion coordination of rigid bodies in the Special Euclidean group SE(3) under the assumption that the agents exchange information over strongly connected graphs. In this paper, we especially focus on one of the motion coordination problems on SE(3) called attitude synchronization. We first develop a passivity-based distributed velocity input law to achieve attitude synchronization. Using the notion of algebraic connectivity, we then establish a connection between the speed of convergence and the structure of the interconnection graph. We also prove attitude synchronization in the leader-follower case and in the cases of communication delay and temporary communication failures. Finally, the performance of our developed control laws is demonstrated through both numerical simulation and experiments on a planar (2-D) test bed.

TI An Improved KF-RBF Based Estimation Algorithm for Coverage Control with

ID NETWORKS
AB This paper investigates the coverage control for a group of agents, where the density function over the given region is unknown and time-varying. A cost function, depending on the density function and a certain metric, is provided to evaluate the performance of coverage network. Then, while considering the sampling noise, a novel estimation algorithm is developed to approximate the density function based on the Kalman filter (KF) and the Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network. Compared with the other estimation algorithms, a novel sampling regulation mechanism is designed to improve the estimation performance and reduce the computational load. On this basis, a coverage control scheme with estimated density function is proposed to drive the agents to the optimal deployment. Moreover, the stability and performance of proposed coverage control system are strictly analyzed. Finally, numerical simulation is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed approaches.

AB Mechatronic systems are becoming an intrinsic part of our daily life, and the adopted control approach in turn plays an essential role in the emulation of the intelligent behavior. In this paper, a framework for the development of intelligent controllers is proposed. We highlight that robustness, prediction, adaptation, and learning, which may be considered the most fundamental traits of all intelligent biological systems, should be taken into account within the project of the control scheme. Hence, the proposed framework is based on the fusion of a nonlinear control scheme with computational intelligence and also allows mechatronic systems to be able to make reasonable predictions about its dynamic behavior, adapt itself to changes in the plant, learn by interacting with the environment, and be robust to both structured and unstructured uncertainties. In order to illustrate the implementation of the control law within the proposed framework, a new intelligent depth controller is designed for a microdiving agent. On this basis, sliding mode control is combined with an adaptive neural network to provide the basic intelligent features. Online learning by minimizing a composite error signal, instead of supervised off-line training, is adopted to update the weight vector of the neural network. The boundedness and convergence properties of all closed-loop signals are proved using a Lyapunov-like stability analysis. Numerical simulations and experimental results obtained with the microdiving agent demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and its suitableness for both stabilization and trajectory tracking problems.

AB The capability of monodisperse carboxylated particles of poly(methyl methacrylate) and of styrene copolymers with glycidyl methacrylate or with methacrylic acid for self-assembling into thin films exhibiting properties of photonic crystals was studied in relation to their polymer nature, carboxyl group distribution, and to the compositions of the dispersion medium. These particles were capable of self-assembling from their dispersions and forming close-packed three-dimensional ordered arrays on glass slides. The poly(styrene-co-methacrylic acid) particles revealed to be the best choice as the building blocks for photonic crystals formation. To ensure the appropriate surface structure of the particles and narrow particle size distribution in the submicron range the effects of reaction mixture pH, chain-transfer agents, and initiator concentration were investigated subsequently. The Bragg reflection spectra from the (1 1 1) planes of their ordered structures showed a predominant high-reflectance peak corresponding to photonic band gap caused by 3D periodicity of refractive index. The experimental spectra obtained for polarized light at different angles of incidence were well simulated in the theoretical calculations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Online communities bring together individuals with shared interest in joint action or sustained interaction. Power law distributions of user popularity appear ubiquitous in online communities but their formation mechanisms are not well understood. This study tests for the emergence of power law distributions via the mechanisms of preferential attachment, least efforts, direct reciprocity, and indirect reciprocity. Preferential attachment, where new entrants favor connections with already popular participants, is the predominant explanation suggested by prior literature. Yet, the attribution of preferential attachment or any other mechanism as a single unitary reason for the emergence of power law distributions runs contrary to the social nature of online communities and does not account for diversity of participants' motivation. Agent-based modeling is used to test if a single social mechanism alone or multiple mechanisms together can generate power law distributions observed in online communities. Data from 28 online communities is used to calibrate, validate, and analyze the simulation. Simulated communication networks are randomly generated according to parameters for each hypothesis. The fit of the power law distribution in the model testing subset is then compared against the fit for these simulated networks. The major finding is that, in contrast to research in more general network settings, neither preferential attachment nor any other single mechanism alone generates a power law distribution. Instead, a blended model of preferential attachment with other social network formation mechanisms was most consistent with power law distributions seen in online communities. This suggests the need to move away from stylized explanations of network emergence that rely on single theories toward more highly socialized and multitheoretic explanations of community development.

AB A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed and optimized to simultaneously detect 6 avian respiratory pathogens. Six sets of specific oligonucleotide primers for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), avian influenza virus (AIV), infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Mycoplasma gallisepticum (MG), and Mycoplasma synoviae (MS) were used respectively in the test. With the use of agarose gel electrophoresis for detection of the PCR-amplified DNA products, the sensitivity of detection was between 10 pg for IBV, AIV. MG, and ILTV and 100 pg for NDV and MS after 35 cycles of PCR. Similar sensitivity of these primers was achieved with chickens experimentally infected with respiratory pathogens. In experimental infections, the multiplex PCR was able to detect all the infected chickens in each group at 1 and 2 wk postinfection as compared with serologic tests at 2 wk postinfection that confirmed the presence of specific antibodies. The multiplex PCR was also able to detect and differentiate coinfections with two or more pathogens. No specific DNA amplification for respiratory avian pathogens was observed among noninoculated birds kept separately as a negative control group.

AB The interaction of a double stranded small interference RNA (siRNA Nef) with cationic carbosilane dendrimers of generations 1-3 with two different ammonium functions at the periphery ([-NMe2R](+), R=Me, (CH2)(2)OH) has been studied by experimental techniques (zeta potential, electrophoresis, single molecule pulling experiments) and molecular dynamic calculations. These studies state the presence of different forces on dendriplex formation, depending on generation and type of ammonium group. Whilst for higher dendrimers electrostatic forces mainly drive the stability of dendriplexes, first generation compounds can penetrate into siRNA strands due to the establishment of hydrophobic interactions. Finally, in the particular case of first generation dendrimer [G(1)O(3)(NMe2(CH2)(2)OH))(6)](6+); the presence of hydroxyl groups reinforces dendriplex stability by hydrogen bonds formation. However, since these small dendrimers do not cover the RNA, only higher generation derivatives protect RNA from degradation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper describes a rhodopsin-based model of 5-HT1A serotonin receptor. The flexibility of the receptor was considered by using large number of models for ligand dockings. Rearrangements of the heptahelical bundle were introduced, which resulted in the improvement of correlation between computational results and experimental data. The model was validated by automated docking of conformationally restricted arylpiperazines. Specific interactions, responsible for the recognition of arylpiperazine derivatives, were identified. An ionic bond was formed between the protonated amine of ligands and Asp3.32. The aromatic moiety and its substituents specifically interacted with Phe6.52 and Set-5.42, respectively, while the carbonyl groups of imide part of ligands formed hydrogen bonds with Asn7.39 and Tyr7.43. The model reproduced the binding affinity of the test group of ligands (correlation r = 0.8 between pK(i) and docking score). It also gave the enrichment in virtual screening-like experiment (100 compounds), in which 34 high-affinity compounds were found among 50 top-scored ligands.

AB The paper presents a behavior strategy for agents in the Semantic Web which implements the philosophy underlying the decision process of human beings. It employs dynamic reasoning to simulate the scenario analysis in human decision and introduces a notion of favorable factor to measure each possible choice's utility. We dynamically extend description logic ALCO@K in a proportional dynamic logic manner, and then encode agents' statistic knowledge in ALCO@K, describe their abilities to change the world (by performing available Web applications) in terms of their preconditions (epistemic queries to the knowledgebase) and effects (possibly negated ALCO@K assertions involving only primitive concepts). With these knowledge formalized in the formalism, we propose faithful algorithms to compute the most favorable action.

TI A MODEL OF TRADE-FLOWS IN DIFFERENTIATED GOODS
SO ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUILIBRIUM
AB In modelling trade competition for final products within a sector, the assumption of product homogeneity is often quite unrealistic. Even where the demand for different versions of the product can be attributed to relatively independent submarkets, considerable heterogeneity may still exist within each submarket. For each submarket, such as that for a medium-priced family car, it is assumed that more product heterogeneity exists between countries or regions than within them. Heterogeneity between regions is related to the existence of importers, acting as intermediate agents, who make trade-offs between cif import prices of goods and the willingness-to-pay by consumers. Aggregate spatial supply and demand functions based on plausible distributional assumptions are presented and estimated using a unified theoretical basis for each regional grouping of producers, importers and consumers. Conditions for simultaneous equilibrium for these three sets of agents are established, and illustrated via a small numerical example.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to detect pulmonary embolism (PE) in rabbits. Dual energy CT was performed on phantoms composed of different dilution of gadolinium and iodinated contrast agents, CT numbers of the phantoms were measured at different tube voltages. Ten rabbits, which were subdivided into two groups receiving 3 or 5 ml/kg of gadolinium based contrast agent (n = 5 for each group), underwent baseline gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CTPA. The CT numbers of pulmonary arteries were measured. The following day, sponge gelatin was injected into femoral vein of 6 rabbits to create pulmonary emboli. The rabbit were re-imaged 2 h after sponge gelatin injection. Histopathology analysis of the lung lobes was performed. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. Serum creatinine levels were measured on day 1 before gadolinium contrast media injection, and on day 2 prior to PE creation. The phantoms and animal study showed that the CT numbers of gadolinium-based contrast agent and pulmonary arteries at 80 kVp were higher than those at 140 kVp and average weighted 120 kVp. In 6 rabbits, CTPA showed bilateral pulmonary artery emboli, and the reconstructed gadolinium maps showed decreased pulmonary perfusion in the corresponding lung lobes. With the histopathology results as the reference standards, CTPA and Blood flow imaging (BFI) detected PE in 14 and 14 of the 14 pulmonary lobes, 26, 24 lobes without PE, respectively, corresponding to sensitivities of 100 and 100%, and specificities of 100 and 92%, respectively. Serum creatinine level increased by 6.7 and 20.6% in the rabbits receiving 3 and 5 ml/kg gadolinium based contrast medium respectively. Histopathological analysis found no significant tubular necrosis at either gadolinium dose. Gadolinium-enhanced dual energy CT pulmonary angiography is feasible and it can simultaneously provide information on pulmonary artery and lung perfusion in a rabbit model of PE.

AB Statement of problem. Various machinable materials are currently used with computer-aided design/computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies for the chairside fabrication of restorations. However, properties of these new machinable materials, such as fracture load, wear, marginal deterioration, and color stability, should be investigated in vitro under replicated clinical conditions prior to time-consuming clinical studies.
   Purpose. This study investigated the effect of cyclic loading fatigue and different luting agents under wet conditions on the fracture load of CAD/CAM machined composite resin and all-ceramic crowns.
   Materials and methods. Ninety-six intact human maxillary premolars were prepared for composite resin and all-ceramic crowns with the following preparation criteria: 6-degree axial taper, 1.5-mm shoulder finish line placed 0.5 mm occlusal to the cemento-enamel junction, 1.5-mm axial reduction, 2-mm occlusal reduction, and 5-mm occluso-gingival height. Sixteen unprepared premolars served as controls. Forty-eight all-ceramic crowns (Vita Mark 11) and 48 millable composite resin crowns (MZ100 Block) were fabricated using a CAD/CAM system (Cerec 3). Three luting agcnts-RelyX ARC (R-X), GC Fuji CEM (FC), and zinc phosphate cement (ZP)-were used for cementation (n=16). After 1-week storage in water, half of the specimens (n=8) in each subgroup were cyclically loaded and thermal cycled under wet conditions for 600,000 masticatory cycles and 3500 thermal cycles (58 degrees C/4 degrees C; dwell time, 60 seconds) in a masticatory simulator; the other half (n=8) were fractured without cyclic loading. All specimens were loaded in a universal testing machine with a compressive load (N) applied along the long axis of the specimen at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min until fracture. Fracture loads (N) were recorded for each specimen. Three-way analysis of variance was used to detect the effects of the experimental factors (crown material, luting agent, and loading conditions) on the fracture load. The comparison with the unprepared natural teeth as controls was done by means of t tests (alpha=.05).
   Results. Analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant influence of the luting agent and the cyclic loading (P<.001), whereas the crown material had no significant influence. Cyclic loading fatigue significantly decreased the mean fracture load of test groups independent of the 3 luting agents used: MZ100/ZP, 827.1 to 552.5 N; MZ100/FC, 914.7 to 706.2 N; MZ100/RX, 955.9 to 724.4 N; Vita/ZP, 772.3 to 571.5 N. Vita/FC, 923.6 to 721.1 N; and Vita/RX, 929.1 to 752.7 N. However, there was no significant difference in the mean fracture load of control specimens before and after cyclic loading (1140.1 N and 1066.2 N, respectively). Adhesive luting agents RelyX ARC and GC Fuji CEM increased fracture load significantly compared to zinc phosphate cement.
   Conclusions. Cyclic loading fatigue significantly reduced the fracture loads of composite resin and all-ceramic crowns, whereas adhesive cementation significantly increased the fracture loads.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel opinion dynamics model that is based on bounded confidence and termed interval opinion dynamics with the dynamic bounded confidence. In this opinion dynamics model, the agents express their opinions in numerical intervals, and the bounded confidences vary in a specified interval as time varies (i.e., dynamic bounded confidence). Based on several theoretical analyses of the proposed opinion dynamics, we propose conditions that are sufficient to form a consensus or fragmentations among the agents. Moreover, we also design several simulation experiments to investigate the effects of the dynamic bounded confidence and interval widths on the proposed opinion dynamics and to illustrate the differences between the proposed model and the original opinion dynamics with bounded confidence.

AB In order to solve the problem of reservoir heterogeneity in the process of oil displacement, Daqing oilfield has proposed a partial pressure injection technology (using partial pressure tools). The partial pressure tool can improve the overall oil displacement effect by reducing the pressure of the displacement agent and adjusting the injection amount of the displacement agent in the high-permeability oil layer. In order to study the effect of the partial pressure tool on the polymer solution, the flow characteristics of the polymer solution in the partial pressure tool were studied by finite element analysis, and the results of the numerical simulation were compared and verified by laboratory experiments. Then, the optimal structural parameters of the partial pressure tool were selected by orthogonal experiments. Finally, field tests were carried out to verify the effectiveness of the partial pressure tool. The results show that when the flow rate is 10 m(3)/d, the pressure drop of the polymer solution reaches 6.08 x 10(5) Pa and the viscosity loss rate reaches 6.69%, while the physical parameters of the solution change periodically under the action of the partial pressure tool. At a low flow rate, the results of the laboratory experiment and numerical simulation fit well, and the optimal structural parameters of the partial pressure tool are selected. Field tests show that the oil recovery is increased by 2.54% after using partial pressure tools. The research results are of great significance to the study of resolving interlayer conflicts and enhancing oil recovery.

AB We consider distributed detection problems over adaptive networks, where dispersed agents learn continually from streaming data by means of local interactions. The requirement of adaptation allows the network of detectors to track drifts in the underlying hypothesis. The requirement of cooperation allows each agent to deliver a performance superior to what would be obtained if it were acting individually. The simultaneous requirements of adaptation and cooperation are achieved by employing diffusion algorithms with constant step-size mu. By conducting a refined asymptotic analysis based on the mathematical framework of exact asymptotics, we arrive at a revealing understanding of the universal behavior of distributed detection over adaptive networks: as functions of 1/mu, the error (log-) probability curves corresponding to different agents stay nearly-parallel to each other (as already discovered in [1] and [2]), however, these curves are ordered following a criterion reflecting the degree of connectivity of each agent. Depending on the combination weights, the more connected an agent is, the lower its error probability curve will be. The analysis provides explicit analytical formulas for the detection error probabilities and these expressions are also verified by means of extensive simulations. We further enlarge the reference setting from the case of doubly-stochastic combination matrices considered in [1] and [2] to the more general and demanding setting of right-stochastic combination matrices; this extension poses new and interesting questions in terms of the interplay between the network topology, the combination weights, and the inference performance. The potential of the proposed methods is illustrated by application of the results to canonical detection problems, to typical network topologies, for both doubly-stochastic and right-stochastic combination matrices. Interesting and somehow unexpected behaviors emerge, and the lesson learned is that connectivity matters.

AB Pultrusion is a continuous process for manufacturing polymer composite with uniform cross-sectional profiles. In this process the pulling speed and die temperature are the main process variables that can be used to improve the chemical and mechanical properties of the pultruded polymer composite. A critical processing step in reactive polymer composites that involves thermoset resins is the curing reaction that starts from monomers/oligomers, which forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network. While empirical kinetic models for the prediction of the degree of cure are easy to handle, they are limited in terms of providing a complete understanding of the system, due to the absence of knowledge regarding the full kinetic of the functional groups. In this regard, the use of phenomenological models, based on material balances of functional groups involved in the curing reaction, is a noteworthy strategy. In this work two kinetic models were tested to simulate the pultrusion process: (i) empirical model and (ii) phenomenological model. Diffusional limitations on the cure kinetics were coupled into both models. The kinetic parameters of both models were estimated from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments of an epoxy resin derived from an unmodified liquid diglycidyl ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA resin) in a mixture with an Anhydride Curing Agent and an Accelerator like DMP-30 (2,4,6-tris(dimethylaminomethyl) phenol). The results revealed that the kinetic models could be reasonably adjusted to the experimental curing behavior, allowing to obtain accurate values for different curing rates. The kinetic models were then implemented into the pultrusion model, by the use of the FE software, ANSYS-17.2. According to the results of ultruded thermal and curing profiles of pultruded parts, it is shown that the kinetic models are suitable for predicting the thermal and curing behavior of the pultrusion process.

AB Along with the phase-out of CF3Br (Halon 1301), several agents have been proposed as halon replacements for use in suppressing fires in aircraft cargo bays. However, these potential drop-in replacements were found to have a promotion effect on the explosion of an aerosol can, which tested by the US Federal Aviation Administration. Motivated by this problem, we measured the laminar burning velocity of premixed methane/air flames with added one of these agents, C6F12O (Novec 1230), in the counterflow configuration, for fuel/air equivalence ratios of 0.63, 0.68, 0.74, and 0.82. C6F12O was added at levels up to 3.5% by volume fraction to each mixture. Numerical simulations were performed using the detailed kinetic mechanism. The predicted results were in good agreement with the experimental measurements. The burning velocity for the very lean flames (phi=0.63) was increased with C6F12O added at low concentrations due to the additional heat release from C6F12O reaction, whereas for higher equivalence ratios (phi=0.68-0.82), it always decreased with all added agent concentrations. The extinction stretch rates have also been measured using the counterflow technique to gain further insight into the promotion/inhibition behavior of C6F12O in ultra-lean (phi<0.63) flames. The results showed that C6F12O has larger promotion effect for the ultra-lean conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that lean flames are more sensitive to the fluorinated reactions compared to the rich. In addition, direct images of hydrocarbon flame inhibition by fluorinated ketone were provided for the first time to help interpret the experiments.

AB Many service systems use case managers, servers who are assigned multiple customers and have frequent, repeated interactions with each customer until the customer's service is completed. Examples may be found in healthcare (emergency department physicians), contact centers (agents handling multiple online chats simultaneously) and social welfare agencies (social workers with multiple clients). We propose a stochastic model of a baseline case-manager system, formulate models that provide performance bounds and stability conditions for the baseline system, and develop two approximations, one of which is based on a two-time-scale approach. Numerical experiments and analysis of the approximations show that increasing case throughput by increasing the probability of case completion can lead to much greater waiting-time reductions than increasing service speed. Many systems place an upper limit on the number of customers simultaneously handled by each case manager. We examine the impact of these caseload limits on waiting time and describe effective, heuristic methods for setting these limits.

AB Objective: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of human plasma, compared to physiologic saline, on microtensile bond strengths of 5 self-conditioning dentin adhesives when used as a dentin perfusion medium. Method and Materials: One hundred and fifty extracted human third molars were prepared in a special manner allowing the simulation of intrapulpal pressure and dentin perfusion. The specimens were randomly divided into 10 experimental groups. Five groups were perfused with physiologic saline, while the others were perfused with diluted human plasma, each under constant hydrostatic pressure of 30 cm H2O. One saline group and 1 human plasma group was then assigned to each of the following dentin adhesives: Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray), Clearfil Protect Bond (Kuraray), Xeno 3 (Dentsply), Futurabond NR (Voco), and iBond (Heraeus Kulzer). The microtensile bond strength for each group was evaluated using a Zwick universal testing machine 10 minutes after light curing. Results: Pairwise comparison showed a significant increase of bond strength in all human plasma-perfused subgroups (P < .05, Tukey's test). The influence of the different dentin adhesives was significant (P < .001, analysis of variance). The highest significant values were observed for Futurabond NR and iBond with human plasma (P < .05, closed test procedure). Conclusion: The use of human plasma might be a suitable alternative to imitate perfused dentin conditions in testing devices and might eliminate the discrepancy between different in vitro investigations focusing on bond strength of dentin adhesives.

AB Understanding how seabirds and other central place foragers locate food resources represents a key step in predicting responses to changes in resource abundance and distribution. Where prey distributions are unpredictable and ephemeral, seabirds may gain up-to-date information by monitoring the direction of birds returning to the colony or by monitoring the foraging behavior of other birds through local enhancement. However, search strategies based on social information may require high population densities, raising concerns about the potential loss of information in declining populations. Our objectives were to explore the mechanisms that underpin effective search strategies based on social information under a range of population densities and different foraging conditions. Testing relevant hypotheses through field observation is challenging because of limitations in the ability to manipulate population densities and foraging conditions. We therefore developed a spatially explicit individual-based foraging model, informed by data on the movement and foraging patterns of seabirds foraging on pelagic prey, and used model simulations to investigate the mechanisms underpinning search strategies. Orientation of outbound headings in line with returning birds enables departing birds to avoid areas without prey even at relatively low population densities. The mechanisms underpinning local enhancement are more effective as population densities increase and may be facilitated by other mechanisms that concentrate individuals in profitable areas. For seabirds and other central place foragers foraging on unpredictable and ephemeral food resources, information is especially valuable when resources are spatially concentrated and may play an important role in mitigating poor foraging conditions.

AB The promotion of space sharing in order to raise the quality of community living and safety of street surroundings is increasingly accepted feature of modern urban design. In this context, the development of a shared space simulation tool is essential in helping determine whether particular shared space schemes are suitable alternatives to traditional street layouts. A simulation tool that enables urban designers to visualise pedestrians and cars trajectories, extract flow and density relation in a new shared space design, achieve solutions for optimal design features before implementation, and help getting the design closer to the system optimal. This paper presents a three-layered microscopic mathematical model which is capable of representing the behaviour of pedestrians and vehicles in shared space layouts and it is implemented in a traffic simulation tool. The top layer calculates route maps based on static obstacles in the environment. It plans the shortest path towards agents' respective destinations by generating one or more intermediate targets. In the second layer, the Social Force Model (SFM) is modified and extended for mixed traffic to produce feasible trajectories. Since car movements are not as flexible as pedestrian movements, velocity angle constraints are included for cars. The conflicts described in the third layer are resolved by rule-based constraints for shared space users. An optimisation algorithm is applied to determine the interaction parameters of the force-based model for shared space users using empirical data. This new three-layer microscopic model can be used to simulate shared space environments and assess, for example, new street designs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper explores the impact that agent bargaining (when one player represents another party in a bargaining situation for some form of compensation) has on the outcome of negotiations in a three-player setting. We conduct a laboratory experiment simulating a simple unstructured example of agent bargaining with various percentage-based compensation plans. We test hypotheses formulated using a Nash bargaining framework. We also propose novel behavioral explanations for the observed behavior. Our results suggest that compensation percentage has a non-monotonic effect on an agent's bargaining effectiveness. We find that Nash bargaining does a poor job of explaining our observations, and that using a new solution concept we call the "minimization of differences" solution provides a promising alternative.

AB Purpose: To assess the gadolinium-based macromolecular intravascular contrast agent P792 for magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) at magnetic field strengths of 3.0 T, in comparison to 1.5 T, in rabbits.
   Materials and Methods: Eleven female New Zealand rabbits of the same age served as the animal model. Dose relationship testing was performed with 2 doses (13 and 25 [mu mol/kg; n = 4 per group) of P792 as compared with a single dose (100 mu mol/kg; n = 3) of gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA). All animals underwent contrast-enhanced MRA of the abdominal aorta and its branches on 2 occasions separated by 72 hours. The particular doses were administered in random order. Contrast-enhanced MRA was performed on 3.0 and 1.5 T whole-body MR systems, using a fast 3D spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence. Data acquisition was performed before and up to 10 minutes after administration of intravenous contrast material. Image quality was judged on a 4-point-Likert scale. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise measurements were performed; statistical differences (P < 0.05) between the groups were determined.
   Results: P792 and Gd-DOTA yielded high-quality MR angiograms in rabbits in all cases. Although image quality within the first 3 minutes after contrast material administration was equal for both agents, P792 at a dose of 25 mu mol/kg was considered superior to Gd-DOTA at the later time points. Signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise values of the higher dose of P792 were statistically significantly higher than those of Gd-DOTA in the post-bolus phase.
   Conclusions: P792 seems to be well suited for high-quality early phase and equilibrium phase MRA in rabbits at a field strength of 3.0 T, on the basis of this initial evaluation in an animal model.

AB A key focus of recent policy efforts to curb tobacco product usage has been the role of place-specifically the density of retail and advertising and the resulting spatial pattern of access and exposure for consumers. Policies can alter the environment by reducing density or shifting distribution of tobacco retail and thus limiting access and exposure. Since little empirical evidence exists for the potential impact of these policies across potentially heterogeneous places, we develop and apply an original spatial computational model to simulate place-based retail tobacco control policies. The model is well-grounded in theory and available empirical evidence. We apply the model in four representative settings to demonstrate the utility of this approach as a policy laboratory, to develop general insights on the relationship between retailer density, retail interventions, and tobacco costs incurred by consumers, and to provide a framework to guide future modeling and empirical studies. Our results suggest that the potential impact on costs of reducing tobacco retailer density are highly dependent on context. Projected impacts are also influenced by assumptions made about agent (smoker) purchasing decision-making processes. In the absence of evidence in this area, we tested and compared three alternative decision rules; these interact with environmental properties to produce different results. Agent properties, namely income and cigarettes per day, also shape purchasing patterns before and after policy interventions. We conclude that agentbased modeling in general, and Tobacco Town specifically, hold much potential as a platform for testing and comparing the impact of various retail-based tobacco policies across different communities. Initial modeling efforts uncover important gaps in both data and theory and can provide guidance for new empirical studies in tobacco control.

AB BACKGROUND: Earlier work established an evidence practice gap during provision of nonprescription salbutamol (albuterol). Pharmacist interns are hypothesized to be in a position to improve professional practice in the community pharmacy setting.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential of intern pharmacists to improve the professional practice of community pharmacy staff in the provision of nonprescription salbutamol.
   METHODS: Intern pharmacists (n = 157) delivered an asthma intervention in 136 pharmacies consisting of an educational activity to pharmacy staff and a health promotion campaign to consumers. Post-intervention, simulated patients presented to 100 intervention and 100 control community pharmacies with a request for salbutamol. The appropriate outcome was medical referral for poor asthma control and correction of poor inhaler technique. Incidence and quantity of patient assessment and counseling provided during the visit were also assessed. Logistic regression was used to determine the predictors of medical referral.
   RESULTS: A doubling in the rate of medical referral was seen in the intervention group (19% vs 40%; p = 0.001). Assessment of reliever use frequency was the main predictor of medical referral (OR = 22.7; 95% CI 9.06 to 56.9). Correction of poor inhaler technique did not improve; however, a reduction in salbutamol supplied without patient assessment (23% vs 8%; p = 0.009) or counseling (75% vs 48%; p < 0.001) was noted.
   CONCLUSIONS: A doubling in the rate of medical referral showed a clear improvement in professional practice during the provision of nonprescription salbutamol. The improved patient outcome in the intervention group was due to increased assessment of reliever use frequency. Identification of poor inhaler technique remained near zero in both groups, which suggests that intern pharmacists were able to improve the current practice of community pharmacies yet were unable to establish a new practice behavior. This study provides evidence that intern pharmacists can act as change agents to improve pharmacy practice.

AB This article addresses the stock market as a complex system. The complexity of the stock market arises from the structure of the environment, agent heterogeneity, interactions among agents, and interactions with market regulators. We develop the idea of a meta-model, which is a model of models represented in an agent-based model that allows us to investigate this type of market complexity. The novelty of this article is the incorporation of various complexities captured by network theoretical models or induced by investment behavior. The model considers agents heterogeneous in terms of their strategies and investment behavior. Four investment strategies are included in the model: zero-intelligence, fundamental strategy, momentum (trend followers), and adaptive trading strategy using the artificial neural network algorithm. In terms of behavior, the agents can be risk averse or loss occupied with overconfidence or conservative biases. The agents may interact with each other by sharing market sentiments through a structured scale-free network. The market regulator controls the market through various control tools such as the risk-free rate and taxation. Parameters are calibrated to the S&P500. The calibration is implemented using a scatter search heuristic approach. The model is validated using various stylized facts of stock return patterns such as excess kurtosis, auto-correlation, and ARCH effect phenomena. Analysis at the macro and micro level of the market was performed by measuring the sensitivity of volatility and market capital and investigating the wealth distributions of the agents. We found that volatility is more sensitive to the model parameters than to market capital, and thus, the level of volatility does not affect market capital. In addition, the findings suggest that the efficient market hypothesis holds at the macro level but not at the micro level. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Complexity 21: 530-554, 2016

AB Multilevel theory and research have advanced organizational science but are limited because the research focus is incomplete. Most quantitative research examines top-down, contextual, cross-level relationships. Emergent phenomena that manifest from the bottom up from the psychological characteristics, processes, and interactions among individualsalthough examined qualitativelyhave been largely neglected in quantitative research. Emergence is theoretically assumed, examined indirectly, and treated as an inference regarding the construct validity of higher level measures. As a result, quantitative researchers are investigating only one fundamental process of multilevel theory and organizational systems. This article advances more direct, dynamic, and temporally sensitive quantitative research methods designed to unpack emergence as a process. We argue that direct quantitative approaches, largely represented by computational modeling or agent-based simulation, have much to offer with respect to illuminating the mechanisms of emergence as a dynamic process. We illustrate how indirect and direct approaches can be complementary and, appropriately integrated, have the potential to substantially advance theory and research. We conclude with a set of recommendations for advancing multilevel research on emergent phenomena in teams and organizations.

AB Agent-based modelling is a useful approach for capturing heterogeneity in disease transmission. In this study, a synthetic population was developed for American Samoa using an iterative approach based on population census, questionnaire survey and land use data. The population will be used as the basis for a new agent-based model, intended specifically to fill the knowledge gaps about lymphatic filariasis transmission and elimination, but also to be readily adaptable to model other infectious diseases. The synthetic population was characterized by the statistically realistic population and household structure, and high-resolution geographic locations of households. The population was simulated over 40 years from 2010 to 2050. The simulated population was compared to estimates and projections of the U.S. Census Bureau. The results showed the total population would continuously decrease due to the observed large number of emigrants. Population ageing was observed, which was consistent with the latest two population censuses and the Bureau's projections. The sex ratios by age groups were analysed and indicated an increase in the proportion of males in age groups 0-14 and 15-64. The household size followed a Gaussian distribution with an average size of around 5.0 throughout the simulation, slightly less than the initial average size 5.6.

AB We present a stochastic simulation model of a prototype financial market. Our market is populated by both noise traders and fundamentalist speculators. The dynamics covers switches in the prevailing mood among noise traders (optimistic or pessimistic) as well as switches of agents between the noise trader and fundamentalist group in response to observed differences in profits. The particular behavioral variant adopted by an agent also determines his decision to enter on the long or short side of the market. Short-run imbalances between demand and supply lead to price adjustments by a market maker or auctioneer in the usual Walrasian manner. Our interest in this paper is in exploring the behavior of the model when testing for the presence of chaos or non-linearity in the simulated data. As it turns out, attempts to determine the fractal dimension of the underlying process give unsatisfactory results in that we experience a lack of convergence of the estimate. Explicit tests for non-linearity and dependence (the BDS and Kaplan tests) also give very unstable results in that both acceptance and strong rejection of IIDness can be found in different realizations of our model. All in all, this behavior is very similar to experience collected with empirical data and our results may point towards an explanation of why robustness of inference in this area is low. However, when testing for dependence in second moments and estimating GARCH models, the results appear much more robust and the chosen GARCH specification closely resembles the typical outcome of empirical studies.

AB With the gradual expansion of high buildings and underground spaces, deep foundation pits have been widely used in these engineering projects, but if they are not well-designed, safety problems occur. Proper deep foundation pit design requires proper exit distribution. However, calculating an adequate number of exit distributions for evaluation is difficult due to the numerous influential factors existing in the deep foundation pit environment. To this end, this paper presents a prototype of a decision-making system that uses agent-based modeling to simulate deep foundation pit evacuation in the presence of collapse disaster. By modeling the collapse occurrence process and agent escape process, an agent-based evacuation model is built, and a modified simulation-based particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem of exit distribution. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the system, and the results show that the system provides a feasible framework for deep foundation pit evacuation.

AB We present numerical simulations and experimental results for susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) at 7 T. Magnitude, phase, and SWI contrast were simulated for different voxel geometries and imaging parameters, resulting in an echo time of 14 msec for optimum contrast between veins and surrounding tissue. Slice thickness of twice the in-plane voxel size or more resulted in optimum vessel visibility. Phantom and in vivo data are in very good agreement with the simulations and the delineation of vessels at 7 T was superior compared to lower field strengths. The phase of the complex data reveals anatomical details that are complementary to the corresponding magnitude images. Susceptibility weighted imaging at very high field strengths is a promising technique because of its high sensitivity to tissue susceptibility, its low specific absorption rate, and the phase's negligible sensitivity to B, inhomogeneities.

AB In order to understand heterogeneous behavior amongst agents, empirical data from Learning-to-Forecast (LtF) experiments can be used to construct learning models. This paper follows up on Assenza et al. (2013) by using a Genetic Algorithms (GA) model to replicate the results from their LtF experiment. In this GA model, individuals optimize an adaptive, a trend following and an anchor coefficient in a population of general prediction heuristics. We replicate experimental treatments in a New-Keynesian environment with increasing complexity and use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well the model explains the experimental data. We find that the evolutionary learning model is able to replicate the three different types of behavior, i.e. convergence to steady state, stable oscillations and dampened oscillations in the treatments using one GA model. Heterogeneous behavior can thus be explained by an adaptive, anchor and trend extrapolating component and the GA model can be used to explain heterogeneous behavior in LtF experiments with different types of complexity.

AB The excess accumulation of charges in the fluidized bed has a severe impact on hydrodynamics. Due to lack of effective experimental methods, electrostatic effects on hydrodynamics have mostly been studied using numerical simulation. By injecting a trace of liquid antistatic agents into a fluidized bed, charges were controlled and electrostatic influences on particle motions were investigated. The average particle-wall impact angles are acquired by developing multiscale wavelet decomposition of acoustic emission signals. The impact angles are significantly influenced by both charge levels and gas velocities. If the electric force is reduced and/or fluid drag is increased, friction dominates the particle-wall interactions. Under a larger gas velocity where fluid drag dominates, charges elimination causes no significant variation in particle impact angles, but particle velocities increase as well as at lower gas velocities. In addition, existence of electrostatic charges influences the ranges of bubble growing zone and jet impacting zone. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

AB Genome packaging in prokaryotic cells is believed to be carried out by a combination of DNA-binding proteins, crowding effects, and DNA supercoiling. Much is known about DNA-protein interaction as well as the condensation of DNA due to excluded volume effects however, and to our knowledge, few studies have targeted the potential synergistic role of DNA-binding proteins and crowding agents on DNA condensation.
   This work aims at assessing the effect of crowding, induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), on DNA-H-NS binding, with H-NS a histone-like nucleoid structuring protein that is believed to play a crucial role in gene regulation. A non-monotonic behavior was found upon the addition of PEG to DNA-H-NS complexes; 100 mg mL(-1) of PEG leads to the expansion of the DNA, while 200 mg mL(-1) of PEG to a stronger DNA condensation, when compared to complexes in the absence of PEG. Such behavior was found at intermediate concentrations of H-NS. Spermine (Spm) was additionally studied, to assess the importance of the specificity of the DNA-binding agent. The synergistic effect of Spm and PEG on DNA condensation was very clear and especially large for the higher studied concentration of PEG. The effect of ionic strength was additionally looked upon. Two regimes were found; at low Spm concentrations, DNA psi-condensation dominates and systems with higher ionic strength show a larger DNA condensation. At large Spm concentrations, on the other hand, a larger ionic strength leads to a more moderate DNA condensation. Synergism effects were found to be larger at low DNA-Spm concentrations and high ionic strengths.
   Results from Monte Carlo simulations, using a very simple model to mimic the experimental studies, also indicate a synergistic effect of the DNA-binding and crowding agents on DNA condensation for intermediate concentrations of the DNA-binding agents. Since H-NS proteins are known to self-assemble in the presence of DNA, an attractive potential was also used in the protein model. It was found that such self-association is needed to induce DNA condensation and that strong synergism occurred solely for intermediate attractive potentials. It is suggested that crowding agents act to reduce the critical association concentration of the proteins. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,

AB Environmental and biotic factors regulate species abundance and the composition of ecological communities. However, it is difficult to demonstrate principles of community assembly in nature due to observational limitations and historical effects. Numerical simulation can be used to evaluate whether hypothesized mechanisms produce a pattern seen in natural communities. Most models of many-species communities assume similar behavior by all individuals in a population. Here we describe an agent-based model of many-species communities in which interactions among individual agents are subjected to Darwinian selection (Holland's Echo model). To evaluate the response of the model to evolutionary mechanisms, we present a simple version of the model, and describe an experiment which evaluated community assembly patterns with and without selection for genome-mediated interactions, at various levels of invasion. Increased invasion rates decreased population size, but increased species richness and evenness. Interactions acted upon by natural selection resulted in greater population sizes and lower species richness and evenness than random interactions. Genotype abundances deviated from the expectation of equal abundances, and were affected by both the invasion rate and nature of inter-agent interactions. Species abundance patterns indicate that communities formed by random and selective interactions follow different assembly rules, and communities formed under high invasion rates showed no coherent community-level pattern of genotype abundances. Thus, both invasion rate and type of interspecific interaction regulate the assembly of species into communities. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Imagine an agent that performs tasks according to different strategies. The goal of Behavioral Recognition (BR) is to identify which of the available strategies is the one being used by the agent, by simply observing the agent's actions and the environmental conditions during a certain period of time. The goal of Behavioral Cloning (BC) is more ambitious. In this last case, the learner must be able to build a model of the behavior of the agent. In both settings, the only assumption is that the learner has access to a training set that contains instances of observed behavioral traces for each available strategy. This paper studies a machine learning approach based on Probabilistic Finite Automata (PFAs), capable of achieving both the recognition and cloning tasks. We evaluate the performance of PFAs in the context of a simulated learning environment (in this case, a virtual Roomba vacuum cleaner robot), and compare it with a collection of other machine learning approaches.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICAL PHYSICS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; EVOLUTION
AB We study the behavior of a generalized consensus dynamics on a temporal network of interactions, the activitydriven network with attractiveness. In this temporal network model, agents are endowed with an intrinsic activity a, ruling the rate at which they generate connections, and an intrinsic attractiveness b, modulating the rate at which they receive connections. The consensus dynamics considered is a mixed voter and Moran dynamics. Each agent, either in state 0 or 1, modifies his or her state when connecting with a peer. Thus, an active agent copies his or her state from the peer (with probability p) or imposes his or her state to him or her (with the complementary probability 1 -p). Applying a heterogeneous mean-field approach, we derive a differential equation for the average density of voters with activity a and attractiveness b in state 1, which we use to evaluate the average time to reach consensus and the exit probability, defined as the probability that a single agent with activity a and attractiveness b eventually imposes his or her state to a pool of initially unanimous population in the opposite state. We study a number of particular cases, finding an excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the model. Interestingly, we observe a symmetry between voter and Moran dynamics in pure activity-driven networks and their static integrated counterparts that exemplifies the strong differences that a time-varying network can impose on dynamical processes.

TI Discerning In-Situ Performance of an Enhanced-Oil-Recovery Agent in the
   Midst of Geological Uncertainty: II. Fluvial-Deposit Reservoir
SO SPE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB An enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) pilot test has multiple goals, among them to be profitable (if possible), demonstrate oil recovery, verify the properties of the EOR agent in situ, and provide the information needed for scaleup to an economical process. Given the complexity of EOR processes and the inherent uncertainty in the reservoir description, it is a challenge to discern the properties of the EOR agent in situ in the midst of geological uncertainty. We propose a numerical case study to illustrate this challenge: a polymer EOR process designed for a 3D fluvial-deposit water/oil reservoir. The polymer is designed to have a viscosity of 20 cp in situ. We start with 100 realizations of the 3D reservoir to reflect the range of possible geological structures honoring the statistics of the initial geological uncertainties. For a population of reservoirs representing reduced geological uncertainty after 5 years of waterflooding, we select three groups of 10 realizations out of the initial 100, with similar water-breakthrough dates at the four production wells. We then simulate 5 years of polymer injection. We allow that the polymer process might fail in situ and viscosity could be 30% of that intended. We test whether the signals of this difference at injection and production wells would be statistically significant in the midst of geological uncertainty. Specifically, we compare the deviation caused by loss of polymer viscosity with the scatter caused by the geological uncertainty using a 95% confidence interval. Among the signals considered, polymer-breakthrough time, minimum oil cut, and rate of rise in injection pressure with polymer injection provide the most-reliable indications of whether a polymer viscosity was maintained in situ.

AB Branched or hyperbranched polymers with a high degree of branching (DB) and a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) are highly desirable for biomedical applications because of the significant effect of molecular weight (MW), DB, and PDI on their cytotoxicity and delivery efficiency. Although either the self-condensed vinyl polymerization (SCVP) or copolymerization with a small molecular cross-linker has been repeatedly highlighted to be an efficient strategy with respect to (hyper)branched polymers, the preparation of a (hyper)branched polymer with simultaneously a high DB and a narrow PDI has been a significant challenge because an increased DB was usually accompanied by a broad PDI. For this purpose, a reduction-sensitive branched copolymer synthesized via a reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of a reducible monomer-initiator double-head agent, 24(24(2-bromo-2-methylpropanoyl)oxy)ethyl)disulfanyl)ethyl methacrylate (BSSMA), and a divinyl cross-linker, ethane-1,2-diyl diacrylate (DDA), was further reacted with a large amount of AIBN with respect to a simultaneous end-capping of RAFT thiocarbonylthio groups and a secondary in situ branching reaction of the vinyl residues, which resulted in a secondary in situ branched copolymer (SBP), SBP-poly(BSSMA-st-DDA) (SBP-P(BSSMA-st-DDA)), with an increased DB and insignificantly broadened PDI compared to the parent branched copolymer (BP), BP-poly(BSSMA-st-DDA) (BP-P(BSSMA-st-DDA)). To provide sufficient colloidal stability, SBP-P(BSSMA-st-DDA) was further used as a multi-macroinitiator to produce an amphiphilic branched block statistical copolymer, poly(BSSMA-st-DDA)-b-poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) (SBP-P(BSSMA-st-DDA)-b-POEGMA), by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of OEGMA. The resultant SBP-P(BSSMA-st-DDA)-b-POEGMA can form unimolecular core-shell micelles with enhanced stability due to the branched structure. The doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded micelles showed an intracellular reduction-promoted drug release, an efficient cellular uptake, and an inhibition of proliferation of HeLa cells. This study therefore developed a facile yet robust strategy to prepare stimuli-responsive branched polymers with a high DB and a narrow PDI for an efficient anticancer drug delivery.

AB Discrete-event simulation (DES) has been widely used in systems analysis. However, authors defend the idea that this kind of simulation does not properly represent the human element or the factors affecting its productivity. In Agent-Based Simulation (ABS), agents are intelligent, autonomous and proactive beings, which are features closely related to human behaviour. Therefore, ABS and DES were combined into one model to represent the human element as agents, who were subjected to one of the factors that affect their performance, the circadian rhythm. After statistical validation it was determined that the computer models integrating ABS and DES represent the productive systems under analysis with high level of confidence. A comparison between the model built and a DES model where operators are represented by resources was also performed. It was verified that the ABS/DES represents better the actual systems behaviour than the DES, showing a lower average of relative error.

AB Human behavior simulation in emergency evacuation helps engineers identify design shortcomings and improve building performance. Conference halls, as a public assembly, are at a greater risk than ordinary buildings due to the number of participants, space density, and gender segregation. In this study, a BIM software (Revit) with the human behavior simulation engine (AnyLogic code) upon the agent-based modeling (ABM) approach was applied to simulate emergency evacuation from NIGC conference hall with 177 delegates. In order to consider gender segregation and architectural design on egress flow, three groups of people with special characteristics and behavioral rules were considered in five different egress scenario including different positions and dimensions of exit doors. Each simulated scenario was repeated 100 times to minimize error. Then, the model was verified through a real experimental test with the cooperation of 22 volunteers. Although the average evacuation time for all scenarios did not differ beyond 13%, the results showed that placing two symmetrical exit doors on both sides of the conference hall offers the most efficient and fastest egress pattern. Also, the critical evacuation time was 0.4-0.6 min., while 80% of people left the conference hall within 1.2-1.4 min. after alarm (excluding scenario 4). The results also indicated the impact of the location of sitting of low-speed people on the evacuation time and egress pattern. All these results help architectures and building interior designers to properly design and locate exit doors, corridors, number and distance between seats and rows in a conference hall.

AB Dung-inhabiting pest flies are one of the main problems associated with the accumulation of cattle dung. This work analyzes the diversity and dynamics of a coprophilous community from northern Buenos Aires, Argentina, in a search for potential biocontrol agents. Thirty-six dung pads of 3 age categories and 4 microhabitats were collected on each sampling date and examined for their arthropod fauna. Some of the species with undefined feeding behavior were subjected to feeding trials in the laboratory. We found 34 coprophagous species, 47 predators, and 13 parasitoids. The combination of the results of the feeding trials, co-occurrence and abundance data of the prey and predator populations, and direct field observations were used to put together a trophic web and hypothesis on the dynamics of the community. Dung scarabs cause significant reductions in immature dung fly survival by burying and desiccating large amounts of dung. The Philonthini (Coleoptera: Staphylinidae) are the most abundant and rich predator group, although they are slow to respond to variations in fly populations. However, predatory flies show the same abundance curves as their prey flies. Predatory beetles and flies, dung scarabs, and pupal parasitoids cause additive mortality to the fly population, whereas larval parasitoids cause some compensatory mortality. Four species of staphylinids, 1 predatory muscid, and a coprophagous scarab could have potential as biocontrol agents. The perspectives of success and convenience of a horn fly biocontrol scheme in southern South America are discussed.

AB The selfish herd hypothesis provides an explanation for group aggregation via the selfish avoidance of predators. Conceptually, and as was first proposed, this movement should aim to minimise the danger domain of each individual. Whilst many reasonable proxies have been proposed, none have directly sought to reduce the danger domain. In this work we present a two dimensional stochastic model that actively optimises these domains. The individuals' dynamics are determined by sampling the space surrounding them and moving to achieve the largest possible domain reduction. Two variants of this idea are investigated with sampling occurring either locally or globally. We simulate our models and two of the previously proposed benchmark selfish herd models: k-nearest neighbours (kNN); and local crowded horizon (LCH). The resulting positions are analysed to determine the benefit to the individual and the group's ability to form a compact group. To do this, the group level metric of packing fraction and individual level metric of domain size are observed over time for a range of noise levels. With these measures we show a clear stratification of the four models when noise is not included. kNN never resulted in centrally compacted herd, while the local active selfish model and LCH did so with varying levels of success. The most centralised groups were achieved with our global active selfish herd model. The inclusion of noise improved aggregation in all models. This was particularly so with the local active selfish model with a change to ordering of performance so that it marginally outperformed LCH in aggregation. By more closely following Hamilton's original conception and aligning the individual's goal of a reduced danger domain with the movement it makes increased cohesion is observed, thus confirming his hypothesis, however, these findings are dependent on noise. Moreover, many features originally conjectured by Hamilton are also observed in our simulations. Crown Copyright (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. Most of the devices used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of resin-based composites in vitro use a dentin barrier test. However, it is difficult to obtain the number of freshly extracted teeth, all on the same day, that is necessary for powerful statistical analysis. Tooth cryopreservation provides a way to build up a supply of teeth. This in vitro study compared cryopreserved teeth and freshly extracted teeth in an evaluation of the cytotoxicity of resin-based composites. In addition, this study also evaluated the effects of pulsatile pressure and the importance of dentin permeability on the cytotoxic response to bonding resins.
   Methods. Forty freshly extracted and forty cryopreserved third molars were used. A standardized Class I cavity was prepared within the dentin. The hydraulic conductance of each tooth was recorded. The cavities were filled either with Scotchbond Multi-Purpose Plus and Z 100 (3M Dental Products) or with Optibond and Herculite (Kerr). A plexiglas device was designed to permit 24 h long contact between culture medium and the roof of the pulp chamber while a pulsatile pulpal pressure was simulated. The viability of L 929 cells cultured with a control medium and evaluated by an MTT assay was compared to that of L 929 cells cultured with medium which remained for 24 h in contact with the pulp chamber of restored teeth. A three-way ANOVA was used to compare the cytotoxicity among the different groups. A simple least-squares linear regression was used to seek a relationship between the hydraulic conductance of dentin and the cytotoxicity of composite restorative materials.
   Results. No significant differences in cytotoxicity were found between the freshly extracted teeth and the cryopreserved teeth (p = 0.53). The cytotoxicity of the resin adhesives was statistically higher when a pulsatile pulpal pressure was simulated (p = 0.04). A significant relationship was found between the hydraulic conductance of dentin and the cytotoxicity of resin-based composites (p = 0.02).
   Significance. Cryopreserved teeth can be used for in vitro evaluation of the cytotoxicity of resin adhesives. Pulsatile pulpal pressure simulations increased the in vitro cytotoxicity of the tested materials.

AB Studies show that reputation systems have the potential to improve market quality. In this paper we report the results of simulating a market of trading agents that uses the beta reputation system for collecting feedback and computing agents' reputations. The simulation confirms the hypothesis that the presence of the reputation system improves the quality of the market. Among other things it also shows that a market with limited duration rather than infinite longevity of transaction feedback provides the best conditions under which agents can adapt to each others change in behaviour.

AB Objective: To provide evidence regarding the construct validity of a sexual aggression proxy in which male participants go on multiple virtual dates with a woman. A unique strength of this proxy is participants' opportunity to make choices throughout the simulation about how they interact with their virtual date. These decisions determine their exposure to the female agent's sexual refusals. Method: Piloting included focus groups (n = 82), surveys (n = 95), and cognitive interviews (n = 32). To establish construct validity, 87 male participants completed 2 separate sessions: a) an online survey with measures of discriminant and convergent validity; and b) a lab session in which they went on multiple dates that included nonsexual options, sexual options that the female agent accepted, and sexual options she refused. Sexual aggression was operationalized as the total number of sexual refusals that participants' received. Results: There was strong correlational evidence for discriminant and convergent validity. As hypothesized, there were some differences in the risk factors associated with refusals received on casual as compared to steady dates. Additionally, the number of refusals received was associated with the types of thoughts and actions commonly reported by perpetrators. Conclusions: This simulation provides a new approach for examining sexual aggression in controlled experiments that vary factors within the simulation such as the man's and woman's intoxication and past sexual history. Because what happens is based on each individual's responses, it could be adapted for use in prevention and treatment programs.

AB Ruthenium extraction by tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP) from nitric acid was studied and modelled in the conditions of the PUREX process. Experimental distribution ratios obtained for water, nitric acid and ruthenium were described with a physicochemical model based on the application of the mass action law on each extraction equilibrium and by taking into account deviations from thermodynamic ideal behaviour both in aqueous and organic phase using Mikulin and Sergievskii-Dannus equations. The best agreement between experimental and calculated ruthenium extraction isotherms was obtained by considering the formation of two complexes <(TBP2RuNO(NO3)(3)(H2O)(2))over bar> and <(TBP3RuNO(NO3)(3)(H2O)(2))over bar> in organic phase. This model was implemented in the CEA-AREVA PAREX process simulation code and used to simulate ruthenium behaviour in a countercurrent PUREX hot test performed in mixer-settlers.

AB The question of whether, and if so how, learning can be transfered from previously experienced games to novel games has recently attracted the attention of the experimental game theory literature. Existing research presumes that learning operates over actions, beliefs or decision rules. This study instead uses a connectionist approach that learns a direct mapping from game payoffs to a probability distribution over own actions. Learning is operationalized as a backpropagation rule that adjusts the weights of feedforward neural networks in the direction of increasing the probability of an agent playing a myopic best response to the last game played. One advantage of this approach is that it expands the scope of the model to any possible n x n normal-form game allowing for a comprehensive model of transfer of learning. Agents are exposed to games drawn from one of seven classes of games with significantly different strategic characteristics and then forced to play games from previously unseen classes. I find significant transfer of learning, i.e., behavior that is path-dependent, or conditional on the previously seen games. Cooperation is more pronounced in new games when agents are previously exposed to games where the incentive to cooperate is stronger than the incentive to compete, i.e., when individual incentives are aligned. Prior exposure to Prisoner's dilemma, zero-sum and discoordination games led to a significant decrease in realized payoffs for all the game classes under investigation. A distinction is made between superficial and deep transfer of learning both the former is driven by superficial payoff similarities between games, the latter by differences in the incentive structures or strategic implications of the games. I examine whether agents learn to play the Nash equilibria of games, how they select amongst multiple equilibria, and whether they transfer Nash equilibrium behavior to unseen games. Sufficient exposure to a strategically heterogeneous set of games is found to be a necessary condition for deep learning (and transfer) across game classes. Paradoxically, superficial transfer of learning is shown to lead to better outcomes than deep transfer for a wide range of game classes. The simulation results corroborate important experimental findings with human subjects, and make several novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.

TI ON THE PRIMARY ATOMIZATION OF NON-NEWTONIAN IMPINGING JETS: VOLUME I
   EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION

DE gelled propellant simulant; rheology; sheet breakup length; drop size
AB The effect of liquid rheology on the flowfield resulting from non-Newtonian impinging jets was investigated experimentally. Experimental data were acquired using a unique facility developed to examine the jet impingement of non-Newtonian liquids. Prior to jet impingement, the rheological properties of hydroxypropyl cellulose, Kappa carrageenan, Agar, and several carboxymethylcellulose water-based mixtures were obtained. All investigated mixtures exhibited pseudoplastic behavior. Sheet breakup length and drop size were measured from high-speed video images at various nozzle geometric and flow parameters. Results indicate that viscosity, as a function of shear rate, is not the sole factor that determines atomization likelihood. Instead, a key role is played between the interaction of gelling agent and solvent at the molecular level.

AB A new process was used to foam polypropylene (PP) with batch foaming technique with supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) as the blowing agent. Comparing with the conventional process, the new one takes less time to foam and the foaming temperature range is much broader, which is about 2.5 h and 55 degrees C, respectively. An activation model was established on the basis of mass equilibrium, this model was combined with classical nucleation theory and S-L EOS model to explain foaming behaviors of PP and simulate the cell nucleation and cell diameter. A satisfactory agreement between calculated and experimental values was obtained. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Partially hydrolyzed Polyacrylamide (PHPAM) crosslinked by Cr+3 is frequently applied to plug thief zone for the better water management in matured oil reservoir. However, PHPAM gel may certainly cause inevitable formation damage nearby the wellbore. Although various kinds of chemical agents, such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) were employed to mitigate the nearby wellbore damage. But, huge financial investment, poor degelation efficiency, environmentally insecure, corrosion problem, and long time span requirement persuade researchers to look for other effective technique. In this connection, ultrasonic waves is characterized by reliable, environment friendly, and cost effective technology. Current work involves comparative study of PHPAM gel degradation by the individual means of chemical agent and ultrasonic waves. Subsequently, the best-performed ultrasonic parameters and well-performed chemical agent were used independently and then simultaneously to deplug (PHPAM gel) the core sample. Results showed that 20 KHz frequency (1000 W) effectively reduced gel viscosity from original (2495 mPa.$) to 1.37 mPa.s after 10 min irradiation. This degradation is attributed to cavitation, heat energy, and hydroxyl radical (HO center dot). However, after 2 min further exposure, the viscosity grew back to 3.29 mPa.s (18 KHz), 1.42 mPa.s (20 KHz), and 3.74 mPa.s (25 KHz). This adverse behavior is owing to hydroxyl radical (HO center dot) annihilation. In chemical treatment, H2O2 among other chemicals efficiently degelled the PHPAM gel's original viscosity to 2.64 mPa.s after 24 h reaction. Similarly, NaOCl and ClO2 brought down original viscosity to 6.5 mPa.s and 159 mPa.s respectively. SEM of the samples before and after treatment was performed for the better understanding of PHPAM gel morphology. Considering dynamic experiment, maximum 23.5% and 19.80% damaged permeability recovery (30 x 10(-3) mu m(2) gas permeability) were obtained by applying ultrasonic waves (20 KHz, 1000 W, and 100 min irradiation) and chemical agent (H2O2) respectively. Permeability recovery was further increased to 40.90% by the simultaneous application of ultrasonic waves and chemical agent.

AB The comparison of macroscopic appearance and microscopic morphology of gold electrodeposit determined PHEN as the main brightener for its effective influence on refining the grains, resulting in a golden bright and shiny deposit. Improving the flatness of deposit when used together with PHEN, PDDA was the auxiliary brightener, thereby obtaining thicker deposits. Results of TEM and XRD showed that the average size of refined gold crystals was about 20 nm. We speculated from the patterns of XPS that the action of the additive molecule is to adsorb on the metal surface. Combined electrochemical measurements and MD simulations revealed that both PHEN and PDDA molecules could steadily adsorb on the surface of Ni and Au, increasing the polarization of the cathode surface and promote the refinement of grains. PHEN was the main additive when used as a composite additive for its higher adsorption energy than PDDA. The effective adsorption of PHEN and PDDA molecules led to the enhancement of cathodic polarization, causing the negative shift of potential and the decrease of current in cyclic voltammetry of the second step reduction. The chronoamperometry measurements indicated that the nucleation process was a progressive model. The grain growth was significantly inhibited when the additives were used.

AB A novel experimental apparatus and procedures have been developed and implemented to measure the volatility of a chemical warfare agent simulant as a function of ambient temperature and water vapor partial pressure. Initial data have been measured for dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) to validate the methodology. The results presented herein reveal a significant volatility suppression for DMMP, increasing as the relative humidity increases. Deviation from ideal behavior as described by Raoult's law has been quantified. The maximum deviation from ideality occurs at water partial pressures near 500 Pa. An empirical model has been developed to enable interpolation and limited extrapolation of the data to higher water partial pressures as might be found in compressed-air regenerative filtration applications.

AB The methanesulfonanilide-containing Class III agents dofetilide, D-sotalol, E-4031, and MK-499 have been characterized as selective blockers of a rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier (I-K) K+ current, I-Kr. In the present studies, the effects of dofetilide (3-30 nM), D-sotalol(10-100 mu M), E-4031 (30-300 nM), and MK-499 (30-300 nM) on myocardial effective refractory period (ERP) were assessed in ferret right ventricular papillary muscles in conditions of altered extracellular Kf concentration ([Ki(+)](e) [normal (4 mM) versus increased (10 mM)] concentrations, and of altered pacing frequency (1-3 Hz). With 4 mM [K+](e), all four agents elicited significant, concentration-dependent ERP increases in the frequency range of 1-3 Hz, and all four agents displayed reverse frequency-dependent activity. Reverse frequency-dependent profiles also were demonstrable in 10 mM [K+](e) at the higher test agent concentrations: dofetilide (10 and 30 nM), D-sotalol (100 mu M), E-4031 (100 and 300 nM) and MK-499 (100 and 300 nM). All four agents displayed diminished ERP increases in increased versus normal [K+](e). Among individual test agents, however, there were differences in magnitudes of diminution of ERP increases observed in increased [K+](e): The activities of D-sotalol and MK-499 were better maintained in increased [K+](e) than were those of dofetilide and E-4031. As a result of this differential sensitivity increased [K+](e), significant ERP increases were not demonstrable for dofetilide and E-4031 in simultaneous conditions of increased [K+](e) and rapid pacing, whereas significant activities were maintained with D-sotalol and MK-499 in increased [K+](e) throughout the 1-3-Hz range of pacing frequencies. However, the inherent tendency of myocardial refractoriness to increase in increased [K+](e), particularly at faster pacing frequencies, played a dominant role in determining the relationship between increased versus normal [K+](e) posttreatment ERP in all Class III treatment groups. This frequency-dependent increment in refractoriness in increased [K+](e) reflected in baseline ERP determined in 10 versus 4 mM [K+](e), respectively, at frequencies of 1 Hz (163 +/- 3 vs. 157 +/- 2 ms, p = 0.06), 2 Hz (146 +/- 3 vs. 134 +/- 2 ms, p < 0.01), and 3 Hz (134 +/- 2 vs. 112 +/- 2 ms, p < 0.01) tended to offset as well as minimize differences among the I-Kr blockers in diminution of activity observed in increased [K+](e). As a consequence, no fundamental differences among the methanesulfonanilide I-Kr blockers were apparent with regard to the influence of altered pacing frequency and [K+](e) on effects on absolute refractoriness in this experimental preparation. -

AB Purpose: The effects of three preoperative mouthwashes on salivary bacterial levels were evaluated and compared between subjects with differing periodontal status.
   Materials and Methods: Based on periodontal parameters, periodontally healthy individuals (n = 60) and those with gingivitis (n = 60) and periodontitis (n = 60) were randomly assigned to a single preoperative dose of chlorhexidine (CHX), essential oils (EO), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) or negative control mouthwashes. Saliva samples were collected between 8:00 and 11:00 a.m., before and after a single-dose rinse with the respective mouthwash. Total bacterial load and levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola and Streptococcus oralis were determined by qPCR. Data were statistically analysed using paired t- and Student's t-tests (p < 0.05).
   Results: CHX, EO and CPC showed greater antimicrobial efficacy than did the negative control. CHX [1226445.53] and EO [1743639.38] provided greater reductions in comparison to both CPC [106302.96] and negative control [37852.46]). CHX provided greater reductions of simultaneous levels of Pg [106326.00], Td [3335841] and Tf [61557.47] in the healthy group, as did EO in the diseased groups. CPC provided the greatest reduction [3775319.36] in the periodontitis group.
   Conclusion: Periodontal status influenced the antimicrobial efficacy of preoperative mouthwashes. Therefore, periodontal status should be taken into consideration by clinicians. The antimicrobial efficacy differed among the agents tested. CHX and EO showed the greatest efficacy. The recognition of periodontal condition by clinicians is mandatory to select the most effective preoperative mouthwash.

AB Mycobacteria represent a group of pathogens which cause serious diseases in mammals, including the lethal tuberculosis (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Despite the mortality of this community-acquired and nosocomial disease mentioned above, other mycobacteria may cause similar infections, acting as dangerous opportunistic pathogens. Additionally, resistant strains belonging to Mycobacterium spp. have emerged. Thus, the design of novel antimycobacterial agents is a challenge for the scientific community. In this sense, chemoinformatics has played a vital role in drug discovery, helping to rationalize chemical synthesis, as well as the evaluation of pharmacological and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) profiles in both medicinal and pharmaceutical chemistry. Until now, there is no in silico methodology able to assess antimycobacterial activity and ADMET properties at the same time. This work introduces the first multitasking model based on quantitative-structure biological effect relationships (mtk-QSBER) for simultaneous prediction of antimycobacterial activities and ADMET profiles of drugs/chemicals under diverse experimental conditions. The mtk-QSBER model was constructed by using a large and heterogeneous dataset of compounds (more than 34600 cases), displaying accuracies higher than 90% in both, training and prediction sets. To illustrate the utility of the present model, several molecular fragments were selected and their contributions to different biological effects were calculated and analyzed. Also, many properties of the investigational drug TMC-207 were predicted. Results confirmed that, from one side, TMC-207 can be a promising antimycobacterial drug, and on the other hand, this study demonstrates that the present mtk-QSBER model can be used for virtual screening of safer antimycobacterial agents.

AB A combination of experimental characterisation techniques and computational modelling has allowed us to gain insight into the molecular features governing structure direction in the synthesis of microporous aluminophosphates. The occlusion of three different structure-directing agents (SDAs), triethylamine (TEA), benzylpyrrolidine (BP) and (S)-(-)-N-benzyl-pyrrolidine-2-methanol (BPM), within the AFT structure during its crystallisation, together with the simultaneous incorporation of water, has been experimentally measured. We found a higher incorporation of organic molecules in the structure obtained with BPM. while a higher water (and lower organic) content is found for the ones obtained with TEA and BP as SDAs. The computational study provides a thermodynamic explanation for the observed behaviour in terms of the relative stabilisation energy of the SDAs and water molecules within the AFT framework compared with when they are in aqueous solution, and demonstrates that a competition for preferential occupation exists between water and organic SDAs, which is a function of the interaction with the inorganic framework. ne lower interaction of TEA and BP molecules with the AFT structure promotes the simultaneous incorporation of water molecules in the 12-membered-ring (MR) channel, to increase the host-guest interaction energy and thus the thermodynamic stability. The presence of strongly interacting methanol groups in the BPM molecules leads to the incorporation of only organic molecules within the 12-MR channels. Our results demonstrate the essential role that water molecules play in the stabilisation of hydrophilic microporous aluminophosphates; a minimum amount of organic SDA is, however, essential for a templating role of the microporous architecture.

AB We describe a series of experiments with an agent designed to model human conversational touch-capable of physically touching users in synchrony with speech and other nonverbal communicative behavior-and its use in expressing empathy to users in distress. The agent is composed of an animated human face that is displayed on a monitor affixed to the top of a human mannequin, with touch conveyed by an air bladder that squeezes a user's hand. We demonstrate that when touch is used alone, hand squeeze pressure and number of squeezes are associated with user perceptions of affect arousal conveyed by an agent, while number of squeezes and squeeze duration are associated with affect valence. We also show that, when affect-relevant cues are present in facial display, speech prosody, and touch used simultaneously by the agent, facial display dominates user perceptions of affect valence, and facial display and prosody are associated with affect arousal, while touch had little effect. Finally, we show that when touch is used in the context of an empathic, comforting interaction (but without the manipulation of affect cues in other modalities), it can lead to better perceptions of relationship with the agent, but only for users who are comfortable being touched by other people.

AB The future smart grid would help to benefit both the users and the electricity providing companies from smart pricing techniques. In addition, smart pricing can be used to achieve social objectives and would in turn fluctuate wholesale market into demand side. Collecting abundant information regarding the users electricity consumption pattern is a challenging task for utility providing companies. That is, users may not be willing to expose their indigenous information without any incentive. In this paper an Optimal Energy Consumption Scheduling (OECS) mechanism is proposed to tackle this problem. An agent-based forecasting method is designed, which is capable of predicting energy consumption of each consumer with a lead-time of one hour. This forecasting is exploited to estimate the cost of buying required amount of energy from multiple suppliers. Consequently, based on the estimated required energy and cost, an auction mechanism is proposed to optimize the energy traded between consumers and multiple suppliers within a smart grid. The objectives include increased efficiency and cost reduction of electricity usage by the end users. The results and properties of the proposed OECS mechanism are studied, and it is shown that the auction technique is budget balanced for distribution of electrical energy among consumers from diverse renewable generation resources. Extensive numerical simulations are also conducted to show and prove the beneficial properties of OECS mechanism.

AB Background. Angiogenesis is a multistep process in which the endothelial cell plays a pivotal role. We hypothesized that the combination of two antiangiogenic agents with distinct mechanisms of action would more effectively inhibit tumor growth than either agent alone in a murine mesothelioma model.
   Methods. A syngeneic murine mesothelioma flank tumor model (AB-12) was established in BALB/c mice. Separate adenovirus vectors expressing the cDNAs for human pigment epithelium-derived factor (AdPEDF) and a soluble form of the human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (Adsflt-1) were administered intratumorally. End points measured included tumor size, animal survival, and microvessel density using CD31 immunohistochemistry. An orthotopic model of mesothelioma was established by implanting AB-12 cells into the murine pleural cavity. Simultaneously, AdPEDF and Adsflt-1 were instilled intrapleurally and tumor burden and survival were recorded. The development of pulmonary emphysema was also assessed by calculating the mean linear intercept (a measure of interalveolar septal distance) in histologic lung sections from tumor-free mice after vector administration.
   Results. In the flank tumor model, the combination of AdPEDF and Adsflt-1 inhibited tumor growth, prolonged survival, and decreased microvessel density more profoundly compared with either AdPEDF or Adsflt-1 alone. In the orthotopic model, the combination was also more effective in prolonging survival. Intrapleural AdPEDF or Adsflt-1 did not increase the mean linear intercept compared with controls in tumor-free mice.
   Conclusions. In this murine model, inhibiting multiple mechanisms of angiogenesis using two agents is a more effective antineoplastic strategy than using either agent alone. In addition, instillation of antiangiogenic gene transfer vectors into the pleural space does not result in histologic evidence of pulmonary emphysema. (C) 2004 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.

AB Because invasion is, either directly or via metastasis formation, the main cause of death in cancer patients, development of efficient anti-invasive agents is an important research challenge. We have established a screening program for potentially anti-invasive compounds. The assay is based on organotypic confronting cultures between human invasive cancer cells and a fragment of normal tissue in three dimensions. Anti-invasive agents appeared to be heterogeneous with regard to their chemical nature, but plant alkaloids, polyphenolics and some of their synthetic congeners were well represented. Even within this group, active compounds were quite diverse: (+)-catechin, tangeretin, xanthohumol and other prenylated chalcones, 3,7-dimethoxyflavone, a pyrazole derivative, an isoxazolylcoumarin and a prenylated desoxybenzoin. The data gathered in this system are now applied in two projects. Firstly, structure-activity relationships are explored with computer models using an artificial neural network approach, based on quantitative structural descriptors. The aim of this study is the prediction and design of optimally efficient anti-invasive compounds. Secondly, the metabolism of orally ingested plant polyphenolics by colonic bacteria is studied in a simulator of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem ( SHIME) and in human intervention trials. This method should provide information on the final bioavailability of the active compounds in the human body, with regard to microbial metabolism, and the feasibility of designing pre-or probiotics that increase the generation of active principles for absorption in the gastro-intestinal tract. The final and global aim of all these studies is to predict, synthesize and apply in vivo molecules with an optimal anti-invasive, and hence an anti-metastatic activity against cancer.

AB Can firms and coevolutionary groups suffer from too much interdependent complexity? Is complexity theory an alternative explanation to competitive selection for the emergent order apparent in coevolutionary industry groups? The biologist Stewart Kauffman suggests a theory of complexity catastrophe offering universal principles explaining phenomena normally attributed to Darwinian natural selection theory. Kauffman's complexity theory seems to apply equally well to firms in coevolutionary pockets. Based on complexity theory, four kinds of complexity are identified. Kauffman's "NK[C] model" is positioned "at the edge of chaos" between complexity driven by "Newtonian" simple rules and rule-driven deterministic chaos. Kauffman's insight, which is the basis of the findings in this paper, is that complexity is both a consequence and a cause. Multicoevolutionary complexity in firms is defined by moving natural selection processes inside firms and down to a "parts" level of analysis, in this instance Porter's value chain level, to focus on microstate activities by agents. The assumptions of stochastically idiosyncratic microstates and coevolution in firms are analyzed. Competitive advantage, as a dependent variable, is defined in terms of Nash equilibrium fitness levels. This allows a translation of Kauffman's theory to firms, paying particular attention to (1) how value chain landscapes might be modeled, (2) assumptions underlying Kauffman's models makings them amenable to firms, and (3) a delineation of seven of Kauffman's computational experiments. As part of the translation, possible parallels between the application of complexity catastrophe theory to coevolutionary pockets and studies by institutional theorists and social network analysts are discussed. The models derive from spin-glass microstate models resulting in Boolean games. Kauffman's Boolean statistical mechanics is introduced in developing the logic underlying the somewhat simplified NK[C] model. The model allows the use of computational experiments to better understand how the dependent variable-value chain fitness-is affected by changes in the number of internal interdependencies K, the number of coevolutionary links with opponents C, the size of the coevolutionary pocket S, and the number of simultaneous adaptive changes, among other things. Various computational experiments are presented that suggest strategic organizing approaches most likely to foster competitive advantage. High or low Nash equilibrium fitness levels an shown to result from internal and external coevolutionary densities as a function of links among value chain competencies within a firm and between a firm and an opponent. Complexity phenomena appear to suggest a number of expected land thus validating) and surprising strategies with respect to complex organizational interdependencies. For example, moderate complexity fares best and external coevolutionary complexity sets an upper bound to advantages likely to be gained from internal complexity. Various complexity "lessons" are discussed. Models such as the NK[C] could offer insights into strategic organizing.

AB Collective behaviors characterize the intrinsic dynamics of the crowds. Automatically understanding collective crowd behaviors has important applications to video surveillance, traffic management and crowd control, while it is closely related to scientific fields such as statistical physics and biology. In this paper, a new mixture model of dynamic pedestrian-Agents (MDA) is proposed to learn the collective behavior patterns of pedestrians in crowded scenes from video sequences. From agent-based modeling, each pedestrian in the crowd is driven by a dynamic pedestrian-agent, which is a linear dynamic system with initial and termination states reflecting the pedestrian's belief of the starting point and the destination. The whole crowd is then modeled as a mixture of dynamic pedestrian-agents. Once the model parameters are learned from the trajectories extracted from videos, MDA can simulate the crowd behaviors. It can also infer the past behaviors and predict the future behaviors of pedestrians given their partially observed trajectories, and classify them different pedestrian behaviors. The effectiveness of MDA and its applications are demonstrated by qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video surveillance sequences.

AB In science and especially in economics, agent-based modeling has become a widely used modeling approach. These models are often formulated as a large system of difference equations. In this study, we discuss two aspects, numerical modeling and the probabilistic description for two agent-based computational economic market models: the Levy-Levy-Solomon model and the Franke-Westerhoff model. We derive time-continuous formulations of both models, and in particular, we discuss the impact of the time-scaling on the model behavior for the Levy-Levy-Solomon model. For the Franke-Westerhoff model, we proof that a constraint required in the original model is not necessary for stability of the time-continuous model. It is shown that a semi-implicit discretization of the time-continuous system preserves this unconditional stability. In addition, this semi-implicit discretization can be computed at cost comparable to the original model. Furthermore, we discuss possible probabilistic descriptions of time-continuous agent-based computational economic market models. Especially, we present the potential advantages of kinetic theory in order to derive mesoscopic descriptions of agent-based models. Exemplified, we show two probabilistic descriptions of the Levy-Levy-Solomon and Franke-Westerhoff model.

AB We present a simulation model of the technological innovations based on the former Guardiola's concept which relies on the notion of technological barriers. The central, novel feature of our proposal is the assumption that barriers can be reduced allowing public support to R&D. However, this can be applied under the different policies. The statistical treatment of the simulation results demonstrated that support of the elitist (super-threshold) innovating units yields higher innovation rate, but more profound variation of the technological levels. On the other hand, the favoring of innovators with sub-threshold technological levels may lead to the more integrated technological world. Simultaneously, we use the same model to study the effects of supporting knowledge sharing (that is to say, lowering sharing barriers) on average organizational knowledge. An interesting aspect of the model represents self-organized adjustment of the probabilistic parameters related to the social linkages.

AB Prior work has proposed different theoretical mechanisms to explain students' course-taking patterns in schools. On the one hand, there are oversocialized accounts that claim that rules, social background factors, and supply-side factors shape observed career patterns. On the other hand, there are undersocialized accounts that claim that the decisions of strategic agents and demand-side dynamics shape course-taking careers. In this article, the authors use simulations to illustrate how these theoretical mechanisms can generate course-taking patterns. Grounding the simulations in empirical data on the mathematics course taking of students in two high schools, they assess the relative merits of these competing theories by testing how closely observed and predicted career patterns align. The results reveal that the characteristics of students and the organizational rules and requirements of course-taking career systems render certain allocation mechanisms more salient than others. In particular, highly competitive and structurally constrained systems are shaped by supply dynamics, while less regulated systems of diverse populations are shaped by agent-based decision making.

AB We develop an agent-based model in which heterogeneous and boundedly rational agents interact by trading a risky asset at an endogenously set price. Agents are endowed with balance sheets comprising the risky asset as well as cash on the asset side and equity capital as well as debt on the liabilities side. A number of findings emerge when simulating the model: we find that the empirically observable log-normal distribution of bank balance sheet size naturally emerges and that higher levels of leverage lead to a greater inequality among agents. Furthermore, greater leverage increases the frequency of bankruptcies and systemic events. Credit frictions, which we define as the stickiness of debt adjustments, are able to explain a key difference in the relation between leverage and assets observed for different bank types. Lowering credit frictions leads to an increasingly procyclical behavior of leverage, which is typical for investment banks. Nevertheless, the impact of credit frictions on the fragility of the model financial system is complex. Lower frictions do increase the stability of the system most of the time, while systemic events become more probable. In particular, we observe an increasing frequency of severe liquidity crises that can lead to the collapse of the entire model financial system. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the peer review process could help research and shed light on the mechanisms that underlie crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present an agent-based model of peer review built on three entities - the paper, the scientist and the conference. The system is implemented on a BDI platform (Jason) that allows to define a rich model of scoring, evaluating and selecting papers for conferences. Then, we propose a programme committee update mechanism based on disagreement control that is able to remove reviewers applying a strategy aimed to prevent papers better than their own to be accepted ("rational cheating"). We analyze a homogeneous scenario, where all conferences aim to the same level of quality, and a heterogeneous scenario, in which conferences request different qualities, showing how this affects the update mechanism proposed. We also present a first step toward an empirical validation of our model that compares the amount of disagreements found in real conferences with that obtained in our simulations.

AB Crowd modeling and simulation is an active research field that has drawn increasing attention from industry, academia and government recently. In this paper, we present a generic data-driven approach to generate crowd behaviors that can match the video data. The proposed approach is a bi-layer model to simulate crowd behaviors in pedestrian traffic in terms of exclusion statistics, parallel dynamics and social psychology. The bottom layer models the microscopic collision avoidance behaviors, while the top one focuses on the macroscopic pedestrian behaviors. To validate its effectiveness, the approach is applied to generate collective behaviors and re-create scenarios in the Informatics Forum, the main building of the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to generate desirable crowd behaviors and offer promising prediction performance.

AB This study investigates the critical role that opinion leaders (or influentials) play in the adoption process of new products. Recent existing reseach evidence indicates a limited effect of opinion leaders on diffusion processes, yet these studies take into account merely the network position of opinion leaders without addressing their influential power. Empirical findings of our study show that opinion leaders, in addition to having a more central network position, possess more accurate knowledge about a product and tend to be less susceptible to norms and more innovative. Experiments that address these attributes, using an agent-based model, demonstrate that opinion leaders increase the speed of the information stream and the adoption process itself. Furthermore, they increase the maximum adoption percentage. These results indicate that targeting opinion leaders remains a valuable marketing strategy.

We have been actively pursuing research in this area and have participated in the RoboCup competitions, winning the RoboCup-98 and RoboCup-99 simulator competitions. In this paper, we report on the main technical issues that we encountered and addressed in direct response to the learning and teamwork challenges stated in the IJCAI-97 challenge paper. We describe "layered learning" in which off-line and online, individual and collaborative, learned robotic soccer behaviors are combined hierarchically. We achieve effective teamwork through a team member agent architecture that encompasses a "flexible teamwork structure." Agents are capable of decomposing the task space into flexible roles and can switch roles while acting. We report detailed empirical results verifying the effectiveness of the learned behaviors and the components of the team member agent architecture.

AB Selective attention describes that individuals have a preference on information according to their involving motivation. Based on achievements of social psychology, we propose an opinion interacting model to improve the modeling of individuals' interacting behaviors. There are two parameters governing the probability of agents interacting with opponents, i.e. individual relevance and time-openness. It is found that, large individual relevance and large time-openness advance the appearance of large clusters, but large individual relevance and small time-openness favor the lessening of extremism. We also put this new model into application to work out some factor leading to a successful product. Numerical simulations show that selective attention, especially individual relevance, cannot be ignored by launcher firms and information spreaders so as to attain the most successful promotion.

AB Profound social, economic, and environmental changes that include new land management practices are often associated with advancing agricultural frontiers. We argue that existing approaches to case studies do not allow for clear generalization or the systematic testing of hypotheses. As an alternative, our study uses Mill's method of agreement approach to synthesize results from seven long-term case studies of land cover change in frontier areas. We identify a number of generalizations that hold across the specific case studies. We also identify changes in the spatial organization of land use in agricultural frontier areas, which are typically characterized by agricultural expansion, growing population, and transportation improvements. We then evaluate the methodological strengths and weaknesses of Mill's method of agreement based on use in this study. Finally, we argue that agent-based models, using virtual landscapes and the logic of demographic standardization, are an important next step to facilitate methodologically defensible comparisons across case studies.

AB Herding of sheep by dogs is a powerful example of one individual causing many unwilling individuals to move in the same direction. Similar phenomena are central to crowd control, cleaning the environment and other engineering problems. Despite single dogs solving this 'shepherding problem' every day, it remains unknown which algorithm they employ or whether a general algorithm exists for shepherding. Here, we demonstrate such an algorithm, based on adaptive switching between collecting the agents when they are too dispersed and driving them once they are aggregated. Our algorithm reproduces key features of empirical data collected from sheep-dog interactions and suggests new ways in which robots can be designed to influence movements of living and artificial agents.

AB In this article, principles of architectures relating to normative agents are evaluated with regard to the question whether and to what extend results of empirical research are incorporated in the architecture. In the human sciences, internalisation is a crucial element within the concept of norms. Internalisation distinguishes normative behaviour regulation from mere coercion. The aim of this article is to begin answering the question of to what extent normative agent architectures represent the theoretical construct of norm internalisation. The relevant research in this area may be found in socialisation research in psychology and sociology. Evaluation of conclusions from the empirical sciences allows to identify drawbacks and opportunities in existing architectures, as well as to develop suggestions for future development.

   Stylized facts
ID FOREIGN-EXCHANGE; FINANCIAL-MARKETS; PRICES; ECONOMICS; BEHAVIOR
AB A well-defined agent-based asset pricing model able to match the widely observed properties of financial time series is valuable for testing the implications of various biases associated with investors' behaviour. Extending one of the most successful models in capturing traders behaviour, we present a new behavioural agent-based asset pricing model. Specifically, we introduce a well-known behavioural bias in the model, loss aversion, and evaluate its implications. First, measuring how close the simulated time series are to its empirical counterparts, we show that the model with loss aversion better matches and explains the properties of real-world financial data, compared with the base model without the behavioural bias. Secondly, we assess the impact of different levels of loss aversion not only on the agents' switching mechanisms, but also on the properties of the time series generated by the model. We demonstrate how for different levels of the loss aversion parameter, the biased agents tend to be driven out of the market at different points in time. Since even the simplest strategies have been shown to survive the competition in an agent-based setting, we can link our findings with the behavioural finance literature, which states that investors' systematic biases lead to unexpected market behaviour, instabilities and systematic errors. Finally, we provide an in-depth analysis of the simulated time series and show the resulting dynamics replicate a rich set of the stylized facts including: absence of autocorrelation, heavy tails, volatility clustering and conditional heavy tails of returns, long memory of absolute returns, as well as volume-volatility relations, gain-loss asymmetry, power-law behaviour and long memory of volume.

AB The use of encapsulated liquid nanoparticles is currently largely investigated for medical applications, mainly because their reduced size allows them to enter targeted areas which cannot be reached by large microbubbles (contrast agents). Low-boiling point perfluorocarbon droplets can be vaporized on-site under the action of the ultrasonic field, in order to turn them into echogeneous-eventually cavitating-microbubbles. This paper presents a theoretical model describing this phenomenon, paying particular attention to the finite size of the droplet and its encapsulation by a thin viscoelastic layer. Numerical simulations are done for droplets of radii 1 and 10 mu m and for frequencies of 1-5 MHz. Results reveal that droplet surface tension and shell rigidity are responsible for an increase of the acoustic droplet vaporization threshold. Furthermore, this threshold does not vary monotonically with frequency, and an optimal frequency can be found to minimize it. Finally, the role of some physical properties on the dynamics of the particle is analyzed, such as the contrast of inner and outer liquids densities and the mechanical properties of the shell.

AB The effects of clodronate, a bisphosphonate for the treatment of hypercalcemia, on the progress of atherosclerosis were studied in rabbits fed with a high-cholesterol (1%) diet and treated simultaneously with disodium clodronate 0 (saline), 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg intravenously twice a week for 6, 9, and 12 weeks. In 9 to 12 weeks, plasma total cholesterol increased from 0.8+/-0.3 mmol/L (mean +/- SD) in rabbits fed the standard diet to 46+/-17 mmol/L in animals subjected to high-cholesterol diet. Clodronate did not influence the cholesterol concentration in plasma. None of the parameters studied were changed by clodronate within 6 weeks after beginning the treatment. In 9 to 12 weeks (n = 7 to 9), plasma total Ca++ concentration was decreased from 3.55+/-0.12 mmol/L in the saline group to 3.36+/-0.16 mmol/L in the group on the greatest clodronate dose (p < 0.05). Free and esterified cholesterol and total Ca++ concentrations in the wall of thoracic aorta were reduced by the greatest dose of clodronate, compared with the groups treated with saline solution or smaller doses of the drug (p < 0.05). At 12 weeks, the greatest dose of clodronate also reduced the visible and lipid-stained atheromatous areas in the thoracic and abdominal aorta, compared with those in the saline and the other clodronate dose groups (p < 0.05). The results suggest that a high dose of clodronate inhibits the development of diet-induced atherosclerosis in rabbits.

AB Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf extract (ISLE) was examined as corrosion mitigating agent against mild steel in 1 M HCl. The extract was characterized by GC-MS and FTIR. Weight loss (WL), potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), SEM- EDX, AFM, UV-Vis spectroscopy and DFT studies were performed to examine corrosion mitigation performance of LSLE. As revealed by WL the extract was above 94% efficient at the concentration of 500 ppm and 333 K. Adsorption of LSLE on mild steel surface is spontaneous and follows Langmuir isotherm model. Mixed type inhibition with anodic predominance was revealed by PDP results. EIS data revealed the formation of inhibitive film on metal surface by the active groups of the extract. SEM and AFM show a better morphological image and reduced surface roughness in the presence of ISLE. UV-Vis results indicate Fe-LSLE complex formation during corrosion reaction. DFT has been conducted to correlate the inhibition efficiency with the molecular structure of active species present in the extract. Quantum parameters and Molecular dynamic simulation helps in correlating the molecular structure and adsorption strength with inhibition efficiency. ANOVA statistical test was conducted to compare the inhibition efficiencies obtained by using different techniques and the data reveals that they are significantly not different.

AB This agent-based financial market model is a generalization of the model of Westerhoff (The Use of Agent-Based Financial Market Models to Test the Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies) by traders who are allowed to have different investment horizons as introduced by Demary (Who Does a Currency Transaction Tax Harm More: Short-Term Speculators or Long-Term Investors?). Our research goals are, first, to study what consequences the introduction of heterogeneous investment horizons has for agent-based financial market models, and second, how effective transaction taxes are in stabilizing financial markets. Numerical simulations reveal that under sufficiently small tax rates traders abstain from short-term trading in favour of longer investment horizons. This change in behavior leads to less volatility and less mispricings. When the tax rate exceeds a certain threshold, however, mispricings increase as also found in Westerhoff (Heterogeneous Traders and the Tobin Tax and The Use of Agent-Based Financial Market Models to Test the Effectiveness of Regulatory Policies). This emergent property is due to the fact that taxation reduces short-term fluctuations and causes longer lasting trends in the exchange rate. As a result, the longer term fundamentalist trading rule becomes unpopular in favor of the longer term trend-chasing rule.

AB Given recent requirements for ensuring the robustness of algorithmic trading strategies laid out in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, this paper proposes a novel agent-based simulation for exploring algorithmic trading strategies. Five different types of agents are present in the market. The statistical properties of the simulated market are compared with equity market depth data from the Chi-X exchange and found to be significantly similar. The model is able to reproduce a number of stylised market properties including: clustered volatility, autocorrelation of returns, long memory in order flow, concave price impact and the presence of extreme price events. The results are found to be insensitive to reasonable parameter variations.

DE Form-finding; Structural shell; Homeostatic model; Finite elements;
   Membranal behavior
AB This paper deals with the shape generation of structural shells within the field of Conceptual Design. Both physical models and computational simulations are presented and discussed. The design is based on the biological principle of homeostasis which states the following: When an external agent attacks the structure, the latter defends itself "intelligently" to recover its bearing capacity. Here, heat is the external agent used to cause the model material degradation. Thus the model adopts a more appropriate structural shape in order to continue to resist loads. The physical experiment is carried out by introducing a Polymethyl Methacrylate (PMMA) plate in an oven with defined boundary conditions and loads. The virtual simulation is performed using a finite element software. A thermal elasto-plastic material model is included to represent the PMMA behavior. A comparison between the shapes found with both approaches is presented. Notwithstanding the diversity of the methods and uncertainties in the material characterization the match is more than acceptable. The numerical simulation may constitute a low cost complement to shell form-finding using the Homeostatic Model Technique. Additionally, the obtained shape is employed as the geometry of a structural shell and both, experimental and finite element stress analyses are performed, yielding a quasi-membranal behavior.

AB Community collective efficacy is an important concept in studying various community problems and in developing community well-beings. While existing research on collective efficacy mainly focuses on building analytical or statistical models from informant survey data, this paper develops a complexity science-informed agent-based model to study the dynamic process of collective efficacy formation in a community. We model the individual level cognitive process for participating in community tasks and simulate the emergent spatial patterns of agents' collective efficacies in a community. The developed model is based on the self-efficacy theory and Theory of Planned Behavior. Interesting patterns such as spatial segregation has been observed through simulations, and an application of the developed model is presented.

AB In the paper the potential of chitosan modified zeolite (NaP1CS) as a cheap adsorbent for methylene blue (MB) removal from aqueous solutions was determined. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses, nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and scanning electron microscope were applied to characterize the adsorbent. Batch adsorption studies were carried out to examine effects of various factors such as pH, contact time, initial MB and Cu(II) concentrations, temperature influence on the sorption process. The impact of different ways of zeolites modification with chitosan on sorption capacity and the comparison of adsorption of unmodified zeolite and fly ash are presented. The effect of different metal ions such as Cu(II), Zn(II), Mn(II), Fe(III) and also that of foreign ions on the MB sorption were also studied. The pseudo-first order, pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models were fitted to the kinetic data. The best fit was achieved with both the pseudo-second order and intraparticle diffusion models. The experimental equilibrium data were evaluated by the Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Dubinin-Radushkevich isotherm models. The calculated thermodynamic parameters indicated a spontaneous and endothermic sorption process. Desorption studies were carried out with different desorbing agents. HCl proved to be the most effective desorption agent for MB and Cu(II). (C) 2017 The Korean Society of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Pb, Cu, Zn, Mn, and Cr were removed from municipal solid waste fly ash through chloride volatilization method using poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) as the chlorinating agent. To investigate the effective utilization of PVC, chloride volatilization at 700-900 degrees C was conducted for 0-120 min under three conditions: elevated heating (similar to 40 degrees C/min), isothermal heating, and isothermal heating with Ca(OH)(2) as a HCl trapping agent. PVC was a better chlorinating agent than CaCl2 and removed similar to 100% Pb and Zn and similar to 50% Cu and Mn by isothermal heating at 900 degrees C for 120 min. Ca(OH)(2) reduced Pb removal at 700 degrees C by similar to 20% and Cu removal at 900 degrees C by similar to 50%; however, it promoted Zn volatilization by 10-20% at all temperatures. The effects of co-existing elements on the chloride volatilization behaviors of these heavy metals were determined by conducting thermodynamic simulations under equilibrium conditions. The combined experimental and thermodynamic approach suggested that Pb and Zn were mainly volatilized as metal chlorides via reaction with the HCl produced by PVC pyrolysis, whereas Mn was volatilized by both CaCl2 and Na2O. Thus, CaO, CaCO3, MgO, and residual carbon in fly ash could inhibit the chlorination of Pb, Cu, and Cr.

AB BACKGROUND In order to improve the desulfurization and denitrification performance of Al2O3@TiO2-Ce adsorbent, ultrasound-assisted surface modification using different pore-forming agents (CTAB (Cetyl Trimethyl Ammonium Bromide), NH4NO3, and Urea) was introduced into the preparation process of Al2O3@TiO2-Ce core-shell structure adsorbent.
   RESULTS Among the adsorbent modified by various pore-forming agent, CTAB modified Al2O3@TiO2-Ce adsorbent showed the best denitrification efficiency, and the ultrasound-assisted modification of CTAB had a positive effect on the removal efficiency of SO2 and NOx. The adsorption performance increased with the increase of addition amount of CTAB in the range of 5% to 10% but decreased with the increase of CTAB addition amount in the range of 10% to 20%. Petal-like wrinkles appeared on the surface of CTAB modified adsorbent, and the distribution of the pores on the surface was dispersed uniformly by ultrasound.
   CONCLUSION The petal-like wrinkle could effectively increase the specific surface area and pore volume of the adsorbent, and pore size distribution was more evenly, which was considered to be the key to improve the adsorption performance. The SO2 and NOx adsorption followed the pseudo-first order rate expression, and the adsorption process was limited by both external diffusion and intraparticle diffusion. This work provides an experimental and theoretical basis for the surface modification of simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification adsorbents. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB A model for evaporation of chemical warfare agents on the ground has been developed. The process of evaporation is described in three steps: (1) the immediate drop enlargement due to impact momentum is modeled using an empirical correlation from technical literature; (2) further enlargement caused by capillary spreading upon the surface and the simultaneous sorption into the substrate, modeled in three dimensions; (3) subsequent drying and redistribution of the sorbed material is described as a one-dimensional (vertical) process, The formulation of the flux in the soil takes into account vapour, liquid, solute, and adsorbed phases. The evaporation from the surface is determined by the vapour concentration at the surface and the conditions in the atmospheric viscous sub-layer close to the droplet spots on the surface.,Model results agree with the limited experimental data found in the literature. The model shows a very rapid sorption and redistribution of chemical warfare droplets on sand. This effect gives a rapid decrease of the evaporation, except for a shorter initial period. However, a small residual evaporation exists for a rather long time from liquid, which has penetrated down into the soil. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This paper utilizes evolutionary robotics techniques as a hypothesis generator to explore optical variables and control strategies that could be used to solve a driving-like braking task. Given such a task, humans exhibit two different braking behaviors: continuously regulated braking and impulsive braking. Based on an oft-used experimental task in human perception/action research, a series of evolutionary robotics simulations were developed to explore the space of possible braking strategies by examining how braking strategies change as the optical information is manipulated. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) behaviors similar to human behavior were observed only when the constraints were selected correctly; (2) the optical variables and proportional rate yielded significantly better braking performance; (3) two different classes of impulsive braking behaviors were observed, including one not reported in previous studies: discrete impulsive braking and oscillatory impulsive braking; (4) the optical variable is used to initiate and terminate braking; (5) the evolved model agents use a proportional rate control strategy to regulate braking continuously. We argue that combining psychological experiments and evolutionary robotics simulations is a promising research methodology that is useful for testing existing hypotheses and generating new ones.

ID POLARIZATION
AB Based on Axelrod's adaptive culture model, the effects of the distribution of global information feedback are examined in two simulations. The first model is the generalized other model, where the most preferred features are hypothesized to represent the mental model of the most ordinary person and have the same influential power as real neighbors. The second model is the filter model, where neighbors are influential only when their traits are concordant with the most common trait among whole agents. In both simulations, the global distribution of information facilitated an earlier convergence and maintenance of cultural diversity. These counterintuitive results suggest that information about a global society, for example mass media coverage, would provide support for a local minority.

AB The manipulation of microbubbles by ultrasonic waves has the potential to be a useful technique in therapeutic ultrasound, such as for drug delivery systems and gene delivery systems. The Bjerknes force, which is an acoustic radiation force produced by microbubbles, acts as a driving force on the microbubbles; however, the two types of Bjerknes force make the resultant bubble movement very complex. In this paper, the evaluation of microbubble dynamics under ultrasonic wave radiation based on a laser diffraction method is proposed. The relationship between the microbubble spatial distribution and the diffracted light intensity is discussed on the basis of both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Experiments are carried out using ultrasonic wave contrast agent as microbubbles. (C) 2010 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB The matching relationship between bolt diameter and borehole diameter determines the bolt supporting effect in the mining roadway. In this paper, the failure modes of the anchorage body under different diameter matching were studied by the pullout test. When the anchorage agent was pulled out completely with bolt, the anchoring effect was ideal. Whereas, when the bolt was pulled out smoothly with only a thin layer of anchorage agent, the anchoring effect was relatively worse. Through multiple pullout tests, the suitable diameter matching difference can be defined with a range of 6-11 mm. Based on the interface sliding failure mode between anchorage agent and rock-like mass, a mechanical model of diameter matching was established. Both equations of tensile force and interfacial shear stress along with the anchorage direction in perfectly elastic state were derived. FLAC 3D was applied to analyze the distribution of interfacial shear stress and axial stress under different diameter matching between the bolt and the borehole. As a result, a 4-11 mm diameter difference shows the best anchoring effect. According to both experimental and simulation results, the optimal diameter matching difference is 6-11 mm.

AB Angiogenic sprouting requires functional specialisation of endothelial cells into leading tip cells and following stalk cells. Experimental data illustrate that induction of the tip cell phenotype is dependent on the protein VEGF-A; however, the process of tip cell selection is not fully understood. Here we introduce a hierarchical agent-based model simulating a suggested feedback loop that links VEGF-A tip cell induction with delta-like 4 (Dll4)/notch-mediated lateral inhibition. The model identifies VEGF-A concentration, VEGF-A gradients and filopodia extension as critical parameters in determining the robustness of tip/stalk patterning.
   The behaviour of the model provides new mechanistic insights into the vascular patterning defects observed in pathologically high VEGF-A, such as diabetic retinopathy and tumour angiogenesis. We investigate the role of cell morphology in tip/stalk patterning, highlighting filopodia as lateral inhibition amplifiers. The model has been used to make a number of predictions, which are now being tested experimentally, including: (1) levels of Dll4/VEGFR-2, or related downstream proteins, oscillate in synchrony along a vessel in high VEGF environments; (2) a VEGF gradient increases tip cell selection rate.

AB We explore the variability that animals display in their movement choices as they forage in a finite-sized food patch with a uniform food distribution, and present a framework for how these choices may be adjusted to optimize foraging efficiency. Inspired by experimental studies of the zooplankton Daphnia, we model foraging animals as "agents" moving in two dimensions in repeated and successive sequences of hops, pauses, and turns. For Daphnia and other species, critical movement parameters such as hop lengths, pause times, and turning angles are typically reported as probability density functions. Similarly, the agents in our simulations choose their movement parameters at random from such distributions. Each distribution is defined by a characteristic width, which we interpret as a "noise width," available to be tuned for increased foraging efficiency. We investigate the sensitivity of the system by measuring the food gathered by the agents as the turning angle and hop length noise widths are varied. In all cases, we find a maximum in food gathered at some particular value of the noise width in question, suggesting that these results can be considered robust examples of natural stochastic resonance.

AB In this paper, a dynamical systems analysis is presented for characterizing the motion of a group of unicycles; in leader-follower formation. The equilibrium formations are characterized along with their local stability analysis. It is demonstrated that with the variation in control gain. the collective dynamics might undergo Andronov-Hopf and Fold-Hopf bifurcations. The vigor of quasi-periodicity in the regime of Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and heteroclinic bursts between quasi-periodic and chaotic behavior in the regime of Fold-Hopf bifurcation increases with the number of unicycles. Numerical simulations also suggest the occurrence of global bifurcations involving the destruction of heteroclinic orbit. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The basis of keloid formation and its subsequent behavior, the very high incidence of recurrence after resection, and other forms of treatment are not fully understood. Keloids still remain a dilemma in plastic surgery. Analyzing the etiopathogenesis of keloids in a large number of patients in Ghana and in Poland led to a concept of keloid triad hypothesis (KTH). This is defined as a group of three etiologic factors which must simultaneously coexist and interact for keloids to form. The etiological factors are: genetic Links; bacterial, viral or any type of infective agent; type of surgery - sutures, tension of suture lines, location of sutures in relationship to the body skin lines of tension; etc. At least three of these factors must be present, inter-correlate, in order to form a keloid. These factors have been sub-divided into two groups - major (or main) and minor (or auxiliary) and are analyzed in this paper. In each situation at least one major factor must be present in order for a keloid to form.

AB Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are small micro-bubbles that behave nonlinearly when exposed to an ultrasound wave. This nonlinear behavior can be observed through the generated higher harmonics in a back-scattered echo. In past years several techniques have been proposed to detect or image harmonics produced by UCAs. In these proposed works, the harmonics generated in the medium during the propagation of the ultrasound wave played an important role, since these harmonics compete with the harmonics generated by the micro-bubbles. We present a method for the reduction of the second harmonic generated during nonlinear-propagation-dubbed second harmonic inversion (SHI). A general expression for the suppression signals is also derived. The SHI technique uses two pulses, p' and p '', of the same frequency f(0) and the same amplitude P-0 to cancel out the second harmonic generated by nonlinearities of the medium. Simulations show that the second harmonic is reduced by 40 dB on a large axial range. Experimental SHI B-mode images, from a tissue-mimicking phantom and UCAs, show an improvement in the agent-to-tissue ratio (ATR) of 20 dB compared to standard second harmonic imaging and 13 dB of improvement in harmonic power Doppler.

AB Behavior selection is typically a "built-in" feature of behavior-based architectures and hence, not amenable to change. There are, however, circumstances where changing behavior selection strategies is useful and can lead to better performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that such dynamic changes of behavior selection mechanisms are beneficial in several circumstances. We first categorize existing behavior selection mechanisms along three dimensions and then discuss seven possible circumstances where dynamically switching among them can be beneficial. Using the agent architecture framework activation, priority, observer, and component (APOC), we show how instances of all (nonempty) categories can be captured and how additional architectural mechanisms can be added to allow for dynamic switching among them. In particular, we propose a generic architecture for dynamic behavior selection, which can integrate existing behavior selection mechanisms in a unified way. Based on this generic architecture, we then verify that dynamic behavior selection is beneficial in the seven cases by defining architectures for simulated and robotic agents and performing experiments with them. The quantitative and qualitative analyzes of the results obtained from extensive simulation studies and experimental runs with robots verify the utility of the proposed mechanisms.

AB Local delivery of anti-thrombotic and anti-restenotic drugs is desired to achieve high concentrations of agents which may be rapidly degraded systemically or which exhibit very short half-lives in vivo. In this article, the operating characteristics of a novel local drug delivery method are described and its effectiveness demonstrated computationally and experimentally. Computational models used a finite volume method to determine the concentration field. Optical dye density measurements of Evans blue in saline were performed in an in vitro steady flow system. Modeling parameters were kept in the physiologic range. Experimental how visualization studies demonstrated high concentrations of infusate near the vessel wall. Computational studies predicted high, clinically significant drug concentrations along the wall downstream of the infusion device. When the radial infusion velocity is large (infusion flow rate, Q(inf)>0.5% of the main flow rate, Q), the wall concentration of the infused drug remains high, e.g., levels are greater than 80% of the infusate concentration 5 cm downstream of the infusion device. At lower infusion rates (Q(inf)<0.001Q), the drug concentration at the wall decreases exponentially with axial distance to less than 25% of the infusate concentration 5 cm downstream of the infusion device, although therapeutic drug levels are still readily maintained. The near wall drug concentration is a function of flow conditions, infusion rate, and the drug diffusivity. Good agreement was obtained between computational and experimental concentration measurements. Flow simulation and experimental results indicate that the technique can effectively sustain high local drug concentrations for inhibition of thrombosis and vascular lesion formation.

AB We model how macro-level dynamics of platform competition emerge from micro-level interactions among consumers. We problematize the prevailing winner-take-all hypothesis and argue that instead of assuming that consumers value the general connectivity of an entire network, they are selectively attentive and locally biased. We contrast several alternative agent-based models with differing sets of assumptions regarding consumer agents' behavior and compare their predictions with empirical data from the competition between Sony's PlayStation 3 and Microsoft's Xbox 360. The results show that only when consumers are assumed to be selectively attentive and locally biased is it possible to explain real-life market sharing between the given platforms. In effect; it is shown how a late-entrant platform can get adopted by most consumers in the market, despite the fact that an early entrant has greater initial installed base, greater pool of complementary products, and lower initial price.

AB In this work, we provide an introduction to an emerging field which has recently received considerable attention, namely the analysis and modeling of swarms. In a very general sense, the term swarm is usually meant to signify a group of objects (agents) that interact with one another and have a collective goal. Point-mass, particulate-like models are frequently used to simulate the behavior of groups comprised of individual units whose interaction are represented by inter-particle forces. The interaction "forces" can represent, for example in the case of Unmanned Airborne Vehicles (UAVs), motorized propulsion arising from inter-vehicle communication and then actuation resulting in thrust. For a swarm member, these forces have two main components, attraction and repulsion, with the fellow swarm members and the surrounding environment. This work develops and investigates (1) basic models of such systems, (2) properties of swarm models and (3) numerical algorithms, in particular temporally adaptive methods, for swarm-like systems.

AB The study of emergency evacuation in public spaces, buildings and large ships may present parallel characteristic in terms of complexity of the layout but there are also significant differences that can hindering passengers to reach muster stations or the lifeboats. There are many hazards on a ship that can cause an emergency evacuation, the most severe result in loss of lives. Providing safe and effective evacuation of passengers from ships in an emergency situation becomes critical. Recently, computer simulation has become an indispensable technology in various fields, among them, the evacuation models that recently evolved incorporating human behavioral factors. In this work, an analysis of evacuation in a Landing Helicopter Dock (LHD) ship was conducted. Escape routes specified by the ship's procedures were introduced in the model and the six emergency scenarios of the Naval Ship Code were simulated. The crew and embarked troops were introduced with their different evacuation behavior, in addition, walking speeds were extracted from data set collected in experiments conducted at other warships. From the results of the simulations, the longest time was chosen and confidence intervals constructed to determine the total evacuation time. Finally, results show that evacuation time meets regulatory requirements and the usefulness and low cost of the evacuation simulation for testing and refining possible ships' layouts and emergency scenarios.

AB Motivation: Currently, there are no ontologies capable of describing both the spatial organization of groups of cells and the behaviors of those cells. The lack of a formalized method for describing the spatiality and intrinsic biological behaviors of cells makes it difficult to adequately describe cells, tissues and organs as spatial objects in living tissues, in vitro assays and in computational models of tissues.
   Results: We have developed an OWL-2 ontology to describe the intrinsic physical and biological characteristics of cells and tissues. The Cell Behavior Ontology (CBO) provides a basis for describing the spatial and observable behaviors of cells and extracellular components suitable for describing in vivo, in vitro and in silico multicell systems. Using the CBO, a modeler can create a meta-model of a simulation of a biological model and link that meta-model to experiment or simulation results. Annotation of a multicell model and its computational representation, using the CBO, makes the statement of the underlying biology explicit. The formal representation of such biological abstraction facilitates the validation, falsification, discovery, sharing and reuse of both models and experimental data.

AB CONTEXT: Adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies are expected to help transform current agricultural systems towards sustainability. To enable and steer transformation we need to understand the mechanisms of adoption and diffusion holistically. Our current understanding is mainly informed by empirical farm level adoption studies and by agent-based models simulating systemic diffusion mechanisms. These two approaches are weakly integrated.
   OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to build an empirically grounded conceptual framework for adoption and diffusion of digital farming technologies by synthesizing literature on these alternative approaches.
   METHODS: We review 32 empirical farm-level studies on the adoption of precision and digital farming technologies and 27 agent-based models on the diffusion of agricultural innovations. Empirical findings are synthesized in terms of significance and partially standardized coefficients, and diffusion studies are categorized by their approaches and theoretical frameworks.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We show that farm-level studies focus on farm and operator characteristics but pay less attention to attributes of technology, interactions, institutional and psychological factors. Agent-based models, despite their usefulness for representing system interaction, only loosely connect with empirical farm level findings. Based on the identified gaps, we develop a conceptual framework integrating farm-level evidence on adoption with a systemic perspective on technology diffusion.
   SIGNIFICANCE: Our empirically grounded conceptual framework is the first holistic approach to connect the dots between the wealth of empirical research on technology adoption with more model-driven investigation of innovation diffusion in agent-based studies. Focusing on digital farming technologies, it may serve as a reference for those studying the adoption and diffusion of such technologies beyond farm scale. Furthermore, this framework can be the basis for contextual applications to inform policy-makers trying to foster the diffusion of suitable digital technologies through interventions as it highlights where policy can impact important aspects of adoption via relevant processes of diffusion.

AB In National Toxicology Program (NIT) studies, investigators want to assess whether a test agent is carcinogenic overall and specific to certain tumor types, while estimating the dose-response profiles. Because there are potentially correlations among the tumors, a joint inference is preferred to separate univariate analyses for each tumor type. In this regard. we propose a random effect logistic model with a matrix of coefficients representing log-odds ratios for the adjacent dose groups for tumors at different sites. We propose appropriate nonparametric priors for these coefficients to characterize the correlations and to allow borrowing of information across different dose groups and tumor types. Global and local hypotheses can be easily evaluated by summarizing the output of a single Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC). Two multiple testing procedures are applied for testing local hypotheses based on the posterior probabilities of local alternatives. Simulation studies are conducted and an NTP tumor data set is analyzed illustrating the proposed approach.

AB Past self-organizing models of collectively moving "particles" (simulated bird flocks, fish schools, etc.) have typically been based on purely reflexive agents that have no significant memory of past movements. We hypothesized that giving such individual particles a limited distributed memory of past obstacles they encountered could lead to significantly faster travel between goal destinations. Systematic computational experiments using six terrains that had different arrangements of obstacles demonstrated that, at least in some domains, this conjecture is true. Furthermore, these experiments demonstrated that improved performance over time came not only from the avoidance of previously seen obstacles, but also (surprisingly) immediately after first encountering obstacles due to decreased delays in circumventing those obstacles. Simulations also showed that, of the four strategies we tested for removal of remembered obstacles when memory was full and a new obstacle was to be saved, none was better than random selection. These results may be useful in interpreting future experimental research on group movements in biological populations, and in improving existing methodologies for control of collective movements in computer graphics, robotic teams, particle swarm optimization, and computer games.

AB The principal interactions leading to the emergence of order in swarms of marching locust nymphs was studied both experimentally, using small groups of marching locusts in the lab, and using computer simulations. We utilized a custom tracking algorithm to reveal fundamental animal-animal interactions leading to collective motion. Uncovering this behavior introduced a new agent-based modeling approach in which pause-and-go motion is pivotal. The behavioral and modeling findings are largely based on motion-related visual sensory inputs obtained by the individual locust. Results suggest a generic principle, in which intermittent animal motion can be considered as a sequence of individual decisions as animals repeatedly reassess their situation and decide whether or not to swarm. This interpretation implies, among other things, some generic characteristics regarding the build-up and emergence of collective order in swarms: in particular, that order and disorder are generic meta-stable states of the system, suggesting that the emergence of order is kinetic and does not necessarily require external environmental changes. This work calls for further experimental as well as theoretical investigation of the neural mechanisms underlying locust coordinative behavior.

TI Costimulation Blockade of CD40 and CD28 Pathways in Limb Transplantation
SO TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA English
DT Article
ID TOLERANCE
AB Costimulation blockade remains a promising experimental regimen for the induction of transplantation tolerance. The simultaneous blockade of both the CD40 and CD28 pathways has been synergistic in prolonging organ allograft survival but has not previously been investigated in a model of limb allotransplantation. This study determined the efficacy of this combination in the murine limb allograft model. C57B1/6 (H-2K(b)) female mice were recipients of heterotopic vascularized limb allografts from Balb/c (H-2K(d)) male donors. Experimental groups received treatment with a short course of MR1 (hamster anti-mouse anti-CD40 ligand antibody) alone or in combination with CTLA4-Ig, a fusion protein that blocks the B7/CD28 pathway. Untreated recipients rejected limb allografts at a mean of 9.6 +/- 1.1 (standard error of the mean) days postoperatively. Recipients of a prolonged course of MR1 rejected limb allografts at 75 +/- 25 days. When both MR1 and CTLA4-Ig were used, limb allograft survival of > 120 days was observed despite a much shorter course of therapy. Rejection in both treatment groups was consistent with a chronic antibody-mediated process. Donor antigen rechallenge in these recipients by in vitro assay and skin allograft demonstrated a hyperacute response consistent with presensitization. Long-term limb allograft survival is produced by the synergistic effect of blocking both the CD40 and CD28 costimulatory pathways. However, permanent acceptance was not achieved, and allografts eventually succumbed to what appeared to be antibody-mediated rejection. The additional use of newer agents that block more recently described costimulatory pathways may be essential for the induction of tolerance by costimulation blockade.

AB We developed a water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W)-type multiple emulsion of a new tacrolimus formulation. A potential approach to avoid the complications of systemic immunosuppression and simultaneously enhance immunosuppressive efficacy is to deliver immunosuppressive agents locally to the site of the target organs. The W/O/W emulsion is dispersed oil drops containing smaller water droplets that allow the delivery of drugs preferentially to the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Since the liver and the spleen are primary components of the RES, and the brain and the kidney have a poor RES, we hypothesized that a W/O/W emulsion of tacrolimus would possess the pharmacokinetic benefits of local immunosuppression. We evaluated this hypothesis in a rat model. The tacrolimus levels of whole blood, the liver, spleen, brain, and kidney in rats given intravenous emulsions of tacrolimus (W/O/W group) were compared with a group administered tacrolimus alone (T group). There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetic parameters of W/O/W group and T group based on whole blood data. However, the W/O/W group had significantly decreased tacrolimus levels in the brain and kidney, and significantly increased levels in the liver and spleen compared with the T group. These data suggest that the W/O/W emulsion is applicable as an intravenous drug carrier for local immunosuppression.

AB We develop a computational model to explore how ethnic geography shapes the distribution of violence in civil war. We seed the model with disaggregated data on ethnic settlement patterns in Afghanistan and calibrate the model parameters to fit empirically observed locations of violence against civilians. Our simulation suggests that (i) political actors are more likely to attack civilians in heterogeneous areas where members of one ethnic group are exposed to members of a rival group; (ii) violence directed at civilians occurs with greater frequency in locations where one political actor exercises hegemonic but incomplete territorial control (relative to areas of complete or mixed control); and (iii) geographically concentrated ethnic minorities face a higher risk of violence.

AB Carbon nanotubes have emerged as highly promising theranostic agents due to their unique structural/physical features, high surface area, and high drug-loading capacity. The high cytotoxicity of carbon nanotubes can be eliminated by noncovalent coating using hydrophilic polymers. We investigated the adsorption of long pyrene functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG) chains, PEG(2000) and PEG(5000) on a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) from a crowded solution. Full-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water were used to mimic the experimental conditions of noncovalent PEGylation with a stoichiometry of one SWNT to ten pyrene-PEG. Although the diffusional behavior of the pyrene molecules still attached to the polymers did not change according to chain length, the adsorption rate for pyrene-PEG(2000) to the SWNT was higher than that for pyrene-PEG(5000) chains. Here longer chains sterically hindered the adsorption of pyrene groups on the SWNT surface. Once adsorbed, pyrene molecules stayed on the SWNT surface even though they frequently adopted different orientations that may weaken their pi - pi stacking interactions with the nanotube surface.

TI Enhanced Equivalence Projective Simulation: A Framework for Modeling
   Formation of Stimulus Equivalence Classes
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Formation of stimulus equivalence classes has been recently modeled through equivalence projective simulation (EPS), a modified version of a projective simulation (PS) learning agent. PS is endowed with an episodic memory that resembles the internal representation in the brain and the concept of cognitive maps. PS flexibility and interpretability enable the EPS model and, consequently the model we explore in this letter, to simulate a broad range of behaviors in matching-to-sample experiments. The episodic memory, the basis for agent decision making, is formed during the training phase. Derived relations in the EPS model that are not trained directly but can be established via the network's connections are computed on demand during the test phase trials by likelihood reasoning. In this letter, we investigate the formation of derived relations in the EPS model using network enhancement (NE), an iterative diffusion process, that yields an offline approach to the agent decision making at the testing phase. The NE process is applied after the training phase to denoise the memory network so that derived relations are formed in the memory network and retrieved during the testing phase. During the NE phase, indirect relations are enhanced, and the structure of episodic memory changes. This approach can also be interpreted as the agent's replay after the training phase, which is in line with recent findings in behavioral and neuroscience studies. In comparison with EPS, our model is able to model the formation of derived relations and other features such as the nodal effect in a more intrinsic manner. Decision making in the test phase is not an ad hoc computational method, but rather a retrieval and update process of the cached relations from the memory network based on the test trial. In order to study the role of parameters on agent performance, the proposed model is simulated and the results discussed through various experimental settings.

ID CONSENSUS FORMATION; BOUNDED CONFIDENCE
AB Although the idea of introducing heterogeneous confidence levels has been around for some time, its implications for the influence of the confidence thresholds on the consensus formation have not yet been sufficiently elaborated. In this paper, we propose a bounded confidence opinion model with random confidence threshold D associated with potential opinion interaction. Initial opinions are uniformly continuously distributed on the interval [0,1]. Using techniques developed in interacting particle systems, we identify the critical confidence threshold to be E(D) = 1/2 in the sense of almost surely convergence regardless of the distribution of D, if the underlying communication graph is the real line Z. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our results. Noticed are some interesting dependency of the rate of consensus and sharpness of phase transition on the distribution of D. Additionally, numerical experiments show that our obtained results are applicable to Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks, implying a universality of the obtained critical confidence threshold. It is hoped that the results could lead to new insights in understanding the mechanisms and dynamics of those group-level collective behaviors arising from micro-level decision-making patterns.

AB The presented study was planned to determine whether vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) could prevent cytokine haemostatic, haematological, and biochemical disturbances in LPS-treated rats. Adult male Wistar rats (weight range: 200-250 g) were used. The study included four groups: group 1 served as a control group (C); animals in group 2 were given intravenously 1.6 mg/100 g of LPS (E. coli, serotype 0.111:B4); in group 3, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 25 ng/kg of VIP; in group 4, the same doses of VIP and I,PS were injected simultaneously. Blood samples were collected 6 h after treatments. In endotoxaemic rats, platelet count, fibrinogen, and antithrombin levels were decreased, the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were prolonged, and leucopoenia, as well as significant changes in differential leukocyte percentage were demonstrated. In addition, LPS caused statistically significant increases in plasma INF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-10 levels, and AST, ALT, creatinine, cholesterol, triglyceride concentrations. However, it caused a statistically significant decrease in total protein and albumin levels when compared to control group. The results showed that during endotoxaemia, VIP had moderately therapeutic effect as an antiinflammatory agent, suppressing INF-alpha and IL-6, and stimulating IL-10; however, it was not effective against the adverse effect of LPS on investigated haematological and biochemical parameters.

AB Objective: To compare in vitro the influence of 3 cementation techniques on leakage and fracture strength of alumina all-ceramic crowns after cyclic loading in an artificial chewing simulator.
   Method and Materials: Forty-eight extracted molars were mounted in a way that simulates natural tooth mobility. Crowns ( Procera Alumina, Nobel Biocare) were fabricated and inserted with either conventional cementation with zinc phosphate cement without pretreatment (group ZOP); cementation with a universal adhesive resin cement without pretreatment (group HYB); or adhesive bonding with composite resin after pretreatment of the tooth ( dentin bonding agent) and the crown (airborne-particle abrasion and a special ceramic priming agent containing adhesive monomers that bond to metal-oxide ceramics) ( group ADH). All specimens were stored in artificial saliva and subjected to 1.2 million load cycles in a dual-axis chewing simulator (Willytec). Eight specimens per group were subjected to compressive load until failure, while the remaining 8 specimens were stained and sectioned for measuring of dye penetration. One-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD were used for statistical analyses (alpha=.05).
   Results: Cementation techniques were significantly different (P=.009) in regard to mean load at failure. Fracture strength was significantly greater for ADH ( mean load at fracture, 2,782 +/- 419 N) as compared to HYB (1,980 +/- 270 N) or ZOP (1,788 +/- 242 N). All groups differed significantly for leakage values (P <.001), with ADH showing the lowest mean leakage (0.04 +/- 0.07 mm), followed by HYB (0.96 +/- 0.16 mm) and ZOP (2.44 +/- 0.19 mm).
   Conclusion: Cementation technique affects fracture strength and leakage of all-ceramic molar crowns. Fracture strengths were well above natural chewing forces for all cementation methods. However, adhesive bonding significantly increased fracture strength and improved marginal seal of alumina crowns.

AB In this article, a novel guidance law derivation and new synchronization strategy are proposed for a virtual structure-based formation flight. These are designed using both aerodynamic and dynamics equations of aerial robots to facilitate implementation of the guidance and control laws. The guidance commands are derived in the form of acceleration based on a new analytical approach. These acceleration commands are converted to suitable inputs for the control system in the form of velocity, roll and pitch angles by employing an innovative strategy. In addition, a new synchronization strategy for virtual structure formation control is proposed. In this strategy, each agent utilizes the other agents' actual position rather than their position errors. The proposed strategy is capable of shape formation flight using a passive sensor, such as vision sensors, for position detection of neighbour agents. This ability makes the proposed strategy more reliable than conventional synchronization methods. The mentioned strategy is further improved by self-tuning of the synchronization gain based on a fuzzy inference. The simulation of formation flight for a group of three fixed-wing aerial robots using six degrees of freedom models for each one reveals the merits of the proposed strategy. In fact, this approach significantly decreases the number of oscillations and corresponding amplitudes of position/orientation error for each agent. This is a crucial aspect of the mission performance for formation flight control.

To deal with this singular behavior numerically, we propose an agent-based simulation method in which both the organisms and the chemicals are represented as particles. Our numerical estimates for the threshold behavior are consistent with the analytic predictions.

Following recent experiments we use linear, rigid divalent cations of various lengths to induce condensation. Our results clarify and explain the experimental results for short cations. For longer cations we observe novel condensation behavior owing to the alignment of the cations. We also study the role of the polyelectrolyte surface-charge density, and find a nonmonotonic variation in bundle stability. This nonmonotonicity captures two trends that have been observed in separate experiments.

AB The Forest Agent-Based Landowner Economy (FABLE) model simulates a market where private forest landowner agents with heterogeneous preferences cast bids using normative decisionmaking rules. In doing so, the model connects two areas of study important to the forest economics literature: market behavior and behavior of individual forest landowners. The model constructs heterogeneity by separating agents into those who bid based on a valuation of timber and those who bid based on an amenity value. Furthermore, discount rates vary among agents and stand age is drawn from an empirical age class distribution of North Carolina's southern coastal plain. Model outputs include price, removals, average harvest age, and age class structure. A sensitivity analysis on demand curve and amenity value scenarios shows expected economic relationships as exhibited by model outputs and by implicit supply and inventory elasticities. For the majority of scenarios, these elasticity estimates, which are not predetermined but represent an emergent property of the model, are consistent with empirical estimates. Equilibrium dynamics mimic long-wave inventory cycles found historically, rather than simple steady-state solutions.

AB Purpose To evaluate the effect of temporary cement cleaning methods on the retention of cemented crowns using zinc phosphate cement and resin-modified glass ionomer cement. Materials and Methods Forty titanium specimens were fabricated to simulate prepared molars with minimally retentive taper. The Ni-Cr cast crowns were fabricated, temporarily cemented, and separated. The specimens were divided into four groups according to the temporary cement cleaning method (n = 10) as follows: control group (no temporary cementation), orange solvent group, ultrasonic cleaning group, and air-abrasion group. After the cleaning procedures, the specimens were cemented with definitive cements (zinc phosphate cement and resin-modified glass ionomer, RMGI, cement) and subjected to thermocycling (5000 cycles, 5-55 degrees C, dwell time, 10 seconds). The tensile bond strength of each specimen was measured using a universal testing machine, and the results were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U test (alpha = 0.05). Results When cemented with zinc phosphate cement, the statistical analysis showed that the value of the air-abrasion group was significantly higher than those of the other groups (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference among the other groups. When cemented with RMGI cement, the air-abrasion group showed the lowest value, and the control group showed the highest value (p < 0.01). The difference between the ultrasonic cleaning group and the orange solvent group was not statistically significant. Conclusion The use of temporary cement did not have a significant influence on retention of permanently cemented crowns when zinc phosphate cement was used for permanent cementation. Airborne-particle abrasion after provisional cementation improved retention of crowns cemented with zinc phosphate cement; however, the use of temporary cement significantly decreased retention of permanently cemented crowns when RMGI cement was used regardless of the temporary cement cleaning method.

AB Background There is a relative paucity of research that integrates materials science and bioengineering with computational simulations to decipher the intricate processes promoting cancer progression. Therefore, a first-generation computational model, SpheroidSim, was developed that includes a biological data set derived from a bioengineered spheroid model to obtain a quantitative description of cell kinetics. Results SpheroidSim is a 3D agent-based model simulating the growth of multicellular cancer spheroids. Cell cycle time and phases mathematically motivated the population growth. SpheroidSim simulated the growth dynamics of multiple spheroids by individually defining a collection of specific phenotypic traits and characteristics for each cell. Experimental data derived from a hydrogel-based spheroid model were fit to the predictions providing insight into the influence of cell cycle time (CCT) and cell phase fraction (CPF) on the cell population. A comparison of the number of active cells predicted for each analysis showed that the value and method used to define CCT had a greater effect on the predicted cell population than CPF. The model predictions were similar to the experimental results for the number of cells, with the predicted total number of cells varying by 8% and 12%, respectively, compared to the experimental data. Conclusions SpheroidSim is a first step in developing a biologically based predictive tool capable of revealing fundamental elements in cancer cell physiology. This computational model may be applied to study the effect of the microenvironment on spheroid growth and other cancer cell types that demonstrate a similar multicellular clustering behavior as the population develops.

AB Developing novel and more efficient filters for chemical warfare agent (CWA) decomposition remains an important challenge for modern technology due to the continuous threat those weapons present in the event of use. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted attention as potential catalysts for nerve agent decomposition. However, in order to improve their performance under battlefield conditions, it is crucial to understand the influence of ambient contaminants such as carbon dioxide on CWA adsorption and decomposition. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental and computational study on the influence of CO, on the adsorption and decomposition of the CWA simulant dimethyl methyl phosphonate (DMMP) by the Zr-based MOF-808. The study combined in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with variable-temperature infrared spectroscopy (VTIR) and computations. PXRD and experiments with pure CO2 revealed that the MOF framework contracts by 0.2% after CO2 saturation and CO2 adsorbs within the MOF-808 framework via dispersion forces with an enthalpy of adsorption of -32.2 +/- 1.8 kJ/mol. From five DRIFTS experiments conducted in various gas flow regimes we established that CO2 interferes with the decomposition of DMMP due to the formation of carbonate species, while if it is used as a regeneration agent, it accelerates the desorption of DMMP and DMMP decomposition products. In situ PXRD experiments showed that CO2 also limited expansion of the framework due to the formation of carbonate species by 40% in comparison to values in a control experiment with N-2. The main conclusions of the computational study are (a) CO2 reversibly adsorbs onto MOF-808 via both mu(3)-OH groups located within the tetrahedral pores of the MOF and/or to the MOF surface with stabilizing dispersion interactions, (b) the presence of DMMP provides stability to the CO2-(mu(3)-OH) moiety, which hinders the mu(3)-OH transfer to the DMMP molecule required for the nerve-agent decomposition until the carbonyl to carbonate transformation is completed, and (c) CO2 molecules are not sufficient for the regeneration of the MOF when DMMP decomposition products are present but rather there is desorption of bound DMMP.

AB Most construction of artificial, multicomponent structures is based upon an external entity that directs the assembly process, usually following a script/blueprint under centralized control. In contrast, recent research has focused increasingly on an alternative paradigm, inspired largely by the nest building behavior of social insects, in which components "self-assemble" into a given target structure. Adapting such a nature-inspired approach to precisely self-assemble artificial structures (bridge, building, etc.) presents a formidable challenge: one must create a set of local control rules to direct the behavior of the individual components/agents during the self-assembly process. In recent work, we developed a fully automated procedure that generates such rules, allowing a given structure to successfully self-assemble in a simulated environment having constrained, continuous motion; however, the resulting rule sets were typically quite large. In this article, we present a more effective methodology for automatic rule generation, which makes an attempt to parsimoniously capture both the repeating patterns that exist within a structure, and the behaviors necessary for appropriate coordination. We then empirically show that the procedure developed here generates sets of rules that are not only correct, but significantly reduced in size, relative to our earlier approach. Such rule sets allow for simpler agents that are nonetheless still capable of performing complex tasks, and therefore demonstrate the problem-solving potential of self-organized systems.

AB Statement of problem. Different cleaning methods are recommended to remove residual fit-indicating materials before definitive cementation. There is little information in the dental literature regarding the effect of these cleaning methods on the eventual retention of crowns.
   Purpose. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the effect of various cleaning methods on the retention of simulated crowns after using disclosing wax and silicone as fit-indicating materials.
   Material and methods. One hundred and ten specimens were divided into 11 groups (n = 10) according to the fit indicators used (silicone and disclosing wax) and the methods of cleaning as follows: Group C, no fit indicator with airborne-particle abrasion and steam cleaning (control); Group S+O, silicone with no cleaning; Group S+CH, silicone with chemical cleaning; Group S+ST, silicone with steam cleaning; Group S+US, silicone with ultrasonic cleaning in distilled water; Group S+AA+ST, silicone with airborne-particle abrasion and steam cleaning; Group W+O, disclosing wax with no cleaning; Group W+CH, disclosing wax with chemical cleaning; Group W+ST, disclosing wax with steam cleaning; Group W+US, disclosing wax with ultrasonic cleaning in distilled water; Group W+AA+ST, disclosing wax with airborne-particle abrasion and steam cleaning. Solid acrylic resin blocks were machined to form the specimens. Each specimen consisted of a cylinder and a rod. The specimens were invested and cast using a nickel chromium alloy. The rod and the internal surface of the cylindrical part of each specimen were airborne-particle abraded using 100-mu m aluminum oxide powder. After application of fit indicators and subsequent cleaning, all the rods were cemented into their perspective cylinders using zinc phosphate cement at a constant load of 5 kg for 10 minutes. Specimens were randomly assigned to all groups before cementation procedures. The sequence of cementation of all specimens was also performed randomly regardless of the groups to which they were assigned. The specimens were then stored in water at 37 degrees C for 1 month. All specimens were mounted in a universal testing machine and the rods were then pulled out of their respective cylinders at a crosshead speed of 0.05 mm/min. The ultimate load required for separation was recorded and expressed as MPa. The resultant data were statistically analyzed using 2-way ANOVA for fit-indicating materials/cleaning methods, and Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) tests (alpha = .05).
   Results. Two-way ANOVA showed significant interaction between the effects of fit-indicating materials tested and the method of cleaning on retention (P<.001). The Tukey HSD test indicated that wax and silicone fit indicators significantly reduced retention if not properly cleaned (P<.001). Retention was significantly improved when wax was used compared to silicone, regardless of the cleaning method (P<.001). Airborne-particle abrasion coupled with steam cleaning produced the highest retention values with both fit indicators tested (P<.001). However, when wax was used there was no significant difference between steam cleaning and airborne-particle abrasion along with steam cleaning.
   Conclusions. Wax and silicone fit indicators significantly reduced retention of simulated crowns if not properly cleaned. Airborne-particle abrasion, in addition to steam cleaning, was necessary to clean silicone. However, steam cleaning alone was sufficient for cleaning wax.

AB There is still controversy regarding many of the problems that pertain to aggressive behavior. One of these issues is the classification of aggressive behavior. In our opinion, intraspecies intermale aggression can be classified as follows: (1) Stress- and fear-induced reactive defensive aggression; (2) Frustration-induced offensive aggression accompanied by anger; (3) Instrumental type of offensive aggression. (4) Aggression linked to pleasure. A number of problems related to the neuro- and biochemistry of aggression are also controversial. Many chemical agents participate in the induction of aggressive behavior. It is important to identify which agents take part in the realization of aggressive behavior in situ. Therefore, it is necessary to identify substances that simulate aggression which elicits adaptive responses to threatening stimuli in the environment. We hypothesize that the most suitable inducer of aggressive behavior must fulfill the following criteria: (i) when released in the organism or injected in physiological doses, it elicits/amplifies aggressive behavior; (ii) its synthesis and release increases during stress and agonistic encounters; (iii) its basal concentration in dominants is higher in brain structures responsible for aggressive behavior. Only norepinephrine fits all of the mentioned criteria. It stimulates an aggressive response and is produced actively when aggressive behavior is necessary for adaptation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB There have been many techniques developed in recent years to in silico model a variety of cancer behaviors. Agent-based modeling is a specific discrete-based hybrid modeling approach that allows simulating the role of diversity in cell populations as well as within each individual cell; it has therefore become a powerful modeling method widely used by computational cancer researchers. Many aspects of tumor morphology including phenotype-changing mutations, the adaptation to microenvironment, the process of angiogenesis, the influence of extracellular matrix, reactions to chemotherapy or surgical intervention, the effects of oxygen and nutrient availability, and metastasis and invasion of healthy tissues have been incorporated and investigated in agent-based models. In this review, we introduce some of the most recent agent-based models that have provided insight into the understanding of cancer growth and invasion, spanning multiple biological scales in time and space, and we further describe several experimentally testable hypotheses generated by those models. We also discuss some of the current challenges of multiscale agent-based cancer models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model aiming to shed light on the potential destabilizing effects of bank behavior. Our work takes its motivation from the effects of the financial crisis which erupted in 2007 in the US. It draws on the Financial Instability Hypothesis by Hyman P. Minsky, and on the Agent Based macro modeling literature (Delli Gatti et al. 2010, Riccetti et. al 2013) to model a simplified economy in which heterogeneous banks and firms interact on game theoretic rules. Simulation results suggest that aggregate financial instability may emerge as the outcome of banks' attempt to increase their profit or market share through their pricing strategies. A further finding from the model is the need for banks to take into account time consistency when issuing credit in order to protect the financial stability of the system.

AB To reduce overpopulation around Seoul, Korea, the government implemented a relocation policy of public officers by moving the government complex. This implies that there will be a negative impact on the suburban area that originally hosted the complex, but we do not know the magnitude of the impact. Therefore, this paper presents a micro-level estimation of the impact on the city commerce with an agent-based model. This model is calibrated by the micro-level population census data, the time-use data, and the geographic data. Agent behavior is formally specified to illustrate the daily activities of diverse population types, and particularly the model observes how many agents pass by commercial buildings of interest. With the described model, we performed a virtual experiment that examines the strengths of factors in negatively influencing the city commerce. After the experiment, we statistically validated the model with the survey data from the real world, which resulted in relatively high correlation between the real world and the simulations.

AB Four lipophilic 1,10-phenanthroline di(thio) amide, diester or diketone derivatives were studied as ligands for Am(III)/Eu(III) separation from acidic media. The synthesis of these compounds is reported together with the extraction tests in different solvents (kerosene, octanol and o-nitrophenyl hexyl ether), HNO3 concentrations and ratios between the ligand and the synergistic agent (Br-Cosan). The promising results obtained from the large number of solvent extraction tests carried out show that it might be possible to apply this class of ligands to advanced reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel. The experimental data indicate that, under the conditions that simulate the real radioactive waste, the extraction efficiency and Am/Eu separation factors are particularly high, thus suggesting that the combination of soft heterocyclic N-donor atoms and hard carbonyl groups of ester and amides affords a tetradentate donor set of atoms (ONNO) that gives rise to remarkable selectivities. ESI-MS studies and DFT calculations shed light on the possible structure of the Eu3+ complexes indicating that the 1:1:2 (cation:ligand:anion) complex is slightly more stable than the 1:2:1 species.

AB Recent empirical results have cast doubt on the value of Microfinance as a tool for reducing poverty. But, the difficulty lies in evaluating the impact of Microfinance in a world where the Microfinance institutions, their borrowers, and government policies are constantly changing. There is a need for a comprehensive and transparent framework to develop the theoretical grounds for believing in (or against) the efficacy of Microfinance, which can at the same time be used as a testing ground for policymakers. This paper presents a first attempt to develop an agent-based modeling (ABM) framework for pre-policy-implementation testing of the effects of Microfinance. Under the ABM paradigm, a set of behaviors for individual agents in the economy is used to construct a simulation whereby random interaction allows agents to change their state over time. Simulation of the model in different scenarios supported all our intuitions about Microfinance; in particular, there was positive impact of Microfinance on the wealth level of the poor. It was found that increase of available funds, easy access for producers and lower interest rates increase the effectiveness of Microfinance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aqueous foam is widely used in fire extinguishing and dust suppression technologies. Improving the foaming ability is the key to reducing the added concentration of foaming agents as well as the economic cost. In this work, the effect of a water-soluble polymer (polyvinyl alcohol, PVA) on the foaming ability of anionic surfactant (sodium dodecyl ether sulfate, SDES) was studied by an experiment and molecular dynamics simulation. The experimental results showed that PVA greatly improves the foaming ability of SDES solutions when the surfactant concentration is less than 0.1%, which is attributed to the fact that the polymer can enhance the stability of bubble films and reduce the bubble rupture rate during the foam generation process. The simulation results indicate that PVA can enhance the hydration of surfactant head groups and contribute to the formation of a three-dimensional hydrogen bond network between surfactants, polymers, and water molecules, thus greatly improving the stability of bubble liquid films. The above results suggest that water-soluble polymers can be used to improve the foaming ability of surfactant solutions by enhancing the bubble film stability, which is beneficial as it reduces the added concentration of foaming agents in aqueous foam applications.

AB As HIV incidence among people who inject drugs grows in the context of an escalating drug overdose epidemic in North America, investigating how network structure may affect vulnerability to rapid HIV transmission is necessary for preventing outbreaks. We compared the characteristics of the observed contact tracing network from the 2015 outbreak in rural Indiana with 1000 networks generated by an agent-based network model with approximately the same number of individuals (n = 420) and ties between them (n = 913). We introduced an initial HIV infection into the simulated networks and compared the subsequent epidemic behavior (e.g., cumulative HIV infections over 5 years). The model was able to produce networks with largely comparable characteristics and total numbers of incident HIV infections. Although the model was unable to produce networks with comparable cohesiveness (where the observed network had a transitivity value 35.7 standard deviations from the mean of the simulated networks), the structural variability of the simulated networks allowed for investigation into their potential facilitation of HIV transmission. These findings emphasize the need for continued development of injection network simulation studies in tandem with empirical data collection to further investigate how network characteristics played a role in this and future outbreaks.

AB This article analyses the issues pertaining to the simulation of joint attention with virtual humans. Gaze represents a powerful communication channel illustrated by the pivotal role of joint attention in social interactions. To our knowledge, there have been only few attempts to simulate gazing patterns associated with joint attention as a mean for developing empathic virtual agents. Eye-tracking technologies now enable creating non-invasive gaze-contingent systems that empower the user with the ability to lead a virtual human's focus of attention in real-time. Although gaze control can be deliberate, most of our visual behaviors in everyday life are not. This article reports empirical data suggesting that users only have partial awareness of controlling gaze-contingent displays. The technical challenges induced by detecting the user's focus of attention in virtual reality are reviewed and several solutions are compared. We designed and tested a platform for creating virtual humans endowed with the ability to follow the user's attention. The article discusses the advantages of simulating joint attention for improving interpersonal skills and user engagement. Joint attention plays a major role in the development of autism. The platform we designed is intended for research and treatment of autism and tests included participants with this disorder.

AB Technology innovations create possibilities to capture exposure-related data at a great depth and breadth. Considering, though, the substantial hurdles involved in collecting individual data for whole populations, this study introduces a first approach of simulating human movement and interaction behaviour, using Agent Based Modelling (ABM).
   A city scale ABM was developed for urban Thessaloniki, Greece that feeds into population-based exposure assessment without imposing prior bias, basing its estimations onto emerging properties of the behaviour of the computerised autonomous decision makers (agents) that compose the city-system. Population statistics, road and buildings networks data were transformed into human, road and building agents, respectively. Survey outputs with time-use patterns were associated with human agent rules, aiming to model representative to real-world behaviours. Moreover, time-geography of exposure data, derived from a local sensors campaign, was used to inform and enhance the model. As a prevalence of an agent-specific decision-making, virtual individuals of different sociodemographic backgrounds express different spatiotemporal behaviours and their trajectories are coupled with spatially resolved pollution levels.
   Personal exposure was evaluated by assigning PM concentrations to human agents based on coordinates, type of location and intensity of encountered activities. Study results indicated that PM2.5 inhalation adjusted exposure between housemates can differ by 56.5% whereas exposure between two neighbours can vary by as much as 87%, due to the prevalence of different behaviours.
   This study provides details of a new methodology that permits the cost-effective construction of refined time activity diaries and daily exposure profiles, taking into account different microenvironments and sociodemographic characteristics. The proposed method leads to a refined exposure assessment model, addressing effectively vulnerable subgroups of population. It can be used for evaluating the probable impacts of different public health policies prior to implementation reducing, therefore, the time and expense required to identify efficient measures.

AB Two different organic cations (structure directing agents, SDAs) have been selected because of their ability to drive the synthesis of zeolites towards the same microporous material, RUB-13 (RTH), both being organophosphorous compounds. These P containing structure directing agents are characterized by a high concentration of positive charge on the phosphorus atom. Then, in the presence of fluoride anions used in these syntheses, a strong P+ center dot center dot center dot F- electrostatic contribution competes with the van der Waals short range SDA . . . zeolite interaction that drives the zeolite formation. The rotation of the methyl groups present in the SDA is expected to be nearly free if van der Waals interactions dominate, but they will be hindered if the Coulombic P+ center dot center dot center dot F- term forces a closer approach to the SDA towards the zeolite framework. SDAs can be designed a priori to tune which interactions dominate. The rotational mobility of the SDAs, as well as certain related bending modes, has been well tackled by inelastic neutron scattering (INS) in order to test this hypothesis. The INS results provide valuable information for the design of specific SDAs for the synthesis of zeolites.

AB Based on a regular lattice, we present an evolving Stag-Hunt game model to illustrate the persistence of cooperation in many real-world systems. In our model, starting from a regular lattice, at first agents play the Stag-Hunt game with each other and perform the strategy update same as the traditional game dynamics on graphs; After that, each player tries to cut off the link with the defective neighbor with the highest fitness and build a new link preferentially connected to a high-degree node; If an isolated node is eliminated from the system, a new player will be reproduced and inserted into the system so as to keep the system size constant. Large-scale numerical simulations indicate that the cooperation level can be greatly promoted compared to the standard stag-hunt game behaviors on regular lattices, and the link rewiring and node's elimination and reproduction represent the co-evolution between the structure and game dynamics, which facilitates the cooperative clusters among nodes. Our model can, to some extent, characterize the realistic cases in which an individual often tries to avoid the future contact with a defective partner. Current findings are beneficial to help us to deeply understand the evolution of cooperation within many natural, social and economic systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Evolution has endowed animals with outstanding adaptive behaviours which are grounded in the organization of their sensorimotor system. This paper uses inspiration from these principles of organization in the design of an artificial agent for autonomous driving. After distilling the relevant principles from biology, their functional role in the implementation of an artificial system are explained. The resulting Agent, developed in an EU H2020 Research and Innovation Action, is used to concretely demonstrate the emergence of adaptive behaviour with a significant level of autonomy. Guidelines to adapt the same principled organization of the sensorimotor system to other agents for driving are also obtained. The demonstration of the system abilities is given with example scenarios and open access simulation tools. Prospective developments concerning learning via mental imagery are finally discussed.

AB This article explores the assumption that a deeper (quantitative) understanding of the information-theoretic implications of sensory-motor coordination can help endow robots not only with better sensory morphologies, but also with better exploration strategies. Specifically, we investigate by means of statistical and information-theoretic measures to what extent sensory-motor coordinated activity can generate and structure information in the sensory channels of a simulated agent interacting with its surrounding environment. The results show how the usage of correlation, entropy, and mutual information can be employed (a) to segment an observed behavior into distinct behavioral states; (b) to analyze the informational relationship between the different components of the sensory-motor apparatus; and (c) to identify patterns (or fingerprints) in the sensory-motor interaction between the agent and its local environment.

SO BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS

AB In this work the properties of minority games containing agents which try to winning all the time are studied by means of computational simulations. We have considered several ways of introducing above the rules clever players using "strategies" which try to outdo the others endowed with statistically equivalent strategies and compared the resulting behaviors of the ensemble. It is shown that by introducing such agents the overall performance of the system gets significantly poorer. While the introduction of a very small fraction of these never-loosing-players may not destroys the unordered/ordered phase transition of the standard minority game we find that even for a low concentration of their presence only a state "worse" than random coin toss choices sets in. These special agents/players have the role of impurities or vacancies in spin systems and their presence may lead to a critical concentration where the usual phases are washed out.

AB Context: Tilorone dihydrochloride is a therapeutic agent with a different mechanism in cancer. The species of Lactobacillus have an important role in cytotoxic effect.
   Aims: Because of unknown effects of tilorone and culture supernatants from Lactobacillus reuteri on hepatoma, the aim of this study is to evaluate apoptotic, cytotoxic, and therapeutic effects of tilorone on mouse hepatoma cell line with and without culture supernatants from L. reuteri.
   Materials and Methods: To do so, after cell line culture, cells were divided into different groups such as negative control, treatment with four doses of tilorone, positive control of supernatant (single dose), and combination therapy groups of different doses of tilorone with supernatant (constant doses), for 48 h. All groups were studied with pathologic tests, biochemical study, tetrazolium dye (3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide [MTT]) assay, and absolute real-time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were done to assess Bax and Bcl-2 genes expression, as molecular studies.
   Results: MTT assay results revealed that the tilorone tissue culture IC50 (TCIC50) on the Hepa1-6 cell line was 50 mu g/ml. RT-PCR analysis showed that tilorone dihydrochloride induced upregulation and downregulation in expression of Bax and Bcl-2, respectively. Simultaneous, antioxidant effect has also seen in a way that prevented necrosis, in biochemical analysis. These results were dose dependent and statistically significant compared to the control group.
   Conclusions: Based on these results, it appeared that this agent could be a good candidate for further evaluation as effective chemotherapy acting through the induction of apoptosis in hepatoma. The cell death caused through bacterial supernatant was rather necrosis than apoptosis.

AB In this study, the consequence of cell-size, cell-wall-thickness and cell circularity together on the compressive performance of closed-cell aluminum foam was analyzed experimentally and with FEM simultaneously. The closed-cell metal foams (CAFs) with varying cell sizes of 55% porosity were synthesized through stir casting technique. The granular metallic calcium is used as a stabilizing/thickening agent, and TiH2 powder used as a foaming agent. The uniaxial compression tests were performed to investigate the compressive deformation behavior of CAFs. The simulation studies were carried out by taking the assumption similar to experimental constraints. The circular-shaped cells were created in FE half symmetrical model of varying cell sizes (in 2-Dimensional). The cell sizes used in FE models are 1.5 mm, 2.5 mm, 2.8 mm and of 3.5 mm. While in experimental samples, different cell sizes obtained are 1.65 mm, 2.47 mm, 2.88 mm and 3.59 mm. In both of the investigations, it is observed that the energy absorption capacity and plateau strength decrease with an increase in cell sizes or vice versa. A similar effect was also observed with an increase in cell wall thickness. The obtained FE results are acceptable and comparable with the experimental for each cell size model. The deformation mechanism was analyzed using deformed sample images, which were captured during the deformation as well as during the different stages in the FEA models.

AB Social insects exhibit coordinated behaviour without central control. Local interactions among individuals determine their behaviour and regulate the activity of the colony. Harvester ants are recruited for outside work, using networks of brief antennal contacts, in the nest chamber closest to the nest exit: the entrance chamber. Here, we combine empirical observations, image analysis and computer simulations to investigate the structure and function of the interaction network in the entrance chamber. Ant interactions were distributed heterogeneously in the chamber, with an interaction hot-spot at the entrance leading further into the nest. The distribution of the total interactions per ant followed a right-skewed distribution, indicating the presence of highly connected individuals. Numbers of ant encounters observed positively correlated with the duration of observation. Individuals varied in interaction frequency, even after accounting for the duration of observation. An ant's interaction frequency was explained by its path shape and location within the entrance chamber. Computer simulations demonstrate that variation among individuals in connectivity accelerates information flow to an extent equivalent to an increase in the total number of interactions. Individual variation in connectivity, arising from variation among ants in location and spatial behaviour, creates interaction centres, which may expedite information flow.
