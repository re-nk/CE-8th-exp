TI Internal-external stimulus competition in a system of interacting moving
   particles: Persuasion versus propaganda
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID STATISTICAL-MECHANICS; OPINION; DYNAMICS
AB We propose a general nonlinear analytical framework to study the effect of an external stimulus in the internal state of a population of moving particles. This novel scheme allows us to study a broad range of excitation transport phenomena. In particular, considering social systems, it gives insight of the spatial dynamics influence in the competition between propaganda (mass media) and convincement. By extending the framework presented by Terranova et al. [Europhys. Lett. 105, 30007 (2014)], we now allow changes in individual's opinions due to a reflection induced by mass media. The equations of the model could be solved numerically, and, for some special cases, it is possible to derive analytical solutions for the steady states. We implement computational simulations for different social and dynamical systems to check the accuracy of our scheme and to study a broader variety of scenarios. In particular, we compare the numerical outcome with the analytical results for two possible real cases, finding a good agreement. From the results, we observe that mass media dominates the opinion state in slow dynamics communities; whereas, for higher agent active speeds, the rate of interactions increases and the opinion state is determined by a competition between propaganda and persuasion. This difference suggests that kinetics can not be neglected in the study of transport of any excitation over a particle system.

AB This work aims to shed light on the mechanism of interaction between components of ternary DNA-PEI-Fe(III) complexes, using experimental and theoretical approaches. In the experimental part, the chelation between PEI-Fe(III) was inspected by potentiometry and electrical conductance measurements and the respective importance for the condensation of DNA analyzed. To this end, three different mixing protocols for the components were imposed using different PEIs, branched (bPEI1.2 and bPEI10) and linear (IPEI2.5 and IPEI25). A delay in DNA condensation was observed when PEI and Fe(III) were premixed and then added to DNA. The set of observations was complemented by determination of the amount of Fe(III) included in the polyplexes, which was found to be dependent on the order of mixture and on the type of PEI used, decreasing with intrinsic PEI condensation efficiency. Overall, a coherent picture in which Fe(III) compensates PEI, probably modulating the respective charge, emerges. Some points arisen from the experimental part were rationalized using Monte Carlo simulations. Different architectured polycation (PC) chains were modeled and an interaction between PC and multivalent ions, mimicking the chelation of Fe(III) by the PEI, was imposed. It was found that chelation enhances,polyanion (PA) compaction, irrespective of the PC architecture and charge density. The amount of multivalent ions in each polyplex compensates the negative charge unbalanced by the PC. The charge density and the ability of chelation of each PC dictate the disposition of each condensing agent along the PA backbone, and their coexistence strengthens PA compaction. The deep understanding of these ternary mixtures is a step forward in the optimization of such systems for application in gene delivery.

AB The successful RAFT-mediated ab initio emulsion copolymerization of acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene using 2-(((dodecylsulfanyl)carbonothioyl)sulfanyl)propanoic acid (DoPAT) is reported at 45-55 degrees C. The number-average molecular weight exhibits a linear evolution as a function of monomer conversion (5000 <= M-n (g mol(-1)) <= 41000, 1.3 <= D (-) <= 3.3). Relatively good control (e.g., D approximate to 1.2 for selected conditions) over the polymerization up to moderate monomer conversion (50-60%) was attained when the employed initial molar ratio of RAFT agent to initiator was 2.5 or higher. Good omega-end-group functionality is evidenced by chain extension of NBR with a polystyrene block, with both H-1 NMR and SEC showing the average fraction of the NBR block as ca. 75 mol%. A kinetic model implemented via the PREDICI software package confirms the experimental findings, including a semiempirical approach to account for branch formation. The onset of the loss in control over the copolymerization at conversions >40% was tentatively attributed to branch formation. The current study evidences that RAFT mediated ab initio emulsion polymerization of 1,3-butadiene and acrylonitrile is a viable polymerization protocol for the synthesis of well-defined next generation nitrile-butadiene rubbers including in industrial context.

ID KINEMATICS; COGNITION; GOAL; MOVEMENTS; CODES
AB Humans excel at recognizing (or inferring) another's distal intentions, and recent experiments suggest that this may be possible using only subtle kinematic cues elicited during early phases of movement. Still, the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying the recognition of intentional (sequential) actions are incompletely known and it is unclear whether kinematic cues alone are sufficient for this task, or if it instead requires additional mechanisms (e.g., prior information) that may be more difficult to fully characterize in empirical studies. Here we present a computationally-guided analysis of the execution and recognition of intentional actions that is rooted in theories of motor control and the coarticulation of sequential actions. In our simulations, when a performer agent coarticulates two successive actions in an action sequence (e.g., "reach-to-grasp" a bottle and "grasp-to-pour"), he automatically produces kinematic cues that an observer agent can reliably use to recognize the performer's intention early on, during the execution of the first part of the sequence. This analysis lends computational-level support for the idea that kinematic cues may be sufficiently informative for early intention recognition. Furthermore, it suggests that the social benefits of coarticulation may be a byproduct of a fundamental imperative to optimize sequential actions. Finally, we discuss possible ways a performer agent may combine automatic (coarticulation) and strategic (signaling) ways to facilitate, or hinder, an observer's action recognition processes.

DT Article
ID MARKOV POPULATION PROCESSES; MODELS; LIMITS
AB This article presents the first models developed specifically for understanding the infiltration and interdiction of ongoing terror plots by undercover intelligence agents, and does so via novel application of ideas from queueing theory and Markov population processes. The resulting "terror queue" models predict the number of undetected terror threats in an area from agent activity/utilization data, and also estimate the rate with which such threats can be detected and interdicted. The models treat terror plots as customers and intelligence agents as servers. Agents spend all of their time either detecting and infiltrating new terror plots (in which case they are "available"), or interdicting already detected terror plots (in which case they are "busy"). Initially we examine a Markov model assuming that intelligence agents, while unable to detect all plots, never err by falsely detecting fake plots. While this model can be solved numerically, a simpler Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion approximation yields some results in closed form while providing nearly identical numerical performance. The transient behavior of the terror queue model is discussed briefly along with a sample sensitivity analysis to study how model predictions compare to simulated results when using estimated versus known terror plot arrival rates. The diffusion model is then extended to allow for the false detection of fake plots. Such false detection is a real feature of counterterror intelligence given that intelligence agents or informants can make mistakes, as well as the proclivity of terrorists to deliberately broadcast false information. The false detection model is illustrated using suicide bombing data from Israel.

AB Herein we report the synthesis of ternary statistical methacrylate copolymers comprising cationic ammonium (amino-ethyl methacrylate: AEMA), carboxylic acid (propanoic acid methacrylate: PAMA) and hydrophobic (ethyl methacrylate: EMA) side chain monomers, to study the functional role of anionic groups on their antimicrobial and hemolytic activities as well as the conformation of polymer chains. The hydrophobic monomer EMA was maintained at 40 mol% in all the polymers, with different percentages of cationic ammonium (AEMA) and anionic carboxylate (PAMA) side chains, resulting in different total net charge for the polymers. The antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the copolymer were determined by the net charge of +3 or larger, suggesting that there was no distinct effect of the anionic carboxylate groups on the antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the copolymers. However, the pH titration and atomic molecular dynamics simulations suggest that anionic groups may play a strong role in controlling the polymer conformation. This was achieved via formation of salt bridges between cationic and anionic groups, transiently crosslinking the polymer chain allowing dynamic switching between compact and extended conformations. These results suggest that inclusion of functional groups in general, other than the canonical hydrophobic and cationic groups in antimicrobial agents, may have broader implications in acquiring functional structures required for adequate antimicrobial activity. In order to explain the implications, we propose a molecular model in which formation of intra-chain, transient salt bridges, due to the presence of both anionic and cationic groups along the polymer, may function as "adhesives" which facilitate compact packing of the polymer chain to enable functional group interaction but without rigidly locking down the overall polymer structure, which may adversely affect their functional roles.

AB Using a new agent-based model that mimics the learning process in hand-reaching behavior of individual mice, we show that mouse hand preference is probabilistic, dependent on the environment and prior learning. We quantify the learning capabilities of three inbred strains and show that population distributions of hand preference emerge from the properties of individual mice. The model informs our understanding of gene-environment interactions because it accommodates genotypic differences in learning and memory abilities, and environmental biases. We tuned each strain's model to match their experimental hand-preference distributions in unbiased worlds and, by comparing simulations and experiments, identified and quantified a constitutive left-bias in hand preference of one strain. The models, tuned for unbiased worlds, match experimental measures in left-and right-biased worlds and in biased worlds after previous training. New measures quantitatively assess this matching, revealing that two strains, previously considered non-learners of hand preference, actually have significant learning ability and we confirm this with new experiments. Model mice match the kinetics of hand-preference learning of one strain and predict the limits of learning. We conclude that genetically evolved hand-preference behavior in mice is inherently probabilistic to provide robustness and allow constant adaptability to ever-changing environments.

AB We report the application of agent-based modeling to examine the signal transduction network and receptor arrays for chemotaxis in Escherichia coli, which are responsible for regulating swimming behavior in response to environmental stimuli. Agent-based modeling is a stochastic and bottom-up approach, where individual components of the modeled system are explicitly represented, and bulk properties emerge from their movement and interactions. We present the Chemoscape model: a collection of agents representing both fixed membrane-embedded and mobile cytoplasmic proteins, each governed by a set of rules representing knowledge or hypotheses about their function. When the agents were placed in a simulated cellular space and then allowed to move and interact stochastically, the model exhibited many properties similar to the biological system including adaptation, high signal gain, and wide dynamic range. We found the agent based modeling approach to be both powerful and intuitive for testing hypotheses about biological properties such as self-assembly, the non-linear dynamics that occur through cooperative protein interactions, and non-uniform distributions of proteins in the cell. We applied the model to explore the role of receptor type, geometry and cooperativity in the signal gain and dynamic range of the chemotactic response to environmental stimuli. The model provided substantial qualitative evidence that the dynamic range of chemotactic response can be traced to both the heterogeneity of receptor types present, and the modulation of their cooperativity by their methylation state.

TI Land-Use Changes in Distant Places: Implementation of a Telecoupled

AB International agricultural trade has changed land uses in trading countries, altering global food security and environmental sustainability. Studies have concluded that local land-use drivers are largely from global sources (e.g., trade increases deforestation in exporting countries). However, little is known about how these local land-use changes affect distant locations, namely the feedback between them. Yet these distant impacts and feedbacks can be significant for governing local land systems. The framework of telecoupling (i.e., socioeconomic-environmental interactions between distant places) has been shown to be an effective conceptual tool to study international trade and the associated socio-economic and environmental impacts. However, a systems simulation tool to quantify the telecoupled causes and effects is still lacking. Here, we construct a new type of agent-based model (ABM) that can simulate land-use changes at multiple distant places (namely TeIeABM, telecoupled agent-based model). We use soybean trade between Brazil and China as an example, where Brazil is the sending system and China is the receiving system because they are the world's largest soybean exporter and importer respectively. We select one representative county in each country to calibrate and validate the model with spatio-temporal analysis of historical land-use changes and the empirical analysis of household survey data. We describe the model following the ODD+D protocol, and validate the model results in each location respectively. We then illustrate how the aggregated farmer agents' land-use behaviors in the sending system result in land-use changes in the receiving system, and vice versa. One scenario example (i.e., a high-tariff scenario) is given to demonstrate the results of TeIeABM. Such a model allows us to advance the understanding of telecoupling features and the influence on land system science, and to test hypotheses about complex coupled human-natural systems (e.g., cascading effect).

AB Aim
   To investigate the effect of taxifolin on cisplatin-induced oxidative and proinflammatory optic nerve damage in rats.
   Methods
   A total of 18 albino Wistar male rats were assigned into 3 groups, as follows; Group 1: Control group, Group 2: Only cisplatin administered group for 14 days (Cisplatin group), and Group 3: Taxifolin + cisplatin administered group for 14 days (CIS + TAX group). Serum malondialdehyde (MDA), total Glutathione (tGSH), Nuclear Factor-Kappa B (NF-kappa B), Total Oxidative Status (TOS) and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) levels were collected from the left eyes of rats. Rats' right eyes were enucleated for histopathological evaluations of optic nerves.
   Results
   NF-kappa B, MDA and TOS levels were statistically significantly higher (p < 0.001) in cisplatin group when compared to other 2 groups, the tGSH and TAS levels of which were statistically significantly lower (p < 0.001). Regarding these parameters, in cisplatin group NF-kappa B, MDA and TOS levels were statistically significantly increased with cisplatin administration and giving taxifolin concomitantly with cisplatin prevented this elevation. On the other hand, tGSH and TAS levels were statistically significantly decreased with cisplatin administration and routine simultaneous application of taxifolin with cisplatin prevented this decrease. In histopathological findings, haemorrhage was observed in the perineum of the injured optic nerves in the cisplatin treated group. And also edoema and degeneration in nerve fascicles in damaged optic nerves were seen in the cisplatin group. In the taxifolin treated group histopathological examinations were close to normal appearance, except mild edoema in nerve fascicles.
   Conclusion
   Cisplatin causes oxidative stress on the rat optic nerves, and these changes lead to significant histopathological damage. Taxifolin, which we used to prevent oxidative damage to the optic nerves caused by cisplatin, has been emphasized as a powerful antioxidant agent in many previous scientific investigations. Concomitant administration of taxifolin may prevent these adverse effects of cisplatin, as well as histopathological damage. Further studies are needed to fully determine the effects of cisplatin and taxifolin on the eye.

AB The use of microcapsule-enabled self-healing cementitious composite has high potential as a new repair method for the cracked concrete. It will evidently provide extended lifetime and security while reducing the maintenance costs and rates of occurrences of system failures by incorporating self-healing agents in microcapsules. Based on experimental observation and Taylor's model, a two-dimensional micromechanical damage-healing model of microcapsule-enabled self-healing cementitious materials under compressive loading has been proposed. The proposed model can predict the healing effect on microcrack-induced damage quantitatively under compressive loading. The kinetic equations of damage-healing evolution and the formulations of compliance after healing are developed. Subsequently, the proposed model is validated by experimental data. Different system parameters of microcapsule-enabled self-healing concretes, such as the fracture toughness of healing agents, the degree of initial damage, the volume fraction and radius of microcapsules, are investigated. In particular, the proposed micromechanical damage-healing model demonstrates the potential capability to explain and simulate the physical behavior of microcapsule-enabled self-healing materials under compressive loading on the mesoscale.

AB Hydrogen in spite of having a chain transfer agent role is one of the most important factors which directly affecting on kinetic of propylene polymerization. Hydrogen causes to dramatically increase the percentage of activated sites in proportion to being total potential sites on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, the chain transfer agent role of hydrogen gives rise to changing some vital indices of final product properties. This study has attempted to present a validated mathematical model that able to predicting profile polymerization rate and also calculating some of the vital indices of the final product, properties to be derived from kinetic equations. Furthermore, in this paper, we present a developed model that calculates fraction activated sites catalyst via hydrogen concentration based on dormant site theory and determining the best process condition. The modeling approach is based on the polymer moment balance method, i.e. population balance technique and validated by experimental works. The main aim of this study is assigned to investigate the behavior change of polymerization rate to hydrogen. The experimental data and model outputs were compared and concluded that the global errors were in the acceptable range.

AB Calcein leakage assays are a standard experimental set-up for probing the extent of damage induced by external agents on synthetic lipid vesicles. The fluorescence signal associated with calcein release from liposomes is the signature of vesicle disruption, transient pore formation or vesicle fusion. This type of assay is widely used to test the membrane disruptive effect of biological macromolecules, such as proteins, antimicrobial peptides and RNA and is also used on synthetic nanoparticles with a polymer, metal or oxide core. Little is known about the effect that calcein and other fluorescent dyes may have on the properties of lipid bilayers, potentially altering their structure and permeability. Here we develop a coarse-grained model of calcein that is compatible with the Martini force field for lipids. We validate the model by comparing its dimerization free energy, aggregation behavior at different concentrations and interaction with a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) membrane to those obtained at atomistic resolution. Our coarse-grained description of calcein makes it suitable for the simulation of large calcein-filled liposomes and of their interactions with external agents, allowing for a direct comparison between simulations and experimental liposome leakage assays.

AB This paper introduces a generic mass Disaster Modeling Framework (DMF) to support integrated sociophysical risk assessment and management of disasters. The DMF draws on the principles that disasters have many common features regardless of their instigating hazards and are the outcome of interaction between a hazard and society. The modular architecture of the DMF weakly couples three key applications: the Community Simulation Model (CSM), the Hazard Simulation Model (HSM), and the Evacuation Simulation Model (ESM). The CSM utilizes census, cadastral, and other data to construct an individual-based representation of the potentially impacted community. The CSM estimates people and built environment at risk at any given time of the day, week, and year. The CSM assessment along with the hazard simulation of the HSM feed into the ESM to simulate the progression of fatalities throughout the event. Dam failures, for which vivid and detailed accounts of human interaction with the incoming flood exist, served as case studies. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000033.

   PREDICTION
AB Bacterial biofilm formation is an organized collective response to biochemical cues that enables bacterial colonies to persist and withstand environmental insults. We developed a multiscale agent-based model that characterizes the intracellular, extracellular, and cellular scale interactions that modulate Escherichia coli MG1655 biofilm formation. Each bacterium's intracellular response and cellular state were represented as an outcome of interactions with the environment and neighboring bacteria. In the intracellular model, environment-driven gene expression and metabolism were captured using statistical regression and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, respectively. In the cellular model, growth, death, and type IV pili- and flagella-dependent movement were based on the bacteria's intracellular state. We implemented the extracellular model as a three-dimensional diffusion model used to describe glucose, oxygen, and autoinducer 2 gradients within the biofilm and bulk fluid. We validated the model by comparing simulation results to empirical quantitative biofilm profiles, gene expression, and metabolic concentrations. Using the model, we characterized and compared the temporal metabolic and gene expression profiles of sessile versus planktonic bacterial populations during biofilm formation and investigated correlations between gene expression and biofilm-associated metabolites and cellular scale phenotypes. Based on our in silico studies, planktonic bacteria had higher metabolite concentrations in the glycolysis and citric acid cycle pathways, with higher gene expression levels in flagella and lipopolysaccharide-associated genes. Conversely, sessile bacteria had higher metabolite concentrations in the autoinducer 2 pathway, with type IV pili, autoinducer 2 export, and cellular respiration genes upregulated in comparison with planktonic bacteria. Having demonstrated results consistent with in vitro static culture biofilm systems, our model enables examination of molecular phenomena within biofilms that are experimentally inaccessible and provides a framework for future exploration of how hypothesized molecular mechanisms impact bulk community behavior.

AB Background: Mathematical and computational models showed to be a very important support tool for the comprehension of the immune system response against pathogens. Models and simulations allowed to study the immune system behavior, to test biological hypotheses about diseases and infection dynamics, and to improve and optimize novel and existing drugs and vaccines.
   Continuous models, mainly based on differential equations, usually allow to qualitatively study the system but lack in description; conversely discrete models, such as agent based models and cellular automata, permit to describe in detail entities properties at the cost of losing most qualitative analyses. Petri Nets (PN) are a graphical modeling tool developed to model concurrency and synchronization in distributed systems. Their use has become increasingly marked also thanks to the introduction in the years of many features and extensions which lead to the born of "high level" PN.
   Results: We propose a novel methodological approach that is based on high level PN, and in particular on Colored Petri Nets (CPN), that can be used to model the immune system response at the cellular scale. To demonstrate the potentiality of the approach we provide a simple model of the humoral immune system response that is able of reproducing some of the most complex well-known features of the adaptive response like memory and specificity features.
   Conclusions: The methodology we present has advantages of both the two classical approaches based on continuous and discrete models, since it allows to gain good level of granularity in the description of cells behavior without losing the possibility of having a qualitative analysis. Furthermore, the presented methodology based on CPN allows the adoption of the same graphical modeling technique well known to life scientists that use PN for the modeling of signaling pathways. Finally, such an approach may open the floodgates to the realization of multi scale models that integrate both signaling pathways (intra cellular) models and cellular (population) models built upon the same technique and software.

AB This paper outlines a theoretical account of musical self-enhancement. I claim that listening to music serves as a resource for actively manipulating affective states so that a positive self-view is maintained and a sense of optimism is provided. Self-enhancement the process by which individuals modify their self-worth and gain self-esteem typically takes place in social interactions. I argue that experiencing music may serve as a unique "esthetic surrogate" for interaction, which equally enables self-enhancement. This ability relies on three main characteristics of the musical experience, namely, its capacity to (a) evoke empathetic feelings, (b) elicit social cohesion and affiliation, and (c) elicit feelings of reward. I outline how these characteristics relate to theories of music cognition and empirical findings in psychology and neuroscience research. I also explain the specifics of musical self enhancement and how it differs from music's other regulatory functions such as mood- and emotion regulation. My aim in introducing the notion of musical self-enhancement is to broaden our understanding of how music functions as an environmental resource entailing access to unique affective states and how musical experiences are co-constituted by both the agent and the sonic environment. This specific use of music for self-enhancement can be regarded as a form of affective niche construction, providing the external conditions in which people can experience themselves more positively and maintain high self-esteem.

AB This study developed an IBM (individual-based model) to model fish movement trajectories integrating hydraulic stimulus variables (turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), velocity (V) and strain rate (SR)) to which fish responded, and the rules for individual fish movement. The fish movement trajectories of the target fish, silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix), were applied to model fish trajectories in a 1% vertical slot fishway at a discharge of 13.5 L/s. Agreement between measured and simulated trajectories implied the plausibility of the movement rules, which illustrated that the fish movement trajectories model has the preliminary ability to track individual fish trajectories for this fishway.

AB Where wildlife disease requires management, culling is frequently considered but not always effective. In the British Isles, control of cattle tuberculosis (TB) is hindered by infection in wild badger (Meles meles) populations. Large-scale badger culling can reduce the incidence of confirmed cattle TB, but these benefits are undermined by culling-induced changes in badger behavior (termed perturbation), which can increase transmission among badgers and from badgers to cattle. Test-vaccinate/remove (TVR) is a novel approach that entails testing individual badgers for infection, vaccinating test-negative animals, and killing test-positive animals. Imperfect capture success, diagnostic sensitivity, and vaccine effectiveness mean that TVR would be expected to leave some infected and some susceptible badgers in the population. Existing simulation models predict that TVR could reduce cattle TB if such small-scale culling causes no perturbation, but could increase cattle TB if considerable perturbation occurs. Using data from a long-term study, we show that past small-scale culling was significantly associated with four metrics of perturbation in badgers: expanded ranging, more frequent immigration, lower genetic relatedness, and elevated prevalence of Mycobacterium bovis, the causative agent of TB. Though we could not reject the hypothesis that culling up to three badgers per social group might avoid perturbation, we also could not reject the hypothesis that killing a single badger prompted detectable perturbation. When considered alongside existing model predictions, our findings suggest that implementation of TVR, scheduled for 2014, risks exacerbating the TB problem rather than controlling it. Ongoing illegal badger culling is likewise expected to increase cattle TB risks.

AB A combination of partial least squares (PLS) regression and design of experiments was used to analyse and define the short- and long-term loss mechanisms of carvacrol from polymer/clay nanocomposite films used as an antimicrobial food packaging material. Three formulation x variables were evaluated: type of nanoclay, concentration of nanoclay and concentration of compatibilizer agent. Five experimental y responses were measured: loss of carvacrol from the films stored at room conditions on the third and fifth days (short-term loss); on the forty-fifth and sixtieth days (long-term loss); and the polymer/clay level of intercalation. All variables and responses were simultaneously calibrated by an ANOVA-validated (P < 0.05) comprehensive PLS interaction model with a satisfactory R-2 = 0.956 and Q(2) = 0.505. A differentiation and discrimination of the mechanisms that control the loss of carvacrol over different periods of time was observed. Short-term loss seems to be controlled mainly by direct molecular interactions in the interlayer space between carvacrol and the nanoclay organomodifier. Long-term loss seems to be mainly controlled by diffusion within the nanocomposite matrix once carvacrol has left the nanoclay interlayer space, and it is closely related to the levels of intercalation reached in the nanocomposite.

AB Statement of problem. Marginal discrepancies of zirconia posterior fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) fabricated using various systems have been assessed to determine the quality of the restorations and facilitate clinical use; however, studies are limited and results are ambiguous because of the sample sizes and measurement methods.
   Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare changes in marginal fit of posterior fixed dental prostheses of 3 zirconia systems manufactured using CAD/CAM technology and metal ceramic posterior fixed dental protheses fabricated with the conventional lost-wax technique, before and after cementation.
   Material and methods. Forty standardized master steel dies with 2 abutments simulating first mandibular premolars were fabricated to receive a posterior 3-unit FDP (from first molar to first premolar) and divided into 4 groups (n=10): Lava All-Ceramic System, Procera Bridge Zirconia, VITA In-Ceram 2000 YZ, and metal ceramic (control group). All FDPs were prepared for an internal space of 50 pm. The external marginal gap of the restorations was investigated by measuring 30 points in the middle of the buccal and lingual surfaces; therefore, 60 measurements per abutment were recorded. Measurements were made with an image analysis program on the master steel model before and after conventional cementation with a glass ionomer agent (Ketac Cem Easymix). The data obtained were statistically analyzed using 1-way ANOVA, Duncan's multiple range post hoc test, and Student's paired t test (alpha=.05).
   Results. No significant differences in the vertical marginal fit before and after cementation were recorded for the analyzed groups. The marginal discrepancy of Procera abutments before and after cementation (9 +/- 10 mu m and 12 +/- 9 pm, respectively) was less than that of the other groups. Significant differences (P=.001) were observed in marginal adaptation between Procera Bridge Zirconia and the other groups.
   Conclusions. The results of this study showed that cementation did not cause a significant increase in the vertical marginal discrepancies of the FDPs and that an Internal space of 50 pm provided a high precision of fit of the restorations. The accuracy of fit achieved for the 3 zirconium oxide groups analyzed was within the range of clinical acceptance, and the discrepancies were lower than in the metal ceramic group. Procera Bridge Zirconia showed the lowest vertical discrepancies. (J Prosthet Dent 2009; 102:378-384)

AB Microbial contamination in alcoholic fermentation is a widespread concern. Antibiotics are generally used for controlling bacterial contamination. However, drug-resistant strains and some health restrictions have limited the use of antibiotics. Here we propose the addition of hop extract as a natural antibacterial agent in alcoholic fermentation processes. Besides the behavior of the hop extract and the biocide Kamoran (R) were compared. The simultaneous evaluation of yeast, hop extract and bacterial concentrations as experimental variables enabled us to determine optimal conditions for contaminated fermentation processing. We determined that the optimal yeast and hop extract concentrations are 35 g L-1 and 46 mg L-1, respectively, and the bacterial concentration does not significantly influence the analysis. The use of the natural hop extract presents similar results to the biocide Kamoran. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The voltammetric behavior of 4-methylbenzelidene camphor (MBC) was studied by square wave voltammetry (SWV) using mercury electrode. The experimental condition that provided the highest peak current with the best reduction signal definition of MBC was found in Britton-Robinson buffer and cationic surfactants, cetyltrimethylammoniun bromide (CTABr). A single peak of MBC reduction was observed at -1.21 V versus Ag/AgCl. The developed methodology was applied for determination of MBC in commercial sunscreen SPF 15, 20 and 30 and for the simultaneous determination when other protection agents were associated, such as benzophenone-3 (BENZO) and octyl methoxycinammate (OMC). Both methodologies had shown good determination values for the analyzed samples. The calculated detection limit was 2.99 X 10(-9) mol L-1 and the quantification limit was 9.98 X 10(-9) mol L-1.

AB A continuum damage model for simulating damage propagation of bonded joints is presented, introducing a linear softening damage process for the adhesive agent. Material models simulating anisotropic non-linear elastic behavior and distributed damage accumulation were used for the composite adherends as well. The proposed modeling procedure was applied to a series of lap joints accounting for adhesion either by means of secondary bonding or co-bonding. Stress analysis was performed using plane strain elements of a commercial finite element code allowing implementation of user defined constitutive equations. Numerical results for the different overlap lengths under investigation were in good agreement with experimental data in terms of joint strength and overall structural behavior.

AB Laboratory experiments are described that examined the effectiveness of certain naturally occurring combinations of salts as weathering agents. Cubes of a highly quartzose sandstone were repeatedly soaked in one of a series of salt solutions and then oven-dried to simulate natural weathering. The weathering effect of both potassium alum and ammonium alum is enhanced by the presence of alunogen or gypsum whereas sodium chloride depresses the effect of the alums. Sodium chloride combined with gypsum is confirmed as appreciably more destructive than either of the salts alone. The results indicate that it is difficult to predict the weathering behaviour of combinations of salts from the weathering behaviour of the salts individually. Possible causes of enhanced weathering by some combined salt solutions are discussed. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The paper presents the results of a multicultural economic experiment executed in the Czech Republic and Russia. The experiment was focused on studying the behaviour of economic agents in a situation simulating a charitable lottery. From Dale's (2004) experimental design, we adopted the fixed-prize lottery (raffle) structure, in which tickets are sold for chances of winning a prize. This means that the more tickets one buys, the higher probability to win he gains. We introduced a new scheme the modified fixed-prize lottery - within which the chance of winning was equal for all contributing individuals. Our results show that such a structure is not effective, that is, that individuals contribute considerably less under the modified fixed-prize lottery than under the classic raffle.

AB Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) has emerged as an interesting alternative for conventional power production technologies, intrinsically combining power production and CO2 capture. The performance of the oxygen carrier particles used in this technology is of vital importance for the overall technical and economical feasibility of CLC technology, and therefore, the behavior of a selected oxygen carrier (CuO/Al2O3) has been investigated in more detail using thermogravimetry. The experimental study focused on the reactivity during the oxidation and reduction cycles and the stability of the particles over multiple alternating sequences of these cycles. Particles of relatively large size were used, to investigate the possibility of using the material in packed-bed CLC. Interpretation of the experimental results on a quantitative level was achieved through comparison with numerical simulations using a detailed particle model in which the effects of both reaction kinetics and intraparticle mass-transfer limitations were fully taken into account. It was found that the experimentally determined conversion rate of the particles during oxidation could be very well described by the particle model that accounts for changes in the particle morphology. The average pore size needed in the simulations to reproduce the experimental results matched well with the most common pore size found by nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments using the BET and BJH methods. For the reduction cycles using hydrogen as the reducing agent, it was concluded that the conversion characteristics could be described reasonably well for moderate conversions, but for higher conversions, the discrepancies were larger, especially at rather low operating temperatures. When reduction cycles were carried out with methane, carbon deposition was observed. The generated data and insights help in assessing the optimal reactor configuration for CLC and its feasibility.

AB Formation control technology can exhibit the collective flock behaviors of a crowd for simulation and animation purpose, and thus, can be applied in various fields. In this paper, an innovative geometry-constrained framework for smooth formation animation of regulated crowds is proposed. We employ the morphing method to generate a series of in-between constrained shapes as key frames to impose process control and ensure smoothness of formation transformations. We also introduce centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) to calculate optimal distribution of agents, and present an improved Lloyd descent method to perform path planning by utilizing its fixed point iteration feature. As extensions, the proposed framework can handle environmental obstacles avoiding problems for the whole crowd to preserve certain formation extremely by utilizing a domain modification method, and can also be adapted to 3D spaces and density-based domains. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate stable, smooth, orderly, regular and elegant crowd formation animations. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Reactive dividing wall column(RDWC) is a highly integrated unit which combines reaction distillation (RD) with dividing wall column separation technology into one shell, and it realized the chemical reaction and the separation of multiple product fractions simultaneously. In this paper, the reaction of esterification with acetic acid and ethanol to produce ethyl acetate was used as the research system, experiments and simulations of the RDWC were carried out. This system in the traditional process mostly used the homogeneous catalyst (e.g. sulfuric acid). However, in view of the corrosion of the equipment caused by the acidity of the catalyst, we used the heterogeneous catalysts - iron exchange resins - Amberlyst15 and proposed a novel catalyst loading method. Firstly, the reliability of the model of the simulation was verified by the experimental study on the change of liquid split ratio and reflux ratio. After that, the four-column model was established in Aspen Plus to analyze the effects of the amount of azeotropic agent, reflux ratio and acetic acid concentration. Finally, for a fair comparison, the economic analysis was conducted between traditional RD column and RDWC. The results showed that RDWC can save 34.7% of total operating costs and 18.5% of TAC.

AB This article presents an investigation into the validation of velocity fields obtained from computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models of flow through the membrane oxygenators using x-ray digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Computational fluid dynamic is a useful tool in characterizing artificial lung devices, but numerical results must be experimentally validated. We used DSA to visualize flow through a membrane oxygenator at 2 L/min using 37% glycerin at 22 degrees C. A Siemens Artis Zee system acquired biplane x-ray images at 7.5 frames per second, after infusion of an iodinated contrast agent at a rate of 33 ml/s. A maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method was used to track the contrast perfusion through the fiber bundle. For the CFD simulations, the fiber bundle was treated as a single momentum sink according to the Ergun equation. Blood was modeled as a Newtonian fluid, with constant viscosity (3.3 cP) and density (1050 kg/m3). Although CFD results and experimental pressure measurements were in general agreement, the simulated 2 L/min perfusion did not reproduce the flow behavior seen in vitro. Simulated velocities in the fiber bundle were on average 42% lower than experimental values. These results indicate that it is insufficient to use only pressure measurements for validation of the flow field because pressure-validated CFD results can still significantly miscalculate the physical velocity field. We have shown that a clinical x-ray modality, together with a MCC tracking algorithm, can provide a nondestructive technique for acquiring experimental data useful for validation of the velocity field inside membrane oxygenators.

AB In this paper, the use of molecular surface imprinted polymers (MIPs) in designing colon-specific drug delivery systems was investigated. MIPs were prepared on crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol microspheres (CPVA) with sodium 4-styrene sulfonate (SSS) as functional monomer, Metronidazole (MTZ) as template and N,N'-Methylene bisacrylamide (MBA) as crosslinking agent by utilizing cerium salt-hydroxyl group redox initiation system, obtaining MTZ molecular surface imprinted microspheres MIP-PSSS/CPVA. The MIP-PSSS/CPVA microspheres were further characterized by scanning electron microscope and batch binding method. Because there is strong electrostatic interactions between MTZ and monomer SSS, the MTZ molecular surface imprinting is quite successful, and the imprinted microspheres MIP-PSSS/CPVA possess high recognition selectivity and excellent combining affinity. The experimental results show that at pH 1, the MIP-PSSS/CPVA microspheres exhibit very strong binding ability for MTZ, and the binding capacity reaches up to 115mg/g. The in vitro release of the MTZ-loaded MIP-PSSS/CPVA is highly pH-dependent and time-delayed. The release behavior shows that the drugs do not release in simulated gastric fluid (pH = 1), the drug release is small while in the simulated small intestinal fluid (pH = 6.8), an abrupt release will be firstly produced and then drug release is sustained and slowed in the simulated colon fluid (pH = 7.4), displaying excellent colon-specific drug delivery behavior.

AB Hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS), an anticaking agent for mixed feed, was added alone or simultaneously with a toxic Zearalenone (ZEN) dose to balb/c mice and was evaluated for its ability to restore damages induced by ZEN. The latter is a mycotoxin produced by fusarium genera; it is mainly known to induce several toxic effects such as hepatotoxicity, immunotoxicity and nephrotoxicity on animals and humans. The experimental approach consisted of eight treatments of six mice each by 400 mg/kg bw or 5 g/kg bw of HSCAS. Two experimental groups have received respectively ZEN alone at 40 (8% of LD50) and at 500 mg/kg bw (LD50). Two other groups have received ZEN at 40 or 500 mg/kg bw combined respectively with HSCAS at 400 mg/kg bw and 5 g/kg bw. The control groups received water or olive oil. Forty-eight hours after treatment, blood samples were collected for haematological and serum biochemical parameters measurements. ZEN treatment significantly increased hematocrit, haemoglobin, white blood cells: lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, monocytes and the most of biochemical serum parameters; it significantly reduced platelets and induced degenerative changes in the hepatic and renal tissues; while, the mixture of HSCAS with ZEN induced a reestablishment of haematological parameters, levels of serum biochemical enzyme activities and histological pictures of both liver and kidney. It also prevented general toxicity of ZEN. This was observed by the shift of LD50 for this toxin.
   Thus, our data strongly suggested that deleterious effects of ZEN could be overcome or, at least, significantly were diminished by HSCAS. Moreover, this sorbent by itself did not show any toxic effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All ri-hts reserved.

AB An experimental simulation involving 55 women assessed the main and interactive effects of experimentally induced mood state (positive vs negative) and favorability of performance feedback (positive vs negative) on the perceived accuracy of feedback. The study was conducted in two sessions. During Session I the subjects role-played the position of an advertising agent and worked on an advertising task. In Session II they were administered either a positive or negative mood induction, given positive or negative feedback on the advertising task, and completed a measure of the perceived accuracy of feedback. Regression analyses indicated support for hypothesized main and interactive effects, suggesting that mood state and favorability of feedback interactively affect the perceived accuracy of received feedback.

AB Crystallization kinetics of simultaneously developing polymorphic modifications was investigated in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) under non-isothermal conditions. iPP was nucleated by a trisamide derivative (TATA), which is a non-selective beta-nucleating agent, in order to obtain mixed polymorphic structure. The crystallization process was followed using differential scanning calorimetry under constant cooling rates and a stepwise experimental technique is presented, which can separate the development of alpha- and beta-modifications. Ozawa method was applied to evaluate the crystallization kinetics of the two modifications separately. The results indicate clearly that the kinetics of the modification is different. Accordingly, any methods, which evaluate the crystallization process of samples containing mixed polymorphic structure without separation the modifications, are incorrect, and this is the reason why these complicated processes are difficult to linearize using the conventional kinetic evaluation techniques.

AB Styrene is a widely used bulk chemical produced by dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB). Purification of styrene to contain < 100 ppm EB is not cost-effective by conventional separation methods. One separation method is extractive distillation with an ionic liquid (IL) as a binding agent for one of the components, thereby lowering the vapour pressure of this component. In this study, using quantum density functional theory (DFT), we have simulated 22 IL anioncation pairs, styrene and EB affinities to them, and ion-pair dimer affinities of the ILs. These are compared with experimental liquidliquid equilibrium studies of M.T.G. Jongmans, B. Schuur, and A.B. de Haan, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 50 (2011), pp. 1080010810. It is shown that experimental selectivity and distribution coefficients of styrene and EB in the ILs are related to computed gas phase anioncation stabilisation energies and ion-pairion-pair dimer affinities. The inverse of molar volume is found to strongly correlate with the selectivity. The computational results also qualitatively correlate with molar volume, and consequently, it is possible to use DFT calculations as a qualitative prediction tool in screening of ILs for this separation process. This tool does not account for effects caused by long alkyl chains, as the length does not seem to affect dimer stabilisation energy beyond ethyl group.

AB In this study, a novel decentralized adaptive full-order sliding mode control framework is proposed for the robust synchronized formation motion of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) subject to system uncertainty. First, a full-order sliding mode surface in a decentralized manner is designed to incorporate both the individual position tracking error and the synchronized formation error while the UAV group is engaged in building a certain desired geometric pattern in three dimensional space. Second, a decentralized virtual plant controller is constructed which allows the embedded low-pass filter to attain the chattering free property of the sliding mode controller. In addition, robust adaptive technique is integrated in the decentralized chattering free sliding control design in order to handle unknown bounded uncertainties, without requirements for assuming a priori knowledge of bounds on the system uncertainties as stated in conventional chattering free control methods. Subsequently, system robustness as well as stability of the decentralized full-order sliding mode control of multiple UAVs is synthesized. Numerical simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control framework to achieve robust 3D formation flight of the multi-UAV system. (C) 2017 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Heterocyclic compounds are known to have numerous pharmacological properties including antimicrobial and anticancer activities. In the current study, substituted pyran, pyrimidine and pyrazole derivatives were synthesized as potential antimicrobial agents via condensation of ethyl 2- cyano-3-oxooctadecanoate with substrates containing active methylene and/or nitrogen nucleophiles. An initial study of the products was carried out using the MOE module to simulate the behavior of these compounds inside infected cells. Some of these compounds showed activities when tested against bacteria, fungi and two lines of specific cancer cells e.g., MCF-7 and HePG(2) . In addition, the surface characters for the products were investigated, which showed improvement in solubility and activity in the surface. Moreover, the computational experiments have strengthened the study and are in line with experimental aspects. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: The recent results of several experimental studies have suggested that tumour implantation after laparoscopic surgery for intra-abdominal malignancy may be partly related to the chemical composition of the insufflation gas used during surgery. These studies have demonstrated that the use of helium as a laparoscopic insufflation agent for cancer surgery results in less tumour implantation and growth at port sites. To further investigate these findings, the present study was performed to compare the growth of cultured tumour cells after exposure to simulated laparoscopic environments, rich in helium, carbon dioxide (CO2), or air.
   Methods: A rat mammary adenocarcinoma cell suspension was exposed to a simulated laparoscopic environment for 40 min in one of the following groups: (i) control (atmospheric air. equivalent to a 'gasless' laparoscopic environment): (ii) a CO2-rich environment; and (iii) a helium-rich environment. Cells were then cultured for 18 h and optical density readings wore used to assess the number of viable tumour cells at the end of this period. The experiment was performed twice using an identical protocol to ensure consistency in the results. In a further study, pH was continuously measured using an antimony probe during a 40 min insufflation period and for 10 min after insufflation.
   Results: Cell growth was significantly lower after incubation in the helium-rich environment compared to both the CO2 and control groups (P < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in pH in the CO2 group which was not observed during exposure to either air or helium.
   Conclusions: The inhibition of tumour growth in a helium-rich environment demonstrated by this study, and the reduced incidence of port-site metastases seen in other experimental studies. suggests that the clinical use of helium as an insufflation gas may have important advantages ol er CO2.

AB The faster is slower effect is a self-organized phenomena first described for pedestrian dynamics. Although it has been obtained in computer simulations, it has not been observed in real systems yet. To achieve this goal, we carried out experiments with ants, which are self-propelled biological agents. The ants were placed inside a bidimensional chamber with a narrow exit, and a paper imbibed with repellent was placed in the opposite wall of the chamber. Using different concentrations of citronella, which produced different degrees of repellency, the ants were forced to egress from the chamber and the evacuation time was measured. A minimum evacuation time is observed for intermediate concentrations of citronella, compatible with the faster is slower effect. However, this effect was not generated by the occurrence of blocking clusters right before the exit as the ants did not display a selfish evacuation behavior. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper deals with the design of a decentralized guidance and control strategy for a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), with the objective of maintaining a given connection topology with assigned mutual distances while flying to a target area. In the absence of obstacles, the assigned topology, based on an extended Delaunay triangulation concept, implements regular and connected formation shapes. In the presence of obstacles, this technique is combined with a model predictive control (MPC) that allows forming independent sub-swarms optimizing the formation spreading to avoid obstacles and collisions between neighboring vehicles. A custom numerical simulator was developed in a Matlab/Simulink environment to prove the effectiveness of the proposed guidance and control scheme in several 2D operational scenarios with obstacles of different sizes and increasing number of aircraft.

AB Statistical analysis of accidents in recent years shows that crowd crushes have become significant non-combat, non-environmental public disasters. Unlike common accidents such as fires, crowd crushes may occur without obvious external causes, and may arise quickly and unexpectedly in otherwise normal surroundings. We use physics-based simulations to understand the processes and consequences of compressive forces on high density static crowds consisting of up to 400 agents in a restricted space characterized by barriers to free movement. According to empirical observation and experimentation by others, we know that local high packing density is an important factor leading to crowd crushes and consequent injuries. We computationally verify our hypothesis that compressive forces create high local crowd densities which exceed human tolerance. Affected agents may thus be unable to move or escape and will present additional movement obstacles to others. Any high density crowd simulation should therefore take into account these possible negative effects on crowd mobility and behavior. Such physics-based simulations may therefore assist in the design of crowded spaces that could reduce the possibility of crushes and their consequences.

AB Mercury detection due to harmful effects on the environment and human health is of importance. Among the reported methods, functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) due to their interesting ability for selective detection of Hg2+ have been considered. In this article, by employing full atomistic molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and quantum mechanic calculations, dynamical behavior and aggregation mechanism of the pure and 11-mecaptoundecanoic acid (MCA) functionalized gold nanoparticles (MCA-AuNPs) were investigated. MD simulation results indicate that pure AuNPs are not stable in water and aggregate due to van der Waals interactions. On the other hand, MCA groups increase the stability of AuNPs and their resistance against aggregation by elevating the repulsive interactions of the AuNPs. Moreover, MCA-AuNPs have the considerable ability for selective detection of Hg2+ in the presence of different metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cu2+, Ba2+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Mg2+, Ni2+ and Pb2+. On the basis of the QM calculations, Hg2+ has a strong electrostatic interaction with the COO- groups of the MCA on the AuNPs surface. This metal ion acts as a linkage agent between the MCA-AuNPs, which facilitates the nanoparticle aggregation, through the elimination of the repulsive interactions. A good agreement between the theoretical results and experimental data indicates the importance of the theoretical methods for understanding the mechanism of ion sensing by the functionalized AuNPs, which is of great interest for designing new sensors based on gold nanoparticles.

AB This paper discusses a novel collective sensing approach using autonomous sensors specially designed to monitor gas leaks and search for gas sources. The proposed collective behavior aims to improve the gas-source search by sharing information between mobile sensors and reducing the risks associated with gas leakage. The group acts as a composite sensor that can move independently to search for an optimal sensing zone. The autonomous searching behavior is bio-inspired by colonies of bacteria that continuously seek energy sources throughout their existence. Each sensor makes its own autonomous search decision, considering the group sense, to move in the direction of a better energy source. The collective approach is based on autonomous agents sharing information to achieve a collective sense of gas perception and utilizes more intelligent searching. The method is evaluated in a cyber-physical system specially developed to safely experiment with gases and mobile sensors while reproducing the realistic dynamic behavior of the gas. Experiments are performed to clarify the collective gas-sensing contributions, and the gas search is compared through multiple mobile sensors with and without collective sensing. The proposed approach is evaluated in an unhealthy environment to elucidate its effectiveness. In addition to presenting the related differences between collective and individual sensory approaches, this work contributes with analyzes of the scalability of mobile gas sensing systems. This work also contributed as a simulated semi-physical experimental system to test algorithms' performance before applying it to practice.

AB This paper presents the development of a parking occupancy simulator to support a smart parking system. The simulator uses an agent-based approach to model drivers who follow activity plans and who may or may not use the smart parking system. We illustrate how the process of developing our simulator helped in the design and implementation of the smart parking system components. The paper also shows how the simulator was used to study the possible usage of the smart parking system in a university campus, foreseeing (1) support for the smart parking system's overall suitability, (2) reservation guarantee violation problems, and (3) the value of using total traveled distance as a metric for the smart parking evaluation. The experience presented in this paper may prove valuable to teams planning the development of a smart parking system for similar contexts.

AB Purpose. The potential of UV-mediated photofunctionalization to enhance the resin-based luting agent bonding performance to aged materials was investigated. Methods. Sixty samples of each material were prepared. Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YZr) and Pd-Au alloy (Pd-Au) plates were fabricated and sandblasted. Lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (LDS) was CAD-CAM prepared and ground with #800 SiC paper. Half of the specimens were immersed in machine oil for 24 h to simulate the carbon adsorption. Then, all of the specimens (noncarbon- and carbon-adsorbed) were submitted to UV-mediated photofunctionalization with a 15 W UV-LED (265 nm, 300 mA, 7692 mu W/cm(2)) for 0 (control groups), 5, and 15 min and subjected to contact angle (theta) measurement and bonded using a resin cement (Panavia (TM) V5, Kuraray Noritake, Japan). The tensile bond strength (TBS) test was performed after 24 h. The theta (degrees) and TBS (MPa) data were statistically analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Bonferroni correction tests (alpha=0.05). Results. In the carbon-adsorbed groups, UV-mediated photofunctionalization for 5 min significantly decreased theta of all materials and increased TBS of YZr, and UV for 15 min significantly increased the TBS of LDS and Pd-Au. In noncarbon-adsorbed groups, UV-photofunctionalization did not significantly change the theta or TBS except YZr specimens UV-photofunctionalized for 15 min. Conclusion. UV-mediated photofunctionalization might have removed the adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules from the materials' surfaces and enhanced bond strengths of Panavia (TM) V5 to YZr, LDS, and Pd-Au. Additionally, UV-mediated photofunctionalization improved the overall TBS of YZr. Further investigation on the optimum conditions of UV photofunctionalization on indirect restorative materials should be conducted.

AB Organophosphate hydrolases are proficient catalysts of the breakdown of neurotoxic organophosphates and have great potential as both biotherapeutics for treating acute organophosphate toxicity and as bioremediation agents. However, proficient organophosphatases such as serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) and the organophosphate-hydrolyzing lactonase SsoPox are unable to hydrolyze bulkyorganophosphates with challenging leaving groups such as diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) or venomous agent X, creating a major challenge for enzyme design. Curiously, despite their mutually exclusive substrate specificities, PON1 and diisopropyl fluorophosphatase (DFPase) have essentially identical active sites and tertiary structures. In the present work, we use empirical valence bond simulations to probe the catalytic mechanism of DFPase as well as temperature, pH, and mutational effects, demonstrating that DFPase and PON1 also likely utilize identical catalytic mechanisms to hydrolyze their respective substrates. However, detailed examination of both static structures and dynamical simulations demonstrates subtle but significant differences in the electrostatic properties and solvent penetration of the two active sites and, most critically, the role of residues that make no direct contact with either substrate in acting as "specificity switches" between the two enzymes. Specifically, we demonstrate that key residues that are structurally and functionally critical for the paraoxonase activity of PON1 prevent it from being able to hydrolyze DFP with its fluoride leaving group. These insights expand our understanding of the drivers of the evolution of divergent substrate specificity in enzymes with identical active sites and guide the future design of organophosphate hydrolases that hydrolyze compounds with challenging leaving groups.

ID LIPOSOMAL AMPHOTERICIN-B; NEUTROPENIC PATIENTS; PERSISTENT FEVER; AGENT
AB This study was retrospectively carried out to compare the efficacy of echinocandins such as micafungin (MCFG) and caspofungin (CPFG) in the treatment of antibiotic-unresponsive febrile patients with hematologic malignancies. A total of 163 patients received either MCFG or CPFG. We evaluated the efficacy of echinocandin against fever decline in all patients. Fever decline, defined as a body temperature of less than 37.5 degrees C sustained for more than 48 h without scheduled antipyretic medication. Efficacy assessments showed that the incidence of fever decline was not significantly different between the MCFG and CPFG groups (P=0.599). The median number of days from the start of echinocandin administration to fever decline was 5 in both the MCFG and CPFG groups. Multivariate analysis showed that the use of anti-MRSA drugs (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.90; P=0.011) and a change from echinocandins to voriconazole or liposomal-amphotericin B (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.30-0.74; P<0.001) are significant risk factors for sustained fever. A significant difference (P=0.002) in incidence of fever decline was however associated with differences in the timing of anti- MRSA drug administration. The median number of days from the start of echinocandin administration to fever decline was 5 when administration of the anti-MRSA drug occurred "simultaneously or prior to echinocandin start" and 11 in the "next day or later of echinocandin start" group. In other words, starting anti- MRSA drug treatment after echinocandin treatment is a risk factor. In conclusion, MCFG and CPFG have similar efficacy as empirical antifungal agents in the treatment of antibiotic-unresponsive febrile patients with hematopoietic malignancies.

ID DISTRIBUTED CONTROL; SEARCH; UAVS
AB A central issue in distributed formation of swarm is enabling agents with only a local view of their environment to take actions that advance global system objectives (emergence of collective behavior). This paper describes a bio-inspired control algorithm using pheromone for coordinating a swarm of identical flying agents to spatially self-organize into arbitrary shapes using local communication maintaining a certain level of density. Development of morphological features such as the fine formation of particles, hollow particles, cracks in particles, and the evolution of the structure are used as illustrative examples. Distributed formation of swarming with no coordinated agreement or positioning information is an interesting research area because the global behaviors must emerge from many diverse local interactions. Different from most existing distributed control, the proposed approach considers the topological structure of the organization, supports dynamic reconfiguration and self-organization. This paper presents the experimental results on simulating in the forming of arbitrary shape, and also describes a analytic aspect of our model comparing with behavioral performances.

AB Military and civilian first responders must be able to recognize and effectively manage mass disaster casualties. Clinical management of injuries resulting from nerve agents provides different challenges for first responders than those of conventional weapons. We evaluated the impact of a mixed-methods training program on competency acquisition in cholinergic crisis clinical management using multimedia with either live animal or patient actor examples, and hands-on practice using SimMan3G mannequin simulators. A purposively selected sample of 204 civilian and military first responders who had not previously completed nerve agent training were assessed pre- and post-training for knowledge, performance, self-efficacy, and affective state. We conducted analysis of variance with repeated measures; statistical significance p < 0.05. Both groups had significant performance improvement across all assessment dimensions: knowledge > 20%, performance > 50%, self-efficacy > 34%, and affective state > 15%. There were no significant differences between the live animal and patient actor groups. These findings could aid in the specification of training for first-responder personnel in military and civilian service. Although less comprehensive than U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Chemical Defense courses, the training outcomes associated with this easily distributed program demonstrate its value in increasing the competency of first responders in recognizing and managing a mass casualty cholinergic event.

ID HEALTH; THINKING; SCIENCE
AB Early childhood caries (ECC) is a largely preventable condition that occurs when children develop caries in their primary teeth before the age of six. National trends of ECC indicate that prevalence is decreasing, but disparities between various sociodemographic groups may be increasing, despite intervention efforts. Dynamic mechanisms in caries development are hypothesized to be responsible for the observed population distributions of disease. Agent-based models (ABMs) have been utilized to explore similar hypotheses in many areas of health research. Therefore, we developed an ABM of ECC development mechanisms and examined population outcomes of hypothetical preventive intervention scenarios. We found that risk-based targeting had minimal impact on population averages or disparities and was largely due to the strength of the dynamic mechanisms among those considered to be at high caries risk. Universally increasing intervention access reduced population caries prevalence, but increased disparities between different groups of caries risk profiles. We show that population distributions of ECC can emerge as a result of dynamic mechanisms that have been shown to drive disease development. Understanding the effectiveness of a proposed intervention in relation to the hypothesized mechanism(s) that contributes to the outcome of interest is critical to future efforts to address population disparities in ECC.

AB This work studies the heavy oil gasification experimentally and numerically. The experimental investigations use the semi-industrial test facility HP POX (High Pressure Partial Oxidation gasifier), operated at the Institute of Energy Process Engineering and Chemical Engineering, TU Bergakademie Freiberg. The HP-POX facility with a capacity of 5 MW operates under industrial conditions and features comprehensive instrumentation. The numerical model considers state-of-the-art model approaches and a detailed determination of the droplet size distribution, applying breakup models to the liquid heavy oil phase. The optical system of the HP-POX allows the heavy oil injection to be observed; these observations are then used to evaluate the droplet size distribution. The numerical model approach is validated against two lab-scale experiments from the literature, which also provide data on high pressure and temperature conditions. Validation A is the pressurized entrained-flow reactor of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation applying coal gasification at 20 bar. Validation B is the research gasifier for liquid fuel, of the Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry that gasifies Orimusion (R) at 19 bar. The numerical model shows good agreement for both experiments, and for the heavy oil gasification experiment in the HP-POX plant. The validated model is used to study the impact of two different burner concepts on gasification characteristics. Burner 1 has a central fuel injection and an annular gasification agent injection, while Burner 2 has a central gasification agent injection and an annular fuel injection. The results show that Burner 1 achieves a higher syngas yield (H-2 + CO) but with higher soot production in comparison to the simulation results for Burner 2.

AB Dimethyl sulfate (DMS; CAS No. 77-78) is a colorless, oily liquid which is used as a chemical intermediate and as a reactant in producing polyurethane resins. In this study, groups of pregnant Cr1:CD(R)BR rats were exposed, nose-only, to either 0.1, 0.7 or 1.5 ppm DMS by inhalation for 6 hr/day from Days 7 through 16 of gestation (day in which copulation plug was detected was designated Day 1G). A control group of pregnant rats was exposed simultaneously to air only. All female rats were euthanized on Day 22G and the fetuses were examined. A suppression of both food consumption and the rate of body weight gain was seen in the 0.7 and 1.5 ppm groups. No unusual clinical signs were seen in rats exposed to DMS. None of the reproductive parameters was altered in any of the groups and no statistically significant fetal effects were detected. DMS is not a developmental toxin in the rat following inhalation exposures up to 1.5 ppm during the period of major organogenesis.

For the case of asymmetric communication rate, we present sufficient conditions to guarantee the strong stochastic flocking to occur and show the almost sure exponential convergence toward constant equilibrium state through the control of the parameters and initial data.

AB Self-organized pattern behavior is ubiquitous throughout nature, from fish schooling to collective cell dynamics during organism development. Qualitatively these patterns display impressive consistency, yet variability inevitably exists within pattern-forming systems on both microscopic and macroscopic scales. Quantifying variability and measuring pattern features can inform the underlying agent interactions and allow for predictive analyses. Nevertheless, current methods for analyzing patterns that arise from collective behavior capture only macroscopic features or rely on either manual inspection or smoothing algorithms that lose the underlying agent-based nature of the data. Here we introduce methods based on topological data analysis and interpretable machine learning for quantifying both agent-level features and global pattern attributes on a large scale. Because the zebrafish is a model organism for skin pattern formation, we focus specifically on analyzing its skin patterns as a means of illustrating our approach. Using a recent agent-based model, we simulate thousands of wild-type and mutant zebrafish patterns and apply our methodology to better understand pattern variability in zebrafish. Our methodology is able to quantify the differential impact of stochasticity in cell interactions on wild-type and mutant patterns, and we use our methods to predict stripe and spot statistics as a function of varying cellular communication. Our work provides an approach to automatically quantifying biological patterns and analyzing agent-based dynamics so that we can now answer critical questions in pattern formation at a much larger scale.

AB Background-The noninvasive, tissue-specific delivery of therapeutic agents to the heart would be a valuable clinical tool. This study addressed the hypothesis that albumin-coated microbubbles could be used to effectively deliver an adenoviral transgene to rat myocardium by ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction,
   Methods and Results-Recombinant adenovirus containing beta-galactosidase and driven by a constitutive promoter was attached to the surface of albumin-coated, perfluoropropane-filled microbubbles, These bubbles were infused into the jugular vein of rats with or without simultaneous echocardiography. Additional controls included ultrasound of microbubbles that did not contain virus, virus alone, and virus plus ultrasound. One group underwent ultrasound-mediated destruction of microbubbles followed by adenovirus infusion. Rats were killed after 4 days and examined for beta-galactosidase expression. The hearts of all rats that underwent ultrasound-mediated destruction of microbubbles containing virus showed nuclear staining with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside substrate, indicating expression of the transgene. None of the control animals showed myocardial expression of the beta-galactosidase transgene. By quantitative analysis, beta-galactosidase activity was 10-fold higher in the treated group than in controls (P<0.0001).
   Conclusions-Ultrasound-mediated destruction of albumin-coated microbubbles is a promising method for the delivery of bioactive agents to the heart.

AB An agent-based model of farmers' crop and best management practice (BMP) decisions is developed and linked to a hydrologic-agronomic model of a watershed, to examine farmer behavior, and the attendant effects on stream nitrate load, under the influence of markets for conventional crops, carbon allowances, and a second-generation biofuel crop. The agent-based approach introduces interactions among farmers about new technologies and market opportunities, and includes the updating of forecast expectations and uncertainties using Bayesian inference. The model is applied to a semi-hypothetical example case of farmers in the Salt Creek Watershed in Central Illinois, and a sensitivity analysis is performed to effect a first-order assessment of the plausibility of the results. The results show that the most influential factors affecting farmers' decisions are crop prices, production costs, and yields. The results also show that different farmer behavioral profiles can lead to different predictions of farmer decisions. The farmers who are predicted to be more likely to adopt new practices are those who interact more with other farmers, are less risk averse, quick to adjust their expectations, and slow to reduce their forecast confidence. The decisions of farmers have direct water quality consequences, especially those pertaining to the adoption of the second-generation biofuel crop, which are estimated to lead to reductions in stream nitrate load. The results, though empirically untested, appear plausible and consistent with general farmer behavior. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the coupled agent-based and hydrologic-agronomic models for normative research on watershed management on the water-energy nexus.

AB A series of trihydroxy-methoxyflavone (MF) analogues was designed starting from MF, contracts that reference structural characters of the existing neuraminidase inhibitors. The docking and molecular dynamics simulations were carried out, aiming to discover the novel antiviral agents and contribute to the understanding on the interacting mechanisms. It is found that the binding locations of derivatives at the neuraminidase active site will not be influenced much with the addition of functional groups(carboxyl and guanidino/Nacetylamino), and there are some connections between the structures of derivatives and their interaction energies. Compound 9, with the replacements of carboxyl and guanidino groups at C7 and C5 of MF, demonstrates the highest interaction energy among the covered derivatives, equals -1172.52 kJ/mol, and is larger than the values of available lead drugs BA and MF(-672.12 and -347.44 kJ/mol). The space orientations of carboxyl and guanidino groups within the compound 9 at the neuraminidase active site are in good agreement with the current drugs. In addition, compound 9 has strong interactions with the conserved active-site residues Asp 151 and Glu227, which is similar to the situation of MF. Therefore, compound 9 is a novel neuraminidase inhibitor with potential applications. We hope that these results will arouse the interest of experimental aspects to design novel anti-influenza drugs.

AB Molecular interactions of ferrocenyl hydrazones (FcHZ) inclusion complexes with beta-cyclodextrin (BCD), methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MEB), 2,6-di-O-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (DIMEB) and 2,3,6-tri-O-methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (TRIMEB) in order to enhance their aqueous solubility and anti-mycobacterial efficiency were investigated by semi-empirical PM7 method and B3LYP/m6-31G* calculations. Simulation results suggest the complex formations of FcHZ with BCD, MEB, DIMEB and TRIMEB are possible with 1:1 host-guest molecular ratio. Two different binding modes of the FcHZ inside the BCD and MEB cavities were found. The ferrocene fragment of FcHZ molecule was entrapped in the cavity, located near the wider rim of BCD and MEB in both orientations (AandB). The hydrazone aromatic fragment of FcHZ cannot be completely embedded inside the hydrophobic cavity of BCD. It points downward from the narrower rim of BCD in orientationAand point upward from the wider rim of BCD in orientationB. Only orientationBwas found in 1:1 inclusion complex of FcHZ agents with DIMEB and TRIMEB due to the effect of methyl group substitutions at the primary hydroxyl groups, which located at the narrower rim of cyclodextrins. The entering pathways of the FcHZ molecule into the molecular cavity of the BCD, MEB, DIMEB and TRIMEB were also discussed.

AB In the event that pathogens or toxins are introduced to a water distribution system, a utility manager may identify a threat through water quality data or alerts from public health officials. The utility manager may issue water advisories to warn consumers to reduce water use activities. As consumers react and change water demands, dynamic feedbacks among the community, utility managers, and the engineering infrastructure can create unexpected public health consequences and network hydraulics. A Complex Adaptive System (CAS)-based methodology is developed to couple an engineering model of a water distribution system with agent-based models (ABM) of consumers, public health officials, and utility managers to simulate feedback among management decisions, system hydraulics, and public behavior. A utility manager and a public health official are represented as agents, who respond to the event using a set of rules and equations that are based on a statistical analysis of a set of recorded water events. Consumers are represented as agents who update their water activities based on exposure to the contaminant and warnings from a utility agent and family members. A model of consumer compliance is developed using results from two surveys that report data to characterize consumer perceptions toward information sources during a water contamination event. The ABM framework is applied for an illustrative mid-sized virtual city to quantify the significance of interactions and advisories on public health consequences.

ID MULTIAGENT RENDEZVOUS PROBLEM; AGGREGATION; CONSENSUS; SYSTEMS
AB This article proposes three control algorithms for the emergence of self-organized behaviours, including aggregation, flocking and rendezvous, in swarm robotics systems. The proposed control algorithms are based on a local polar coordinates' control law available in the literature for posture regulation; this law is adapted to work in a self-organized robotic swarm using distance and bearing as coupling information. Therefore, the robots only need to know the radial distance and orientation to the goal; additionally, the three algorithms are based on self-organization, eliminating the need for a preset coupling topology among the robots. In particular, the flocking algorithm has a first stage for topology creation, while the rendezvous and aggregation algorithms change the topology on every iteration depending on the local interactions of the robots. The effectiveness of the algorithms was evaluated through numerical simulations of swarms of up to 100 differential traction wheeled mobile robots.

AB For many consumer goods, the advent of online markets dramatically increases the amount of information available about products' different features and qualities. Although numerous studies have investigated the effects of information quantity on individual-level decisions, it is still unknown how the amount of attribute information affects group-level patterns of behavior, particularly when consumers are also aware of a choice's popularity. In the present studies, we hypothesized that when attribute information increases, it may exceed the individual's cognitive capacity to process this information, and as a result conformity - choosing the most popular item - becomes more likely. In this study, we first examined empirical data collected from human subject experiments in a simulated online shopping experience, and then developed an agent-based model (ABM) to explore this behavioral clustering. Both studies confirmed our primary hypotheses, and the ABM shows promise as a tool for exploring extensions of these ideas. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Organic staining on bone from exposure to wood and other plant materials
SO FORENSIC SCIENCE INTERNATIONAL

DT Article
DE Organic staining; Taphonomy; Munsell Soil Color Charts
ID CEMETERY; TANNINS
AB Determining the depositional environment and the postmortem alterations to a set of remains are necessary aspects of a forensic investigation to explain the circumstances surrounding the death of an individual. The present study examines organic staining as a method for reconstructing the depositional environment of skeletal remains and the taphonomic agents with which they came into contact. Organic staining results largely from tannins leaching from plant materials and therefore can be seen on bone deposited in wooden coffin environments or on terrestrial surfaces.
   The present study examines the hypothesis that the degree of staining observed on skeletal elements would increase as the length of exposure to the organic matter increased and that different plant materials and environments would leave different patterns or colorations of staining. The sample consisted of 165 pig (Sus scrofa) femora divided into four groups exposed to differing experimental conditions, including burial in direct contact with soil or burial in a simulated coffin environment, immersion in water with wood samples, and surface deposition with plant matter contact. The bones were removed once a month from their experimental environments and the level of staining was recorded qualitatively using the Munsell Soil Color Chart.
   In all of the experimental environments, staining was present after two months of exposure, and the color darkened across the bone surface with each episode of data collection. The results from the present study indicate that staining can manifest on bone within a relatively short time frame once skeletonization occurs and a variety of colorations or patterns of staining can manifest based on the plant material. The present research also demonstrates the potential of organic staining to aid in estimations of the postmortem interval as well as a depositional environmental reconstruction through plant species identification.

AB Objective: It is a well known fact that endometriosis is linked with apoptosis, extracellular matrix formation, and angiogenesis. In this study, the authors aim to investigate the relation between the extent of endometriosis and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Materials and Methods: Twenty-one patients who received laparoscopic intervention due to endometriosis constituted the patient group, whereas 19 patients who were operated due to extra-endometrial benign cyst were included in the control group. Following the laparoscopic pelvic assessment, peripheral blood samples and two cc of free peritoneal fluid from the Douglas pouch were obtained simultaneously. The samples were studied with regards to VEGF level via solid phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Results: In the patient group, eight cases were diagnosed with Stages I and II endometriosis, while 13 cases were diagnosed with Stages III and IV endometriosis. Among the Stage I and II cases, serum VEGF levels were statistically significantly higher, as compared to the Stage III and IV cases, as well as the control group. Discussion: In conclusion, the authors found a relationship between elevated serum VEGF levels and early stage endometriosis.

TI An open-data-driven agent-based model to simulate infectious disease
   outbreaks
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID SPREAD
AB Agent-based models are a tool that can be used to better understand the dynamics of an infectious disease outbreak. An infectious disease outbreak is influenced by many factors including vaccination or immunity levels, population density, and the age structure of the population. We hypothesize that these factors along with interactions of factors and the actions of individuals would lead to outbreaks of different size and severity even in two towns that appear similar on paper. Thus, it is necessary to implement a model that is able to capture these interactions and the actions of individuals. Using openly available data we create a data-driven agent-based model to simulate the spread of an airborne infectious disease in an Irish town. Agent-based models have been known to produce results that include the emergence of patterns and behaviours that are not directly programmed into the model. Our model is tested by simulating an outbreak of measles that occurred in Schull, Ireland in 2012. We simulate the same outbreak in 33 different towns and look at the correlations between the model results and the town characteristics (population, area, vaccination rates, age structure) to determine if the results of the model are affected by interactions of those town characteristics and the decisions on the agents in the model. As expected our results show that the outbreaks are not strongly correlated with any of the main characteristics of the towns and thus the model is most likely capturing such interactions and the agent-based model is successful in capturing the differences in the outbreaks.

DE Agent-based model; Innovation diffusion; Water saving; Survey
ID INFORMATION-TECHNOLOGY; BEHAVIOR; ADOPTION
AB This paper presents an agent-based model of the diffusion of water-saving innovations. The empirical foundation of this model is a study, which was carried out for that specific purpose. As an example case, the diffusion of three water-related innovations in Southern Germany was chosen. The model represents a real geographic area and simulates the diffusion of showerheads, toilet flushes, and rain-harvesting systems. Agents are households of certain lifestyles, as represented by the Sinus-Milieus (R) from commercial Marketing. Agents use two different kinds of decision rules to decide upon adoption or rejection of the modeled innovations: A cognitively demanding deliberate decision rule and a very simple decision heuristic. Thus, the model integrates concepts of bounded rationality. The overall framework for decision-making is the Theory of Planned Behavior, which has been elaborated using innovation characteristics from diffusion research. The model was calibrated with empirical data stemming from a questionnaire survey and validated against independent data. Scenarios for the nearer future show that water-saving innovations will diffuse even without further promotion, and different promotion strategies that relate specifically to both innovations and lifestyles can be pointed out.

TI Perception of urban subdivisions in pedestrian movement simulation

ID ROUTE CHOICE; SPACE SYNTAX; TRAFFIC FLOW; WALKING DISTANCE; COGNITIVE
   MAPS; STREET; ENVIRONMENT; REPRESENTATIONS; HIERARCHIES; DESIGN
AB The perception of urban subdivisions, deriving from regionalisation processes and the identification of separating elements (barriers), has proven to dynamically shape peoples' cognitive representations of space and route choice behaviour in cities. However, existing Agent-Based Models (ABMs) for pedestrian simulation have not accounted for these particular cognitive mapping processes. The aim of this paper is to explore the behaviour of pedestrian agents endowed with knowledge about urban subdivisions. Drawing from literature in spatial cognition, we adapted a region-based route choice model, which contemplates a high- and a local planning level, and advanced a barrier-based route choice model, wherein the influence of separating elements is manipulated. Finally, we combined these two approaches in a region-barrier based model. The patterns emerging from the movement of agents employing such approaches were examined in the city centres of London and Paris. The introduction of regions in the routing mechanisms reduced the unbalanced concentration of agents across the street network brought up by the widely employed least cumulative angular change model (-.08 Gini coefficient). The inclusion of barriers further raised the dispersal of the agents through secondary roads, while leading agents to walk along waterfronts and across parks; it also yielded a more regular usage of pedestrian roads. Moreover, the region- and the region-barrier based routes showed deviation ratio values from the road distance shortest path (region-based: 1.18 London, 1.16 Paris, region-barrier based: 1.43 London, 1.33 Paris) consistent with empirical observations from pedestrian behaviour research. A further evaluation of the model with macro-level observational data may enhance the understanding of pedestrian dynamics and help tuning the interplay amongst urban salient elements at the agent level. Yet, we consider the movement flows arising from our current implementation insightful for assessing the distribution of pedestrians and testing possible interventions for the design of legible and walkable spaces.

AB One of the key factors of a successfully implemented mixed-model line system is considering model sequencing problem as well as the line balancing problem. In the literature, there are many studies, which consider these two tightly interrelated problems individually. However, we integrate the model sequencing problem in the line balancing procedure to obtain a more efficient solution for the problem of Simultaneous Balancing and Sequencing of Mixed-Model Parallel Two-Sided Assembly Lines. A mathematical model is developed to present the problem and a novel agent based ant colony optimisation approach is proposed as the solution method. Different agents interact with each other to find a near optimal solution for the problem. Each ant selects a random behaviour from a predefined list of heuristics and builds a solution using this behaviour as a local search rule along with the pheromone value. Different cycle times are allowed for different two-sided lines located in parallel to each other and this yields a complex problem where different production cycles need to be considered to build a feasible solution. The performance of the proposed approach is tested through a set of test cases. Experimental results indicate that considering model sequencing problem with the line balancing problem together helps minimise line length and total number of required workstations. Also, it is found that the proposed approach outperforms other three heuristics tested. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID COLLISION-AVOIDANCE
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential in delivering Internet-of-Things (IoT) services from a great height, creating an airborne domain of the IoT. In this article, we address the problem of autonomous UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments by formulating it as a Markov decision process with sparse rewards and propose an algorithm named deep reinforcement learning (RL) with nonexpert helpers (LwH). In contrast to prior RL-based methods that put huge efforts into reward shaping, we adopt the sparse reward scheme, i.e., a UAV will be rewarded if and only if it completes navigation tasks. Using the sparse reward scheme ensures that the solution is not biased toward potentially suboptimal directions. However, having no intermediate rewards hinders the agent from efficient learning since informative states are rarely encountered. To handle the challenge, we assume that a prior policy (nonexpert helper) that might be of poor performance is available to the learning agent. The prior policy plays the role of guiding the agent in exploring the state space by reshaping the behavior policy used for environmental interaction. It also assists the agent in achieving goals by setting dynamic learning objectives with increasing difficulty. To evaluate our proposed method, we construct a simulator for UAV navigation in large-scale complex environments and compare our algorithm with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that LwH significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms handling sparse rewards and yields impressive navigation policies comparable to those learned in the environment with dense rewards.

   TUTORIAL
AB We consider Bayesian inference techniques for agent-based (AB) models, as an alternative to simulated minimum distance (SMD). Three computationally heavy steps are involved: (i) simulating the model, (ii) estimating the likelihood and (iii) sampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters. Computational complexity of AB models implies that efficient techniques have to be used with respect to points (ii) and (iii), possibly involving approximations. We first discuss non-parametric (kernel density) estimation of the likelihood, coupled with Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling schemes. We then turn to parametric approximations of the likelihood, which can be derived by observing the distribution of the simulation outcomes around the statistical equilibria, or by assuming a specific form for the distribution of external deviations in the data. Finally, we introduce Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques for likelihood-free estimation. These allow embedding SMD methods in a Bayesian framework, and are particularly suited when robust estimation is needed. These techniques are first tested in a simple price discovery model with one parameter, and then employed to estimate the behavioural macroeconomic model of De Grauwe (2012), with nine unknown parameters.

AB The recently developed Diphonix(R) resin contains the geminally substituted diphosphonic acid ligand chemically bonded to a styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. The resin exhibits an extraordinarily strong affinity for actinides, especially in the tetra-and hexavalent oxidation states. Therefore the resin has potential for application in TRU removal from nuclear wastes. The Diphonix-CS resin is a Diphonix-type resin that contains also phenolic groups chemically attached to the polymeric matrix. The phenolic groups exhibit high affinity for Cs' ions from highly alkaline media. Thanks to the combined action of the diphosphonic acid and the phenolic groups, the Diphonix-CS resin can simultaneously remove actinide species, Cs and Sr from alkaline media. In this paper the results obtained in the characterization of the new resin are reported, with regard to the uptake equilibrium and kinetics of Cs+ and Sr+2 removal from NaOH solutions and from synthetic alkaline wastes. The chemical and radiolytic stability of the resin has been investigated. The results have indicated that the Diphonix-CS resin is remarkably stable under the experimental conditions of this work (up to 35 days in 1 to 4 M NaOH, and up to 200 MRad gamma ray absorbed dose). The possibility of stripping the Cs+ and Sr+2 from the resin has been investigated in column experiments by using 1 M HNO3 as the stripping agent. Some problems encountered in the stripping of Sr+2 and possible ways to improve the stripping performance are discussed.

AB The increased penetration of renewable energy sources into existing power systems induces challenges in supply-demand balancing. Demand-side flexibility is seen as an option to accommodate variability and limited predictability from renewable energy generation. Heat pumps at residential level, if well coordinated, can be one of those flexibility sources. The complexity involved is high though, since their coordinated operation combines control, population effects and the fact agents may actually not behave as rational decision-makers. We describe here a coordinated control framework that accounts for those aspects altogether. Decentralized model predictive control for large populations of heterogeneous agents is employed. As the cost to be minimized is affected by the population behaviour as a whole through the electricity price, the decentralized control is re-thought as a mean-field game. Existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium are discussed while the Picard-Banach algorithm is used as a solution approach. It is extended to the case of bounded-rational agents. The impact on system dynamics of modelling agents as bounded rational is illustrated through numerical simulations.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'The mathematics of energy systems'.

AB Background and aims: Atherosclerosis is critically fueled by vascular inflammation through oxidized lipids and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Genetic disruption of Tnf-alpha reduces atherosclerosis in experimental mouse models. However, less is known about the therapeutic potential of Tnf-alpha blockage by pharmacological inhibitors such as monoclonal antibodies, which are already approved for several inflammatory disorders in patients. Therefore, we investigated the effect of pharmacological TNF-alpha inhibition on plaque development in experimental atherosclerosis.
   Results: 10 week old male Ldlr(-/-) mice were divided into 4 groups (n = 7-10) and fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet for 6 and 12 weeks. Simultaneously, the mouse-specific anti-Tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody CNTO5048 (CNT) or a control IgG was administered.
   Results: CNT reduced circulating inflammatory markers without affecting body weight and glucose metabolism. Unexpectedly, CNT treatment increased plasma triglyceride levels and pro-atherogenic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol as well as plaque burden in the thoracoabdominal aorta and in the aortic root. In addition, we observed decreased smooth muscle cell content in the lesions and a trend towards reduced collagen deposition upon Tnf-alpha inhibition. Furthermore, inflammatory gene expression in the aortic arch was increased following Tnf-alpha inhibitor treatment.
   Conclusions: Although up to 12-week pharmacological inhibition of TNF-alpha in Ldlr(-/-) mice diminishes systemic inflammation, experimental plaque burden and vascular inflammatory gene expression are increased, while markers of plaque stability decrease. These observations may be explained by the development of a pro-atherogenic plasma lipid profile.

AB In this paper, the event-triggered-based state estimation problem is investigated for a class of nonlinear networked control systems subjected to external disturbances. A novel event-triggered extended state observer (ESO) is utilized to estimate the so-called total disturbance, and an output predictor is adopted for the proposed ESO between two consecutive transmission instants. It is also worth pointing out that, in the newly proposed ESO, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted to update the measurement signal so as to save the communication resource. The sufficient conditions are provided such that the estimation error dynamics is exponentially ultimately bounded. Furthermore, it is proven that the Zeno behavior does not exist for the event-triggering rules. A number of numerical simulations are conducted to verify the validity of the theoretical results.

AB Moisture-induced damage represents one of the major challenges to the durability of asphalt pavement, which may lead to various premature distresses, such as cracking, ravelling and potholes. To reduce the moistureinduced damages, antistripping agents have been commonly used in asphalt mixtures. On the other hand, the fast-growing waste polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from the end-of-life plastic products poses a serious problem to the environment. How to recycle and reuse the waste PET is becoming a major concern. This study aims to develop a value-added recycling approach of reusing waste PET as an antistripping agent for asphalt mixture. To achieve this objective, waste PET was first collected and went through an aminolysis reaction to yield the amine-based PET additive, which was used to modify bitumen. The infrared spectrum of the PET additive was then characterized, followed by the evaluation of moisture susceptibility through the boiling test and indirect tensile strength (ITS) test. In addition, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to analyze the effect of the PET additive on the density and the cohesive energy density (CED) of the binder, and the interface bonding between binder and aggregate at the molecular level. The results from both experiments and MD simulation consistently indicate that the waste PET derived additive can effectively increase the resistance to moistureinduced damage of asphalt mixture.

ID CANCER; GROWTH; OPTIMIZATION; SIMULATION; APOPTOSIS; INDEXES
AB Linking individual cell behavior to changes on the cell population and ultimately tissue scale is a key step towards connecting in vitro laboratory experiments to clinically relevant organ-scale behavior. For example, understanding how an individual tumor cell's response to drug treatments propagates to the macroscale could help guide clinical decision making when tumors are located in high stakes regions. Based on how dying cells interact, macroscale tumor response can be dominated by tumor shrinkage, tumor damage, change in tumor porosity, or some combination of these phenomena. Here we focus on methods of modeling collective cell behavior with the overall goal of understanding how stochastic cell behavior will ultimately manifest on the cell population scale. To do this, we define and implement an agent-based model problem, introduce novel methods for interpreting simulation results, implement a recently developed technique for conducting a variance-based sensitivity analysis, and investigate key model parameters. Operating within an in silico framework allows us to compare our proposed methods with and without reproducible stochastic variations. This is critical because methods that will be functional for interpreting experimental data must also be able to function when aspects of stochastic variation are not reproducible. To demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods, we identify important simulation parameters for our agent-based model, show that two-dimensional and three-dimensional results are not directly equivalent, and highlight the macroscale implications of cell shrinkage. Looking forward, we anticipate that the methods and results presented here will contribute to significant future research in modeling stochastic cell behavior in the multiscale setting.

AB Timely responses to emergencies are critical for urban disaster and emergency management, particularly in densely populated mega-cities. Researchers and personnel involved in urban emergency management nowadays rely on computers to carry out complex evacuation planning. Agent-based modeling, which supports the representation of interactions among individuals and between individuals and their environments, has become a major approach to simulating evacuations wherein spatial-temporal dynamics and individual conditions need attention, such as congestion in urban areas. However, the development of optimal evacuation plans based upon agent-based evacuation simulations can be very time-consuming. In this study, to shorten the computation time to provide a timely response in an efficient way, we develop a knowledge database to store evacuation plans for typical population distributions generated by mobile phone location data. Subsequently, we use the prepared knowledge database (offline) to accelerate real-time (online) processes in searching for near-optimal evacuation plans. Our experimental result demonstrates that the evacuation plans generated with a knowledge database always outperform those that are generated without a knowledge database. Specifically, the knowledge database can reduce the computation time by an average of 96.76%, with an average fitness value improvement of 21.86%. This result confirms the effectiveness of our proposed approach in improving agent-based evacuation planning. With the rapid development of human sensor data collection and analysis, the estimation of a more accurate population distribution will become easier in future. Thus, we believe that the proposed approach of developing a knowledge database based on population distribution patterns will provide a more feasible alternative solution for evacuation planning in the practice of urban emergency management.

AB We pioneer the synthesis of well-defined high molar mass segmented copolymers, employing a unique combination of step-growth and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The Step-growth precursor polymer is obtained via the ambient temperature UV-light-induced Diels-Alder reaction of 6'-(propane-1,3-diylbis(oxy))bis(2-methylbenzaldehyde) (AA monomer) and di(isopropionic ethyl ester fumarate) trithiocarbonate (BB monomer). Unconventional off-stoichiometric conditions (r = [AA](0):[1313](0) = 1.5-1.75) are employed to ensure a sufficiently high incorporation of BB in the step-growth product (1200 <= M-n/g mol(-1) <= 3950). The optimum r value is based on a detailed product distribution analysis, comparing experimental and bivariate kinetic Monte Carlo generated data, using a scheme of over 200 reactions. The analysis highlights the unexpected occurrence of AA homopolymerization and the ligation of the resulting AA segments at higher reaction times. The precursor step-growth polymer is successfully transformed into a segmented copolymer via insertion of styrene by RAFT polymerization at 60 degrees C (11200 <= mol(-1) <= 53400), as confirmed both experimentally and through simulations.

AB Objectives: Widespread emergence of resistance to antimicrobial agents is a serious problem. The rate at which new agents are made available clinically is unlikely to keep up with these resistant pathogens, and there is an urgent need to accelerate antimicrobial agent development. We explored the use of mathematical modelling to guide selection of dosing regimens.
   Methods: Using time-kill studies data of Pseudomonas aeruginosa over 24 h, we developed a mathematical model to capture the dynamic relationship between a heterogeneous microbial population and meropenem concentrations. The microbial behaviour in response to meropenem over 5 days was predicted via computer simulation and subsequently validated using an in vitro hollow fibre infection model. Three parallel differential equations were used, each characterizing the rate of change of drug concentration, microbial susceptibility and microbial burden of the surviving population over time, respectively. Several model structures were explored; they differed in the adaptation of the microbial population over time. Various fluctuating concentration-time profiles of meropenem were experimentally examined, mimicking human elimination and repeated dosing.
   Results: Using limited experimental data as inputs, the mathematical model was reasonable in qualitatively predicting microbial response (sustained suppression or regrowth due to resistance emergence) to various pharmacokinetic profiles of meropenem.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that mathematical modelling may be used to predict microbial response to a large number of antimicrobial agent dosing regimens efficiently, and have the potential to be used to guide highly targeted investigation of dosing regimens in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The in vivo relevance of the modelling approach warrants further investigations.

AB This paper investigates the rightmost eigenvalue behavior of a class of single-delay large-scale consensus dynamics where information shared among the agents is delayed. We present an analytical approach that links stabilizing effects of delays to the finite number of graph Laplacian eigenvalues associated with the network and to the coupling strengths between the agents. In particular, we extend our previously developed concept called Responsible Eigenvalue (RE), which is concerned with the delay margin of the dynamics, to the analysis of how the infinitely many eigenvalues of the dynamics are configured on the complex plane. We show that, under certain conditions of the graph Laplacian eigenvalues, the rightmost eigenvalue can be placed farther from the imaginary axis of the complex plane for larger delays. This information leads to rules by which coupling strengths of the agents can be designed to reduce the settling time of the system, rendering the consensus dynamics delay tolerant. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the stabilizing effects of delays, including uncertainties in delays, and simulation results are presented to show the improvements in transient response of the consensus dynamics.

AB Agent-based modelling and simulation is a promising methodology that can be applied in the study of population dynamics. The main advantage of this technique is that it allows representing the particularities of the individuals that are modeled along with the interactions that take place among them and their environment. Hence, classical numerical simulation approaches are less adequate for reproducing complex dynamics. Nowadays, there is a rise of interest on using distributed computing to perform large-scale simulation of social systems. However, the inherent complexity of this type of applications is challenging and requires the study of possible solutions from the parallel computing perspective (e.g., how to deal with fine grain or irregular workload). In this paper, we discuss the particularities of simulating populating dynamics by using parallel discrete event simulation methodologies. To illustrate our approach, we present a possible solution to make transparent the use of parallel simulation for modeling demographic systems: Yades tool. In Yades, modelers can easily define models that describe different demographic processes with a web user interface and transparently run them on any computer architecture environment thanks to its demographic simulation library and code generator. Therefore, transparency is provided by two means: the provision of a web user interface where modelers and policy makers can specify their agent-based models with the tools they are familiar with, and the automatic generation of the simulation code that can be executed in any platform (cluster or supercomputer). A study is conducted to evaluate the performance of our solution in a High Performance Computing environment. The main benefit of this outline is that our findings can be generalized to problems with similar characteristics to our demographic simulation model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The acid-catalyzed deprotection of glassy poly(4-hydroxystyrene-co-tertbutyl acrylate) films was studied with infrared absorbance spectroscopy and stochastic simulations. Experimental data were interpreted with a simple description of subdiffusive acid transport coupled to second-order acid loss. This model predicts key attributes of observed deprotection rates, such as fast reaction at short times, slow reaction at long times, and a nonlinear dependence on acid loading. Fickian diffusion is approached by increasing the postexposure bake temperature or adding plasticizing agents to the polymer resin. These findings demonstrate that acid mobility and overall deprotection kinetics are coupled to glassy matrix dynamics. To complement the analysis of bulk kinetics, acid diffusion lengths were calculated from the anomalous transport model and compared with nano-pattern line widths. The consistent scaling between experiments and simulations suggests that the anomalous diffusion model could be further developed into a predictive lithography tool.

AB We study the estimation of static games of incomplete information with multiple equilibria. A static game is a generalization of a discrete choice model, such as a multinomial logit or probit, which allows the actions of a group of agents to be interdependent. While the estimator we study is quite flexible, in most cases it can be easily implemented using standard statistical packages such as STATA. We also propose an algorithm for simulating the model which finds all equilibria to the game. As an application of our estimator, we study recommendations for high technology stocks between 1998-2003. We find that strategic motives, typically ignored in the empirical literature, appear to be an important consideration in the recommendations submitted by equity analysts.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB Stated choice surveys have been used for several decades to estimate preferences of agents using choice models, and are widely applied in the transportation domain. Different types of experimental designs that underlie such surveys have been used in practice. In unlabelled experiments, where all alternatives are described by the same generic utility function, such designs may suffer from choice tasks containing a dominant alternative. Also in labelled experiments with alternative specific attributes and constants such dominance may occur, but to a lesser extent. We show that dominant alternatives are problematic because they affect scale and may bias parameter estimates. We propose a new measure based on minimum regret to calculate dominance and automatically detect such choice tasks in an experimental design or existing dataset. This measure is then used to define a new experimental design type that removes dominance and ensures the making of trade-offs between attributes. Finally, we propose a new regret-scaled multinomial logit model that takes the level of dominance within a choice task into account. Results using simulated and empirical data show that the presence of dominant alternatives can bias model estimates, but by making scale a function of a smooth approximation of normalised minimum regret we can properly account for scale differences without the need to remove choice tasks with dominant alternatives from the dataset.

AB In this work we discuss different factors governing coil-globule coexistence in the compaction process of DNA. We initially analyse the role played by fluctuations in the degree of binding of an external compacting agent in the conformational behavior of the chain backbone. The analysis relies both on Monte Carlo simulation results and simple statistical approaches. Compacting agents of various binding characteristics are taken into consideration and the degree of charge neutralization upon the chain is related to conformational indicators. Selected model systems comprising stiff chains in the presence of multivalent ions are employed to assess intrinsic single-chain conformational fluctuation, in the presence of external agents but not resulting from differences in binding. It is shown that trends found for a variety of compacting agents, including the extension of the coil-globule coexistence regions, can be ratio-nalised on the basis of this analysis.

AB This paper analyses bidder behaviour in the German photovoltaic (PV) auction pilot. It uses a novel approach combining insights from data analysis and decision theory to optimise an agent-based simulation model. We model both a uniform pricing (UP) scheme, a pay-as-bid (PAB) scheme, and a benchmark case, where agents adapt their bidding strategy. The findings are contrasted with empirical auction outcomes. The comparison shows that, especially in the early rounds, bid prices were above the costs-possibly due to uncertainties and false expectations concerning competition. This is particularly visible in the first round. Adapting their expectations to a higher competition level, bidders in the pay-as-bid simulation subsequently decrease their bids. From simulating a separate auction for amble land bidders, we see that this bidder type reduces support costs substantially and that an implicitly discriminatory auction yields more aggressive bids and can induce further cost reductions.

AB In recent years, the tissue optical clearing (OC) technique in the biomedicine field has drawn lots of attention. Various physical and chemical methods have been introduced to improve the efficacy of OC. In this study, the effect of the combination of glycerol and ultrasound treatment on OC of in vitro porcine muscle tissues has been investigated. The refractive index (RI) matching mechanism of OC was directly observed based on the derivative total reflection method. A theoretical model was used to simulate the proportion of tissue fluid in the illuminated area. Moreover, the total transmittance spectra have been obtained by a spectrometer over the range from 450 nm to 700 nm. The administration of glycerol and ultrasound has led to an increase of the RI of background medium and a more RI matching environment was achieved. The experimental results support the validity of the ultrasound treatment for OC. The RI matching mechanism has been firstly quantitatively analyzed based on the derivative total reflection method.

AB Automated Negotiation is a growing area of research in recent years as it provides a mechanism for intelligent agents representing people and institutions to coordinate their behavior in a complex environment under rational selfish assumptions. Most research in this area assumes either a single negotiation thread with a well-defined utility function for each agent involved or a set of concurrent negotiations with an ordering of outcomes in each local negotiation. In this paper, we consider an agent engaged in a set of concurrent negotiations with a utility function defined only for the complete set of agreements in all of them and no locally defined ordering of outcomes in any negotiation. The paper presents an algorithm that allows such agent to maximize its expected global utility by orchestrating its behavior in all negotiation threads. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and empirically using simulation in the context of a trading market.

AB In the present study, the effect of different types of iron oxides, which naturally exist on steel substrate, on the interfacial interaction between an epoxy coating and a carbon steel substrate was studied at the molecular/atomic level by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics (QM) calculations. Three types of iron oxide, that is, ferrous oxide (FeO), ferric oxide (Fe2O3, hematite), and ferrous ferric oxide (Fe3O4, magnetite), were considered for modeling, and their binding energies were calculated and compared by altering the concentration of hydroxide groups on the surface. To probe the effect of curing agent on interfacial interactions, computations were performed for either uncured or aminoamide-cured epoxy resins. The effect of the acid-base properties of the iron oxide on the molecular bonding was theoretically investigated by imposing diverse iron hydroxide/oxide termination groups. Noticeably, MD and QM calculations confirmed rather well earlier experimental evaluations on iron oxide acid base properties obtained through X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements in the view of chemisorption of different epoxy compounds. However, the interaction behavior of cured epoxy with hydroxylated iron oxide surfaces was quantified mechanistically in the current work from a closer view. For instance, it was found that aminoamide-cured epoxy was adsorbed on all oxide substrates through a mechanism of electrostatic and donor acceptor interactions, with binding energies of -113.6, -1035.9, and -304.4 kcal/mol respectively assigned to FeO, Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 iron oxides. In the case of a hydroxylated surface, aminoamide-conjugated epoxy adhesive was found in the hydrogen bond interface as well, which was evidence of strengthened binding at a surface populated by hydroxide groups. Moreover, theoretical explorations showed that the type of covalent linkage between the curing molecule and epoxy resin governs the extent of cured epoxy adhesion to the surface of iron oxide.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate dentin protection of different desensitizing varnishes (light- and self-curing) during acid action/abrasion stress and thermocyclic loading in vitro.
   Methods: Dentin discs of 2 mm thickness were cut from 120 human molars, embedded, and polished. Specimens were randomized into five groups (n=24): A, negative control; B, Gluma Desensitizer; C, Cervitec plus (self-curing); D, Seal & Protect; and E, Admira Protect (lightcuring). In groups B-E, varnish was applied on two-thirds of the dentin surface, and one-third acted as internal control. Stress cycle (2 cycles/day) for specimens were as follows: 1, acid action (pH: 2.9: five minutes); 2, remineralization (synthetic saliva: 60 minutes); 3, brushing (100 strokes); 4, thermocycling (five cycles); and 5, remineralization (synthetic saliva: six hours) for each group (n=12) for 30 (15 days) or 60 times (30 days). Specimens were analyzed using an incident light microscope. Substance loss was measured in micrometers. Statistical analysis was performed with the multiple contrast test (p < 0.05).
   Results: Groups B and C had a significantly lower dentin loss than A (p < 0.01). After 30 days, group A showed the highest dentin loss (p < 0.01), whereas the other groups lacked a significant difference regarding their substance loss (dentin and/or varnish; p > 0.05). Varnish layer loss was shown for groups D and E with a remaining protective layer; groups A-C showed dentin removal.
   Conclusion: All four varnishes are protective compared with an untreated control. Light-curing varnishes might provide higher dentin protection than self-curing materials.

AB We study the dynamics of a class of bi-agent logistics systems consisting of two types of agents interacting on an arbitrary complex network. By approximating the system with simple microscopic models and solving them analytically, we reveal some universal dynamical features and propose applications of such features for system optimisations. Large-scale agent-based numerical simulations are also carried out to explore more realistic and complicated systems, with interesting emergent behaviours that can be well understood from our analytical studies. Using the taxi system as a typical logistics system with commuters and empty taxis as two types of agents, we illustrate two dynamical phases with distinct behaviours, separated by a phase boundary that can be identified as the optimal number of taxis for a particular taxi system. These features and the tuning of the optimal number of taxis can be applied to various situations, including taxi systems allowing real-time dynamical ride-sharing.

ID GAMES
AB We study an evolutionary version of the spatial prisoner's dilemma game (SPD), where the agents are placed in a random graph. For graphs with fixed connectivity, alpha, we show that for low values of alpha the final density of cooperating agents, rho(c) depends on the initial conditions. However, if the graphs have large connectivities rho(c) is independent of the initial conditions. We characterize the phase diagram of the system, using both, extensive numerical simulations and analytical computations. It is shown that two well defined behaviors are present: a Nash equilibrium, where the final density of cooperating agents rho c is constant, and a non-stationary region, where pc fluctuates in time. Moreover, we study the SPD in Poisson random graphs and find that the phase diagram previously developed looses its meaning. In fact, only one regime may be defined. This regime is characterized by a non stationary final state where the density of cooperating agents varies in time. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, the bond behavior of corroded reinforced concrete was investigated by conducting pull-out tests on concrete specimens with variable induced crack widths and different splitting modes. To simulate cracks due to corrosion and focus on their effect on bond strength degradation, a novel method using expansion agent filled pipes is proposed. With the increase of the crack width over elapsed time from filling the aluminum pipe with an expansion agent, a target crack width was obtained. The results confirm that the type of splitting greatly influences the reduction in bond strength with deterioration of bond strength more severe in "Side-split" than in "Single-split." Furthermore, using the surface crack width as a variable, empirical formulas to predict bond strength degradation due to corrosion of rebar are proposed. These prediction models give a good correlation when compared to the available literature.

AB The discovery of mirror neurons has given rise to a number of interpretations of their functions together with speculations on their potential role in the evolution of specifically human capacities. Thus, mirror neurons have been thought to ground many aspects of human social cognition, including the capacity to engage in cooperative collective actions and to understand them. We propose an evaluation of this latter claim. On the one hand, we will argue that mirror neurons do not by themselves provide a sufficient basis for the forms of agentive understanding and shared intentionality involved in cooperative collective actions. On the other hand, we will also argue that mirror neurons can nevertheless play an important role in an account of the production and understanding of joint action, insofar as they provide the basic constituents of implicit agent-neutral representations and are useful elements in a process of online mutual adjustment of participants' actions.

AB Young adulthood is a developmental phase when individuals must navigate a changing social milieu that involves considering how their decisions affect close others such as parents and peers. To date, no empirical work has directly evaluated how young adults weigh these relationships against one another. We conducted a preregistered experiment in which we pitted outcomes for parents against outcomes for friends. Participants (N = 174, ages 18-30 years) played two runs of the Columbia Card Task-one in which gains benefited a parent and losses were incurred by a friend and another in which the opposite was true. We also tested whether age, relationship quality, and reward type earned for parents and friends (simulated vs. real) acted as moderating influences on parent-friend prioritization. Results showed that individuals were more likely to make decisions that benefited a parent at the expense of a friend. Relationship quality and reward type moderated this effect, whereas age did not.

AB 51 gnotobiotic and 63 conventional, one-, or two-days-old piglets were divided into five groups and infected orally with Isospora suis or rotavirus alone, or with both agents simultaneously or successively with alternative sequences and various intervals.  15 gnotobiotic and 10 conventional piglets served as controls.  The development of small intestinal lesions after infection with I. suis was biphasic.  The dominant alterations resulting from rotavirus infection was villus atrophy, considerably more pronounced and extensive in gnotobiotic than in conventional piglets. Synergistic action of I. suis and rotavirus was manifested both clinically, and morphologically.  This action culminated at the time of the actual, or presumed development of merogony of I. suis, i.e. on DPI 3 to 5.  The action develops only if the intestinal epithelium is damaged functionally and morphologically by a preceding rotavirus infection.  It is concluded that the synergistic action is based on a competition of rotavirus and I. suis for mature, enzymatically active absorptive cells.

AB Public Goods Games (PGGs) are a standard experimental economic approach to studying cooperative behaviour. There are two types of games: discrete-time and continuous-time PGGs. While discrete-time PGGs (one-shot decisions about contributions to public goods) can be easily done as lab experiments, continuous-time PGGs (where participants can change contributions at any time) are much harder to realise within a lab environment. This is mainly because it is difficult to consider events happening in continuous time in lab experiments. Simulation offers an opportunity to support real-world lab experiments and is well suited to explore continuous-time PGGs. In this paper, we show how to apply our recently developed ABOOMS (Agent-Based Object-Oriented Modelling and Simulation) development framework to create models for simulation-supported continuous-time PGG studies. The ABOOMS framework utilizes Software Engineering techniques to support the development at the macro level (considering the overall study lifecycle) and at the micro level (considering individual steps related to simulation model development). Our case study shows that outputs from the simulation-supported continuous-time PGG generate dynamics that do not exist in discrete-time setting, highlighting the fact that it is important to study both, discrete and continuous-time PGGs.

AB Purpose: Thromboembolic stroke models in animals closely simulate human embolic stroke, However, great intrinsic variability in the size of the ischemic lesions that are produced makes evaluation of the success of later therapies difficult. Diffusion and perfusion MRI can be employed to assess the size, and subsequent status, of experimental and clinical stroke subjects undergoing thrombolytic therapy,
   Methods: Beginning 30 minutes after embolization of the middle cerebral artery territory with autologous clot, 15 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to treatment with a 30-minute infusion of either t-PA or saline, Serial, whole-brain, diffusion-weighted mapping studies were performed before, during, and after the t-PA (or saline) infusion to quantitatively identify the ischemic region. Bolus tracking perfusion imaging with gadolinium trimeglumine was performed before clot injection, just before treatment, and 30 minutes after the t-PA infusion, Infarction volume at 24 hours after embolization was calculated using 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining, Animals with pre-treatment ischemic lesion volumes less than 100 mm(3) were excluded to reduce the variability of the model,
   Results: The volume of the ischemic lesion showed no statistically significant difference in the t-PA group as compared to controls (n = 7 per group), When one control animal with spontaneous reperfusion was excluded, the diffusion imaging studies showed a significantly smaller ischemic lesion volume in the t-PA group at 60, 90, and 120 minutes after embolization (P < .05). Perfusion imaging documented reduced flow before treatment in all animals, improvement after treatment in four of seven t-PA animals, and spontaneous reperfusion in one control animal,
   Conclusion: This pilot study demonstrates that diffusion and perfusion imaging can be used to evaluate thrombolytic therapy in a thromboembolic stroke model in vivo.

AB We propose a system to simulate, analyze and visualize occupant behavior in urban environments by combining parametric modeling and agent-based simulation. A procedurally generated 3D city model, with semantic information about the functions and behaviors of buildings, is automatically populated with artificial agents (i.e. pedestrians, cars, and public transport vehicles). In a simulation the built environment and the agents interact with each other. The system identifies empiric correlations between properties such as: functions of buildings and other urban elements, population density, utilization and capacity of the public transport network, and congestion effect on the street network. Practical applications include the assessment of a) bottlenecks, b) public transit efficiency, c) accessibility of amenities, d) quality of service of public transport and the traffic network, as well as e) the stress level and exhaustion of pedestrians. All these aspects ultimately relate to the quality of life within the given urban areas. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Complex organizations exhibit surprising, nonlinear behavior. Although organization scientists have studied complex organizations for many years, a developing set of conceptual and computational tools makes possible new approaches to modeling nonlinear interactions within and between organizations. Complex adaptive system models represent a genuinely new way of simplifying the complex. They are characterized by four key elements: agents with schemata, self-organizing networks sustained by importing energy, coevolution to the edge of chaos, and system evolution based on recombination. New types of models that incorporate these elements will push organization science forward by merging empirical observation with computational agent-based simulation. Applying complex adaptive systems models to strategic management leads to an emphasis on building systems that can rapidly evolve effective adaptive solutions. Strategic direction of complex organizations consists of establishing and modifying environments within which effective, improvised, self-organized solutions can evolve. Managers influence strategic behavior by altering the fitness landscape for local agents and reconfiguring the organizational architecture within which agents adapt.

AB As an aluminosilicate mineral, natural zeolite can inhibit sediment nutrient release by forming an active coating layer on the sediment surface. Laboratory experiments demonstrated the inhibitory effects of zeolite on sediment phosphorus release. And the influence of temperature, disturbance, pH value, the thickness and particles size of the zeolite on phosphorus release was also investigated. Phosphors release experiments were simulated in a cylinder 600 mm high, 60 mm inner diameter, 70 mm outer diameter over a period of 60 d. The results showed that at 30 d, the total phosphorus (TP) release intensity of the experimental group was 48% of the control group, and the inhibitory effect tended to be stable after 30 d. The effect of the zeolite to prevent P release is sequentially affected by the temperature, zeolite thickness, pH, and zeolite particle size, but is not affected by the disturbance. Moreover, the unit price of zeolite which inhibits the release of phosphorus in sediments is 2.78 yuan/m(2), which is very economical. This indicates that the use of a small amount of zeolite can effectively suppress the release of phosphorus in a large amount of sediment.

AB The relative binding thermodynamics of trimethoprim [2,4-diamino-5-(3',4',5'-trimethoxybenzyl)pyrimidine] congeners to chicken dihydrofolate reductase are determined by free energy simulation methods.  The congeners considered in this study represent methoxy to ethyl substitutions at the 3'-, 4'-, and 5'-positions of trimethoprim found at the benzyl portion of the inhibitor.  Molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-inhibitor complexes, and the evaluation of potential energy interactions between inhibitor and protein, were evaluated for their ability to predict trends similar to those found for the thermodynamic simulations.  The relative free energy trends for the 3',5'-diethyl and 3',4',5'-triethyl derivatives of trimethoprim follow those observed experimentally for identical inhibitor compounds.  An observation of a reversal of enzyme preference for species with 3'- or 5'-ethyl functional groups, depending on the absence or presence of a 4'-ethyl group, demonstrates complex influences by active site atoms on the relative thermodynamics of inhibitor binding.  Potential energy data derived from molecular dynamics of inhibitor-protein complexes show no demonstrable correlation to experimental results or calculated thermodynamic data.

AB Synechocystis sp., a common unicellular freshwater cyanobacterium, has been used as a model organism to study phototaxis, an ability to move in the direction of a light source. This microorganism displays a number of additional characteristics such as delayed motion, surface dependence, and a quasi-random motion, where cells move in a seemingly disordered fashion instead of in the direction of the light source, a global force on the system. These unexplained motions are thought to be modulated by local interactions between cells such as intercellular communication. In this paper, we consider only local interactions of these phototactic cells in order to mathematically model this quasi-random motion. We analyze an experimental data set to illustrate the presence of quasi-random motion and then derive a stochastic dynamic particle system modeling interacting phototactic cells. The simulations of our model are consistent with experimentally observed phototactic motion. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper presents a load-balanced resource directory (LB-RD) architecture based on the constrained application protocol (CoAP), and is aimed at addressing the scalability issue with the centralized resource discovery approach in large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) local networks. To balance the traffic load due to a large number of messages concentrated on the resource directory (RD), the LB-RD serves as an intermediary agent between the servers and the RD. Its architecture includes the following three essential functional blocks: server group management (SGM), message aggregation (MA), and message forwarding scheduling (MFS). The SGM manages the uniform resource identifier (URI) list for a group of servers associated with the LB-RD. The MA aggregates the registration/update messages received from the servers into a single aggregated message. Finally, the MFS determines the forwarding time for the LB-RD to send its aggregated message to the RD. To verify the effectiveness of the LB-RD architecture, an experimental simulation is conducted under various scenarios. The results show that the LB-RD architecture achieves better performance than the existing RD approach in terms of the number of lost messages and the message loss rate.

Then, the dimethylamino groups of the APA-TFC membrane surface were furthermore converted into the QAC through the quaternarization of 5-chloromethylsalicylaldehyde. The experimental results showed that QAC and SA synergistically endowed the membrane with the durable anti-biofouling properties by acting as the anti-microbial agents and bacteria contact-killers, alternatively SA endowed the membrane with the high chlorine resistance as the chlorine-consumer, and QAC could also endow the membrane with the high hydrophilicity as the hydrophilic material. Under the optimized modifying conditions, the chlorine and biofouling had almost no influence on the water flux and salt rejection of the modified membrane during the filtration process fortunately.

AB Experimental studies of photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) of VX-gas simulation substance cysteamine-S-phosphate sodium salt (NaHPO3S-CH2-CH2-NH2, CPSS) at various initial concentrations and pH were undertaken. PCO ultimately resulted in complete mineralisation of CPSS. The PCO byproducts of CPSS include acetate, oxalate and trace amounts of formate ions. The formation rates of acetate and phosphate were equal to the rate of degradation of CPSS, which indicates easy breakage of P-S, C-S and C-N bonds. Sulphate was formed more slowly due to stepwise oxidation of reduced sulphur. Amino group, generally transformed to ammonia, was partially oxidised to nitrite and nitrate in alkaline media. The fastest mineralisation in terms of both TOC degradation and phosphate formation was observed in neutral media. Under neutral media conditions, the PCO rate increased linearly with the CPSS concentration increase. The maximum efficiency by TOC degradation was observed as large as 77 mg per Wh of incident UV flux with quantum efficiency 3.8%.

AB The present study reports the preparation and performance evaluation of a new class of hybrid sorbent that is, (i) magnetically active, (ii) selective toward a wide array of target inorganic and organic environmental contaminants, and (iii) amenable to efficient regeneration and reuse. The preparation of this material is operationally simple and involves partial sulfonation of a widely available polymeric material, followed by dispersion of iron oxide nanoparticles within the polymer phase using a simple chemical -thermal technique developed earlier. Experimental results show that the new sorbent material, referred to as dual-zone sorbent (DZS), can remove arsenites or As(III); arsenates or As(V); copper(II); and dichlorophenol, a synthetic organic compound, simultaneously in addition to being magnetically active. These new hybrid particles exhibit complementary attributes that are not present in currently available commercial polymeric or inorganic ion exchangers. The newly developed polymeric-inorganic material can be used as a passive monitoring agent for the detection of a diverse group of environmental contaminants.

AB The amine-grafted and mercapto-grafted SBA-15 mesoporous silica were synthesized successfully via hydrothermal method. These functionalized mesoporous silica were prepared by direct co-condensation and post-synthesis grafting processes and then used as adsorbents to remove the Cu2+ from the simulated water. The obtained mesoporous adsorbent was characterized by X-ray diffraction, nitrogen adsorption-desorption analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental results showed that mesoporous materials can be grafted functional groups successfully without significant change of the hexagonal mesostructure after the functionalization process, but the adsorption capacity of copper ions was greatly enhanced and the adsorption amount was up to 99.68%. Compared with post-synthesis grafting processes, because the direct co-condensation templating agent was not completely removed which affects the adsorption capacity. It was demonstrated that the functionalized mesoporous silica could be used as a promising adsorbent for removing and recovering heavy metal ions in water.

ID SODIUM-ACETATE TRIHYDRATE; NUCLEATION
AB Recently, there has been considerable interest in heat storage materials. Among them, sodium acetate trihydrate (melting point: 58 degrees C; latent heat: 264 kg/kg) is a suitable latent heat storage material for recovering and using exhaust heat in a temperature range lower than 100 degrees C, which is discharged in homes and factories. The purpose of this study was to investigate the heat storage and release behavior of sodium acetate trihydrate in a thin-vessel heat storage unit (160 mm x 130 mm x 4.8 mm) made of glass and polycarbonate. The sodium acetate trihydrate in the unit was heated or cooled by flowing water in water channels (width: 1 mm) disposed on both sides of the heat storage unit. From the experimental results, performance deterioration was evident in the heat storage and release process of sodium acetate trihydrate due to phase separation during heat storage and supercooling during heat release. Therefore, a thickener and a nucleating agent were added to sodium acetate trihydrate to suppress phase separation and supercooling effects. The results revealed that the thickener and nucleating agent were unevenly distributed in the case of repeated heat storage and release. The heat transfer numerical simulation adopting the lumped capacitance model was confirmed to be useful for investigating the melting behavior of sodium acetate trihydrate.

TI Effect of network topology and node centrality on trading
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB Global supply networks in agriculture, manufacturing, and services are a defining feature of the modern world. The efficiency and the distribution of surpluses across different parts of these networks depend on the choices of intermediaries. This paper conducts price formation experiments with human subjects located in large complex networks to develop a better understanding of the principles governing behavior. Our first experimental finding is that prices are larger and that trade is significantly less efficient in small-world networks as compared to random networks. Our second experimental finding is that location within a network is not an important determinant of pricing. An examination of the price dynamics suggests that traders on cheapest-and hence active-paths raise prices while those off these paths lower them. We construct an agent-based model (ABM) that embodies this rule of thumb. Simulations of this ABM yield macroscopic patterns consistent with the experimental findings. Finally, we extrapolate the ABM on to significantly larger random and small-world networks and find that network topology remains a key determinant of pricing and efficiency.

ID EARLY PLEISTOCENE; CANNIBALISM; EURASIA; SPAIN
AB After more than 100,000 years of evolutionary success in Western Eurasia, Neanderthals rapidly went extinct between 40,000 and 30,000 years ago, almost coinciding with the spread of Anatomically Modern Homo sapiens (AMHS) in Europe. Several scenarios relate their extinction to competition with AMHS, climatic changes during the last glacial period or a combination of both. Here we propose a much simpler scenario, in which the cannibalistic behaviour of Neanderthals may have played a major role in their eventual extinction. We show that this trait was selected as a common behaviour at moments of environmental or population stress. However, as soon as Neanderthals had to compete with another species that consumed the same resources (AMHS in this case) cannibalism had a negative impact, leading, in the end, to their extinction. To test this hypothesis, we used an agent-based model computer simulation. The model is simple, with only traits, behaviours and landscape features defined and with no attempt to re-create the exact landscape in which Neanderthals lived or their cultural characteristics. The basic agent of our system is a group of individuals that form a community. The most important state variable of our model is the location of the group, coupled with a defined home range and two additional factors: cannibalism and the chance of fission. The result of the simulation shows that cannibalistic behaviour is always selected when resources are scarce and clustered. However, when a non-cannibalistic species (late Pleistocene AMHS) is introduced into the same environment, the cannibalistic species retreats and the new species grows until it has reached the carrying capacity of the system. The cannibalistic populations that still survive are displaced from the richest areas, and live on the borders with arid zones, a situation which is remarkably similar to what we know about the end of the Neanderthals.

AB With cutting-edge live microscopy and image analysis, biologists can now systematically track individual cells in complex tissues and quantify cellular behavior over extended time windows. Computational approaches that utilize the systematic and quantitative data are needed to understand how cells interact in vivo to give rise to the different cell types and 3D morphology of tissues. An agent-based, minimum descriptive modeling and analysis framework is presented in this paper to study C. elegans embryogenesis. The framework is designed to incorporate the large amounts of experimental observations on cellular behavior and reserve data structures/interfaces that allow regulatory mechanisms to be added as more insights are gained. Observed cellular behaviors are organized into lineage identity, timing and direction of cell division, and path of cell movement. The framework also includes global parameters such as the eggshell and a clock. Division and movement behaviors are driven by statistical models of the observations. Data structures/interfaces are reserved for gene list, cell-cell interaction, cell fate and landscape, and other global parameters until the descriptive model is replaced by a regulatory mechanism. This approach provides a framework to handle the ongoing experiments of single-cell analysis of complex tissues where mechanistic insights lag data collection and need to be validated on complex observations.

AB Fibre/matrix interfacial properties and interfacial shear strengths (IFSS) in epoxy composites reinforced by dual basalt and SiC fibres (DFC) were investigated by the fragmentation method combined with acoustic emission (AE) analysis. Statistical analysis of fibre tensile strength was performed in terms of statistical parameters. The tensile strength and elongation of basalt and SIC fibres decreased with increasing gauge length because of the size effect. Fibre tensile strengths above an optimum concentration decreased because of the stress concentrations at lumps in the coating. When an amino-silane coupling agent was used, the IFSS showed significant improvements of more than three times under dry conditions. The IFSS was also considerably improved under wet conditions. This environmental effect is probably due to chemical and hydrogen bonds as well as to interdiffusion effects in two different interphases in the fibre/silane-coupling-agent/epoxy-matrix system. In situ monitoring of AE during the straining of DFC specimens showed the sequential occurrence of two distinct groups of AE data. The first group may have come from fibre breakages, and the second mainly from cracking of the epoxy matrix. Characteristic frequencies coming from the different failure modes of the fibres and epoxy matrix were investigated by fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis. By setting an appropriate threshold level, a one-to-one correspondence between the number of AE events and fibre breakages was established. This AE method could be correlated well with the fragmentation technique of obtaining the IFSS value. It can be also be applied to semi- or non-transparent composites where visual observation is not possible. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Glutamine (gln)-supplemented University of Wisconsin (UW) solution improves overall small bowel (SB) preservation. Sustained gln metabolism in a system devoid of hepatic detoxification will necessarily result in the accumulation of pH active end products leading to nonphysiologic pH shifts. We hypothesized that simultaneous addition of N,N-bis[2-hydroxyethyl]-2-aminoethane sulfonic, acid (BES), a known buffering agent, would potentiate the beneficial effect of gln supplementation by addressing the fundamental metabolic principle of pH homeostasis.
   Methods. Sprague-Dawley SB rats were administered a vascular flush with one of four solutions: UW; UW+90 mM BES (UWB); UW+2% gln (UWG); or UW+2% gln+90 mM BES (UVBG). Indices of energetics, barrier function, gln catabolism, and histology (light and electron microscopy) were assessed over a 10-hr cold storage time course.
   Results. Superior gln utilization in the UWBG group was indicated by elevated levels of key catabolites (glutamate, aspartate, glycine, ammonia). The addition of BES and gln resulted in significantly higher levels of all energetic parameters (ATP, total adenylates) at 10 hr compared with UW, UWB, and/or UWG. Barrier function was markedly improved after 10 hr storage in the UWBG group; mannitol permeability was 169 nmol/cm(2)/hr versus 572 and 445 nmol/cm(2)/hr (for UW and UWG, respectively). Histologic injury at 10 hr was 5.5,7.5, and 8 (Park's grade) for UWBG, UWG, and UW. Ultrastructural damage was markedly reduced with UWBG, as assessed by grade of mitochondria damage.
   Conclusion. This study strongly supports that the beneficial effects of gln-enriched UW solution can be amplified when combined with an effective buffering agent such as BES.

AB In nucleophilic substitution reactions at carbonyl centres, there are two possible channels. The first one occurs when the attack of nucleophilic agents takes place simultaneously with the departure of the nucleofuge. This process is named as concerted. The second possibility is the formation of a reaction intermediate, typically a tetrahedral intermediate from which the nucleofuge departs after passing through a second transition state. This second mechanism is defined as stepwise. Whether a concerted or stepwise mechanism is to be expected for a given reaction depends on several factors. Among these determinants are the nucleophilicity of the attacking group, the leaving group ability of the nucleofuge, and the solvent, which affects both the stability of the intermediate or the transition states involved. The role of the electrophilic centre can however become an important factor that can determine the reaction mechanism. In this work we show that the group nucleophilic Fukui function model may be used to rationalize and to predict the reaction mechanism of the title compounds towards alicyclic amines. In general, when the electrophilic carbon centre is attached to the soft sulfur atom, the reaction mechanism is predicted to follow a stepwise route. When the electrophilic carbon atom is attached to a harder oxygen centre, the reaction mechanism is determined by chemical substitution at the nucleofuge moiety. Experimental verification for a set of four substrates is presented. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB The present in vitro study aimed to assess the effects of root surface mechanical instrumentation on the marginal integrity and adaptation of resin composite crowns. The following null hypotheses were tested: no differences exist between finish line and 1) marginal gap or 2) marginal microleakage before and after manual mechanical periodontal maintenance.
   A total of 56 intact human mandibular molars were randomly distributed into four groups and subjected to standardized tooth preparations for indirect composite crowns with different marginal finish lines (90 degrees shoulder, beveled 90 degrees shoulder, feather edge, chamfer). One-half of the specimens was used as a control and remained untreated, and the remaining half was subjected to root surface procedures simulating five years of semestral mechanical supportive periodontal treatment. The marginal gap and microleakage were evaluated and statistically analyzed.
   The specimens used as controls showed lower mean marginal gaps than those subjected to the simulated periodontal treatment, whereas the latter showed lower microleakage than the control crowns. Statistically significant differences were recorded for both the experimental variables.
   The root surface procedures resulted in altered surfaces of the composite crowns. The marginal gap increased after the treatment, whereas the marginal microleakage was reduced. The 90 degrees shoulder and the chamfer preparation could be considered a viable option to fabricate composite crowns, but the beveled 90 degrees shoulder and the feather edge should not be recommended.

DE Relative Agreement Model; Opinion Dynamics; Agent-Based Simulation
AB We present a brief history of models of opinion dynamics in groups of agents, and summarise work from the creation of the Bounded Confidence model (Krause 2000; Hegselmann and Krause 2002) through to the more recent development of the Relative Agreement (RA) model (Deffuant et al. 2002; Deffuant 2006). In the RA model, randomly-selected pairs of agents interact, expressing their opinions and their confidence in those opinions; and each agent then updates their own opinion on the basis of the new information. The two seminal RA papers (Deffuant et al. 2002, Deffuant 2006), both published in JASSS, each present simulation results from the RA model that we have attempted to independently replicate. We have surveyed over 150 papers that cite Deffuant et al. 2002, yet have found no prior independent replications of the key empirical results for the RA model presented in the 2002 paper. We have each written a separate implementation of the RA model (one in Java, one in Python, both published in full as appendices to this paper) which we therefore believe to be the first independent replications of the RA model as published in the 2002 JASSS paper. We find that both our implementations of the RA model generate results that are in good agreement with each other, but both of which differ very significantly from those presented by Deffuant et al.. Our results are presented along with an analysis and discussion where we argue from first principles that our results are more plausible than those published in the 2002 JASSS paper. We close with discussion of the relevance of this model, along with future applicability.

AB The development and application of seawater sea-sand concrete (SSSC) can effectively reduce the utilisation of natural resources for producing concrete, thereby protecting ecological environments. However, the durability of reinforced SSSC is an important aspect. Previous studies have shown that the addition of fibres and expansive agents (EAs) can improve the durability of reinforced concrete structures by controlling crack development, reducing concrete porosity, and enhancing the tensile strength of concrete. In this study, the compressive behaviour of SSSC containing glass fibres (GFs) and EAs was studied. Furthermore, tests were performed to evaluate the combined effects of fibre length, GF content, and EA content on the workability of fresh concrete and the failure mechanism, compressive strength, strain at peak stress, and toughness of hardened concrete. It was found that the addition of GFs and EAs significantly improved the compressive performance of SSSC. The characteristics of compressive stress-strain curves were analysed and a constitutive model that could simulate the compressive stress-strain relationship of SSSC containing GFs and EAs was proposed. These outcomes are expected to provide experimental support and theoretical guidelines for designing SSSC structures.

AB Simulations were carried out to analyze a promising new antimicrobial treatment strategy for targeting antibiotic-resistant bacteria called the beta-lactamase-dependent prodrug delivery system. In this system, the antibacterial drugs are delivered as inactive precursors that only become activated after contact with an enzyme characteristic of many species of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (beta-lactamase enzyme). The addition of an activation step contributes an extra layer of complexity to the system that can lead to unexpected emergent behavior. In order to optimize for treatment success and minimize the risk of resistance development, there must be a clear understanding of the system dynamics taking place and how they impact on the overall response. It makes sense to use a systems biology approach to analyze this method because it can facilitate a better understanding of the complex emergent dynamics arising from diverse interactions in populations. This paper contains an initial theoretical examination of the dynamics of this system of activation and an assessment of its therapeutic potential from a theoretical standpoint using an agent-based modeling approach. It also contains a case study comparison with real-world results from an experimental study carried out on two prodrug candidate compounds in the literature.

AB Cell-to-cell adhesion is an important aspect of malignant spreading that is often observed in images from the experimental cell biology literature. Since cell-to-cell adhesion plays an important role in controlling the movement of individual malignant cells, it is likely that cell-to-cell adhesion also influences the spatial spreading of populations of such cells. Therefore, it is important for us to develop biologically realistic simulation tools that can mimic the key features of such collective spreading processes to improve our understanding of how cell-to-cell adhesion influences the spreading of cell populations. Previous models of collective cell spreading with adhesion have used lattice-based random walk frameworks which may lead to unrealistic results, since the agents in the random walk simulations always move across an artificial underlying lattice structure. This is particularly problematic in high-density regions where it is clear that agents in the random walk align along the underlying lattice, whereas no such regular alignment is ever observed experimentally. To address these limitations, we present a lattice-free model of collective cell migration that explicitly incorporates crowding and adhesion. We derive a partial differential equation description of the discrete process and show that averaged simulation results compare very well with numerical solutions of the partial differential equation.

AB Cancer is a global epidemic, which significantly affects all ages and socio-economic groups and one reason is the great difficulty of the initial diagnostic phase. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), through effective contrast agents, has greatly helped in the diagnosis at the initial stage. Recently, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and complexes with Mn2+ have received great attention due to their applications as contrast agents for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Those materials can shorten the T-2 and T-2* transverse relaxation times. Thus, in this work, the face 100 of the delta-FeOOH and the complex [MnH(3)buea(OH)](2-) were studied with explicit water molecules in order to obtain the H-1 and O-17 hyperfine coupling constants (HFCCs). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the ReaxFF program for subsequent statistical inefficiency calculations. Thus, the structures from the MD simulation were selected for HFCC calculations. The theoretical results suggest that the delta-FeOOH and [MnH(3)buea(OH)](2-) considerably increase the H-1 and O-17 hyperfine coupling constants of the water molecules. In addition, delta-FeOOH is sensitive to H-1 and O-17 HFCCs parameters, however, in the complex [MnH(3)buea(OH)](2-), O-17 is much more sensitive than H-1 in relation to the HFCC parameters. Our findings point out delta-FeOOH as a promising alternative to conventional contrast agents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Colesevelam hydrochloride is a novel, lipid-lowering agent that binds bile acids with high affinity. A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-design study was conducted to assess the efficacy and tolerability of combination low-dose colesevelam and lovastatin treatment in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.
   Hypothesis: Combination therapy with low doses of colesevelam and lovastatin decreases low density (LDL) cholesterol with minimal adverse events.
   Methods: Following a 4- to 6-week dietary lead in, 135 patients were randomized into five groups for a 4-week treatment period: placebo, colesevelam 2.3 g at dinner, lovastatin 10 mg at dinner, the combination of colesevelam and lovastatin given at dinner (dosed together), and combination treatment with colesevelam given at dinner and lovastatin administered at bedtime (dosed apart).
   Results: Combination colesevelam and lovastatin treatment decreased LDL cholesterol by 34% (60 mg/dl, p < 0.0001) and 32% (53 mg/dl, p < 0.0001) when colesevelam and lovastatin were dosed together or dosed apart, respectively. Both combination therapies were superior to either agent alone (p < 0.05). Decreases in LDL cholesterol exceeded the combined decreases observed for colesevelam alone (13 mg/dl, 7%) and lovastatin alone (39 mg/dl, 22%). Both combination treatments reduced total cholesterol by 21% (p < 0.0001) and apolipoprotein B by 24% (p < 0.0001). Neither combination treatment significantly altered high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Adverse side effects were not significantly different among randomized groups.
   Conclusions: Combination colesevelam and lovastatin was efficacious and well tolerated, resulting in additive decreases in LDL cholesterol levels whether or not both agents were administered simultaneously.

AB Respiratory diseases are responsible for major economic losses at poultry farms especially during during co-infections of respiratory pathogens. However, impact of co-infections is not well known, especially in broilers. The current study was aimed to assess the probable synergism of E. coli (O78) and velogenic Newcastle disease virus in the broiler model. Three-week-old commercial broilers were inoculated with either vNDV, E. coli serotype O78 or both agents simultaneously or 3 days apart. The birds were clinically observed and swabbed daily. They were killed at 4 and 14 days after single or dual inoculations and were inspected for gross lesions. Samples of the respiratory organs (trachea, lungs, and air sacs) were taken for histological analyses. All the infected subjects showed clinical signs of varying severity. Co-infected groups showed the most obvious clinical signs, associated with significant higher mortality and respiratory organ abnormalities, in comparison with the mono-infected groups (P<0.05). There was a non-significant (P>0.05) effect of the inoculation time intervals between vNDV and E. coli inoculation (none or 3 days). Microscopic lesions staining supported clinical and macroscopic findings. Higher virus shedding (P<0.05) in oropharyngeal swabs was observed in co-infected groups than single infected groups. The results revealed that experimental co-infection of E. coli and NDV enhances the degree of severity of clinical signs, gross lesions and death rate and warns that E. coli and NDV can cause substantial economic losses by exercising additive or synergistic pathogenic effect in the reproduction of respiratory disease if given simultaneously or three days apart.

TI Kinetics and morphologies in polymerization-induced cooperative

AB In the last decade, polymerization-induced self-assembly (PISA) has emerged to be a quite popular technique for preparing a variety of nanoassembly structures in a selective solvent. As a special technique of PISA, polymerization-induced cooperative assembly (PICA) is believed to be able to produce more variable nanostructures and its ways of regulation seem more flexible. The process of PICA is studied systematically with a simulation method for discovering possible ways of regulation of morphologies. We find that the existence of solvophobic homopolymers yields a 'chain growth retarding effect', which effectively slows down the reaction kinetics of the polymerization. Besides proving the transition from lower-order morphologies to higher-order morphologies as reported in experiments, we also find a novel transition from higher-order morphologies to lower-order morphologies, as a result of the self-adaptation behavior of the system. For the first time, we demonstrate that this behavior is able to be well described as a kind of inverse flip-flop process of vesicle structures to thermodynamically stable micelle structures. We also find that the obvious contrast of length between the solvophilic macro-chain transfer agents and solvophobic blocks is beneficial to the emergence of plentiful kinds of structures. The results of this study are helpful for understanding the crucial factors for precisely regulating the morphologies in PICA, as well as guiding the way to improve experimental technologies.

AB 'Cryohydrocytosis' is an unusual human haemolytic anaemia of the 'hereditary stomatocytosis' group, in which the red cell membrane is abnormally permeable to Na and K+ at both body and (even more prominently) refrigerator temperatures. If whole cryohydrocytosis blood is anticoagulated in heparin or EDTA and stored on ice overnight, about 50% of the cells will lyse. Citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDa) anticoagulant, empirically verified as an optimal anticoagulant for storage of normal blood before transfusion, very markedly ameliorated this overnight lysis, suggesting that these cells might form an informative model in which cold storage of the red cell could be studied in a short time scale. Accordingly, we conducted studies of ion flux, cell swelling and lysis in different media used historically for blood preservation and compared the experimental data with an 'integrated red cell model', which seeks mathematically to model the osmotic behaviour of red cells under different conditions. Upon experiment, lysis in these cells was reduced by additives that could be regarded as impermeant extracellular solutes (citrate, mannitol) and by low pH, but not by those agents that are regarded as protecting the cell against energy depletion or oxidation (adenine, glucose, nicotinic acid). The protective effects of these extracellular additives were all reproduced by the computer simulation, confirming the validity of this model, although the effect of pH could be simulated only semi-quantitatively, possibly because Na+ permeability itself depends on pH.

AB The study explores calcium oxalate crystal inhibiting characteristic of polyacrylic acid (pAA), an anionic polymer in in vitro and in vivo. Animals were divided into 5 groups where group 1 served as control, group 2 were made hyperoxaluric by supplementing with Ethylene glycol (EG) 0.75% (v/v) for 30 days. Group 3, 4 & 5 were also given with EG and treated simultaneously with 2.5, 5 & 10 mg of pAA/kg of body weight, respectively. Urine, serum and tissue analyses along with histological studies were performed at the end of the 30 days study. In vitro crystallization was significantly inhibited by pAA and further it was supported by particle size analyses, XRD and FT-IR studies. Toxicological analyses showed that pAA was safe to use in animals at concentrations below 100 mg/kg BW. In vivo anti-urolithic study showed significant improvement in urinary lithogenic factors (calcium, oxalate, phosphate, citrate & magnesium) and renal function parameters (creatinine, urea and protein). Tissue analyses on anti-oxidant enzyme activity and lipid peroxides showed maintenance of tissue antioxidant status in the pAA supplemented rats and histological studies demonstrated the nephroprotection offered by pAA and were concurrent to the biochemical analyses. Supplementation of pAA not only reduces the crystal aggregation but also regulates the expression and localization of crystal inhibiting proteins and gene expression of inflammatory cytokines in experimental animals. In summary, pAA is a potent anti-urolithic agent in rats and we can propose that 10 mg/kg body weight is the effective dosage of pAA and this concentration can be used for further studies.

AB An experimental and theoretical study of CuZn electroplating mechanisms is conducted in trisodium citrate baths. The study aims to evaluate the influence of different bath parameters: ligand concentration, pH, metal complexation behaviors and solution ionic strength on bath stability and, if applicable, co-reduction processes. UV-VIS spectrophotometry, studies of current polarization curves for copper-zinc deposition, and speciation diagrams of copper in aqueous citrate solutions are incorporated to review the role of the blocking agent and pH on co-reduction ability issues. The CuZn electroplating process is also investigated using LSV curves in different baths, while focus is placed on the rate of metal ion diffusion to the growing centers. Following which, an optimized bath, based on control of the species of the blocking intermediates, is selected and investigated to check CuZn reduction potential rapprochement. Finally, deposition behaviors of copper, zinc and both combined are investigated to correlate deposition kinetics and efficiency to deposit properties (thickness/element content). Chronocoulometric curves of different CuZn deposits combined with their deconvoluted potentiodynamic dissolution peaks are used. Hull cell tests are performed to evaluate current control on a large range of CuZn coatings. Deposit properties are studied using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.

AB Heterogeneous latexes were prepared by a semicontinuous seeded emulsion polymerization process under monomer starved conditions at 80degreesC using potassium persulfate as the initiator and sodium dodecyl sulfate as the emulsifier. Poly(butyl acrylate) latexes were used as seeds. The second-stage polymer was poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate). By varying the amounts of methyl methacrylate (MMA) in the second-stage copolymer, the polarity of the copolymer phase could be controlled. Phase separation towards the thermodynamic equilibrium morphology was accelerated either by ageing the composite latex at 80degreesC or by adding a chain-transfer agent during polymerization. The morphologies of the latex particles were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The morphology distributions of latex particles were described by a statistical method. It was found that the latex particles displayed different equilibrium morphologies depending on the composition of the second-stage copolymers. This series of equilibrium morphologies of [poly(butyl acrylate)/poly(styrene-co-methyl methacrylate)] (PBA/P(St-co-MMA)) system provides experimental verification for quantitative simulation. Under limiting conditions, the equilibrium morphologies of PBA/P(St-co-MMA) were predicted according to the minimum surface free energy change principle. The particle morphology observed by TEM was in good agreement with the predictions of the thermodynamic model. Therefore, the morphology theory for homopolymer/homopolymer composite systems was extended to homopolymer/copolymer systems. (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the fracture resistance of teeth restored using an adhesive core material placed under artificial crowns without pins or posts and to assess the effect of different preparation designs and cementation techniques (glass ionomer compared with adhesive cementation) used for the crowns.
   Materials and Methods: Eighty-three intact molars were collected. Sixty-seven teeth were decoronated (test groups and one control group), a 2-mm circular ferrule design was prepared, and four different preparation designs (2-mm- or 1-mm-deep cavities and 2-mm- or 1-mm-thick walls) were used. Three control groups were also established. Cores were built up using an adhesive material. After preparation, standardized artificial crowns (cobalt-chromium alloy) were fabricated. Half of the crowns in the test group (n = 32) were cemented using Panavia (P group); glass-ionomer cement was used for the other half (KC group). All teeth were exposed to 10,000 thermal cycles and loaded until fracture. Statistical analysis was performed, including nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test) and ANOVA.
   Results: In the P group, the fracture strength was significantly (p = 0.004) higher (591.75 +/- 177.95 N) than in the KC group (430.18 +/- 193.67 N). The effect of the preparation design was more pronounced in the KC group. In all groups simulating the most moderate type of tooth decay (2-mm-deep cavity and a 2-mm-thick wall), the fracture strength was comparable with that of intact teeth. Results from ANOVA showed that the type of cementation of the crowns affected fracture strength.
   Conclusion: Fracture strengths of adhesive core/crown complexes are greater when an adequate cavity for retention (at least 2 mm deep) is prepared and the crown is luted.

AB Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major concern within healthcare systems. This pharmacoeconomic study evaluated the use of caspofungin (CAS) versus liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB) in the empirical treatment of IFIs within the Turkish healthcare system. A decision-analytic model was adopted, utilising data from a randomised, non-inferiority clinical trial and a panel of clinical experts in Turkey. A five-point composite outcome measure was used to evaluate both agents. Sensitivity analyses were performed. In the base-case scenario, CAS was preferred over L-AmB by Turkish Lira (TL) 3961 per patient treated, TL 12 904 per successfully treated patient and TL 3972 per death averted. One-way sensitivity analysis did not change the study outcome. Monte Carlo simulation concluded a 71.0% chance of the outcome favouring CAS. The results were most sensitive to changes in length of stay. This is the first economic evaluation of the empirical treatment of IFIs in Turkey and suggests that CAS is more cost effective than L-AmB. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.

AB ObjectivesAgent-based modeling (ABM) is a type of computer simulation that creates a virtual society and allows controlled experimentation. ABM has the potential to be a powerful tool for exploring criminological theory and testing the plausibility of crime prevention interventions when data are unavailable, when they would be unethical to collect, or when policy-makers need an answer quickly. This paper takes stock of the current literature to discuss the potential contributions of ABM, assess current practice, identify shortcomings that threaten the validity of findings using ABM, and to make suggestions regarding the construction and communication of future work using ABM.MethodsWe systematically searched major databases to find all publications using ABM to simulate urban crime patterns and coded publications to quantify the following information: (1) characteristics of the publication, the model and the agents, (2) model purpose, (3) crime type investigated, and (4) interrogation of the model via sensitivity testing and validation.ResultsAfter sifting papers according to our inclusion criteria, we identified and reviewed 45 publications. Models informed by the opportunity theory framework dominated. Most publications lacked detail sufficient to enable replication. Many did not include clear a rationale for modeling choices, parameter selection or calibration. Rarely were parameters calibrated using empirical data. Model validation was limited and inconsistent across papers.ConclusionsABM offers significant potential for criminological enquiry. However, at present, the lack of model detail reported in publications makes it difficult to assess where sufficient evidence exists to supportand where gaps limitthe development of models that reflect extant conditions and offender decision-making. For the field to progress, as a minimum, standardized reporting that encourages transparency will be necessary.

AB Background: Combining various antiretroviral agents into one single dosage form has been a strategy to reduce pill burden and enhance medication adherence among human immunodeficiency virus /AIDS (HIV/AIDS) patients.
   Objectives: This is a cost-utility study from a health care system's perspective comparing coformulated fixed dose (FXD) strategy versus multiple free dose combination (FRC) in antiretroviral therapy.
   Method: The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used to identify HIV/AIDS patients with >= 2 active antiretroviral medications. Patients on FXD were matched in 1:1 ratio with the FRC group using propensity scores. All medical costs excluding those paid by patients and families were included. Utility was measured using SF-6D scores from the SF-12 questionnaire. Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated using the mean annual estimates. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was determined using a Monte Carlo probabilistic simulation technique.
   Results: Nine FXD antiretroviral formulations approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by 2005 was included in this study. One hundred seventy HIV/AIDS patients with antiretroviral agents were identified from the MEPS database, of which 53% (n = 92) were on FXD formulation. On matching, 70 patients from FXD had a match from the FRC group. No differences in sociodemographic and health status variables were observed between the matched groups. The mean annual cost was $15,766.15 for FXD patients and $11,875.21 for FRC patients. The mean utility gained by using FXD over FRC was 0.085; however, this difference was not statistically significant. The ICUR for the FXD treatment over FRC treatment was $45,540.49/quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed FXD to dominate FRC (> 50% probability of being cost-effective) above the $40,000 threshold.
   Conclusion: Although the cost-effectiveness of a single-pill strategy was within the acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold, the QALY difference were minimal. Further research is recommended to explore the long-term impact of the strategy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article investigates how income inequality shapes residential segregation by income. Using agent-based modeling, it develops a residential preferences model that is capable of generating results mimicking empirical income segregation patterns. Simulation analysis shows how varying income inequality produces differential residential mobility outcomes that alter income segregation profiles. The model is used to capture the distinct impacts of households' moves into richer or poorer neighborhoods, and how these impacts are further differentiated with respect to the moving household's income. The article demonstrates how aggregating such diverse outcomes of micro-level interactions at a meso-level can help us to better understand the changes in macro-level income segregation patterns. Analyzing residential mobility patterns carefully, the article suggests that i) segregation of affluence and of poverty can trigger each other via initiating cascades of residential mobility and housing prices, and ii) increasing income inequality can disrupt housing market and lead to shortages in affordable housing, which can yield high residential instability and eviction rates among the poorest stratum.

ID HOUSEHOLD ACTIVITY
AB Existing activity-based models are typically concerned with predicting observed aggregate activity-travel patterns. The interaction and dependencies between individuals have received less attention. Considered here is how one specific schedule choice, namely, the start time of an activity chosen by an agent, aggregates to form an equilibrium distribution, which in turn influences individual decision making. These choices are formalized as the outcomes of a game of incomplete information in which agents have to conjecture the behavior of other agents. The properties of the model are examined by using numerical computer simulations. The results of the simulations support the face validity of the formulated model.

TI Cumulative phase delay between second harmonic and fundamental
   components-A marker for ultrasound contrast agents
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA

DT Article
ID NONLINEAR PROPAGATION; MICROBUBBLE
AB Several imaging techniques aimed at detecting ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) echo signals, while suppressing signals coming from the surrounding tissue, have been developed. These techniques are especially relevant for blood flow, perfusion, or contrast dispersion quantification. However, despite several approaches being presented, improving the understanding of the ultrasound/UCAs interaction may support further development of imaging techniques. In this paper, the physical phenomena behind the formation of harmonic components in tissue and UCAs, respectively, are addressed as a possible way to recognize the origin of the echo signals. Simulations based on a modified Rayleigh, Plesset, Noltingk, Neppiras, and Poritsky equation and transmission and backscattering measurements of ultrasound propagating through UCAs performed with a single element transducer and a submergible hydrophone, are presented. Both numerical and in vitro results show the occurrence of a cumulative time delay between the second harmonic and fundamental component which increases with UCA concentration and propagation path length through UCAs, and that was clearly observable at frequencies (f(0) = 2.5 MHz) and pressure regimes (mechanical index = 0.1) of interest for imaging. Most importantly, this delay is not observed in the absence of UCAs. In conclusion, the reported phenomenon represents a marker for UCAs with potential application for imaging.

AB Workforce staffing and assignment decisions are of critical importance for meeting the challenge of minimizing operational costs while providing satisfactory customer service. These decisions are particularly challenging for omnichannel service centers, where customers can request services via different communication channels (e.g., phone, e-mail, live-chat, social media) that have different service quality and response requirements. We present a formulation of the omnichannel workforce management problem that accounts for variations in response urgencies of different channels as well as diminishing agent performances due to channel switching. We develop an algorithm that efficiently provides solutions for this problem and determines the number and channel allocation of service agents within the service center. Through numerical experiments, we study the performance of the algorithm among various service center configurations with equal cost characteristics. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can identify service center structures that outperform many alternative structures, including those commonly-adopted in the real-world.

AB What causes turnover on the Billboard charts? The neutral model of cultural evolution, which assumes that taste is transmitted via an unbiased copying process, provides precise predictions regarding expected popularity distributions and turnover within a popularity-ranked list. Recent advances in this line make it possible to characterize the likelihood of music taste transmission mechanisms by investigating departures of observed turnover rates from neutral model predictions. Here, I bias the neutral model to investigate four alternative conceptions of individual music taste transmission (song quality, individual status, social network, and anticonformist) and use agent-based simulations to examine the impact on turnover. I then compare modeled with empirical turnover data from the Billboard Hot 100 over the period from 1958 to 2021 and find that observed turnover patterns are reproduced only in an anticonformist model simulating the systematic rejection of the most popular songs. This finding was unexpected and challenges the notion of a generalized "preference for the popular." Overall, this study contributes to ongoing debates regarding the mechanisms involved in the transmission of taste and the mechanics of fashion change.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB Rapid technological innovation and globalization have led to increasingly complex agri-food supply chains and networks, and uncertain agri-food markets. Given this type of competitive environment, management scholars have argued that agri-food firms that adopt capabilities for entrepreneurship will outperform firms that do not. We use agent-based simulation methods to explore this hypothesis. Agent-based models are particularly relevant in this study as they allow for the explicit simulation of the entrepreneurial behaviors and firm interactions that lead to wealth creation. In our analysis, we find that entrepreneurial capabilities of alertness, risk-taking, and efficiency vary in their effect on firm performance given alternative agri-food strategic landscape configurations.

AB Networks are well understood as crucial to the diffusion of HIV among injection drug users (IDUs), but quasi-anonymous risk nodes - such as shooting galleries - resist measurement and incorporation into empirical analyses of disease diffusion. Drawing on network data from 767 IDUs in Bushwick, Brooklyn, we illustrate the use of calibrated agent-based models (CABMs) to account for network structure, injection practices, and quasi-anonymous transmission in shooting galleries. Results confirm the importance of network structure and actor heterogeneity to the magnitude and speed of HIV transmission. Models further demonstrate that quasi-anonymous injections in shooting galleries increase the speed of HIV diffusion across the whole network and have the greatest impact on HIV seroconversion levels for IDUs at the network periphery. Shooting galleries are shown to be transmission hubs that operate independently of traceable structural ties, linking otherwise unconnected network components. CABMs potentially increase understandings of HIV diffusion dynamics by infusing computer simulations with empirical data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Ultrasound-stimulated microbubble dynamics have been shown to be dependent on intrinsic bubble properties, including size and shell characteristics. The effect of the surrounding environment on microbubble response, however, has been less investigated. In particular, microbubble optimization studies are generally conducted in water/saline, characterized by a 1 cP viscosity, for application in the vasculature (i.e., 4 cP). In this study, ultra-high speed microscopy was employed to investigate fluid viscosity effects on phospholipid encapsulated microbubble oscillations at 1 MHz, using a single, eight-cycle pulse at peak negative pressures of 100 and 250 kPa. Microbubble oscillations were shown to be affected by fluid viscosity in a size-and pressure-dependent manner. In general, the oscillation amplitudes exhibited by microbubbles between 3 and 6 mu m in 1 cP fluid were larger than in 4 cP fluid, reaching a maximum of 1.7-fold at 100 kPa for microbubbles 3.8 mu m in diameter and 1.35-fold at 250 kPa for microbubbles 4.8 mu m in diameter. Simulation results were in broad agreement at 250 kPa, however generally underestimated the effect of fluid viscosity at 100 kPa. This is the first experimental demonstration documenting the effects of surrounding fluid viscosity on microbubble oscillations, resulting in behavior not entirely predicted by current microbubble models.

AB Whether any non-human animal can attribute mental states to others remains the subject of extensive debate. This despite the fact that several species have behaved as if they have a 'theory of mind' in various behavioral tasks. In this paper, we review the reasons of skeptics for their doubts: That existing experimental setups cannot distinguish between 'mind readers' and 'behavior readers', that results that seem to indicate 'theory of mind' may come from studies that are insufficiently controlled, and that our own intuitive biases may lead us to interpret behavior more 'cognitively' than is necessary. The merits of each claim and suggested solution are weighed. The conclusion is that while it is true that existing setups cannot conclusively demonstrate 'theory of mind' in non-human animals, focusing on this fact is unlikely to be productive. Instead, the more interesting question is how sophisticated their social reasoning can be, whether it is about 'unobservable inner experiences' or not. Therefore, it is important to address concerns about the setup and interpretation of specific experiments. To alleviate the impact of intuitive biases, various strategies have been proposed in the literature. These include a deeper understanding of associative learning, a better knowledge of the limited 'theory of mind' humans actually use, and thinking of animal cognition in an embodied, embedded way; that is, being aware that constraints outside of the brain, and outside of the body, may naturally predispose individuals to produce behavior that looks smart without requiring complex cognition. To enable this kind of thinking, a powerful methodological tool is advocated: Computational modeling, namely agent-based modeling and, particularly, cognitive modeling. By explicitly simulating the rules and representations that underlie animal performance on specific tasks, it becomes much easier to look past one's own biases and to see what cognitive processes might actually be occurring.

AB Various degrees of residential segregation by income and race generally exist in U.S. cities. This study extends Sethi and Somanathan's theoretical model (J Polit Econ 112:1296-1321, 2004) by presenting an agent-based sorting, repeated-game model to quantify the patterns of segregation from a broader perspective. Based on the belief that residential racial segregation is a probabilistic problem without assured results, a numerical model-calibrated to U.S. household income data-is proposed to examine residential segregation by income and racial preferences. Similar to the SimSeg model developed by Fosset (J Math Sociol 30:185-274, 2006a; J Math Sociol 35:114-145, 2011), the numerical model we construct is based on a simple format which also explores segregation dynamics. The simulation results exhibit various degrees of segregation probability in a hypothetical three-neighborhood scenario. It also reveals that although income plays an important role, racial consciousness-the measurement of an agent's attitude toward the racial composition of the neighborhood-is the dominant factor in determining residential segregation.

AB This work presents an exhaustive mathematical model for the high pressure polymerization of ethylene in tubular reactors of configuration similar to that encountered in the industry. Multiple injection of monomer, mixtures of initiators and chain transfer agents are considered together with realistic flux configurations. Typical heat transfer coefficients are estimated from industrial plant data, The effects of pressure pulse on the reactor behavior are also analyzed. Instantaneous temperature profiles produced by such pressure pulse were recovered from stationary simulations showing a very good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. The model features are demonstrated by predictions of temperature, concentrations of reactants and products and molecular properties as a function of reactor length. Also, appropriate predictive capabilities are disclosed by comparison of model simulation results and experimental data. The generation of a high temperature initiator, derived from oxygen, is assessed by comparison of temperature profiles corresponding to runs with and without oxygen.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the laboratory moisture susceptibility of low-volume hot mix asphalt (HMA) and warm mix asphalt (WMA) mixtures containing moist aggregates and recycled materials, such as manufactured roofing shingles and coal ash material. These materials were tested after short-and long-term aging procedures. The test properties of these mixtures included indirect tensile strength (ITS), the tensile strength ratio (TSR), and the flow value of virgin and aged specimens. The experimental design included two percentages of coal ash (10 and 5% by weight of the aggregate), two roofing shingle contents (5 and 3% by weight of the aggregate), three WMA additives (Asphamin, Sasobit, and Evotherm), two antistripping agents (hydrated lime and one liquid antistripping agent), and two aggregate sources. A total of 72 mixtures were designed and a total of 416 ITS specimens were tested for short-and long-term aged procedures in this study. The test results indicated that the dry and wet ITS values of low-volume mixtures containing moist aggregate generally satisfied the demand of pavement without requiring additional treatment. Mixtures containing hydrated lime, in general, showed a better moisture resistance than liquid ASA for WMA mixtures. Moreover, the addition of WMA additives in the low-volume mixture was effective and generally showed a similar moisture resistance to HMA, except for when using Asphamin and liquid ASA simultaneously. Research results also indicated that the utilization of recycled coal ash and roofing shingles significantly improved moisture resistance of HMA and WMA mixtures.

DT Article
DE Adorno; automobile; Bourdieu; consumption; Fordism; post-Fordism;
   postmodernism
ID CRITIQUE
AB JOHN URRY (2000: 57-64) has recently changed the way we think about automobiles with his idea of automobility. With this concept focused on movement and process, he suggests that sociologists abandon their idea of the car as a thing, a simple object of production and consumption, and look at it as a system of interlocking social and technical practices that has reconfigured civil society. Among the dimensions of this system of automobility Urry includes the car as manufactured object, item of individual consumption, machinic (economic) complex, environmental agent, form of mobility and dominant cultural discourse. These dimensions have interacted to produce mobile civil societies with new kinds of space, time, dwelling and interaction (Urry, 2000: 190-3; Urry, 2004).
   Without losing sight of the interdependence of these dimensions, I will focus on one of them - the automobile as an item of individual consumption in a broader culture of consumerism that charges objects with meanings and identities beyond their immediate utility. I hope to show that as a consumer object, the auto embodies a cultural logic that is relatively autonomous from and often contradictory to other dimensions of automobility. This does not mean, however, that this cultural dimension is independent. Revealing the ultimate interdependence of the dimensions of automobility, I argue that the emergence of the cultural logic of a particular automotive age is influenced by the exigencies of auto production and use. However, as this cultural logic grows and intensifies its effects on society, it ultimately comes into contradiction with itself and its concomitant practices of production and use, giving rise to a new configuration of automobility. Thus, the major purpose of my analysis is to add a dynamic dimension to the concept of automobility, to reveal a developing and contradictory system with changing effects on society.
   In the following, I argue that there have been three ages of the automobile in the 20th century, each defined by a unique cultural logic of meaning and identity. To conceptualize these different logics I draw on three sociological theories of consumption. Pierre Bourdieu conceives of consumption as a game of distinction, in which different classes compete for cultural capital or status honor. For him, the automobile is a distinctive status symbol, marking off but ultimately misrecognizing the inequalities of class society. The Frankfurt School also argues that the culture of mass consumption legitimates class differences, not by displaying these differences in a symbolic hierarchy, as Bourdieu holds, but by hiding them altogether. For Theodor Adorno in particular, consumer commodities like the automobile obscure the class relations of their production behind reified facades of mass individuality, giving consumers different quantities of the same illusions to compensate for the denials of mass production. Finally, theorists of postmodernism argue that the diversity and individuality of consumer commodities undermine old class identities by forming the basis for fragmented subcultures. For them the car and its subcultures are part of a fragmented, liberated society of 'difference' that follows the collapse of modernity.
   Although each theory claims to capture the one and only cultural logic of consumerism in modem societies, I hold that, with respect to the automobile at least, each is valid for only a specific historical period or age. This does not mean, however, that these successive logics are totally independent and completely annihilate the preceding ones. The relationship between them is best conceived as dialectical, in the original Hegelian sense (see Marcuse, 1960). Each stage and its logic represents not a replacement but a development of the preceding one. The problems and contradictions of the earlier stage are transcended in the later one - that is to say, they are incorporated into and overcome by a higher stage of development, without being solved in any final sense. So the old logic survives in the new, but in a higher form of development. In a sense, then, I postulate not a succession but a progression of stages, without postulating, as do Hegel and Marx, some end point or purpose to this historical progression. There is, however, a common theme or impulse underlying all three stages - the search for individual identity within a capitalist society that holds out the promise of autonomy but simultaneously denies it in the heteronomy of the economy.
   Empirically, the periodization of these three ages is based mainly on my research on the automobile in American society, presented in my book Auto Opium (Gartman, 1994). However, I will also cite studies that lead me to believe that a similar progression of ages occurs in other countries, especially Britain, although the timing may be different. This article extends my previous research historically as well as nationally. While Auto Opium concentrates on the years up to 1970, here I include an overview of the last 30 years under the rubrics of postmodernism and post-Fordism. Thus, through a focus on the cultural logics of the car, I hope to show that automobility is a dynamic and contradictory system, whose effects on society are pervasive and ever-changing.

AB This paper presents an agent-based complex system simulation of settlement structure change using methods derived from entropy maximization modeling. The approach is applied to model the movement of people and goods in urban settings to study how settlement size hierarchy develops. While entropy maximization is well known for assessing settlement structure change over different spatiotemporal settings, approaches have rarely attempted to develop and apply this methodology to understand how individual and household decisions may affect settlement size distributions. A new method developed in this paper allows individual decision-makers to chose where to settle based on social-environmental factors, evaluate settlements based on geography and relative benefits, while retaining concepts derived from entropy maximization with settlement size affected by movement ability and site attractiveness feedbacks. To demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical and methodological approach, case study settlement patterns from the Middle Bronze (MBA) and Iron Ages (IA) in the Iraqi North Jazirah Survey (NJS) are used. Results indicate clear differences in settlement factors and household choices in simulations that lead to settlement size hierarchies comparable to the two evaluated periods. Conflict and socio-political cohesion, both their presence and absence, are suggested to have major roles in affecting the observed settlement hierarchy. More broadly, the model is made applicable for different empirically based settings, while being generalized to incorporate data uncertainty, making the model useful for understanding urbanism from top-down and bottom-up perspectives.

AB We synthesize the contrasting predictions of motor simulation and teleological theories of action comprehension and present evidence from a series of studies showing that monkeys and apes-like humans-extract the meaning of an event by (a) going beyond the surface appearance of actions, attributing goals and intentions to the agent; (b) using details about the environment to infer when an action is rational or irrational; (c) making predictions about an agent's goal and the most probable action to obtain the goal, within the constraints of the situation; (d) predicting the most probable outcome of actions even when they are physiologically incapable of producing the actions; and (e) combining information about means and outcomes to make decisions about social interactions, some with moral relevance. These studies reveal the limitations of motor simulation theories, especially those that rely on the notion of direct matching and mirror neuron activation. They provide support, however, for a teleological theory, rooted in an inferential process that extracts information about action means, potential goals, and the environmental constraints that limit rational action.

AB Animal behavioural profiles are commonly employed to investigate new therapeutic agents to treat anxiety disorders as well as to investigate the mechanism of action or anxiolytic drugs. However, many clinically important symptoms of anxiety can not be modelled directly in animals. Human models of anxiety should bridge between animal models and anxiety disorders. Experimental anxiety states in humans can be induced by either pharmacological means such as CO2 inhalation or psychological means such as aversive conditioning of skin conductance responses to tones. Investigation of these models may contribute to a better understanding of anxiety disorders, both from a biological and behavioural point of view. In a comprehensive review existing models of human experimental anxiety states are summarized and validity is discussed.

SO CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS

DT Article
ID EVOLUTIONARY GAMES; COOPERATION; EMERGENCE; MOBILITY; REWARD
AB How to interpret the emergence and ubiquity of cooperation between selfish agents has become a long-standing puzzle among the scientific communities. In this paper, we propose a co-evolutionary prisoner's dilemma model to illustrate the evolution of cooperation, in which the model evolution can be divided into two basic steps: (i) strategy update: all agents play the game and perform the strategy update according to the Fermi rule; (ii) topology adjustment: each agent can have a chance to prune the connection with a defecting neighbor so as to decrease the potential benefit loss via an adjustment parameter (alpha). Large quantities of numerical simulations indicate that the cooperation level in the stationary state will be highly elevated, when compared to the traditional prisoner's dilemma game on regular lattices. Meanwhile, we have also observed that the degree distribution of network will be broadened or more skewed and structural heterogeneities will also become higher when the dynamical adjustment of interaction topology is allowed during the system evolution. In addition, it is also proven that the tunable parameter alpha controls the link reconnection process, and even the node elimination and reproduction so that the whole cooperation level can be greatly influenced. Thus, the study points out a suitable way for the sustainability of cooperation in structured populations, and current findings are conducive to further understand the collective cooperation phenomenon within many biological, social, economic and even man-made systems.

AB Many works and articles about probabilistic strategies for the prisoner's dilemma have already been realised. Notably Press & Dyson 2012 article has lead to renewed interest in the subject. In this article, with the help of a systematic study of probabilistic memory-one strategies, we show that there is a basic criterion to configure and anticipate their success. This criterion, identified through the study of large homogeneous sets of strategies, is then compared to other similar criteria. Our experimental method has allowed us to discover new strategies that are efficient not only in probabilistic environments, but also in more general, probabilistic or non-probabilistic environments. We test the robustness of our results by various methods and compare the new strategies obtained with the best strategies currently known.

AB Background: The homogeneous mixing assumption is widely adopted in epidemic modelling for its parsimony and represents the building block of more complex approaches, including very detailed agent-based models. The latter assume homogeneous mixing within schools, workplaces and households, mostly for the lack of detailed information on human contact behaviour within these settings. The recent data availability on high-resolution face-to-face interactions makes it now possible to assess the goodness of this simplified scheme in reproducing relevant aspects of the infection dynamics.
   Methods: We consider empirical contact networks gathered in different contexts, as well as synthetic data obtained through realistic models of contacts in structured populations. We perform stochastic spreading simulations on these contact networks and in populations of the same size under a homogeneous mixing hypothesis. We adjust the epidemiological parameters of the latter in order to fit the prevalence curve of the contact epidemic model. We quantify the agreement by comparing epidemic peak times, peak values, and epidemic sizes.
   Results: Good approximations of the peak times and peak values are obtained with the homogeneous mixing approach, with a median relative difference smaller than 20 % in all cases investigated. Accuracy in reproducing the peak time depends on the setting under study, while for the peak value it is independent of the setting. Recalibration is found to be linear in the epidemic parameters used in the contact data simulations, showing changes across empirical settings but robustness across groups and population sizes.
   Conclusions: An adequate rescaling of the epidemiological parameters can yield a good agreement between the epidemic curves obtained with a real contact network and a homogeneous mixing approach in a population of the same size. The use of such recalibrated homogeneous mixing approximations would enhance the accuracy and realism of agent-based simulations and limit the intrinsic biases of the homogeneous mixing.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate the application value of Tc-99m-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) imaging to differentiate between benign and malignant thymic masses. A total of 32 patients with space-occupying mediastinal masses were enrolled and early and delayed-phase images were collected following injection with the imaging agent. The tumor to background ratio (T/N) values at the different phases were also recorded. The sensitivity of the qualitative analysis to distinguish between benign and malignant thymic masses was 95.24%, with specificity as 90.91%. The T/N values in the early and delayed phases were not significantly different in the group with benign thymic masses, but demonstrated statistical significant differences in the groups with low-and intermediate-grade malignant thymic masses. The T/N values at the above early and delayed phase were significantly different between the benign and low-grade malignancy groups, as well as between low-and moderate-grade malignancy groups. Those between the benign and moderate-grade malignancy groups demonstrated no significant difference. Tc-99m-MIBI imaging was able to differentiate between benign and malignant thymic masses, and the simultaneous semi-quantitative analysis of the T/N values of the tumors may be able to initially determine the degree of malignancy of thymoma.

TI Coordination and correlation in Markov rational belief equilibria
SO ECONOMIC THEORY
LA English
DT Article
AB This paper studies the effect of correlation in the rational beliefs of agents on the volatility of asset prices. We use the technique of generating variables to study stable and non-stationary processes needed to characterize rational beliefs. We then examine how the stochastic interaction among such variables affects the behavior of a wide class of Rational Belief Equilibria (RBE). The paper demonstrates how to construct a consistent price state space and then shows the existence of RBE for any economy for which such price state space is constructed. Next, the results are used to study the volatility of asset prices via numerical simulation of a two agents model. If beliefs of agents are uniformly dispersed and independent, we would expect heterogeneity of beliefs to have a limited impact on the fluctuations of asset prices. On the other hand, our results show that correlation across agents can have a complex and dramatic effect on the volatility of prices and thus can be the dominant factor in the fluctuation of asset prices. The mechanism generating this effect works through the clustering of beliefs in states of different levels of agreement. In states of agreement the conditional forecasts of the agents tend to fluctuate together inducing more volatile asset prices. In states of disagreement the conditional forecasts fluctuate in diverse directions tending to cancel each other's effect on market demand and resulting in reduced price volatility.

AB In Vietnam, the remarkable economic growth that resulted from the doi moi ( renovation) reforms was based largely on the rural households that had become the new basic unit of agricultural production in the early 1990s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the decollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource management, land use, and the institutions that defined access to resources and their distribution. Combined with the extreme biophysical, technical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern mountains, these rapid changes led to the extreme complexity of the agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic approaches. Since 1999, a participatory simulation method has been developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect relationships between the different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different scales. Several tools were combined to understand the interactions between human and natural systems, including a narrative conceptual model, an agent-based spatial computational model ( ABM), a role-playing game, and a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS the knowledge generated from the above tools applied to a representative sample of research sites. The model takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: ( 1) farmers' strategies, i.e., the individual decision-making process as a function of the farm's resource profile; ( 2) the institutions that define resource access and usage; and ( 3) changes in the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. The next step consisted of coupling the ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management rules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers of the GIS, e. g., land use in 1990, accessibility, soil characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e. g., population, ethnicity, livestock, etc. At each annual time step, the agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made by agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force, capital, and land to different productive activities, e. g., crops, livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The participatory simulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages with similar land-use change trajectories to which the same types of technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios of land-use changes were developed with local stakeholders to assess the potential impact of these changes on the natural resource base and on agricultural development. This adaptive approach was gradually refined through interactions between researchers and the local population.

AB Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle-wasting disease with no effective treatment. Multiple mechanisms are thought to contribute to muscle wasting, including increased susceptibility to contraction-induced damage, chronic inflammation, fibrosis, altered satellite stem cell (SSC) dynamics, and impaired regenerative capacity. The goals of this project were to 1) develop an agent-based model of skeletal muscle that predicts the dynamic regenerative response of muscle cells, fibroblasts, SSCs, and inflammatory cells as a result of contraction-induced injury, 2) calibrate and validate the model parameters based on comparisons with published experimental measurements, and 3) use the model to investigate how changing isolated and combined factors known to be associated with DMD (e.g., altered fibroblast or SSC behaviors) influence muscle regeneration. Our predictions revealed that the percent of injured muscle that recovered 28 days after injury was dependent on the peak SSC counts following injury. In simulations with near-full crosssectional area recovery (healthy, 4-wk mdx, 3-mo mdx), the SSC counts correlated with the extent of initial injury; however, in simulations with impaired regeneration (9-mo mdx), the peak SSC counts were suppressed relative to initial injury. The differences in SSC counts between these groups were emergent predictions dependent on altered microenvironment factors known to be associated with DMD. Multiple cell types influenced the peak number of SSCs, but no individual parameter predicted the differences in SSC counts. This finding suggests that interventions to target the microenvironment rather than SSCs directly could be an effective method for improving regeneration in impaired muscle.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY A computational model predicted that satellite stem cell (SSC) counts are correlated with muscle crosssectional area (CSA) recovery following injury. In simulations with impaired CSA recovery, SSC counts are suppressed relative to healthy muscle. The suppressed SSC counts were an emergent model prediction, because all simulations had equal initial SSC counts. Fibroblast and anti-inflammatory macrophage counts influenced SSC counts, but no single factor was able to predict the pathological differences in SSC counts that lead to impaired regeneration.

AB Direct experimentation with chemical warfare agents (CWA) to study important problems such as their permeation across protective barrier materials, decontamination of equipment and facilities, or the environmental transport and fate of CWAs is not feasible because of the obvious toxicity of the CM/As and associated restrictions on their laboratory use. The common practice is to use "simulants," namely, analogous chemicals that closely resemble the CWAs but are less toxic, with the expectation that the results attained for simulants can be correlated to how the CWAs would perform. Simulants have been traditionally chosen by experts, by means of intuition, using similarity in one or more physical properties (such as vapor pressure or aqueous solubility) or in the molecular structural features (such as functional groups) between the stimulant and the CWA. This work is designed to automate the simulant identification process backed by quantitative metrics, by means of chemical similarity search software routinely used in pharmaceutical drug discovery. The question addressed here is: By the metrics of such software, how similar are traditional simulants to CWAs? That is, what is the numerical "distance" between each CWA and its customary simulants in the quantitative space of molecular descriptors? The answers show promise for finding close but less toxic simulants for the ever-increasing numbers of CWAs objectively and fast. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The adsorption of the chemical warfare agent simulant dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP) and the real agents Sarin and VX on the gamma-Al2O3 Surface has been studied using density functional theory. The focus is primarily on two different environmental effects, namely, surface hydroxylation and photoexcitation due to terrestrial solar radiation. Cluster models for the hydroxylated surface have been examined in detail, focusing on the chemical and electronic structure. The energy for formation via dissociative adsorption of H2O2 the density of states of the occupied cluster orbitals and the OH deprotonation energies have been compared with results from two-dimensionally periodic slab calculations and, where available. with experimental data. For all three species, adsorption on an OH-free surface occurs via an Al(T-d)-O=P dative bond to an unsaturated tetrahedral AI(T-d) site. For the hydroxylated surface, OH sites which are 3-fold coordinated to Al are more reactive than one-fold coordinated sites, in agreement with experiment. In hydrogen-bond formation, the phosphonyl O atom is favored over other active centers (e.g., an alkoxy O atom); however, dative bonding, remains the most stable mode of adsorption when OH-free Al(T-d) sites are available. The tertiary amine group in VX is found to be sufficiently basic to e extract an H+ from an acidic OH site. Even on a fully-OH-covered surface, only a single OH-O=P bond is formed, together with weaker CH-O bonds involving alkyl groups. These have been analyzed using the Atoms in Molecules theory. The threshold for electronic excitation of DMMP or Sarin, either in the gas phase or adsorbed on gamma-Al2O3, is found to occur in the vacuum-ultraviolet, well beyond the upper limit of the terrestrial solar spectrum (similar to 4.5 eV). For VX, on the other hand, the threshold is at similar to 4.2 eV in the gas phase and shifts slightly to the red when adsorbed. Adsorption-induced shifts in the threshold transition energies have been analyzed in terms of those in the initial and final states.

AB Bonding to dentin with adhesive systems is affected by the tubular fluid flow induced by pulpal pressure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of simulated pulpal pressure on the microtensile bond strength of an adhesive to dentin surface prepared by laser irradiation. Crowns of twenty human extracted third molars were subjected to Er, Cr: YSGG laser beams. Specimens were divided into two groups according to pulpal pressure simulation. In the first group resin composite (Z-250 Filtek) was bonded to flat surfaces of samples using dentin bonding agent (Single Bond) under simulated pulpal pressure. In the second group, the same procedure was carried out without pulpal pressure simulation. After storing the teeth in saline solution at 37 degrees C for 24 h, thirty 1-mm-thick slices were cut from the samples in each group and subjected to bond strength test. Microtensile bond strength was determined using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. Statistical significance was determined by T-test (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference in the mean microtensile bond strengths between the groups (p < 0.0005). Simulated pulpal pressure had a negative effect on microtensile bond strength of laser ablated dentin when Single Bond adhesive system was used.

AB Because of features that appear to be inherent in many social systems, modellers face complicated and subjective choices in positioning the scientific contribution of their research. This leads to a diversity of approaches and terminology, making interdisciplinary assessment of models highly problematic. Such modellers ideally need some kind of accessible, interdisciplinary framework to better understand and assess these choices. Existing texts tend either to take a specialised metaphysical approach, or focus on more pragmatic aspects such as the simulation process or descriptive protocols for how to present such research. Without a sufficiently neutral treatment of why a particular set of methods and style of model might be chosen, these choices can become entwined with the ideological and terminological baggage of a particular discipline. This paper attempts to provide such a framework. We begin with an epistemological model, which gives a standardised view on the types of validation available to the modeller, and their impact on scientific value. This is followed by a methodological framework, presented as a taxonomy of the key dimensions over which approaches are ultimately divided. Rather than working top-down from philosophical principles, we characterise the issues as a practitioner would see them. We believe that such a characterisation can be done 'well enough', where 'well enough' represents a common frame of reference for all modellers, which nevertheless respects the essence of the debate's subtleties and can be accepted as such by a majority of 'methodologists'. We conclude by discussing the limitations of such an approach, and potential further work for such a framework to be absorbed into existing, descriptive protocols and general social simulation texts.

AB Objective. Ozone was suggested for treatment of hypersensitive dentin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of ozone, with or without the use of desensitizing agents, on patency and occlusion of simulated hypersensitive dentin. Materials and methods. Sixty standardized dentin slabs were randomly divided into six groups: distilled water (Control), ozone treatment, fluoride desensitizer (ALLSolutions, Dentsply), oxalate desensitizer (D/Sense Crystal, Centrix), combined use of ozone/fluoride and combined use of ozone/oxalate. Ozone gas was delivered from OzonyTronX (Mymed). Specimens were evaluated using a scanning electron microscope and digital image analysis before and after treatment. Results. Statistical analysis using ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U-tests revealed significantly lower percentage of tubular occlusion with ozone treatment than distilled water at p <= 0.05. Scanning electron microscope photomicrographs of oxalate desensitizer specimens revealed a thick homogenous precipitate with significantly higher percentage of tubular occlusion than fluoride desensitizer and distilled water. Combined use of ozone/fluoride resulted in a significantly higher percentage of tubular occlusion than fluoride desensitizer alone. However, no significant difference was found between oxalate desensitizer and combined use of ozone/oxalate. Conclusions. The use of ozone gas is a viable adjunct to fluoride-containing desensitizers in enhancing tubular occlusion, but is not effective with oxalate desensitizers.

AB In the literature, there have been no studies showing clear results on how radio-contrast pharmaceuticals would affect intact disc tissue cells. In this context, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of iopromide and gadoxetic acid, frequently used in the discography, on intact lumbar disc tissue in pharmaco-molecular and histopathological level. Primary cell cultures were prepared from the healthy disc tissue of the patients operated in the neurosurgery clinic. Except for the control group, the cultures were incubated with the indicated radio-contrast agents. Cell viability, toxicity and proliferation indices were tested at specific time intervals. The cell viability was quantitatively analysed. It was also visually rechecked under a fluorescence microscope with acridine orange/propidium iodide staining. Simultaneously, cell surface morphology was analysed with an inverted light microscope, while haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining methodology was used in the histopathological evaluations. The obtained data were evaluated statistically. Unlike the literature, iopromide or gadoxetic acid did not have any adverse effects on the cell viability, proliferation and toxicity (P < 0.05). Although this study reveals that radio-contrast pharmaceuticals used in the discography, often used in neurosurgical practice, can be safely used, it should be remembered that this study was performed in an in vitro environment.

AB Guaranteeing a safe, efficient, and comfortable traveling system for pedestrians is one of the most important aspects of an intelligent transportation system. The microscopic simulation of pedestrian flow has attracted increasing research attention in recent years since a reliable simulation model for pedestrian flow may greatly benefit engineers and operators in mass transportation management, as well as designers and planners in urban planning and architecture. This paper introduces CityFlow, an agent-based microscopic pedestrian flow simulation model. The building floor plan in the model is represented by a continuous space constructed in a network approach, and each pedestrian is regarded as a self-adapted agent. Agent movement is implemented in a utility maximization approach by considering various human behaviors. The influences of parameters in the model on the simulation results are investigated. Typical pedestrian flow phenomena, including the unidirectional and bidirectional flow in a corridor as well as the flow through bottlenecks, are simulated. The simulation results are further compared with empirical study results. The comparison reveals that the model can approach the density-speed fundamental diagrams and the empirical flow rates at bottlenecks within acceptable system dimensions. The simulation results of the bidirectional pedestrian flow also show that the model can reproduce the lane-formation phenomenon.

AB Pentacycloundecane (PCU) lactam-peptide based HIV protease inhibitors were synthesized and nanomolar activity against the resistance-prone wild type C-South African HIV protease is reported. NMR investigations indicated that the activity is related to the chirality of the PCU moiety and its ability to induce conformations of the coupled peptide side chain. EASY-ROESY NMR experiments gave information about the 3D structure of the cage peptides and 3D solution structure could be linked to the experimental IC(50) activity profile of the considered inhibitors. QM/MM/MD simulations of the inhibitors in solution confirmed the NMR observed conformations. Docking experiments and QM/MM/MD simulations of the inhibitor-HIV PR complexes were also performed. These computational results complimented the experimental inhibition activities and enabled us to report a unique binding mode for PCU-based inhibitors at the active site of HIV-protease enzyme. A conserved hydrogen bonding pattern between the norstatine type functional group of the PCU hydroxylactam and active site residues, ASP25/ASP25', was observed in all active compounds. The biological significance and possible mode of inhibition by PCU-based HIV PR inhibitors discussed herein provide us with a deeper understanding of the mode of action of these novel inhibitors. The PCU-peptides are between 6000 and 8500 time less toxic to human MT-4 cells than Lopinavir. This potentially creates new application avenues for these putative inhibitors to be investigated against a vast number of other disease-related proteases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

   Environmental Defensive Expenditures
AB Many studies have stressed that human activities may cause the extinction of single species. Anthropogenic activities, however, may affect not only the number of individuals of single species, but also their behavior. To investigate this issue, we propose a growth model in which agents may care not only for the species' survival but also for the typicality of their behavior. We assume that the environmental defensive expenditures can protect the species avoiding their extinction, but can induce the species to modify their behavior. Results emerging from the model suggest that if the social planner cares for typicality of species behavior, then an infinite growth process may no longer be optimal. Numerical simulations, moreover, show the possible existence of a trade-off between number and behavior of the species, leading the system to a high number of species' members that behave in an atypical way or to few members behaving very typically.

TI An Agent-Based Empirical Game Theory Approach for Airport Security

LA English
DT Article
DE agent-based modeling; patrolling games; security game; airport security;
   empirical game theory
AB Airports are attractive targets for terrorists, as they are designed to accommodate and process large amounts of people, resulting in a high concentration of potential victims. A popular method to mitigate the risk of terrorist attacks is through security patrols, but resources are often limited. Game theory is commonly used as a methodology to find optimal patrol routes for security agents such that security risks are minimized. However, game-theoretic models suffer from payoff uncertainty and often rely solely on expert assessment to estimate game payoffs. Experts cannot incorporate all aspects of a terrorist attack in their assessment. For instance, attacker behavior, which contributes to the game payoff rewards, is hard to estimate precisely. To address this shortcoming, we proposed a novel empirical game theory approach in which payoffs are estimated using agent-based modeling. Using this approach, we simulated different attacker and defender strategies in an agent-based model to estimate game-theoretic payoffs, while a security game was used to find optimal security patrols. We performed a case study at a regional airport, and show that the optimal security patrol is non-deterministic and gives special emphasis to high-impact areas, such as the security checkpoint. The found security patrol routes are an improvement over previously found security strategies of the same case study.

ID TRANSITION
AB In nature, many animal groups, such as fish schools or bird flocks, clearly display structural order and appear to move as a single coherent entity. In order to understand the complex motion of these systems, we study the Vicsek model of self-propelled particles (SPP) which is an important tool to investigate the behavior of collective motion of live organisms. This model reproduces the biological behavior patterns in the two-dimensional (2D) space. Within the framework of this model, the particles move with the same absolute velocity and interact locally in the zone of orientation by trying to align their direction with that of the neighbors. In this paper, we model the collective movement of SPP using an agent-based model which follows biologically motivated behavioral rules, by adding a second region called the attraction zone, where each particles move towards each other avoiding being isolated. Our main goal is to present a detailed numerical study on the effect of the zone of attraction on the kinetic phase transition of our system. In our study, the consideration of this zone seems to play an important role in the cohesion. Consequently, in the directional orientation, the zone that we added forms the compact particle group. In our simulation, we show clearly that the model proposed here can produce two collective behavior patterns: torus and dynamic parallel group. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB When casting behaviour as active (Bayesian) inference, optimal inference is defined with respect to an agent's beliefs - based on its generative model of the world. This contrasts with normative accounts of choice behaviour, in which optimal actions are considered in relation to the true structure of the environment - as opposed to the agent's beliefs about worldly states (or the task). This distinction shifts an understanding of suboptimal or pathological behaviour away from aberrant inference as such, to understanding the prior beliefs of a subject that cause them to behave less 'optimally' than our prior beliefs suggest they should behave. Put simply, suboptimal or pathological behaviour does not speak against understanding behaviour in terms of (Bayes optimal) inference, but rather calls for a more refined understanding of the subject's generative model upon which their (optimal) Bayesian inference is based. Here, we discuss this fundamental distinction and its implications for understanding optimality, bounded rationality and pathological (choice) behaviour. We illustrate our argument using addictive choice behaviour in a recently described 'limited offer' task. Our simulations of pathological choices and addictive behaviour also generate some clear hypotheses, which we hope to pursue in ongoing empirical work. (c) 2014 The Authors.

AB Rapamycin, an anti-proliferative agent, is effective in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma and recurrent breast cancers. We proposed that this potent mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor may be useful for the treatment of gliomas as well. We examined the cytotoxicity of rapamycin against a rodent glioma cell line, determined the toxicity of rapamycin when delivered intracranially, and investigated the efficacy of local delivery of rapamycin for the treatment of experimental malignant glioma in vivo. We also examined the dose-dependent efficacy of rapamycin and the effect when locally delivered rapamycin was combined with radiation therapy. Rapamycin was cytotoxic to 9L cells, causing 34% growth inhibition at a concentration of 0.01 mu g/mL. No in vivo toxicity was observed when rapamycin was incorporated into biodegradable caprolactone-glycolide (35:65) polymer beads at 0.3%, 3%, and 30% loading doses and implanted intracranially. Three separate efficacy studies were performed to test the reproducibility of the effect of the rapamycin beads as well as the validity of this treatment approach. Animals treated with the highest dose of rapamycin beads tested (30%) consistently demonstrated significantly longer survival durations than the control and placebo groups. All dose-escalating rapamycin bead treatment groups (0.3%, 3% and 30%), treated both concurrently with tumor and in a delayed manner after tumor placement, experienced a significant increase in survival, compared with controls. Radiation therapy in addition to the simultaneous treatment with 30% rapamycin beads led to significantly longer survival duration than either therapy alone. These results suggest that the local delivery of rapamycin for the treatment of gliomas should be further investigated.

AB In this work we consider the influence of mass media in the dynamics of the two-dimensional Sznajd model. This influence acts as an external field, and it is introduced in the model by means of a probability p of the agents to follow the media opinion. We performed Monte Carlo simulations on square lattices with different sizes, and our numerical results suggest a change on the critical behavior of the model, with the absence of the usual phase transition for p >similar to 0.18. Another effect of the probability p is to decrease the average relaxation times tau, that are log-normally distributed, as in the standard model. In addition, the tau values depend on the lattice size L in a power-law form, tau similar to L-alpha, where the power-law exponent depends on the probability p. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Models are an integral part of the scientific endeavor, whether they be conceptual, mathematical, statistical, or simulation models. Models of appropriate complexity facilitate comprehension and improve understanding of the variables driving system processes. In the context of conservation planning decision-making or research efforts, a useful model can aid interpretation and avoid overfitting by including only essential elements. Models can serve two related, but different purposes: understanding and prediction of future system behavior. Predictive models can require several iterations of refinement and empirical data gathering to be useful for conservation planning. Models with less predictive ability can be used to enhance understanding of system function and generate hypotheses for empirical evaluation. Modeling monarch butterfly systems, whether it be landscape-scale movement in breeding habitats, migratory behavior, or population dynamics at monthly or yearly timeframes, is challenging because the systems encompass complex spatial and temporal interactions across nested scales that are difficult, if not impossible, to empirically observe or comprehend without simplification. We review mathematical, statistical, and simulation models that have provided insights into monarch butterfly systems. Mathematical models have provided understanding of underlying processes that may be driving monarch systems. Statistical models have provided understanding of patterns in empirical data, which may represent underlying mechanisms. Simulations models have provided understanding of mechanisms driving systems and provide the potential to link mechanisms with data to build more predictive models. As an example, recently published agent-based models of non-migratory eastern North American monarch butterfly movement and egg-laying may provide the means to explore how different spatial patterns of habitat, habitat quality, and the interaction of stressors can influence future adult recruitment. The migratory process, however, has not been addressed with agent-based modeling. Using western monarch migration as an example, we describe how modeling could be used to provide insights into migratory dynamics. Future integration of migratory models with non-migratory and population dynamics models may provide better understanding and ultimately prediction of monarch butterfly movement and population dynamics at a continental scale.

AB Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are used as negative contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging: owing to their large magnetic moment the water proton spins are dephased, which accelerates the nuclear magnetic relaxation of an aqueous sample containing these particles. Transverse and longitudinal relaxation times depend on several parameters of the nanoparticles such as radius and magnetization and on experimental parameters such as the static magnetic field or echo time. In this work, we introduce a new simulation methodology, using a classical formalism, allowing the simulation of the NMR signal during transverse and longitudinal relaxation induced by superparamagnetic particles in an aqueous solution, which, to our knowledge has never been done before. Nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profiles are obtained for a wide range of nanoparticle radii and magnetizations. The results can be classified in two regimes-the well-known motional averaging and static regimes. This generalizes previous studies focusing on transverse relaxation at high magnetic field (larger than 1 T). Simulation results correspond to analytical theories in their validity range and so far unknown dependences of the relaxation with magnetization and radii of the NMR dispersions profiles are observed, which could be used to characterize experimental samples containing large superparamagnetic particles.

AB The use of genetic tools, imaging technologies and ex vivo culture systems has provided significant insights into the role of tissue inducer cells and associated signaling pathways in the formation and function of lymphoid organs. Despite advances in experimental technologies, the molecular and cellular process orchestrating the formation of a complex three-dimensional tissue is difficult to dissect using current approaches. Therefore, a robust set of simulation tools have been developed to model the processes involved in lymphoid tissue development. Specifically, the role of different tissue inducer cell populations in the dynamic formation of Peyer's patches has been examined. Utilizing approaches from systems engineering, an unbiased model of lymphoid tissue inducer cell function has been developed that permits the development of emerging behaviors that are statistically not different from that observed in vivo. These results provide the confidence to utilize statistical methods to explore how the simulator predicts cellular behavior and outcomes under different physiological conditions. Such methods, known as sensitivity analysis techniques, can provide insight into when a component part of the system (such as a particular cell type, adhesion molecule, or chemokine) begins to have an influence on observed behavior, and quantifies the effect a component part has on the end result: the formation of lymphoid tissue. Through use of such a principled approach in the design, calibration, and analysis of a computer simulation, a robust in silico tool can be developed which can both further the understanding of a biological system being explored, and act as a tool for the generation of hypotheses which can be tested utilizing experimental approaches.

AB If exposure to xenoestrogens or electromagnetic fields (EMFs) such as 60 Hz contributes to the etiology of breast cancer, it is likely that they must stimulate the growth of breast cells, damage genetic material or enhance the effects of other mitogenic or mutagenic agents (co-promotion). Therefore, the ability of xenoestrogens or exposure to 60-Hz fields to stimulate the entry of growth-arrested human breast cancer cells into the cell cycle was determined using cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activity, synthesis of cyclin D1 and cdc2 activity. Exposure of estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 or T-47D cells to estrogen and xenoestrogens (DDT and Red No. 3) increased Cdk2 and cyclin B1-cdc2 activity and cyclin D1 synthesis. Exposure of breast cancer cells to 12 mG or 1 or 9 G electromagnetic fields at 60 Hz failed to stimulate Cdk2 or cyclin B1-cdc2 activity or cyclin D1 synthesis. Simultaneous co-exposure of cells to 60-Hz fields and chemical promoters did not enhance Cdk2 activation above the levels produced by the chemical promoter alone. Estrogen and xenoestrogens also stimulated binding of the estrogen receptor to the estrogen receptor element but the EMF did not. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induced phosphorylation of p53 and pRb105 in MCF-7 cells, but EMF exposure had no effect. DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic agents and Red Dye No. 3 were found to increase p53 site-specific DNA binding in breast cancer cells, but EMF exposure did not. Differential display analysis failed to detect any effect of EMF exposure on gene expression in MCF-7 cells, whereas the effects of estradiol were detected. These studies suggest that estrogen and xenoestrogens stimulate growth-arrested breast cancer cells to enter the growth cycle, but EMF exposure does not. Site-specific p53-DNA binding was increased in MCF-7 cells treated with DNA-damaging agents, but not by EMF exposure. EMF exposure does not appear to act as a promoter or DNA-damaging agent for human breast cancer cells in vitro. (C) 1996 by Radiation Research Society

AB To follow a goal-directed behavior, an autonomous agent must be able to acquire knowledge about the causality between its motor actions and corresponding sensory feedback. Since the complexity of such sensorimotor relationships directly influences required cognitive resources, this work proposes that it is of importance to keep the agent's sensorimotor relationships simple. This implies that the agent should be designed in a way such that sensory consequences can be described and predicted in a simplified manner. Living organisms implement this paradigm by adapting sensory and motor systems specifically to their behavior and environment. As a result, they are able to predict sensorimotor consequences with a strongly limited amount of (expensive) nervous tissue. In this context, the present work proposes that advantageous artificial sensory and motor layouts can be evolved by rewarding the ability to predict self-induced stimuli through simple sensorimotor relationships. Experiments consider a simulated agent recording realistic visual stimuli from natural images. The obtained results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to (i) synthesize visual sensorimotor structures adapted to an agent's environment and behavior, and (ii) serve as a computational model for testing hypotheses regarding the development of biological visual sensorimotor systems.

ID IRON COKE; TEMPERATURE; OPERATION; ZONE
AB In recent years, the reduction of CO2 emissions and the stable supply of raw materials arc two major issues for the steel industry. Low reducing agent operation in the blast furnace is required to reduce CO2 emissions in ironmaking. As a mean of realizing low reducing agent operation with using low-grade raw materials, ferro coke characterized by high coke reactivity is considered to be useful. Theoretical and experimental studies were carried out to verify the effect of the ferro coke usage on reaction behavior in blast furnace.
   Investigation of CO2 reactivity at the simulated blast furnace condition revealed that the initial temperature of CO2 reaction of ferro coke is lower than the temperature of conventional coke. At the temperature of over 1100 degrees C, the deterioration of ferro coke strength after reaction was depressed because the reaction occurred preferentially at the surface of the ferro coke.
   The coke and ferro coke strength after reaction was estimated based on the experimental results with the two-dimensional mathematical model of the blast furnace. The average coke strength of ferro coke and conventional coke with charging of ferro coke (100 kg/t) was little less than the coke strength without ferro coke charging. It is predicted that the carbon saving with charging of ferro coke (100 kg/t) is about 6% in comparison to without ferro coke charging.

AB The aim of this work was an experimental and theoretical investigation of the influence of electrolyte (NaCl) and surfactant (SP), as textile auxiliary agents (TAAs), onto reactive blue 5G (RB5G) dye removal by applying untreated fish scales (FS) in batch system. Kinetic and equilibrium studies were performed, aiming at the comprehension of the mass transfer mechanisms through phenomenological modeling. The biosorbent was texturally characterized, to investigate the adsorbent's characteristics and to support the models' assumptions. Hence, a physically meaningful' modeling to assess different systems containing dye-TAA mixtures was employed. The experimental results indicated that despite the FS nonporous characteristics, it showed remarkable adsorption capacities (approximate to 291 mg g-1), which may be ascribed to the adsorbent-adsorbate affinity and to dye-aggregates adsorption onto the FS surface. Those results evidence a potential use of FS as an alternative biosorbent material. The mathematical model was able to identify the rate-limiting step of the process; to predict the adsorption kinetics and equilibrium condition, comprising the description of aggregates formation; and to successfully predict kinetic behavior of independent data in simulated real effluent. Those results indicate that the model can be used to simulate operating conditions and, therefore, support the design, optimization, and scale-up of adsorption processes.

AB Background: There is little data guiding clinicians on how to discontinue vasopressors among septic shock patients on concomitant norepinephrine (NE) and vasopressin (VP). Objective: To determine the incidence of hypotension within 24 hours of discontinuing NE (NE DC first) versus VP (VP DC first) first in septic shock patients. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated septic shock patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (MICU) and surgical ICU (SICU) receiving concomitant NE and VP. Receipt of additional vasopressors, mixed shock states, expired or care withdrawn, and NE and VP discontinued simultaneously were exclusion criteria. The primary outcome was incidence of hypotension within 24 hours of first vasopressor discontinuation. Secondary outcomes included time to hypotension, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS, and ICU mortality. Results: A total of 80 patients were included (NE DC first [n = 35]; VP DC first [n = 45]), with a median age of 73 years and median modified Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores of 21 and 7, respectively. More patients in the NE DC first group were in the SICU (42.9% vs 20.0%; P = 0.048) with more intra-abdominal infections (40.0% vs 15.6%; P = 0.021) and fewer appropriate empirical antibiotics (62.9% vs 86.7%; P = 0.018). Hypotension within 24 hours of first agent discontinuation was higher in the VP DC first group (28.6% vs 62.2%; P = 0.004), with similar hospital LOS and ICU mortality. Multivariate analysis identified VP DC first as an independent predictor of hypotension (odds ratio = 7.2; CI = 2.3-22.7). Conclusion: Among septic shock patients on concomitant NE and VP, discontinuation of VP first was associated with an increased incidence of hypotension; future prospective control trials are warranted.

ID RISK-AVERSION; OPTIONS
AB The behaviour of market agents has been extensively covered in the literature. Risk averse behaviour, described by Von Neumann and Morgenstern (Theory of games and economic behavior. Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1944) via a concave utility function, is considered to be a cornerstone of classical economics. Agents prefer a fixed profit over an uncertain choice with the same expected value, however, lately there has been a lot of discussion about the empirical evidence of such risk averse behaviour. Some authors have shown that there are regions where market utility functions are locally convex. In this paper we construct a test to verify uncertainty about the concavity of agents' utility function by testing the monotonicity of empirical pricing kernels (EPKs). A monotonically decreasing EPK corresponds to a concave utility function while a not monotonically decreasing EPK means non-averse pattern on one or more intervals of the utility function. We investigate the EPKs for German DAX data for the years 2000, 2002 and 2004 and find evidence of non-concave utility functions: the null hypothesis of a monotonically decreasing pricing kernel is rejected for the data under consideration. The test is based on approximations of spacings through exponential random variables. In a simulation we investigate its performance and calculate the critical values (surface).

TI Epidemic modeling with discrete-space scheduled walkers: extensions and

DT Article; Proceedings Paper
CT OptAIDS Workshop 2009
CY JUL 29, 2009
CL Toronto, CANADA
AB Background: This exploratory paper outlines an epidemic simulator built on an agent-based, data-driven model of the spread of a disease within an urban environment. An intent of the model is to provide insight into how a disease may reach a tipping point, spreading to an epidemic of uncontrollable proportions.
   Methods: As a complement to analytical methods, simulation is arguably an effective means of gaining a better understanding of system-level disease dynamics within a population and offers greater utility in its modeling capabilities. Our investigation is based on this conjecture, supported by data-driven models that are reasonable, realistic and practical, in an attempt to demonstrate their efficacy in studying system-wide epidemic phenomena. An agent-based model (ABM) offers considerable flexibility in extending the study of the phenomena before, during and after an outbreak or catastrophe.
   Results: An agent-based model was developed based on a paradigm of a 'discrete-space scheduled walker' (DSSW), modeling a medium-sized North American City of 650,000 discrete agents, built upon a conceptual framework of statistical reasoning (law of large numbers, statistical mechanics) as well as a correct-by-construction bias. The model addresses where, who, when and what elements, corresponding to network topography and agent characteristics, behaviours, and interactions upon that topography. The DSSW-ABM has an interface and associated scripts that allow for a variety of what-if scenarios modeling disease spread throughout the population, and for data to be collected and displayed via a web browser.
   Conclusion: This exploratory paper also presents several research opportunities for exploiting data sources of a non-obvious and disparate nature for the purposes of epidemic modeling. There is an increasing amount and variety of data that will continue to contribute to the accuracy of agent-based models and improve their utility in modeling disease spread. The model developed here is well suited to diseases where there is not a predisposition for contraction within the population. One of the advantages of agent-based modeling is the ability to set up a rare event and develop policy as to how one may mitigate damages arising from it.

TI Increasing Specificity of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging Using the
   Interaction of Quasi Counter-Propagating Wavefronts: A Proof of Concept

AB Detection methods implemented in present clinical ultrasound scanners for contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging show high sensitivity but a rather poor specificity due to pseudo-enhancement (false detection of contrast agent) produced by nonlinear wave propagation. They all require linear ultrasound propagation to detect nonlinear scattering of contrast agent microbubbles. Even at low transmit pressure, nonlinear wave propagation occurs in regions perfused with contrast agent because contrast agent microbubbles can dramatically enhance the nonlinear elastic behavior of the medium. This image artifact hinders further development of contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging toward reliable quantitative measurement of local concentration of contrast agent and blood perfusion kinetics. We propose in this manuscript a new detection method, with specific beamforming and pulsing scheme, that produces contrast images with highly reduced pseudo-enhancement. It is based on the interaction of two diverging wavefronts broadcasted by two single elements of a conventional probe array. The contrast image is formed line by line; one single image line is the line segment bisector defined by the centers of the two transmitting elements. Each image line is formed by a three-step pulse sequence: (1) transmission with one element, (2) transmission with the other element, and (3) transmission with both elements. The proof of principle is shown with numerical simulations and in vitro experiments. The method is implemented in a programmable ultrasound system and tested in a tissue-mimicking phantom containing a vessel filled with diluted contrast agent. At a given depth, increasing the distance between the two transmitting elements increases the angle describing the propagation directions of the two wavefronts. As a result, the nonlinear interaction between the two broadcasted waves is reduced. We show experimentally that increasing the distance between the transmitting elements from 0.6 to 24 mm reduces the amplitude of the pseudoenhancement at the far wall of the vessel relative to true contrast signal amplitude in the vessel by 12 dB, therefore improving specificity in the contrast-enhanced image.

AB It is well-known that financial asset returns exhibit fat-tailed distributions and long-term memory. These empirical features are the main objectives of modeling efforts using (i) stochastic processes to quantitatively reproduce these features and (ii) agent-based simulations to understand the underlying microscopic interactions. After reviewing selected empirical and theoretical evidence documenting the behavior of traders, we construct an agent-based model to quantitatively demonstrate that "fat" tails in return distributions arise when traders share similar technical trading strategies and decisions. Extending our behavioral model to a stochastic model, we derive and explain a set of quantitative scaling relations of long-term memory from the empirical behavior of individual market participants. Our analysis provides a behavioral interpretation of the long-term memory of absolute and squared price returns: They are directly linked to the way investors evaluate their investments by applying technical strategies at different investment horizons, and this quantitative relationship is in agreement with empirical findings. Our approach provides a possible behavioral explanation for stochastic models for financial systems in general and provides a method to parameterize such models from market data rather than from statistical fitting.

AB A new method is reported in this paper that the toughness, stiffness and heat resistance of impact polypropylene copolymer (IPC) resin could be increased simultaneously by adding a small amount of hydrophobic nano-SiO2. According to the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and polarized optical microscopy (POM), a small amount of nano-SiO2 can significantly reduce both the particle size of ethylene-propylene rubber and the spherulite size of polypropylene matrix in IPC; therefore, the stiffness, the heat resistance and the toughness of IPC at room temperature and low temperature can be improved simultaneously. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results of the composite material indicate that the nano-SiO2 particles are distributed uniformly in IPC resin. Tested in accordance with ASTM standard, the new composite material prepared in this new way shows that the flexural modulus and heat distortion temperature of IPC/nano-SiO2 composite can gain a monotonical increase as much as 8% and 9.6%. It is also found that the nano-SiO2 and the nucleating agent have synergy effect on IPC modification. When the content of nanoparticles reaches 0.7%, the impact strength gets an increase of 16.5%, the best performance among all samples. The particle sizes of ethylene-propylene rubber and spherulite size of polypropylene matrix in IPC are further reduced when nano-SiO2 and nucleating agent are added into IPC together, which improve further the properties of IPC. The flexural modulus, flexural strength, Izod notched impact strength and heat distortion temperature of IPC are increased by 18%, 15%, 10% and 20% when 0.7% of SiO2 and 0.3% of nucleating agent VP-101B are added into IPC resin. The experimental results show that, to modify IPC, use of the nano-particles and the nucleating agent together is a promising method to produce high performance IPC with high toughness, high stiffness and high heat resistance.

We studied the human myeloma (8226) and T-cell leukemia (GEM) cell lines selected for resistance to the anthracenes, doxorubicin or mitoxantrone, by continuous culture in the presence of either agent, We found that these drug-resistant cell lines were also resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, The degree of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis correlated directly with the level of resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. These observations indicate that, as cancer cell lines develop mechanisms of drug resistance, they may also develop mechanisms of resistance to physiologic signals of apoptosis, Two mechanisms of resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis were observed in these cell lines, One mechanism was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the surface expression of Fas antigen. Analysis of RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays showed that the reduction of Fas antigen expression occurred at the level of transcription, A second mechanism of drug resistance showed no decrease of Fas antigen expression; however, the apoptotic response was diminished, In this situation, removal of the chemotherapeutic agent resulted in a partial reversion to chemosensitivity and re-expression of the Fas antigen, but these cell lines did not regain the ability to undergo apoptosis in response to cross-linking by anti-fas antibody. These findings support the hypothesis that apoptosis mediated by both chemotherapeutic agents and physiologic stimuli may share a common downstream effector, The demonstration that selection for drug resistance in hematopoietic cell lines results in a simultaneous resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis may have clinical implications in the development of strategies for the treatment of resistant disease, Further analysis of the molecular mechanisms of Fas expression and function will facilitate the design of biological response modifying agents for the treatment of malignancy.

AB In this paper, a simple, green and environmental-friendly method is developed for depositing gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) on the surface of polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized graphene (graphene/PDA) for highly efficient catalysis. In this approach, graphene/PDA was prepared through the self-polymerization of dopamine in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) in aqueous solution. With the addition of HAuCl4, AuCl4-1 ions were adsorbed on the surface of graphene/PDA and in situ reduced to metallic Au NPs owing to the abundant catechol groups on the PDA chain. In the whole procedure, PDA not only acts as the surface modifier of graphene, but more importantly it also serves as the reducing agent and stabilizer for Au NPs simultaneously, avoiding the usage of any toxic reducing reagent or special stabilizing agent. The graphene/PDA-Au NPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the size and amount of Au NPs are tunable by changing the experimental conditions. The obtained graphene/PDA-Au NPs nanocomposite, combining the advantages of graphene and Au NPs, exhibits remarkable catalytic activity for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. Considering its green facile preparation procedure and high catalytic activity, the prepared graphene/PDA-Au NPs holds great promise as a highly efficient, cost-effective and environmental-friendly catalyst for industrial applications.

AB Hypothesis: Floral herbivory can affect the strength or pattern of natural selection for floral-sex ratio in a host plant with sexually dimorphic flowers.
   Organisms: The andromonoecious herb horsenettle (Solanum carolinense) and its main floral herbivore, the potato bud weevil (Anthonomus nigrinus).
   Methods: In a controlled experiment with potted plants, we exposed a group of 27 plants to simulated-weevil herbivory on 50% of their flower buds, the florivory rate found in a field study. A control group of 27 plants received no florivory. We used phenotypic-selection analyses to look for directional, disruptive, and stabilizing selection on floral-sex ratio in the two groups and to determine whether florivory changed the optimum ratio.
   Results: In the absence of florivory, directional selection acted to increase the percentage of male flowers, at least to a ratio of 67% males and 33% perfect flowers. Florivory changed the pattern to stabilizing selection, with an optimum of 9% male and 91% perfect flowers.

AB In this work, a combined approach using density functional theory (DFT), molecular dynamic simulations, and electrochemical experiments was developed to study organic additives used for a cyanide-free gold electrodeposition process. When 5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMH) is used as the complexing agent, organic additives with either imino groups or nitrogenous heterocyclic rings including polyethyleneimine (PEI), 2,20-bipyridine, and nicotinic acid (NA) were systematically investigated. Electronic properties and orbital information of these studied additives were determined by quantum chemical calculations based on DFT. Compared to the other additives, PEI was predicted as the most promising one for the introduced DMH based gold electrodeposition. The theoretical prediction was further verified by using experimental results. In particular, the cathodic polarization of the gold electrodeposition was significantly improved in the presence of PEI. Also, the resulting gold electrodeposit shows obviously finer crystalline particles largely. In addition, molecular dynamic simulations determined that PEI molecules possess optimized adsorption behavior on the gold surface, suggesting its effectiveness to be additive in the studied cyanide-free Au-electrodeposition electrolytes.

ID INTERPENETRATING POLYMER NETWORKS
AB Study of the simultaneous interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) between diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A (DGEBA) and unsaturated polyester (UP) was carried out at ambient temperature. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to investigate the intermolecular H-bonding and functional group changes. Viscosity changes due to H-bonding and crosslinking were examined with a Brookfield viscometer. Gelation time was measured by a Techne gelation timer. Complexation between Co (II) (the promoter for UP cure) and diamine (the curing agent for DGEBA) was detected with UV-visible spectrometer. Experimental evidence revealed that intermolecular interactions were observed in systems such as DGEBA/UP, DGEBA/diamine, UP/diamine, Co (II) /diamine, DGEBA/uncured UP, and UP/uncured DGEBA. All such interactions had measurable effects on the curing behaviors for both networks, as were indicated by the viscosity changes and gelation time. The IPNs thus obtained were further characterized with rheometric dynamic spectroscopy (RDS) and differential scaning calorimetry (DSC). Partial compatibility between UP and DGEBA networks was evidenced from a main damping peak with a shoulder near glass transition temperature (T(g)) for lower UP content; while at higher UP content, only a main damping peak near T(g) was observed. DSC revealed a broad glass transition for all IPNs. The resultant IPN materials were all transparent.

AB In this study, the distributed cooperative attitude tracking controller based on fast terminal sliding mode and Chebyshev neural network (CNN) is proposed for multiple spacecraft formation flying (SFF) system in the presence of external disturbance. Firstly, a new modified fast terminal sliding mode manifold, which has faster convergence rate than the existing terminal sliding modes, is proposed. Then, based on the proposed terminal sliding mode manifold, the distributed cooperative attitude tracking controller is designed for the SFF system, where the time varying reference attitude can be only accessed to a subset of the group member. To guarantee that the output of CNN used in the controller is bounded by the corresponding bound of the approximated unknown function, a modified adaptive law is proposed to revise the sliding mode manifold, meanwhile, the finite-time stability of SFF system can be also guaranteed. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed control algorithm.

AB A bolus injection multiple blood sampling method was developed for the simultaneous measurement of blood and plasma clearance of three radiopharmaceuticals in rats. Technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([Tc-99m]MAG(3)) and iodine-131-orthoiodohippurate ([I-131]OIH) were used as makers of effective renal blood now (ERBF), and iodine-125 iothalamate ([I-125]IOT) was used as a marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). These methods can be easily performed in rats without arterial catheterization. Tissue biodistribution was studied in four groups of rats subjected to the following: group A, renal pedicle isolation (sham-operated); group B, ligature of one kidney pedicle; group C, ligature of both renal pedicles; and group D, ligature of both kidney pedicles and the bile duct. Renal clearance of [Tc-99m]MAG(3) was greater than [I-131]OIH and both agents were cleared faster than ([I-125]- IOT). Either of the two markers of ERBF may be used in experimental studies, but it should be borne in mind that these are relative measurements of kidney performance. [99(m)Tc]MAG(3) and [I-125]-IOT showed bile excretion in healthy rats, so they cannot completely fulfill the requirements for use as markers of ERBF. When renal function was impaired experimentally, [Tc-99m]MAG(3) and [I-125]-IOT were excreted in bile and [I-131]OIH was secreted in the intestine. Thus, while the markers of ERBF and GFR may be reliable under normal physiological conditions, they may give progressively more erroneous values as renal function deteriorates.

AB The aim of the present study was to examine the possibilities/advantages of using recently introduced in-line spectroscopic process analyzers (Raman, NIR and plasma emission spectroscopy), within well-designed experiments, for the optimization of a pharmaceutical formulation and its freeze-drying process. The formulation under investigation was a mannitol (crystalline bulking agent)-sucrose (Iyo- and cryoprotector) excipient system. The effects of two formulation variables (mannitol/sucrose ratio and amount of NaCl) and three process variables (freezing rate, annealing temperature and secondary drying temperature) upon several critical process and product responses (onset and duration of ice crystallization, onset and duration of mannitol crystallization, duration of primary drying, residual moisture content and amount of mannitol hemi-hydrate in end product) were examined using a design of experiments (DOE) methodology. A 2-level fractional factorial design (2(5-1) = 16 experiments +3 center points = 19 experiments) was employed. All experiments were monitored in-line using Raman, NIR and plasma emission spectroscopy, which supply continuous process and product information during freeze-drying. Off-line X-ray powder diffraction analysis and Karl-Fisher titration were performed to determine the morphology and residual moisture content of the end product, respectively.
   In first instance, the results showed that - besides the previous described findings in De Beer et al., Anal. Chem. 81 (2009) 7639-7649 - Raman and NIR spectroscopy are able to monitor the product behavior throughout the complete annealing step during freeze-drying. The DOE approach allowed predicting the optimum combination of process and formulation parameters leading to the desired responses. Applying a mannitol/sucrose ratio of 4, without adding NaCl and processing the formulation without an annealing step, using a freezing rate of 0.9 degrees C/min and a secondary drying temperature of 40 degrees C resulted in efficient freeze-drying supplying end products with a residual moisture content below 2% and a mannitol hemihydrate content below 20%. Finally, using Monte Carlo simulations it became possible to determine how varying the factor settings around their optimum still leads to fulfilled response criteria, herewith having an idea about the probability to exceed the acceptable response limits. This multi-dimensional combination and interaction of input variables (factor ranges) leading to acceptable response criteria with an acceptable probability reflects the process design space.

AB The catalytic effect of triethylene glycol dimethyl ether (glyme) on the butylaminolysis of 4-nitrophenylcaprate (NPC) in water/AOT/chlorobenzene microemulsions has been studied. Experimental results show the existence of four simultaneous reaction pathways. One of them takes place at the microemulsion interphase where the rate-determining step of butylaminolysis is the formation of the addition intermediate, T-+/-. The locus of the other three pathways is the continuous medium of the microemulsion. These three pathways consist of the decomposition of the addition intermediate catalyzed by butylamine, by glyme, and by both of them. The kinetic model allows us to obtain the value of every rate and distribution constant involved in the overall reaction mechanism. We must emphasize that the reactions located in the continuous medium exhibit a kinetic behavior similar to the corresponding one found in pure chlorobenzene. On the basis of the pseudophase model, the percentage of reaction in each of the microdomains of the microemulsion has been calculated. Likewise, changes in the loci of reaction from the interphase to the continuous medium as a function of catalyst concentration have been proved.

AB 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an extensively used herbicide in the field of agriculture, its ever-escalating use induces toxicity, health effects, and environmental impact. Oxidative stress plays a key role in pathogenesis of 2,4-D-induced liver and kidney damage. Magnesium (Mg) is a highly effective antioxidant agent in restoring oxidative damage by directly influencing the metabolic and physiological processes. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate Mg role in ameliorating the oxidative damages provoked by 2,4-D in rat model. Male Wistar rats (180-220 g) were distributed into four groups and treated intragastrically for 4 weeks. Group 1: control, group 2: 2,4-D (150 mg/kg body weight/day), group 3: simultaneously treated with 2,4-D (150 mg/kg body weight/day) and Mg supplement (50 mg/kg body weight/day), and group 4: Mg supplement (50 mg/kg body weight/day). Under experimental conditions, plasma hepatic and renal biomarkers, tissue oxidative status, and antioxidant enzymes activities were investigated. Results demonstrated that 2,4-D intoxication caused hepatic and renal impairments as indicated by the significantly increased (p < 0.001) alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, urea, creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen levels. In addition, 2,4-D caused a significant enhancement (p < 0.001) in the level of malondialdehyde as well as reduction (p < 0.001) of the superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase activities in both hepatic and renal tissues. Mg treatment prevented and reversed the toxic variations induced by 2,4-D. In general, these outcomes suggest that Mg may have antioxidant potential and ameliorative effects against 2,4-D provoking hepatic and renal toxicity in rat model.

AB Cyclosporin A (CsA). a potent immunosuppressive agent, is used clinically to prevent allograft rejection after organ transplantation. Although recent experimental studies show that CsA prevents severe hepatic injury associated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), the efficacy of CsA has not been confirmed. In the present study, we evaluated whether CsA protects against the severe hepatic injury induced by simultaneous administration of D-galactosamine (GaIN, 200 mg/kg) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 10 mu g/kg) into the portal vein. The method of CsA (10 mg/kg) was divided into four groups: i.e. preinjection (24 and 2 h before administration of GaIN and LPS), concomitant single-injection, multiple-interval injection (0, 3, 6, 9 and 15 h after administration of GaIN and LPS) and no treatment. In the group receiving multiple-interval injections of CsA, liver function parameters (total bilirubin, asparate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels in sera) were significantly improved and the development of massive hepatic necrosis was significantly prevented, but no improvement of liver function parameters or histological changes was shown either the pre- or concomitant single-injection groups. The serum levels of TNF-alpha. and interferon-gamma showed no differences between the no treatment and multiple-interval injection groups. However, the serum level of interleukin 8 and neutrophil infiltration into the liver tissue after 24 h GaIN and LPS administration were significantly lower than those of the control group. The apoptotic index of liver tissue using the TUNEL method was not significantly different. Our data suggest that CsA protects against acute hepatic injury, if it is administered at the appropriate time during the course of hepatic injury. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB Background and Purpose: Intraluminal application of pharmacologic agents for acute ureteral dilation may facilitate difficult ureteroscopy. We characterized the in-vivo effects of intraluminal application of verapamil and theophylline on ureteral peristalsis and diameter in a porcine model.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-four female domestic pigs (35-40 kg) were incorporated into the study. We deployed a giant magneto resistive (GMR) sensor and electromagnetic (EMG) electrodes laparoscopically onto the ureteral surface for simultaneous measurement of the mechanical and electrical signals of ureteral peristalsis, respectively. The ureteral-luminal diameter was measured at three levels by digital retrograde pyelography and standardized to a 10-mm laparoscope. The results were calculated as change in peristalsis and ureteral diameter from baseline during the first hour after drug injection. We tested two smooth-muscle relaxants, verapamil (2 mg/kg) and theophylline (70 mg/kg), with saline and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; solvent) as controls. Six pigs were studied for each of the four groups. Hydration, anesthesia, and intra-abdominal pressure were standardized. The serum concentrations of the drugs were measured to determine systemic absorption.
   Results: During the first 10 minutes after intraluminal drug injection, theophylline caused a significant decrease in ureteral peristalsis (6.75 waves/10 minutes) compared with the control group (1.00/10 minutes; P = 0.02). This trend persisted for the next hour. However, there were no changes from baseline in ureteral width. Ureteral peristalsis and dilation remained similar after the saline and DMSO injections. Verapamil increased the diameter of the proximal ureter compared with the controls throughout the hour after drug injection. Fifteen minutes after the drug injection, the change in the ureteral diameter with verapamil was 1.38 mm (4.14F), while the control group showed a change of 0.27 nun (P = 0.03). At I hour, the width of the proximal ureter in the verapamil group had increased by 1.72 mm (5.16F), while the control group had changed by 0.55 mm (P = 0.03). There were no statistically significant changes in the widths of the mid or distal ureter. No ureteral dilation was observed in the other groups.
   Conclusions: In the porcine model, intraluminal application of pharmacologic agents produced independent effects on ureteral dilation and peristalsis. Theophylline inhibited ureteral peristalsis, and verapamil produced acute proximal-ureteral dilation. The ability to alter ureteral diameter or peristaltic activity acutely may facilitate ureteroscopy.

   traffic flow model
ID VEHICLE EMISSIONS
AB In this study, we developed a microcosmic mobile emissions model based on an intelligent agent model of vehicles. The intelligent agent was first introduced into a micro-traffic flow system. Individual differences in driver behavior were considered, and the theory of probability was applied to reflect the distribution of drivers' stochastic characteristic dispositions. Each vehicle expressed its intelligence through its own character by perceiving the leading vehicle. From an operational perspective, differences in drivers' dispositions were reflected by a weighted coefficient. Finally,a hybrid microcosmic mobile emissions model was proposed. Its coefficients were determined using traffic data and experiments. Because it addresses more aspects of the car-following process, this model is theoretically superior to previous models, as verified by a numerical simulation. The proposed model was applied to a case study of the emissions from ten vehicles in an urban setting. The model effectively estimated mobile emissions rates. The results indicate that the model can reflect individual differences among drivers and demonstrate that reckless drivers generate more emissions.

AB A new method for determining transfer constants based on an analysis of the In chain length (Or molecular weight) distributions has recently been reported. In this paper, the basis of this method is examined in terms of classical statistics and with the aid of simulated chain length distributions. The advantages, limitations and sources of error in the method are considered with reference to conventional analysis. We show that one major benefit is that the requisite information can be obtained by analysis of a small segment of the chain length distribution. This means that it may be applied under circumstances where there may be overlap between the distributions of the new polymer being formed and the transfer agent (i.e. transfer constants to polymeric species can be determined). The method also has general application since it is less sensitive to experimental noise, poor baseline selection, or the presence of artifacts in gel permeation chromatograms. Finally we look at the scope for obtaining additional mechanistic information on termination mechanisms by analysis of chain length distributions of low-conversion polymers by considering the effects of combination:disproportionation ratios and chain length dependent propagation and termination.

AB Poor aqueous solubility Of new therapeutic agents is one of the most pressing current challenges in drug delivery. Supersaturated solutions, generated in vivo either by virtue of the-intrinsic compound properties (i.e., Ionization behavior) or by dissolution of formulations containing a high energy form of the drug, are considered one of the most promising approaches to improve drug absorption, when it is limited by solubility. The,Challenge is to maintain supersaturation, typically achieved by adding polymeric crystallization inhibitors, for biologically relevant time periods. In this study, we present exciting preliminary observations about the,potential role of bile salts as crystallization inhibitors. Focusing on sodium taurocholate, an endogenous bile salt also widely used in simulated intestinal media, extended experimental nucleation induction times were observed in the presence of the surfactant for a,group of 11 diverse compounds, relative to induction times in buffer. Limited studies with two additional bile salts suggested,other members of the le salt family may also have crystallization inhibition properties. Given the endogenous nature of bile salts, as well as their use in simulated intestinal media, these observations are clearly Of potential importance when assessing the supersaturation behavior of poorly water-soluble compounds.

AB This project explores techniques for reducing the complexity of an agent-based model ( ABM). The analysis involved a model developed from the ethnographic research of Dr. Lee Hoffer in the Larimer area heroin market, which involved drug users, drug sellers, homeless individuals and police. The authors used statistical techniques to create a reduced version of the original model which maintained simulation fidelity while reducing computational complexity. This involved identifying key summary quantities of individual customer behavior as well as overall market activity and replacing some agents with probability distributions and regressions. The model was then extended to allow external market interventions in the form of police busts. Extensions of this research perspective, as well as its strengths and limitations, are discussed.

DE Adolescent sexual minority; HIV; Pre-exposure prophylaxis; Agent-based
   network model
AB Purpose: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-an effective and safe intervention to prevent HIV transmission-was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use by adolescents. Informed by studies of sexual behavior and PrEP adherence, retention, and promotion, we model the potential impact of PrEP use among at-risk adolescent sexual minority males.
   Methods: We simulate an HIV epidemic among men who have sex with men (MSM) aged 13-39. We assume adult MSM ages 19-39 have had PrEP available for 3 years with 20% coverage among eligible MSM based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. PrEP interventions for ages 16-18 are then simulated using adherence and retention profiles drawn from the ATN113 and Enhancing Preexposure Prophylaxis in Community studies across a range of uptake parameters (10%-10 0%). Partnerships across age groups were modeled using parameterizations from the RADAR study. We compare the percent of incident infections averted (impact), person-years on PrEP per infection averted (efficiency), and changes in prevalence over 10 years.
   Results: As compared to no PrEP use, baseline PrEP adherence and retention among adolescent sexual minority males drawn from the ATN113 and Enhancing Preexposure Prophylaxis in Community studies averted from 2.8% to 41.0% of HIV infections depending on the fraction of eligible adolescent sexual minority males that initiated PrEP at their annual health-care visit. Improved adherence and retention achieved with an array of focused interventions from real-world settings increased the percent of infections averted by as much as 26%-70%.
   Conclusions: Empirically demonstrated improvements in the PrEP continuum of care in response to existing interventions can substantially reduce incident HIV infections among adolescent sexual minority males. (C) 2020 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB BACKGROUND Adenosine, lidocaine, and magnesium (ALM) is a cardioplegic agent shown to improve survival by improving cardiac function, tissue perfusion, and coagulopathy in animal models of shock. We hypothesized prehospital ALM treatment in hemorrhagic shock would improve survival compared to current Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) resuscitation beyond the golden hour. METHODS Swine were randomized to: (1) TCCC, (2) 2 mL center dot kg(-1) vehicle control (VC), (3) 2 mL center dot kg(-1) ALM + drip, (4) 4 mL center dot kg(-1) ALM + drip, 5) 4 mL center dot kg(-1) ALM + delayed drip at 0.5 mL center dot kg(-1)center dot h(-1), 6) 4 mL/kg VC, 7) 4 mL center dot kg(-1) ALM for 15 minutes + delayed drip at 3 mL center dot kg(-1)center dot h(-1). Animals underwent pressure controlled hemorrhage to mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 30 mm Hg (S = 0). Treatment was administered at T = 0. After 120 minutes of simulated prehospital care (T = 120) blood product resuscitation commenced. Physiologic variables were recorded and laboratories were drawn at specified time points. RESULTS Tactical Combat Casualty Care demonstrated superior survival to all other agents. The VC and ALM groups had lower MAPs and systolic blood pressures compared with TCCC. Except for the VC groups, lactate levels remained similar with correction of base deficit after prehospital resuscitation in all groups. Kidney function and liver function remained comparable across all groups. Compared with baseline values, TCCC demonstrated significant hypocoagulability. CONCLUSION Adenosine, lidocaine, and magnesium, as administered in this study, are inferior to current Hextend-based resuscitation for survival from prolonged hemorrhagic shock in this model. In survivors, ALM groups had lower systolic blood pressures and MAPs, but provided a protective effect on coagulopathy as compared to TCCC. Adenosine, lidocaine, and magnesium do not appear to be a suitable low volume replacement to current TCCC resuscitation. The reduced coagulopathy compared to TCCC warrants future studies of ALM, perhaps as a therapeutic adjunct. Copyright (c) 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Theoretical studies on predicting potential reactive sites of attractive compounds are of significance, which are capable of providing deeper insight into their chemical behaviors as well as foundations for discovering new drug molecules. The 3,9-diazatetraasterane derivatives are a kind of cage compounds equipping with potent biological activities. In this paper, predication of reactive sites of 3,9-diazatetraasteranes bearing phenyl and ester groups (6,12-diphenyl-3,9-diazahexacyclo[6.4.0.0(2.7).0(4.11).0(5.10)]-dodecane-1,5,7,11-tetracarboxylate) was carried out by the conceptual density functional theory. Firstly, a conformational search of 3,9-diazatetraasterane was performed by molecular dynamics simulations associating with Quantum Mechanics calculations in order to obtain relative stable conformers. And then the reactive site prediction of 3,9-diazatetraasterane was carried out by the Fukui function and condensed Fukui function. The results exhibited that the potentially chemical reactive site is the N atom of 3,9-diazatetraasterane scaffold, which is readily attacked by electrophilic agent. Meanwhile, the calculated results were validated by experimental outcomes in the derivation of 3,9-diazatetraasteranes.

AB This article addresses a consensus phenomenon in a Cucker-Smale model where the magnitude of the step size is not necessarily a constant but it is a function of time. In the considered model the weights of mutual influences in the group of agents do not change. A sufficient condition under which the proposed model tends to a consensus is obtained. This condition strikingly demonstrates the importance of the graininess function in a consensus phenomenon. The results are illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB The efforts exerted by children, parents, and schools affect the outcome of the education process. We build this idea into a theoretical model where the effort exerted by the three groups of agents is simultaneously determined as a Nash equilibrium. The empirical analysis tests the model using the British National Child Development Study and finds support for this idea. We identify which factors affect educational attainment directly and which indirectly through effort. From a policy perspective, the paper indicates that affecting effort directly would have a positive impact on attainment.

AB The purpose of the paper is to investigate the flocking behavior of the discrete-time Cucker-Smale(C-S) model under general interaction network topologies with agents having their free-will accelerations. We prove theoretically that if the free-will accelerations of agents are summable, then, for any given initial conditions, the solution achieves flocking with a finite moving speed by suitably choosing the time step as well as the communication rate of the system or the strength of the interaction between agents. In particular, if the communication rate beta of the system is subcritical, i.e., beta is less than a critical value beta(c), then flocking holds for any initial conditions regardless of the strength of the interaction between agents. While, if the communication rate is critical (beta = beta(c)) or supercritical (beta > beta(c)), then flocking can only be achieved by making the strength of the interaction large enough. We also present some numerical simulations to support our obtained theoretical results.

AB This paper proposes an agent-based office market model, as a component of a Land Use and Transport (L-T) model, SelfSim, to simulate how firms and office buildings co-evolve over time. Essentially, the office market model is involved in both firm demography and office building development: the firmographic model is capable of simulating four typical events, namely, firm birth, growth, relocation and closure; the office building development model is to simulate how facility agents develop office buildings, according to the demand from firms, which is associated with the firm demography. The office market model was tested within theoretical examples set up based on a Chinese medium-sized city, Baoding: both global and local Sensitivity Analyses (SAs) were conducted to explore how the twenty seven key model parameters could influence the thirteen model outputs of interest, identifying five influential parameters. Finally, some specific spatially disaggregate model results were presented.

AB Cooperative control is a key issue for multirobot systems in many practical applications. In this paper, we address the problem of coordinating a set of mobile robots in the RoboCup soccer middle-size league. We show how the coordination problem that we face can be cast as a specific coalition formation problem, and we propose a distributed algorithm to efficiently solve it. Our approach is based on the distributed computation of a measure of satisfaction (called Agent Satisfaction) that each agent computes for each task. We detail how each agent computes the Agent Satisfaction by acquiring sensor perceptions through an omnidirectional vision system, extracting aggregated information from the acquired perception, and integrating such information with that communicated by the teammates. We empirically validate our approach in a simulated scenario and within RoboCup competitions. The experiments in the simulated scenario allow us to analyse the behaviour of the algorithm in different situations, while the use of the algorithm in real competitions validates the applicability of our approach to robotic platforms involved in a dynamic and complex scenario.

AB Novel chitosan/alginate microcapsules simultaneously loaded with copper cations and Trichoderma viride have been prepared and characterized. Information about the intermolecular interactions between biopolymers and bioactive agents was obtained by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Encapsulation of T. viride spores and the presence of copper cations in the same compartment does not inhibit their activity. Microcapsule loading capacity and efficiency as well as swelling behavior and release depend on both the size of the microcapsule and bioactive agents. The in vitro copper cation release profile was fitted to a Korsmeyer-Peppas empirical model. Fickian diffusion was found to be a rate-controlling mechanism of release from smaller microcapsules, whereas anomalous transport kinetics controlled release from larger microcapsules. The T. viride spore release profile exhibited exponential release over the initial lag time. The results obtained opened perspectives for the future use of chitosan/alginate microcapsules simultaneously loaded with biological and chemical agents in plant nutrition and protection.

AB In modeling expectation formation, economic agents are usually viewed as forming expectations adaptively or in accordance with some rationality postulate. We offer an alternative nonlinear model where agents exchange their opinions and information with each other. Such a model yields multiple equilibria, or attracting distributions, that are persistent but subject to sudden large jumps. Using German Federal Statistical Office economic indicators and German IFO Poll expectational data, we show that this kind of model performs well in simulation experiments. Focusing upon producers' expectations in the consumption goods sector, we also discover evidence that structural change in the interactive process occurred over the period of investigation (1970-1998). Specifically, interactions in expectation formation seem to have become less important over time.

AB Formal models can facilitate the development of organizational theory. The complex, adaptive, non-linear nature of human endeavor makes computational models a particularly useful type of formal model for exploring organizational behavior. Researchers, however, rarely contrast such models with empirical data. Further, researchers tend not to contrast such models with other such models. This paper presents results from the artificial organization project and demonstrates how contrasting models with each other and with empirical data can facilitate the development of more veridical organizational models. Specifically, this paper examines whether certain organizational models, differing only with respect to the cognitive limitations of, and adaptability or general intelligence of the agents are better or worse predictors of the behavior of similar organizations composed of humans. It is shown that, not only do different agent models predict different levels of organizational performance, they also predict different relative standings for different organizational structures. Finally, the adequacy of organizations composed of simple computational agents for predicting the behavior of organizations composed of humans appears to increase as the complexity of the organizational structure increases.

AB Purpose: Controlled hypotension during a surgical procedure is a way to decrease blood pressure and subsequently to improve the field of operation. Clonidine is an antihypertensive agent used for induced hypotension. Correction of maxillomandibular discrepancies may necessitate performing osteotomy on both jaws in many cases. Bimaxillary orthognathic surgery is a procedure that is associated with significant blood loss.
   Material and methods: A total of 30 participants who were candidates for double jaw orthognathic surgery were classified into two groups with equal numbers. In one group, 300 mu g oral clonidine premedication was administered 90 min before the operation, and in the other group a placebo with the same condition as in the first group. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate at 10 min intervals, operation time, blood loss, and surgeon satisfaction were measured.
   Results: A total of 10 men and 5 women with a mean age of 22.9 +/- 2.9 years in the study group and 13 men and 2 women with a mean age of 22.1 +/- 2.1 years in the control group were evaluated. The MAP was significantly lower in the clonidine group (P < 0.001). Intraoperative bleeding was 508.67 +/- 46.2 mL in the placebo group and 287.33 +/- 72.06 mL in the clonidine group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Significant differences were observed in operation time (P < 0.05) and surgeon satisfaction (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The authors of this study suggest clonidine premedication in bimaxillary orthognathic surgery. Hemodynamic stability, bleeding control, decrease of operative time, and enhancement of surgical results are advantages of this method.

DT Review
DE Active inference; Free energy principle; Process theory; Variational
   Bayesian inference; Markov decision process; Mathematical review
AB Active inference is a normative principle underwriting perception, action, planning, decision-making and learning in biological or artificial agents. From its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours. Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete state-space models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used to make empirical predictions.

ID CHOICE
AB Recent research on consumption has indicated a growing differentiation of consumption styles and habits, which in turn make the shoppers' decisions increasingly hard to grasp and more complex in general. In particular, it is found that the classic modelling techniques fail to sufficiently represent these decision processes. This paper examines the potentials of an agent-based approach for the locational choices of consumers for their shopping activities on a regional level. The model is applied to two product sectors, groceries and clothing, in two distinct research areas in northern Sweden and southern Germany. While the empirical findings generated for the two case studies resulted in quite different model designs, both are found to be equally applicable for representing the different choice mechanisms and result in forecasts of buying power flows and thus turnovers of individual shops. It is concluded that agent-based approaches provide an elaborate instrument to model consumer locational choices and to forecast consequences of planning decisions, although expanding the empirical basis on qualitative grounds of research may lead to still further advancements.

AB To correctly analyze the effects of general anesthetics on their potential targets by large-scale molecular simulation, the structural parameters and partial atomic charges of the anesthetics are of determinant importance. Geometric optimizations using the Hartree-Fock and the B3LYP density functional theory methods with the large 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set were performed to determine the structures and charge distributions of two halogenated anesthetics, 2-bromo-2-chloro-1,1,1-trifluoroethane (halothane) and fluoromethyl-2,2,2,-trifluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl) ethyl ether (sevoflurane). The calculated bond lengths and angles are within 3% of the corresponding experimental values reported for the similar molecular groups. Charges are assigned using the Mulliken population analysis and the electrostatic potential (ESP) based on the Merz-Kollman-Singh scheme. The atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory is also used to assign the charges in halothane. The dipole moments calculated with the Mulliken population analysis and ESP for the structures optimized by B3LYP/6-311+(2d,p) were respectively 1.355 and 1.430 D for halothane and 2.255 and 2.315 D for sevoflurane. These are in excellent agreement with the experimental values of 1.41 and 2.33 D for halothane and. sevoflurane, respectively. The calculated structures and partial charge distributions can be readily parameterized for molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations involving these halogenated agents.

AB Aims: Non-peptide ligands of oxytocin receptor (OTR) have promising potentialities as therapeutic agents with improved pharmacological properties. WAY-267,464 is a non-peptide agonist which loses its agonist activity when its resorcinol moiety is methylated, yielding a partial antagonist (denoted here, WAY-Methylated). This study attempts to rationalize these opposing activities by comparative analyses of structural dynamicsof OTR in complex with these ligands.
   Main methods: Glide extra precision (XP) docking with and without positional constraints was employed to probe alternative binding poses of both WAY-267,464 and WAY-Methylated. The more preferred configuration of each system was subjected to an extended 2 mu s MD simulation and the physics-based Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area (MM-GBSA) binding energy was used to rank the complexes with improved accuracy, in addition to empirical-based Glide docking score. Network analysis was performed, and the identified critical residues were cross-referenced with the experimental mutagenesis data.
   Key findings: The added methyl groups in the antagonist WAY-Methylated enhanced hydrophobicity, resulting in a flipped binding pose deeper in the binding pocket. Interestingly, OTR responded to the methylation by stabilizing the initial inactive conformation, decreasing fluctuations and increasing the overall secondary structural composition. Conversely, the agonist WAY-267,464 produced larger fluctuations to allow the receptor to change from the default inactive state to a state of partial activation. These transitions were further supported by the identified critical residues overlapping with experimental mutagenesis data.
   Significance: These findings provide insights into the activation mechanism of OTR by WAY-267.464 and its antagonism by WAY-Methylated.

AB Diffusion adaptive networks tasked with solving estimation problems have attracted attention in recent years due to their reliability, scalability, resource efficiency, and resilience to node and link failure. Diffusion adaptation strategies that are based on the least-mean-squares algorithm can be nonrobust against impulsive noise corrupting the measurements. Impulsive noise can degrade stability and steady-state performance, leading to unreliable estimates. In previous work ["Robust adaptation in impulsive noise," IEEE Trans. Signal Process., vol. 64, no. 11, pp. 2851-2865, Jun. 2016], a robust adaptive algorithm for stand-alone agents was developed, one that semi-parametrically estimates the optimal error nonlinearity jointly with the parameter of interest. Prior knowledge of the impulsive noise distribution was not assumed. In this paper, we extend the framework to solve the problem of robust distributed estimation by a network of agents. Challenges arise due to the coupling among the agents and the distributed nature of the problem. The resulting diffusion strategy is analyzed and its performance illustrated by numerical simulations.

AB Background: Women will be included as mission specialists in the upcoming international Space Station program. This paper describes the changes in volume-regulating hormones and determines the degree of degradation in orthostatic tolerance in a group of women after 120 d of bed rest. The aim of this study was to test a countermeasure program to be used by women during long-duration spaceflights. Methods: For 120 d of -6 degrees head-down bed rest (HDBR), eight healthy women were assigned either to a no-countermeasure (No-CM, n = 4), or to a countermeasure (CM, n = 4) group. In the countermeasure group, exercise began after 2 wk, pharmacological agents were given during the ist and 3rd mo, and the "Centaur" suit was worn on the last day of bed rest and during the day time for several days after bed rest. Diet supplements were taken during the 1st and 4th mo of HDBR. Tilt tests were run before and after HDBR. Results: After the HDBR, none of the CM subjects, had pre-syncopal or syncopal symptoms during tilt tests: BP was well maintained in the CM group, while heart rate and BP changed in the No-CM group. In plasma, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) increased in both groups and remained high throughout HDBR, while aldosterone increased and remained elevated in the No-CM group. Natriuresis was decreased during HDBR. Conclusion: The CM protocols used during this study were efficient and prevented orthostatic intolerance for the four CM subjects. It would be necessary to obtain more data regarding this set of CM protocols on female subjects to lead to statistical and formal conclusions.

AB Background
   Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and is associated with significant morbidity. Adequate treatment is essential to reduce morbidity and recurrence.
   Objectives To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for PD- associated peritonitis.
   Search strategy
   We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and reference lists without language restriction. Date of search: February 2005
   Selection criteria
   All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi- RCTs assessing the treatment of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients (adults and children) evaluating: administration of an antibiotic(s) by different routes (e. g. oral, intraperitoneal, intravenous); dose of an antibiotic agent(s); different schedules of administration of antimicrobial agents; comparisons of different regimens of antimicrobial agents; any other intervention including fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage and early catheter removal were included.
   Data collection and analysis
   Two authors extracted data on study quality and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the dichotomous results were expressed as relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous outcomes as mean difference (WMD) with 95% CI.
   Main results
   We identified 36 studies (2089 patients): antimicrobial agents (30); urokinase (4), peritoneal lavage (1) intraperitoneal (IP) immunoglobulin (1). No superior antibiotic agent or combination of agents were identified. Primary response and relapse rates did not differ between IP glycopeptide- based regimens compared to first generation cephalosporin regimens, although glycopeptide regimens were more likely to achieve a complete cure (3 studies, 370 episodes: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 3.58). For relapsing or persistent peritonitis, simultaneous catheter removal/ replacement was superior to urokinase at reducing treatment failure rates (1 study, 37 patients: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91). Continuous IP and intermittent IP antibiotic dosing had similar treatment failure and relapse rates. IP antibiotics were superior to IV antibiotics in reducing treatment failure (1 study, 75 patients: RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.81). The methodological quality of most included studies was suboptimal and outcome definitions were often inconsistent. There were no RCTs regarding duration of antibiotics or timing of catheter removal.
   Authors' conclusions
   Based on one study, IP administration of antibiotics is superior to IV dosing for treating PD peritonitis. Intermittent and continuous dosing of antibiotics are equally efficacious. There is no role shown for routine peritoneal lavage or use of urokinase. No interventions were found to be associated with significant harm.

AB This work offers detailed experimental evidence for crack healing in fully formed epoxy-amine polymer networks. Compact tension specimens of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (EPON-828) and 4,4'-methylene biscyclohexanamine were synthesized at stoichiometry and with an excess or paucity of an amine curing agent. Healing efficiencies were measured on the basis of the regain in the fracture load after a healing protocol was applied. For all systems investigated, the average healing efficiency for first fracture was greater than 50% when healing was conducted at 185 degrees C for 1 h. The crack-healing behavior was highly repeatable at all stoichiometries and healing was found to occur for repeated fracture-heal cycles of the same specimen. On the basis of results from size exclusion chromatography for the extractable phase, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, it is postulated that healing is primarily due to mechanical interlocking of the nodular topology of a fractured crack interface that occurs in the rubbery state and is set in place by vitrification upon cooling. A 1/2 power dependence of the healing efficiency on the healing time was observed, and this suggests that the interlocking of topographical features is governed by diffusive processes. For networks cured with a large excess of epoxide groups, the recovered fracture load was higher than that of virgin specimens. In this case, polyetherification or homopolymerization of previously unreacted epoxy groups increased the healing efficiency significantly, and this suggests that low degrees of covalent bonding can significantly enhance healing behavior in these systems.

TI Shadow Burden of Undiagnosed Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue
   Syndrome (ME/CFS) on Society: Retrospective and Prospective-In Light of
   COVID-19
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE myalgic encephalomyelitis; chronic fatigue syndrome; ME; CFS; COVID-19;
   diagnostic; impact on society
AB Background: Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a poorly understood, complex, multisystem disorder, with severe fatigue not alleviated by rest, and other symptoms, which lead to substantial reductions in functional activity and quality of life. Due to the unclear aetiology, treatment of patients is complicated, but one of the initial problems is the insufficient diagnostic process. The increase in the number of undiagnosed ME/CFS patients became specifically relevant in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this research was to investigate the issues of undiagnosed potential ME/CFS patients, with a hypothetical forecast of the expansion of post-viral CFS as a consequence of COVID-19 and its burden on society. Methods: The theoretical research was founded on the estimation of classic factors presumably affecting the diagnostic scope of ME/CFS and their ascription to Latvian circumstances, as well as a literature review to assess the potential interaction between ME/CFS and COVID-19 as a new contributing agent. The empirical study design consisted of two parts: The first part was dedicated to a comparison of the self-reported data of ME/CFS patients with those of persons experiencing symptoms similar to ME/CFS, but without a diagnosis. This part envisaged the creation of an assumption of the ME/CFS shadow burden "status quo", not addressing the impact of COVID-19. The second part aimed to investigate data from former COVID-19 patients' surveys on the presence of ME/CFS symptoms, 6 months after being affected by COVID-19. Descriptive and analytical statistical methods were used to analyse the obtained data. Results: The received data assumed that the previously obtained data on the ME/CFS prevalence of 0.8% in the Latvian population are appropriate, and the literature review reports a prevalence of 0.2-1.0% in developed countries. Regarding the reciprocity of ME/CFS and COVID-19, the literature review showed a lack of research in this field. The empirical results show quite similar self-esteem among ME/CFS patients and undiagnosed patients with longstanding disease experience, while former COVID-19 patients show a significantly lower severity of these problems. Notably, "psychological distress (anxiety)" and "episodic fatigue" are significantly predominant symptoms reported by former COVID-19 patients in comparison with ME/CFS patients and undiagnosed patients prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The results of our analysis predict that the total amount of direct medical costs for undiagnosed patients (out-of-pocket payments) is more than EUR 15 million p.a. (in Latvia), and this may increase by at least 15% due to the consequences of COVID-19. Conclusions: ME/CFS creates a significant shadow burden on society, even considering only the direct medical costs of undiagnosed patients-the number of whom in Latvia is probably at least five times higher than the number of discerned patients. Simultaneously, COVID-19 can induce long-lasting complications and chronic conditions, such as post-viral CFS, and increase this burden. The Latvian research data assume that ME/CFS patients are not a high-risk group for COVID-19; however, COVID-19 causes ME/CFS-relevant symptoms in patients. This increases the need for monitoring of patients for even longer after recovering from COVID-19 ' s symptoms, in order to prevent complications and the progression of chronic diseases.
   In the context of further epidemiological uncertainty, and the possibility of severe post-viral consequences, preventive measures are becoming significantly more important; an integrated diagnostic approach and appropriate treatment could reduce this burden in the future.

SO CLINICAL NEPHROLOGY

DT Article
DE activated charcoal; hyperphosphatemia; phosphate binder; chronic kidney
   disease; end-stage renal disease
AB Background: Calcium carbonate is widely used as a phosphate binder in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. An unwanted side effect of calcium carbonate is hypercalcemia and vascular calcification. Oral activated charcoal (AC) is a non-selective and highly effeotive adsorbent. We hypothesized that AC augments the phosphate binding capacity of calcium-based agents. We performed an in vitro study to test this hypothesis. Methods: Simulated gastric fluid and intestinal fluid were prepared with a phosphate concentration of 10 mmol/l. Different dosages of calcium chloride (0.083 g, 0.167 g, and 0.250 g), AC (0.15 g, 0.30 g, and 0.45 g) or a combination of both were added to either gastric or intestinal fluid for phosphate binding. After a reaction time of 2 hours, phosphate concentrations in the supernatant were measured, and absolute reduction and percent reduction of phosphate were calculated. The phosphate-binding abilities of calcium chloride, AC, and a combination of both were compared. Results: In simulated intestinal fluid there was no significant difference in the percent reduction of phosphate concentrations among the different calcium chloride concentration groups (28.90 +/- 2.04 vs. 33.33 +/- 3.90 vs. 31.86 +/- 5.23) and there was still no significant difference in phosphate concentrations among the different AC groups (3.33 +/- 0.08 vs. 3.26 +/- 0.01 vs. 3.36 +/- 0.11). In simulated gastric fluid phosphate concentrations at each of the time points (before the reaction, 1 hour after calcium chloride was added, and 2 hours after AC was added) were not significantly different. In simulated intestinal fluid the percent decrease in phosphate concentration in the calcium chloride + AC group was significantly higher than that in the calcium chloride group (48.23 +/- 5.55 vs. 30.72 +/- 6.11). Conclusions: AC alone had no phosphate-binding ability in either gastric or intestinal fluid. The phosphate-binding ability of calcium chloride was improved by AC in intestinal fluid.

AB An indole ring system is considered as a versatile scaffold in the pharmaceutical field. In this article, comparative QSAR modeling (2D-QSAR, 3D-QSAR; kNN-MFA and CoMSIA) was performed on some Knoevenagel-type cytotoxic indole derivatives to understand the structural requirements for the cytotoxic property of these compounds. The 2D-QSAR model was statistically significant and imparted high predictive ability (eta(Train) = 30; R = 0.917; R-A(2) = 0.801; cR(p)(2) = 0.757; Q(2) = 0.722; eta(Test) = 9; R-pred(2) = 0.799). A statistically significant 3D-QSAR kNN-MFA model (both with stepwise forward and simulated annealing model selection method) as well as a 3D-QSAR CoMSIA model was developed to identify the key chemical features associated with enhancing the cytotoxic activities of these indoles. The results suggest that the presence of bulky group in R position can cause better cytotoxic activities. Consequently, substitution with cyano group at X portion and cyano/ester/keto/sulphonyl features at Y position is favourable for the cytotoxicity. However, hydrophobic features in R' region are unfavourable for the biological activity. The chemical and structural features identified from the study may provide important avenues to modulate the structure of these indoles to a desirable biological end point.

AB We describe a Eulerian-Lagrangian-agent method (ELAM) for mechanistically decoding and forecasting 3-D movement patterns of individual fish responding to abiotic stimuli. A ELAM model is an individual-based model (IBM) coupling a (1) Eulerian framework to govern the physical, hydrodynamic, and water quality domains, (2) Lagrangian framework to govern the sensory perception and movement trajectories of individual fish, and (3) agent framework to govern the behavior decisions of individuals. The resulting ELAM framework is well suited for describing large-scale patterns in hydrodynamics and water quality as well as the much smaller scales at which individual fish make movement decisions. This ability of ELAM models to simultaneously handle dynamics at multiple scales allows them to realistically represent fish movements within aquatic systems. We introduce ELAMs with an application to aid in the design and operation of fish passage systems in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Individual virtual fish make behavior decisions about every 2.0 s. These are sub-meter to meter-scale movements based on hydrodynamic stimuli obtained from a hydraulic model. Movement rules and behavior coefficients are systematically adjusted until the virtual fish movements approximate the observed fish.
   The ELAM model introduced in this paper is called the Numerical Fish Surrogate. It facilitated the development of a mechanistic biological-based hypothesis describing observed 3-D movement and passage response of downstream migrating juvenile salmon at 3 hydropower dams on 2 rivers with a total of 20 different structural and operational configurations. The Numerical Fish Surrogate is presently used by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and public utility districts during project planning and design to forecast juvenile salmon movement and passage response to alternative bypass structures.

AB Layer-by-layer multilayer films of poly(styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and 4th generation poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (4G PAMAM) assembled on particle supports were modified by a stepwise process involving (i) cross-linking of free amino groups of PSS/4G PAMAM multilayers using a bifunctional cross-linking agent, gluteraldehyde, which simultaneously chemically activates the surface, (ii) covalently linking the free aldehyde groups made available from the cross-linker with octadecylamine (fatty-acylation), and (iii) adsorbing a poly(ethylene glycol) (molecular weight similar to2000) derivative of distearylphosphatidylethanolamine (PEG2000-DSPE) on the fatty-acylated surface (PEGylation). Microelectrophoresis, confocal laser scanning microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to follow the modification of the PSS/4G PAMAM multilayer coatings on the particles. Analogous experiments were performed on planar supports (silicon, glass, and gold) to additionally quantify the process by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, contact-angle, ellipsometry, and quartz crystal microbalance techniques. The experimental data from the colloid and planar supports were in mutual agreement, providing evidence for the stepwise surface modification of the multilayer films. Adsorption experiments involving biological cells or proteins and the surface-modified PSS/4G PAMAM multilayers were conducted to establish the surface biocompatibility of the modified films. Compared with the respective unmodified films, the surface-modified PSS/4G PAMAM multilayer-coated colloid particles showed reduced adhesion to the biological cell surfaces (macrophage cell line TPH-1), while the adsorbed amount of human serum albumin decreased upon exposure to the surface-modified PSS/4G PAMAM multilayer-coated planar substrates. This demonstrates the biocompatibility of the surface-modified multilayer films.

AB Perfluorocarbon emulsions (PFC) and nitric oxide (NO) releasing agents have on experimental basis demonstrated therapeutic properties in treating and preventing the formation of venous gas embolism as well as increased survival rate during decompression sickness from diving. The effect is ascribed to an increased solubility and transport capacity of respiratory gases in the PFC emulsion and possibly enhanced nitrogen washout through NO-increased blood flow rate and/or the removal of endothelial micro bubble nuclei precursors. Previous reports have shown that metabolic gases (i.e., oxygen in particular) and water vapor contribute to bubble growth and stabilization during altitude exposures. Accordingly, we hypothesize that the administration of PFC and NO donors upon hypobaric pressure exposures either (1) enhance the bubble disappearance rate through faster desaturation of nitrogen, or in contrast (2) promote bubble growth and stabilization through an increased oxygen supply.
   In anesthetized rats, micro air bubbles (containing 79 % nitrogen) of 4-500 nl were injected into exposed abdominal adipose tissue. Rats were decompressed in 36 min to 25 kPa (similar to 10,376 m above sea level) and bubbles studied for 210 min during continued oxygen breathing (FIO2 = 1). Rats were administered PFC, NO, or combined PFC and NO.
   In all groups, most bubbles grew transiently, followed by a stabilization phase. There were no differences in the overall bubble growth or decay between groups or when compared with previous data during oxygen breathing alone at 25 kPa.
   During extreme altitude exposures, the contribution of metabolic gases to bubble growth compromises the therapeutic effects of PFC and NO, but PFC and NO do not induce additional bubble growth.

AB Purpose: To determine whether or not re-etching of oxalate-treated dentin and enamel increases microshear bond strength (pSBS) and improves hybridization.
   Materials and Methods: Two single-bottle etch-and-rinse adhesives, Single Bond (3M/ESPE) and OptiBond S (Kerr), were bonded to deep occlusal dentin and enamel after perfusion under 20 mmHg simulated intrapulpal pressure. For each adhesive tested, the experimental groups were: G1: bonding according to manufacturer's instructions (control); G2: application of oxalate desensitizer (D/Sense Crystal, Centrix) to acid-etched substrate followed by 60 s water rinsing prior to bonding; G3: same as G2, but with a further 15-s re-etching with 35% phosphoric acid before bonding. The microshear bond strength (pSBS) to dentin and enamel was tested (n = 15); a scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analysis of surface topography (n = 2), interface (n = 2), and failure mode was also performed. The data were statistically analyzed using ANOVA and Tukey's tests at p <= 0.05.
   Results: In enamel, both adhesives showed no significant difference in pSBS among groups. In dentin, the highest statistically significant mu SBS for both adhesives was recorded for G1, followed by G2, with the lowest values in G3. The predominant mode of failure was adhesive. SEM analysis of the topography after oxalate treatment revealed remnants of calcium oxalate crystals that were removed only from enamel surfaces after re-etching. SEM images of the interface revealed inadequate dentin hybridization in G2 and G3 compared to G1.
   Conclusion: Re-etching after oxalate treatment compromises bonding of single-bottle etch-and-rinse adhesives to dentin and provides no added benefit to enamel bonding.

AB Managerial policies affect enterprise operations facilitating or impeding the achievement of goals. Enterprises can operate individually or might also be part of a group of interconnected enterprises. For an enterprise operating as part of a (de)centralized group of enterprises with a similar or complementary mission and under the same or different ownership, the coordination of decisions and actions is important. Using the concept of network as an arrangement of interconnected nodes, this paper deals with enterprises as the members of a network, and with enterprise transactions as the connections among its members. We consider coordination exhibiting connectivity, feedback, and adaptation. These features are not only typical of enterprise networks, but also of complex adaptive systems (CAS). By considering enterprise networks as CAS, we study managerial policies that affect the coordination among the members of enterprise networks and the subsequent effect on technical efficiency both at the individual member enterprise and network levels. To approximate the effects of coordination-driven managerial policies, we consider flocking behavior from natural ecosystems, which the CAS literature studies, as a proxy for managerial policies. We simulate the relationships between managerial policies and technical efficiency in an enterprise network of deregulated power plants through an agent-based model. Experimental results inform when and how managerial policies enhance the coordination among network members and allow for the investigation of the relationships that exist between individual decisions and collective influences. These relationships result in an emergent goal seeking network behavior with respect to the goal of achieving technical efficiency. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TRANSPORT; MODEL
AB Urban freight distribution policies aim to improve the efficiency of deliveries of goods in cities.
   Local policy makers intervene on rooted, complex and pre-existent relationships. Various are the agents, both collaborating and competing, involved in providing and buying freight distribution services.
   Retailers, transport providers and own-account agents are among the most important actors; they are all potentially characterized both by inter and intra agent heterogeneity in preferences. Heterogeneity in preferences, whenever present, has relevant implications for policy intervention.
   There is a knowledge gap related to the peculiarities of these agents' preferences and behavior, notwithstanding some recent attempts to bridge it, that call for a thorough agent-specific analysis.
   This paper focuses on urban freight distribution with specific reference to the impact that variations of policy characteristics (e.g. time windows, number of loading and unloading bays, entrance fees, etc.) might cause on own-account agents' behavior. It is important to underline that, de facto, own-account agents are among the least studied operators in this context. This lack of attention is mostly attributable to the toil needed to acquire relevant data to study their preferences and behavior. This lack of knowledge has favored the birth of a widely accepted presumption concerning their inefficiency that, in turn, has produced specifically targeted policies often hindering their activities.
   This paper reports the empirical results of a study conducted in the limited traffic zone in Rome's city center in 2009 thanks to a Volvo Research Foundation grant. The analysis is based on a comprehensive and representative data set including: 1) general information on the respondent, 2) company characteristics, and 3) stated ranking exercises. The ranking data were subsequently transformed in choice data. The paper describes own-account operators' preferences as they emerge from the stated ranking exercises and proposes a systematic comparison among them via willingness to pay measures. The compared estimates are derived under different assumptions concerning agents' preference heterogeneity. More in detail we discuss results assuming: 1) no heterogeneity (multinomial logit), 2) covariates-explained heterogeneity (multinomial logit including interactions with relevant socio-economic variables), 3) flexible heterogeneity (investigating the systematic and stochastic components of the utility function).
   Heterogeneity analysis, apart from relevant theoretical implications, has important poli cy repercussions in as much as it impacts on the willingness to pay measures of the policies implemented. An appropriate treatment of heterogeneity is therefore functional to obtaining undistorted and reliable policy forecasts to be fed to micro simulation models used to support the decision-making process.
   The paper: 1) addresses methodologically relevant issues, 2) uses a new, detailed and significant data set, 3) tackles policy relevant questions, 4) provides worthwhile information for policy-makers. The estimation of willingness to pay / willingness to accept measures for hypothetical policies sets a benchmark for policy makers and researchers alike.

AB In this work, a semimechanistic tumor growth-response model for gemcitabine in pancreatic (administered as single agent) and ovarian (given as single agent and in combination with carboplatin) cancer in mice was developed. Tumor profiles were obtained from nude mice, previously inoculated with KP4, ASPC1, MIA PACA2, PANC1 (pancreas), A2780, or SKOV3 x luc (ovarian) cell lines, and then treated with different dosing schedules of gemcitabine and/or carboplatin. Data were fitted using the population approach with Nonlinear Mixed Effect Models 7.2. In addition to cell proliferation, the tumor progression model for both types of cancer incorporates a carrying capacity representing metabolite pool for DNA synthesis required to tumor growth. Analysis of data from the treated groups revealed that gemcitabine exerted its tumor effects by promoting apoptosis as well as decreasing the carrying capacity compartment. Pharmacodynamic parameters were cell-specific and overall had similar range values between cancer types. In pancreas, a linear model was used to describe both gemcitabine effects with parameter values between 3.26 x 10(-2) and 4.2 x 10(-1) L/(mg x d). In ovarian cancer, the apoptotic effect was driven by an E-MAX model with an efficacy/potency ratio of 5.25-8.65 L/(mg x d). The contribution of carboplatin to tumor effects was lower than the response exerted by gemcitabine and was incorporated in the model as an inhibition of the carrying capacity. The model developed was consistent in its structure across different tumor cell lines and two tumor types where gemcitabine is approved. Simulation-based evaluation diagnostics showed that the model performed well in all experimental design scenarios, including dose, schedule, and tumor type.

AB A model is presented for a pulsating spherical bubble positioned at a fixed location in a viscous, compressible liquid between parallel viscoelastic layers of finite thickness. The Green's function for particle displacement is found and utilized to derive an expression for the radiation load imposed on the bubble by the layers. Although the radiation load is derived for linear harmonic motion it may be incorporated into an equation for the nonlinear radial dynamics of the bubble. This expression is valid if the strain magnitudes in the viscoelastic layer remain small. Dependence of bubble pulsation on the viscoelastic and geometric parameters of the layers is demonstrated through numerical simulations. (C) 2012 Acoustical Society of America.

The sensing behavior of SnO2-based gas sensors that included sensitivity, response, recovery and reproducibility were investigated by using a flow measuring system. In the case of acetonitrile and dichloromethane, the sensor prepared from a precipitated small SnO2 particle (15 nm) was more sensitive than that prepared from the commercial SnO2 (40 nm). The addition of NiO or Nb2O5 promoters also increased the sensitivity of the commercial SnO2 sensor. The experimental results could be explained by the effects of particle size, pore size and promoters. The recovery of the SnO2-based sensors seemed to be possible for acetonitrile and DPGME. In the cases of DMMP and dichloromethane, the complete recovery of SnO2-based sensors was not possible because of poisoning. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Aim: Scopolamine is known to produce amnesia due to blockade of the cholinergic neurotransmission. The present study investigated the potential of Convolvulus pluricaulis (CP) to attenuate scopolamine (2 mg/kg, i.p) induced increased protein and mRNA levels of tau, amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid (A) levels and histopathological changes in rat cerebral cortex. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted on male Wistar rats (250 20 g) divided into four groups of eight animals each. Groups 1 and 2 served as controls receiving normal saline and scopolamine for 4 weeks, respectively. Group 3 received rivastigmine (standard) and group 4 received aqueous extract of CP simultaneously with scopolamine. Western blot and RT-PCR analysis were used to evaluate the levels of protein and mRNA of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau in rat cortex and ELISA was used to measure the amyloid (A) levels. Histopathology was also performed on cortical section of all groups. Result: Oral administration of CP extract (150 mg/kg) to scopolamine treated rats reduced the increased protein and mRNA levels of tau and APP levels followed by reduction in A levels compared with scopolamine treated group. The potential of extract to prevent scopolamine neurotoxicity was reflected at the microscopic level as well, indicative of its neuroprotective effects. Conclusion: CP treatment alleviated neurotoxic effect of scopolamine reflects its potential as potent neuroprotective agent.

AB Sensitive, selective and fast detection of chemical warfare agents is necessary for anti-terrorism purposes. In our search for functional materials sensitive to dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), a simulant of sarin and other toxic organophosphorus compounds, we found that zinc oxide (ZnO) modification potentially enhances the absorption of DMMP on a manganese dioxide (MnO2) surface. The adsorption behavior of DMMP was evaluated through the detection of tiny organophosphonate compounds with quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors coated with ZnO-modified MnO2 nanofibers and pure MnO2 nanofibers. Experimental results indicated that the QCM sensor coated with ZnO-modified nanostructured MnO2 film exhibited much higher sensitivity and better selectivity in comparison with the one coated with pure MnO2 nanofiber film. Therefore, the DMMP sensor developed with this composite nanostructured material should possess excellent selectivity and reasonable sensitivity towards the tiny gaseous DMMP species.

AB This paper presents the results of our research into cooperation in Government Extended Enterprises, a type of system of systems. The effort proposed and evaluated a novel theory that these decisions are the result of the interaction of four canonical forces-Sympathy, Trust, Fear, and Greed. A computational simulation involving the Stag Hunt game examined information sharing decisions in a series of key decision points in three large case studies. For the five hypotheses tested, exploratory data analysis and nonparametric statistical testing show strong support for three of the hypotheses (cooperation is positively correlated with actors' levels of Sympathy and Trust and negatively correlated with actors' levels of Fear) and moderate support for the fourth (cooperation is negatively correlated with actors' levels of Greed). Indications are that the fifth hypothesis (cooperation is correlated with history of behavior) is not needed to explain observed behavior. Multiple correspondence analysis showed significant interactions both among pairs of forces and when a force is paired with decision making strategies. These results can form the basis for: 1) analysis of additional case studies; 2) development of an agent-based simulation; and 3) creation of training programs for current and future organizational leaders.

AB The large amounts of publicly available bibliographic repositories on the web provide us great opportunities to study the scientific behaviors of scholars. This paper aims to study the way we collaborate, model the dynamics of collaborations and predict future collaborations among authors. We investigate the collaborations in three disciplines including physics, computer science and information science,and different kinds of features which may influence the creation of collaborations. Path-based features are found to be particularly useful in predicting collaborations. Besides, the combination of path-based and attribute-based features achieves almost the same performance as the combination of all features considered. Inspired by the findings, we propose an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of collaborations. The model merges the ideas of network structure and node attributes by leveraging random walk mechanism and interests similarity. Empirical results show that the model could reproduce a number of realistic and critical network statistics and patterns. We further apply the model to predict collaborations in an unsupervised manner and compare it with several state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model achieves the best predictive performance compared with the random baseline and other approaches. The results suggest that both network structure and node attributes may play an important role in shaping the evolution of collaboration networks.

TI Generic modes of consensus formation in stochastic language dynamics
SO JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT
LA English
DT Article
DE interacting agent models; stochastic processes; diffusion
AB We introduce a class of stochastic models for the dynamics of two linguistic variants that are competing to become the single, shared convention within an unstructured community of speakers. Different instances of the model are distinguished by the way agents handle variability in the language (i.e., multiple forms for the same meaning). The class of models includes as special cases two previously studied models of language dynamics, the Naming Game, in which agents tend to standardize on variants that they have encountered most frequently, and the Utterance Selection Model, in which agents tend to preserve variability by uniform sampling of a pool of utterances. We reduce the full complexities of the dynamics to a single-coordinate stochastic model which allows the probability and time taken for speakers to reach consensus on a single variant to be calculated for large communities. This analysis suggests that in the broad class of models considered, consensus is formed in one of three generic ways, according to whether agents tend to eliminate, accentuate or sample neutrally the variability in the language. These different regimes are observed in simulations of the full dynamics, and for which the simplified model in some cases makes good quantitative predictions. We use these results, along with comparisons with related models, to conjecture the likely behaviour of more general models, and further make use of empirical data to argue that in reality, biases away from neutral sampling behaviour are likely to be small.

AB Six complexones have been investigated as on-column derivatizing agents for the simultaneous separation of inorganic anions and cations using ion pair chromatography. UV spectrophotometry at 210 nm has been applied for both the direct and the indirect detection of anions and anionic metal complexes. Under the experimental conditions used DCTA and DTPA have been practically applicable. Factors affecting the chromatographic behaviour of analyte ions have been studied. Chloride, nitrite, nitrate sulphate, chromate, molybdate, iron, chromium (III), copper (II), cobalt (II), nickel(II) and mercury (II) ions have been separated in 30 min with a mobile phase containing 1 mmol/l TBA and 0.5 mmol/l DCTA at pH 6.2 in acetonitrile-water (10:90 v/v). With DTPA as eluent and using pre-column derivatization of metal cations with DCTA eight anions and six metal cations can be separated. The detection limits are less than 0.1 mg/l for most of the investigated ions.

AB In this study, the novel ladder polymer (NLP) was syntheriszed and used as flame-reatardant additive for vinyl ester resin (VER). Two kinds of silane coupling agent was ultilized for fabrication of nLP then its characteristics were confirmed with help of NMR, FTIR, X-ray diffractometry. The NLP based composites were fabricated at room temperature using the methyl ethyl keton peroxide as a starter. The mechanical properties, the compatibility, and flamability of obtained composites were studied. The experimental results indicated that the VER with presence of 20 wt% of NLP (S-3 sample) have flexural strength, flexural modulus increased by 195.6%, 260.6%, respectively. Moreover, this sample also exhibited the decreasing in total smoke release (TSR), and peak heat release rate (PHRR) was about 20.7%, and 52.2%, respectively. These results indicated that the NLP is the good candidate for simultaneous improvement of mechanical properties and flame retardant of VER.

AB Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs), thanks to their fast time resolution (1 ns), suitable space resolution (similar to 1 cm) and low production cost (similar to 50 (sic)/m(2)), are widely employed for the muon trigger systems at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their large detector volume (they cover a surface of about 4000 m(2) equivalent to 16 m(3) of gas volume both in ATLAS and CMS) and the use of a relatively expensive Freon-based gas mixture make a closed-loop gas circulation unavoidable. It has been observed that the return gas of RPCs operated in conditions similar to the difficult experimental background foreseen at LHC contains a large amount of impurities potentially dangerous for long-term operation. Several gas-cleaning agents are currently in use in order to avoid accumulation of impurities in the closed-loop circuits. We present the results of a systematic study characterizing each of these cleaning agents. During the test, several RPCs were operated at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) in a high radiation environment in order to observe the production of typical impurities: mainly fluoride ions, molecules of the Freon group and hydrocarbons. The polluted return gas was sent to several cartridges, each containing a different cleaning agent. The effectiveness of each material was studied using gas chromatography and mass-spectrometry techniques. Results of this test have revealed an optimized configuration of filters that is now under long-term validation.
   Gas optimization studies are complemented with a finite element simulation of gas flow distribution in the RPCs, aiming at its eventual optimization in terms of distribution and flow rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We extend our study of single and collective motions of the zooplankton Daphnia both in experiment and computer simulation. Daphnia, as well as many other prey animals, can be observed to swarm under certain circumstances as a protective behavior against predators. Daphnia swarms can be induced by an optical marker such as a vertical shaft of light, to which they are attracted. For low Daphnia densities we observe that individual Daphnia develop a circular motion around the optical marker, whereas for high densities we can reproducibly induce swarming Daphnia to carry out a vortex motion. To learn more about this circular pattern and the associated spontaneous symmetry breaking, the motion of single Daphnia, as well as swarms, is characterized with respect to the light shaft. A stochastic model based on experimental data is compared with the observed Daphnia behavior as well as with existing models for single agents and agent swarms performing a circular motion to reveal the essential ingredients for vortex motion to occur.

AB Human-human communication studies have suggested that within communicative interactions, individuals acknowledge each other as intentional agents and adjust their emotion nonverbal behavior according to the other. This process has been defined as emotional attunement. In this study, we examine the emotional attunement process in the context of affective human-computer interactions. To this purpose, participants were exposed to one of two conditions. In one case, they played with a computer that simulated understanding of their emotional reactions while guiding them across four different game-like activities; in the other, the computer guided participants across the activities without mentioning any ability to understand emotional responses. Face movements, gaze direction, posture, vocal behavior, electrocardiogram and electrodermal activity were simultaneously recorded during the experimental sessions. Results showed that if participants were aware of interacting with an agent able to recognize their emotions, they reported that the computer was able to "understand" them and showed a higher number of nonverbal behaviors during the most interactive activity. The implications are discussed.

AB Background and Methods: Alinidine is a recently developed antiarrhythmic medication that acts directly on the cardiac pacemaker cells to reduce heart rate (HR). At effective doses, alinidine might have cardiodepressant actions that could be hazardous in the presence of hemodynamic instability. On the other hand, one limitation of the use of catecholamines is tachycardia, and alinidine could be beneficial in situations such as septic shock, where adrenergic agents are commonly required. The present study explored the hemodynamic and gasometric effects of alinidine during dobutamine administration in a canine model of septic shock induced by endotoxin administration.
   In ten pentobarbital-anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs (weight 28 +/- 4 kg), Escherichia coli endotoxin (3 mg/kg) injection was followed 30 mins later by saline infusion to restore and maintain pulmonary artery occlusion pressure at the baseline value. Sixty minutes after the endotoxin administration, a dobutamine infusion was started at a rate of 10-mu-g/kg/min. Thirty minutes later, alinidine was administered as a bolus dosage of 1 mg/kg in five dogs; the other five dogs served as a control group.
   Results: Alinidine administration resulted in a decrease in HR from 157 +/- 20 to 138 +/- 27 beats/min (p < .01) and a nonsignificant increase in cardiac output from 5.2 +/- 3.0 to 6.8 +/- 2.8 L/min, as a consequence of increases in stroke volume from 31.9 +/- 15.3 to 49.2 +/- 13.9 mL (p < .01) and in left ventricular stroke work from 32.1 +/- 20.0 to 57.4 +/- 32.1 g.m (p < .05).
   Conclusions: During experimental septic shock, alinidine administration can reverse dobutamine-induced tachycardia and simultaneously improve ventricular function.

AB This paper provides a numerical analysis of a downdraft fixed bed reactor to examine the effect that the different operating modes have on temperature profile, velocity profile, gas composition and particle residence time. First, pine wood sawdust is considered as the feedstock to the reactor. Simulations of the reactor operating modes are performed using the commercial CFD code Ansys-Fluent coupled with the Discrete Phase Method (DPM). So different chemical reactions are considered in the reactor depending on the operating mode: a) pyrolyzer, b) gasifier or c) combustor. A two-dimensional modelling for the geometry is used in conjunction with 0.001 mm diameter spherical particles. The interaction of particles (discrete phase) with the continuous phase is performed by modifying the transport equations. For the purpose of model validation, experimental data of temperature profiles and syngas composition are used. Besides, the influence of concentration of an oxidant agent is numerically investigated. Results show that the maximum temperatures reached in combustion, gasification, and pyrolysis processes are, respectively, 2207.91 (K), 1559.47 (K) and 1097.55 (K). Finally, simulated gasification temperature showed a standard deviation of 5.2% from experimental one.

AB In this brief, we analyze the local stochastic dynamics of a recently proposed network-based model of collective behavior in systems of self-propelled particles. In this model, each agent is assimilated to a 2-D unit vector, whose orientation changes in a discrete time setting as a result of noisy interactions with neighboring agents. The process of neighbor selection is stochastic, whereby each agent averages its orientation with a randomly chosen subset of neighbors. We linearize the model in the neighborhood of its ordered state, where all the vectors share the same orientation, and study the effect of noise on the system response. Closed-form results are validated against numerical simulations for small and large networks.

ID FOLLOWER FORMATION CONTROL; AGENTS
AB The cooperative motion of multiple mobile robots has attracted wide attention due to its advantages in military, marine and aerospace fields, and formation control has become a significant technology in the realization of these tasks. However, most of the existing formation control designs of mobile robots do not consider the practical obstacles in the environment, and the maintenance of both formation and trajectory tracking while confronting the obstacles is still a challenging issue. Therefore, in this paper, a virtual-structure-based formation control approach is designed with obstacle avoidance for a system with multiple mobile robots. The basic trajectory is generated for each robot in the group and parameterized to keep the group in formation. A trajectory generator is then established regarding the obstacles, where a potential function is designed to adjust the basic trajectory and replan the reference trajectory to achieve obstacle avoidance. Then, a novel design for the path parameter is proposed to improve the performance of the robot group when encountering obstacles. Finally, a tracking controller is designed to achieve good tracking performance for robots, and the guaranteed performance is achieved via the Lyapunov theorem. A comparative simulation with three sets is carried out, where an objective functionFobjis designed to evaluate the tracking performance in the presence of obstacles. Besides this, a real experiment is implemented to further verify the effectiveness. The simulation and experimental results verify the good formation and tracking performance of the proposed design for a system with multiple mobile robots with obstacle avoidance.

AB The development of restenosis within the coronary arteries after a stenting procedure has been addressed with the development of the drug eluting stent device. However, in recent times the superiority of the drug eluting stent over bare metal stents has been brought into question. A lack of knowledge regarding the behavior of drug transport from the drug eluting devices contributes to this uncertainty. Questions arise as to whether drug eluting stents deliver sufficient amounts of therapeutic agents into the artery wall to suppress restenosis. Published investigations in this area have focused primarily on trends associated with how variations in stenting conditions affect mass transport behavior. However, experimentally validated numerical models that simulate mass transport within the artery wall are lacking. A novel experimental model was developed to validate computational predictions of species diffusion into a porous medium and an investigation into how stent strut compression influences mass transport was conducted. The study revealed that increased compressive forces on a porous media reduced the ability of species to diffuse through that media, and in relation to drug eluting stents will contribute to a reduction in therapeutic levels of drugs within the wall.

AB Process-induced distortions in composite structures lead to problems with dimensional control, which can be a major concern in the manufacturing. This paper focuses on the prediction of the warpages and curvatures in unsymmetrical laminate plates using closed-form solution and finite element method. A new characterization method that the shape of the deformed composite specimen is conducted in virtue of the coordinate measuring machine through contact method is adopted to experimentally measure the process-induced distortions in unsymmetrical laminate plates. The comparison of numerical and analytical prediction with experimental results for warpages in [0(6)/90(6)] and [0(9)/90(3)] unsymmetrical laminates indicates that shear layer between tool and part has a significant effect on the process-induced distortions, and PTFE release film and release agent between tool and part cannot eliminate effect of the tool-part interaction on the process-induced distortions in unsymmetrical laminate plates. Moreover, the comparison of analytically and numerically predicted development of curvature with experimental results presented by previous literature for unsymmetrical laminates further reveals the effect of tool-part interaction on the process-induced distortions and the accuracy of closed-form solution.

AB In this paper, we studied the container-content interaction between a high-density polyethylene-based packaging (HDPE) and amyl acetate solution considered as diffusing agent. We were specifically interested in the impact of sorption and diffusion phenomena on the mechanical properties of HDPE bottles under static conditions at different stages of physical aging. Several uniaxial tests were realized on samples cut from bottles and structural tests were performed on bottles. The analysis of such various experimental results highlighted the Fickian nature of the diffusion phenomenon and the decrease of the compression strength of the bottles with the preconditioning time. We have also focused on the modelling of the mechanical behavior of HDPE taking into account the mass transfer induced by the diffusion phenomenon. Elastic-viscoplastic model was proposed and implemented in the finite element code ABAQUS. The parameters of this model were identified from tensile tests by solving an optimization problem. The identified models have been validated by numerical simulation of top-load compression of HDPE bottles. The obtained numerical results are in a good agreement with experimental measurements.

TI Sidenafil Pre-Treatment Promotes Decompression Sickness in Rats
SO PLOS ONE

   ACTIVATION; DAMAGE; PDE5
AB Vascular bubble formation after decompression contributes to endothelial injuries which form the basis for the development of decompression sickness (DCS). Nitric oxide (NO) is a powerful vasodilator that contributes to vessel homeostasis. It has been shown that NO-releasing agent may reduce bubble formation and prevent serious decompression sickness. The use of sildenafil, a well-known, phosphodiesterase-5 blocker, which act by potentiating the vasodilatory effect on smooth muscle relaxation, has never been studied in DCS. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effects of sildenafil pre-treatment on DCS in a rat model. 67 rats were subjected to a simulated dive at 90 msw for 45 min before staged decompression. The experimental group received 10 mg/kg of sildenafil one hour before exposure (n = 35) while controls were not treated (n = 32). Clinical assessment took place over a period of 30 min after surfacing. At the end, blood samples were collected for blood cells counts and the level of circulating bubbles in the right cavities was quantified. There were significantly more manifestations of DCS in the sildenafil group than in the controls (34.3% vs 6.25%, respectively, p = 0.012). Platelet count was more reduced in treated rats than in controls (-21.7% vs -7%, respectively, p = 0.029), whereas bubble grades did not differ between groups. We concluded that pre-treatment with sildenafil promotes the onset and severity of neurological DCS. When considering the use of phosphodiesterase-5 blockers in the context of diving, careful discussion with physician should be recommended.

AB Organophosphonates range in their toxicity and are used as pesticides, herbicides, and chemical warfare agents (CWAs). Few laboratories are equipped to handle the most toxic molecules, thus simulants such as dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP), are used as a first step in studying adsorption and reactivity on materials. Benchmarked by combined experimental and theoretical studies of simulants, calculations offer an opportunity to understand how molecular interactions with a surface changes upon using a CWA. However, most calculations of DMMP and CWAs on surfaces are limited to adsorption studies on clusters of atoms, which may differ markedly from the behavior on bulk solid-state materials with extended surfaces. We have benchmarked our solid-state periodic calculations of DMMP adsorption and reactivity on MoO2 with ambient pressure x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies (APXPS). DMMP is found to interact strongly with a MoO2 film, a model system for the MoOx component in the ASZM-TEDA(C) gas filtration material. Density functional theory modeling of several adsorption and decomposition mechanisms assist the assignment of APXPS peaks. Our results show that some of the adsorbed DMMP decomposes, with all the products remaining on the surface. The rigorous calculations benchmarked with experiments pave a path to reliable and predictive theoretical studies of CWA interactions with surfaces.

AB It is a great challenge for nanomedicine to develop novel dendrimers with maximum therapeutic potential and minimum side-effects for drug and gene delivery. As delivery vectors, dendrimers must overcome lots of barriers before delivering the bio-agents to the target in the cell. Extensive experimental investigations have been carried out to elucidate the physical and chemical properties of dendrimers and explore their behaviors when interacting with biomolecules, such as gene materials, proteins, and lipid membranes. As a supplement of the experimental techniques, it has been proved that computer simulations could facilitate the progress in understanding the delivery process of bioactive molecules. The structures of dendrimers in dilute solutions have been intensively investigated by monomer-resolved simulations, coarse-grained simulations, and atom-resolved simulations. Atomistic simulations have manifested that the hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen-bond interactions, and electrostatic attraction play critical roles in the formation of dendrimer-drug complexes. Multiscale simulations and statistical field theories have uncovered some physical mechanisms involved in the dendrimer-based gene delivery systems. This review will focus on the current status and perspective of theoretical and computational contributions in this field in recent years. (275 references)

AB The tensile failure mechanism of carbon-aramid hybrid fibers/epoxy sandwich structure laminates was investigated by using experimental and finite element methods. Double curing agents, triarylsulfonium hexafluoroantimonates and triethylene tetramine with a mass ratio of 4:15 were introduced into the laminates. Sandwich structure laminates, with different proportions of hybrid fibers, were cured by UV-initiated anion/cationic dual curing technique. The results showed that the synergetic curing effects of two curing agents were observed under UV irradiation, leading to the better curing of the system, which further plays a positive influence on the mechanical performance. The tensile properties and failure mechanism of the laminates depended on the stacking sequence and fiber volume fractions of the layer structures. The interplay hybrid laminates, containing three alternate plies with fiber contents of 67.7 vol%, presented the optimal tensile performance, and its tensile strength and modulus were 0.82 GPa and 22.09 GPa, respectively. The fracture morphologies revealed that pull-out and debonding of fibers were the main failure mechanism of hybrid laminates. The performance of sandwich structure laminates was determined by the load-carrying capacity of carbon fiber and load-transferring capacity of the aramid fiber and adhesive. The finite element model based on experiments was established to simulate the stress state and failure mechanism of sandwich laminates. The results demonstrated that the stress was better transferred into carbon fibers from the aramid fibers and adhesive, and the relative error rate of maximum stress from finite element analysis and experimental results was less than 5%, which were in reasonable agreement with the experimental results.

AB We demonstrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast enhancement and ac-field induced heating abilities of tetramethylammoniumhydroxide (TMAH) coated nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4) nanoparticles and discuss the underlying physical mechanisms. The structural characterization revealed that the NiFe2O4 particles synthesized with a modified co-precipitation method have a very narrow size distribution with a 4.4 nm magnetic core and 15 nm hydrodynamic diameters, with relatively small fraction of agglomerates. The as-prepared particles presented superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature. The in vitro hyperthermia experiments, performed in ac-field conditions under human tolerable limits, showed that the suspensions of the synthesized nanoparticles exhibit a maximum specific absorption rate (SAR) value of 11 W/g. The H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry measurements indicated the suspensions of NiFe2O4 have a transverse-to-longitudinal relaxivity ratio r(2)/r(1) greater than two, as required for superparamagnetic MRI contrast agents. On the basis of the parameters obtained from the magnetic measurements, by comparing the relevant theoretical models with the experimental results, we found that the presence of agglomerates, and particularly the interactions within the agglomerated nanoparticles, caused a significant increase in the hyperthermia and MRI efficiencies. On the other hand, from an applicative point of view, both the MRI contrast enhancement and the heating capabilities allow the simultaneous use of nickelferrites in diagnostic and therapeutic applications as theranostic agents.

TI A Bayesian Developmental Approach to Robotic Goal-Based Imitation
   Learning
SO PLOS ONE

ID OTHERS; BEHAVIOR; DESIGN
AB A fundamental challenge in robotics today is building robots that can learn new skills by observing humans and imitating human actions. We propose a new Bayesian approach to robotic learning by imitation inspired by the developmental hypothesis that children use self-experience to bootstrap the process of intention recognition and goal-based imitation. Our approach allows an autonomous agent to: (i) learn probabilistic models of actions through self-discovery and experience, (ii) utilize these learned models for inferring the goals of human actions, and (iii) perform goal-based imitation for robotic learning and human-robot collaboration. Such an approach allows a robot to leverage its increasing repertoire of learned behaviors to interpret increasingly complex human actions and use the inferred goals for imitation, even when the robot has very different actuators from humans. We demonstrate our approach using two different scenarios: (i) a simulated robot that learns human-like gaze following behavior, and (ii) a robot that learns to imitate human actions in a tabletop organization task. In both cases, the agent learns a probabilistic model of its own actions, and uses this model for goal inference and goal-based imitation. We also show that the robotic agent can use its probabilistic model to seek human assistance when it recognizes that its inferred actions are too uncertain, risky, or impossible to perform, thereby opening the door to human-robot collaboration.

AB Through numerical simulation of the Hoff model we show that when ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are excited at frequencies which are close to integer (m > 2) multiples of their natural resonance frequency, the bifurcation structure of the UCA oscillations as a function of pressure may be characterized by 3 general distinct regions. The UCA behavior starts with initial period one oscillations which undergoes a saddle node bifurcation to m coexisting attractors for an acoustic pressure above a threshold, P-t1. Further increasing the pressure above a second threshold P-t2, is followed by a sudden transition to period 1 oscillations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   DESIGN
AB In this paper, based on nonuniform sampling, the master-slave synchronization in a class of Lur'e systems is studied via using the sampled outputs of error system. Different from existing results, the transmission of control signals is determined by a novel adaptive event-triggered scheme, where the triggering thresholds depend on the dynamic behaviors of controlled systems rather than the predetermined constants as some traditional ones. Through choosing two augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs), some delay dependent synchronization criteria are formulated and the conservatism can be effectively reduced owing to the utilization of Wirtinger-based inequalities and delay-product-type LKF terms. Especially, the existence of the controller can be easily checked since the derived conditions are presented via LMI forms. Finally, two numerical examples with comparisons and simulations are given to illustrate the proposed results. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, pinning synchronization problem for nonlinear coupled networks is investigated, which can be recurrently connected neural networks, cellular neural networks, Hodgkin-Huxley models, Lorenz chaotic oscillators, and so on. Nodes in the network are assumed to be identical and nodes' dynamical behaviors are described by continuous-time equations. The network topology is undirected and static. At first, the scope of accepted nonlinear coupling functions is defined, and the effect of nonlinear coupling functions on synchronization is carefully discussed. Then, the pinning control technique is used for synchronization, especially the control type is aperiodically intermittent. Some sufficient conditions to guarantee global synchronization are presented. Furthermore, the adaptive approach is also applied on the pinning control, and a centralized adaptive algorithm is designed and its validity is also proved. Finally, several numerical simulations are given to verify the obtained theoretical results.

AB Node dynamics and network topologies play vital roles in determining the network features and network dynamical behaviors. Thus it is of great theoretical significance and practical value to recover the topology structures and system parameters of uncertain complex networks with available information. This paper presents an adaptive anticipatory synchronization-based approach to identify the unknown system parameters and network topological structures of uncertain time-varying delayed complex networks in the presence of noise. Moreover, during the identification process, our proposed scheme guarantees anticipatory synchronization between the uncertain drive and constructed auxiliary response network simultaneously. Particularly, our method can be extended to several special cases. Furthermore, numerical simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness and applicability of our method for reconstructing network topologies and node parameters. We hope our method can provide basic insight into future research on addressing reconstruction issues of uncertain realistic and large-scale complex networks.

AB The efficiency of the aerial drop of firefighting agents (water and retardants) is extremely dependent on pilot skills in dealing with complex atmospheric conditions, mostly because on-board systems for computer-assisted drops have not yet been used operationally. Hence, numerical modelling tools can be of primary importance for the optimisation of firefighting operations and in the testing of new chemical products. The current work addresses the development of the operational Aerial Drop Model. This numerical tool allows a near real-time simulation of aerial drops with fixed-wing aircraft, while covering the fundamental stages of the process. It copes with a wide range of product viscosities, from water to highly thickened long-term retardants. The Aerial Drop Model simulates the continuous stripping of droplets from the liquid jet by the action of Rayleigh-Taylor and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities applying the linear stability theory. The subsequent secondary breakup and deformation of the formed droplets due to aerodynamic forces is based on experimental correlations defined in terms of the dimensionless Weber number. Droplet trajectories are computed by applying a Lagrangian approach, in which a dynamical drag module accounts for the effect of deformation. This operational tool provides an improved understanding of the behaviour and effectiveness of aerially delivered firefighting liquids.

AB A center coke charging method from the top of blast furnace is known for a novel approach to burden distribution and coal combustion. This method is considered as one of the key technologies for keeping gas permeability of deadman in the lower part of blast furnace and producing iron liquid with a stable furnace operation. In recent years, the center charging method is also expected as improving the unsteady behavior with bridging/slipping of solid bed in low reducing agents operation of blast furnace. In the present study, a center charging method with different particle density or friction coefficients is carried out numerically by using a 3-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM). Before the numerical analysis, an experimental approach using a two-dimensional cold model is also examined. Alumina sphere was used as representative particle of coke/ore packed bed and the glass sphere was for the center charge. From the experiment, it was found that the height of deadman is reduced dramatically by using the center charging method with the glass sphere. This experimental result was compared with the numerical approach, although the gas flow was not considered in the numerical method. In the numerical results, the void fraction was calculated more precisely compared to the previous numerical two-dimensional calculation. Almost uniform particle flow distribution called a piston flow pattern was fairly maintained by the numerical center charging method, and as the result, the height of deadman was also confirmed reduced numerically compared to the alumina bed only. This result was qualitatively coincident with the experimental flow pattern except for the particle velocity descending faster in the experimental center-charging region, which could be available for the operation of deadman control.

AB The frequency of occurrence of step length in the migratory behaviour of various organisms, including humans, is characterized by the power law distribution. This pattern of behaviour is known as the Levy walk, and the reason for this phenomenon has been investigated extensively. Especially in humans, one possibility might be that this pattern reflects the change in self-confidence in one's chosen behaviour. We used simulations to demonstrate that active assumptions cause changes in the confidence level in one's choice under a situation of lack of information. More specifically, we presented an algorithm that introduced the effects of learning and forgetting into Bayesian inference, and simulated an imitation game in which two decision-making agents incorporating the algorithm estimated each other's internal models. For forgetting without learning, each agents' confidence levels in their own estimation remained low owing to a lack of information about the counterpart, and the agents changed their hypotheses about the opponent frequently, and the frequency distribution of the duration of the hypotheses followed an exponential distribution for a wide range of forgetting rates. Conversely, when learning was introduced, high confidence levels occasionally occurred even at high forgetting rates, and exponential distributions universally turned into power law distribution.

AB At a signalized intersection, there exists an area where drivers become indecisive as to either stop their car or proceed through when the traffic signal turns yellow. This point, called a dilemma zone, has remained a safety concern for drivers due to the great possibility of a rear-end or right-angle crash occurring. In order to reduce the risk of car crashes at the dilemma zone, Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) recommended a dilemma zone model. The model, however, fails to provide precise calculations on the decision of drivers because it disregards the supplemental roadway information, such as whether a red light camera is present. Hence, the goal of this study was to incorporate such roadway environmental factors into a more realistic driver decision-making model for the dilemma zone. A driving simulator was used to determine the influence of roadway conditions on decision-making of real drivers. Following data collection, each driver's decision outcomes were implemented in an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) so as to analyze behaviors under realistic road environments. The experimental results revealed that the proposed dilemma zone model was able to accurately predict the decisions of drivers. Specifically, the model confirmed the findings from the driving simulator study that the changes in the roadway environment reduced the number of red light violations at an intersection.

AB In humans, the attitude toward risk is not neutral and is dissimilar between bets involving gains and bets involving losses. The existence and prevalence of these decision features in non-human primates are unclear. In addition, only a few studies have tried to simulate the evolution of agents based on their attitude toward risk. Therefore, we still ignore to what extent Prospect theory's claims are evolutionarily rooted. To shed light on this issue, we collected data from nine macaques that performed bets involving gains or losses. We confirmed that their overall behaviour is coherent with Prospect theory's claims. In parallel, we used a genetic algorithm to simulate the evolution of a population of agents across several generations. We showed that the algorithm selects progressively agents that exhibit risk-seeking, and has an inverted S-shape distorted perception of probability. We compared these two results and found that monkeys' attitude toward risk is only congruent with the simulation when they are facing losses. This result is consistent with the idea that gambling in the loss domain is analogous to deciding in a context of life-threatening challenges where a certain level of risk-seeking behaviour and probability distortion may be adaptive.
   This article is part of the theme issue 'Existence and prevalence of economic behaviours among non-human primates'.

AB Score-dependent and agent-dependent payoffs of the strategies are introduced into the standard minority game. The intrinsic periodicity is consequently removed, and the stylized facts arise, such as long-range volatility correlations and "fat tails" in the distribution of the returns. The agent dependence of the payoffs is essential in producing the long-range volatility correlations. The new payoffs lead to a better performance in the dynamic behavior nonlocal in time, and can coexist with the inactive strategy. We also observe that the standard deviation sigma(2)/N is significantly reduced, thus the efficiency of the system is distinctly improved. Based on this observation, we give a qualitative explanation for the long-range volatility correlations.

AB When modeling goal-directed behavior in the presence of various sources of uncertainty, planning can be described as an inference process. A solution to the problem of planning as inference was previously proposed in the active inference framework in the form of an approximate inference scheme based on variational free energy. However, this approximate scheme was based on the mean-field approximation, which assumes statistical independence of hidden variables and is known to show overconfidence and may converge to local minima of the free energy. To better capture the spatiotemporal properties of an environment, we reformulated the approximate inference process using the so-called Bethe approximation. Importantly, the Bethe approximation allows for representation of pairwise statistical dependencies. Under these assumptions, the minimizer of the variational free energy corresponds to the belief propagation algorithm, commonly used in machine learning. To illustrate the differences between the mean-field approximation and the Bethe approximation, we have simulated agent behavior in a simple goal-reaching task with different types of uncertainties. Overall, the Bethe agent achieves higher success rates in reaching goal states. We relate the better performance of the Bethe agent to more accurate predictions about the consequences of its own actions. Consequently, active inference based on the Bethe approximation extends the application range of active inference to more complex behavioral tasks.

TI Evolution Towards Criticality in Ising Neural Agents

DE Evolution; artificial life; criticality; neural network; Ising model;

AB Criticality is thought to be crucial for complex systems to adapt at the boundary between regimes with different dynamics, where the system may transition from one phase to another. Numerous systems, from sandpiles to gene regulatory networks to swarms to human brains, seem to work towards preserving a precarious balance right at their critical point. Understanding criticality therefore seems strongly related to a broad, fundamental theory for the physics of life as it could be, which still lacks a clear description of how life can arise and maintain itself in complex systems. In order to investigate this crucial question, we model populations of Ising agents competing for resources in a simple 2D environment subject to an evolutionary algorithm. We then compare its evolutionary dynamics under different experimental conditions. We demonstrate the utility that arises at a critical state and contrast it with the behaviors and dynamics that arise far from criticality. The results show compelling evidence that not only is a critical state remarkable in its ability to adapt and find solutions to the environment, but the evolving parameters in the agents tend to flow towards criticality if starting from a supercritical regime. We present simulations showing that a system in a supercritical state will tend to self-organize towards criticality, in contrast to a subcritical state, which remains subcritical though it is still capable of adapting and increasing its fitness.

ID SIMULATION-MODELS
AB To control overcrowded pedestrians at the exit, buffer zones are very common in densely populated areas. However, little focus has been paid on the mechanisms of buffer zone. In this paper, a tentative experiment was designed to preliminarily reveal the role of buffer zone in crowd evacuation. Then a social force based simulation model was established by Massmotion according to the properties of the experiment. The simulated results show that buffer zones may have a potential positive effect on evacuation through comparing with the experimental results. After that, via changing the buffer zone length and the desired velocity of agents in further simulations, the data, such as evacuation time, density distribution, individual waiting time, instantaneous velocity and average velocity were investigated in detail. It is found that after the buffer zone set, the evacuation efficiency is significantly improved at high desired velocity, and the evacuation time is shortened with the increase in buffer zone length. Setting buffer zone in front of the exit can effectively reduce the crowd density at the exit, alleviate the surgent transmission of density waves in crowd, so as to reduce the risk of crowd squeezing and trampling. Besides, when the desired velocity is relatively high, the relationship between the buffer zone length and the average velocity is obtained specifically, indicating that the longer the buffer zone, the more likely pedestrians can escape as quickly as possible. Based on this work, some suggestions were put forward on how to control the dense evacuation via setting suitable buffer zones.

AB Although zinc dicarboxylic acids are highly effective beta-nucleating agents (beta-NAs), they lose their beta-nucleating ability in isotactic polypropylene (iPP) upon the addition of calcium stearate (CaStr(2)). In this study, we investigated the failure mechanism of these p-NAs in terms of the chemical and physical interactions of zinc adipate (ZnAA) with CaStr(2). No chemical reaction occurs between CaStr(2) and ZnAA; rather, it is the physical interactions between this beta-NA and CaStr(2) that are responsible for the loss of beta-nucleating ability. Based on the experimental findings and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we suggest a blocking effect of CaStr(2) on nucleation as a possible failure mechanism. MD simulations confirmed that the aggregation of CaStr(2) on the beta-NA surface, observed experimentally using polarized optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy, resulted from the binding energy for the interaction between ZnAA and CaStr(2) being higher than that for iPP/CaStr(2). Because the active nucleation sites on the surface of the beta-NA were covered, lattice matching between ZnAA and the iPP chains was hindered. Therefore, the addition of CaStr(2) weakens the beta-nucleating ability of ZnAA, leading to inhibition of the epitaxial crystallization process, thereby decreasing the degree of beta-crystal formation and, consequently, lowering the toughness of the resulting iPP.

   Market
SO JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Empirical Analysis; Market Design; Stable Switching; Limited Rationality
AB The question of efficiency of market organization is an important one in economics. When theoretical results suggest the dominance of auctions, empirical studies present more mitigated results putting forward that the global efficiency depends on agents' characteristics and market environment. The Boulogne s/mer fish market is organized in a particular way. Both buyers and sellers can daily choose to exchange through an auction mechanism or through a negotiated one. First empirical results reveal that, at a macro level, this organization is a stable one: the negative price-quantity relation is verified, suggesting a global rationality, even if this relation is not verified for all the individuals. At a micro-level, empirical evidence points out that the agents purchase most of the time on one same market (auctions or negotiated) and this market corresponds to the best choice for them, in terms of prices and quantities sold. A second result then suggests that the performance of a mode of organization depends on the characteristics of the traders and on the features of the good sold. Empirical study also reveals that most of the agents regularly switch from one market to the other. To understand the reasons for this switching, we consider this market as a complex system and simulate an agent based model where limited rational individuals are endowed with simple learning rules (noisy or myopic strategies). The auction sub-market plays a benchmark role, the only strategic possibility for sellers is to decide to go (or not) on the negotiated sub-market. A third result is that macro stability results from the aggregate behaviour of limited rational individuals and this, without any need of central coordinator. A fourth result is that agents daily choose their sub-market according to the global quantities sold on the whole market.

AB This paper focuses on the complexity characteristics of a stakeholder's revenue sharing for time compression in construction projects, such as adopting a life cycle perspective, the preferences of stakeholders, and the adaptability behaviors in the negotiation process. We build an agent-based model on revenue sharing negotiation. Considering that the agents who are in a weak position not only care about their own benefits but also compare their benefits to others, we design an experimental scenario where a contractor has fairness preference based on China's reality. According to different sympathy and envy coefficients, we can divide the inequity aversion preference into three typical types, and we research how a contractor's different types of inequity aversion preferences impact revenue sharing coefficient of agreements, results of successful negotiations, and efficiency in negotiations. Results are as follows: it is advantageous for a contractor to maintain a modest inequity aversion for their own earnings and the degree of sympathy preference in inequity aversion has an important impact on the time to reach consensus while the degree of jealousy preference has no obvious effect. If contractors' sympathy preference is maintained within a moderate range, it will achieve a higher success rate of negotiations in the negotiation process; the success rate of negotiation is affected largely by the agents' sympathy preference, though it is also influenced by the jealousy preference, but it is not very sensitive.

AB Predictive modelling of complex biological systems and biophysical interactions requires the inclusion of multiple nano- and micro-scale events. In many scenarios, however, numerical solutions alone do not necessarily enhance the understanding of the system. Instead, this work explores the use of an agent-based model with visualization capabilities to elucidate interactions between single cells. We present a model of juxtacrine signalling, using Cell Studio, an agent-based modelling system, based on gaming and three-dimensional visualization tools. The main advantages of the system are its ability to apply any cell geometry and to dynamically visualize the diffusion and interactions of the molecules within the cells in real time. These provide an excellent tool for obtaining insight about different biological scenarios, as the user may view the dynamics of a system and observe its emergent behaviour as it unfolds. The agent-based model was validated against the results of a mean-field model of Notch receptors and ligands in two neighbouring cells. The conversion to an agent-based model is described in detail. To demonstrate the advantages of the model, we further created a filopodium-mediated signalling model. Our model revealed that diffusion and endocytosis alone are insufficient to produce significant signalling in a filopodia scenario. This is due to the bottleneck at the cell-filopodium contact region and the long distance to the end of the filopodium. However, allowing active transport of ligands into filopodia enhances the signalling significantly compared with a face-to-face scenario. We conclude that the agent-based approach can provide insights into mechanisms underlying cell signalling. The open-source model can be found in the Internet hosting service GitHub.

AB Landscape changes can result in habitat fragmentation and reduced landscape connectivity, limiting the ability of animals to move across space and altering infectious disease dynamics in wildlife. In this study, we develop and implement an agent-based model to assess the impacts of animal movement behavior and landscape structure on disease dynamics. We model a susceptible/infective disease state system applicable to the transmission of feline immunodeficiency virus in bobcats in the urbanized landscape of coastal southern California. Our agent-based model incorporates animal movement behavior, pathogen prevalence, transmission probability, and habitat fragmentation to evaluate how these variables influence disease spread in urbanizing landscapes. We performed a sensitivity analysis by simulating the system under 4200 different combinations of model parameters and evaluating disease transmission outcomes. Our model reveals that host movement behavior and response to landscape features play a pivotal role in determining how habitat fragmentation influences disease dynamics. Importantly, interactions among habitat fragmentation and movement had non-linear and counter-intuitive effects on disease transmission. For example, the model predicts that an intermediate level of non-habitat permeability and directionality will result in the highest rates of between-patch disease transmission. Agent-based models serve as computational laboratories that provide a powerful approach for quantitatively and visually exploring the role of animal behavior and anthropogenic landscape change on contacts among agents and the spread of disease. Such questions are challenging to study empirically given that it is difficult or impossible to experimentally manipulate actual landscapes and the animals and pathogens that move through them. Modeling the relationship between habitat fragmentation, animal movement behavior, and disease spread will improve understanding of the spread of potentially destructive pathogens through wildlife populations, as well as domestic animals and humans.

AB Agent-based models of political party competition in a multidimensional policy space have been developed in order to reflect adaptive learning by party leaders with very limited information feedback. The key assumption is that two categories of actors continually make decisions: voters choose which party to support and party leaders offer citizens a certain policy package. After reviewing the arguments for using agent-based models, I elaborate two ways forward in the development of these models for political party competition. Firstly, theoretical progress is made in this article by taking the role of the mass media into account. In previous work it is implicitly assumed that all parties are equally visible for citizens, whereas I will start from the more realistic assumption that there is also competition for attention in the public sphere. With this addition, it is possible to address the question why new parties are seldom able to successfully compete with political actors already within the political system. Secondly, I argue that, if we really want to learn useful lessons from simulations, we should seek to empirically falsify models by confronting outcomes with real data. So far, most of the agent-based models of party competition have been an exclusively theoretical exercise. Therefore, I evaluate the empirical relevance of different simulations of Dutch party competition in the period from May 1998 until May 2002. Using independent data on party positions, I measure the extent to which simulations generate mean party sizes that resemble public opinion polls. The results demonstrate that it is feasible and realistic to simulate party competition in the Netherlands with agent-based models, even when a rather unstable period is investigated.

AB Cadmium (Cd) has been identified as the etiologic agent of itai-itai disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether chronic Cd exposure affects bone metabolism in a male rat model and to estimate the bone mineral density (BMD) differences In lumbar and femoral bone because of Cd exposure. Six-week-old male Hos Donryu rats were used in this experiment. Cadmium was administered at a dose of 200 ppm to rats in the diet to produce experimental chronic Cd poisoning. Bone mineral density was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) with a high-resolution scan collimator (0.25 mm diameter) (Hologic QDR-2000). The Cd content in renal tissue reached a critical concentration of 128.42 +/- 14.38 mu g/g 10 months after the administration of the element (Table 3). The average blood urea nitrogen (BUN) value was increased throughout the period of the experiment, and the serum creatinine value of the experimental group showed an increase after 2 months of Cd administration (0.46 +/- 0.09 mg/dL). The concentration of urinary calcium changed in the experimental group after exposure to Cd for 12 months (15.4 +/- 0.13 mg/dL). DEXA showed a greater reduction in the bone mineral density of the 5th vertebral body (L5) in rats that had ingested Cd for 4 months (0.359 +/- 0.013 g/cm(2)) than in control rats (0.372 +/- 0.012 g/cm(2). P < 0.01). On the contrary, the difference in bone mineral content between rats ingesting Cd for 6-8 months and control rats was not significant. However, significant reductions in bone mineral content were again noted in rats that had ingested Cd for 12 months (0.339 +/- 0.023 g/cm(2)) Compared with the control group (0.385 +/- 0.012 g/cm(2), P < 0.01). The bone mineral density of the right femoral bone in control rats was 0.328 +/- 0.018 g/cm(2) and that in experimental rats was 0.306 +/- 0.012 g/cm(2), and a meaningful difference was recognized (P < 0.05). Histological examination of the rats exposed to Cd for 12 months showed that the 5th lumbar vertebral body (L5) exhibited osteomalacia. The results of our studies show that Cd stimulated a loss of bone mineral at an early stage to a great extent in male rats. In the examination of male rats, bone injury and renal functional disorder were encountered simultaneously. This study suggested that osteomalacia was induced by a direct action of Cd on the bone through abnormal calcium homeostasis at an early stage in male rats.

DE Empirical Modeling; Genetic Optimization; Falsification
AB The pioneering works in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) - notably Schelling (1969) and Epstein and Axtell (1996) - introduced the method for testing hypotheses in "complex thought experiments" (Cederman 1997, 55). Although purely theoretical experiments can be important, the empirical orientation of the social sciences demands that the gap between modeled "thought experiments" and empirical data be as narrow as possible. In an ideal setting, an underlying theory of real-world processes would be tested directly with empirical data, according to commonly accepted technical and methodological standards. A possible procedure for narrowing the gap between theoretical assumptions and empirical data comparison is presented in this paper. It introduces a two-stage process of optimizing a model and then reviewing it critically, both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. This procedure systematically improves a model's performance until the inherent limitations of the underlying theory become evident. The reference model used for this purpose simulates air traffic movements in the approach area of JFK International Airport in New York. This phenomenon was chosen because it provides a testbed for evaluating an empirical ABM in an application of sufficient complexity. The congruence between model and reality is expressed in simple distance measurements and is visually contrasted in Google Earth. Context knowledge about the driving forces behind controlled approaches and genetic optimization techniques are used to optimize the results within the range of the underlying theory. The repeated evaluation of a model's 'fitness' - defined as the ability to hit a set of empirical data points - serves as a feedback mechanism that corrects its parameter settings. The successful application of this approach is demonstrated and the procedure could be applied to other domains.

AB A continuum damage model for simulating propagation of debonding in joints, introducing a linear softening damage process for the adhesive agent, is used to predict failure of scarf joints. The proposed modeling procedure was applied to scarf joints of marine type with glass fiber reinforced polymer adherends, commonly encountered in wind turbine rotor blade repair. Tests on aviation type scarf joints with carbon fiber reinforced polymer adherends were also simulated. Stress analysis was performed using plane strain elements of a commercial finite element code allowing implementation of user-defined material behavior. Numerical results for different scarf angles were in good agreement with the experimental data. The proposed model has been utilized to design a repair patch on wind turbine rotor blade and the design has been validated by testing a full-scale subcomponent of the repaired blade.

AB A multiscale model for predicting the superheated steam drying behavior of a packed bed filled with particulate porous material is presented. By using a reaction engineering approach (REA) a semi-empirical model is developed that can describe the heat and mass transfer between a single particle and the surrounding drying agent. By analogy between superheated steam drying and hot air drying, the relative activation energy of the REA model is formulated. Next, the single-particle drying model is fed into a continuum-scale model of a packed bed. The temperature and moisture content of the solid and the vapor temperature are successfully predicted by the bed-scale model. To endow the bed-scale model with predictive capabilities, simulation results are compared with experimental literature data.

AB Lytic viruses were thought to kill the most numerous host (i.e., kill the winner). But persisting viruses/defectives can also protect against viruses, especially in a ubiquitous virosphere. In 1991, Yarmolinsky et al. discovered the addiction modules of P1 phage, in which opposing toxic and protective functions stabilize persistence. Subsequently, I proposed that lytic and persisting cryptic virus also provide addiction modules that promote group identity. In eukaryotes (and the RNA world), a distinct RNA virus-host relationship exists. Retrovirurses/retroposons are major contributors to eukaryotic genomes. Eukaryotic complexity appears to be mostly mediated by regulatory complexity involving noncoding retroposon-derived RNA. RNA viruses evolve via quasispecies, which contain cooperating, minority, and even opposing RNA types. Quasispecies can also demonstrate group preclusion (e.g., hepatitis C). Stem-loop RNA domains are found in long terminal repeats (and viral RNA) and mediate viral regulation/identity. Thus, stem-loop RNAs may be ancestral regulators. I consider the RNA (ribozyme) world scenario from the perspective of addiction modules and cooperating quasispecies (i.e., subfunctional agents that establish group identity). Such an RNA collective resembles a "gang" but requires the simultaneous emergence of endonuclease, ligase, cooperative catalysis, group identity, and history markers (RNA). I call such a collective a gangen (pathway to gang) needed for life to emerge.

AB The addition of amphiphiles is one of the most frequent approaches used to prevent asphaltene precipitation in reservoir rocks and wellbore tubing. These substances can solubilize the asphaltenes otherwise insoluble under production conditions. The activity of the amphiphiles as asphaltene stabilizers is directly related to the adsorption behavior of the amphiphile on the asphaltene surface. In this study, a semiquantitative description of the adsorption behavior of different amphiphiles is carried out using molecular modeling to characterize the mutual interactions between the amphiphile, asphaltene and solvent. At the same time, flocculation onset measurements using n-heptane as a precipitating agent were carried out to evaluate the experimental activity of the different amphiphiles as asphaltene stabilizers. Two different indexes calculated using the mutual interaction energies amphiphile-asphaltene-n-heptane were used to correlate them with the experimental activity shown by the amphiphiles. The results obtained indicate that the activity of the amphiphiles as asphaltene stabilizers increases, as their adsorption on the asphaltene is more favorable. In fact, the net adsorption energies of amphiphiles on asphaltenes from n-heptane can be used as a good criterion for the selection of asphaltene precipitation inhibitors.

AB The use of simulation to investigate biological domains will inevitably lead to the need to extend existing simulations as new areas of these domains become more fully understood. Such simulation extensions can entail the incorporation of additional cell types, molecules or molecular pathways, all of which can exert a profound influence on the simulation behaviour. Where the biological domain is not well characterised, a structured development methodology must be employed to ensure that the extended simulation is well aligned with its predecessor. We develop and discuss such a methodology, relying on iterative simulation development and sensitivity analysis. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated using a case study simulation of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine T cell-mediated autoimmune disease model of multiple sclerosis, where it is used to investigate the activity of an additional regulatory pathway. We discuss how application of this methodology guards against creating inappropriate simulation representations of the biology when investigating poorly characterised biological mechanisms.

AB The increase in the frequency and impact of automotive recalls has had broad reaching economic and social consequences. Recent examples of automotive recalls suggest that some are due to deliberate actions of firms to subvert processes designed to ensure quality. Such controls are dependent on partners acting in good faith in the relationship and abiding by relational norms and so do not recognize the risks of firms lying, falsifying data, or intentionally circumventing process-based controls. Data on automotive recalls shows that recalls exhibit a statistically significant oscillatory pattern with an estimated period of around 3.6 years. We argue that the cyclical pattern in automotive recalls is due, in part, to opportunistic behavior within a network, which is likely to spread and be reciprocated. To test whether opportunism can lead to similar network effects, we develop an agent-based simulation to model opportunism within a network of connected firms. The simulation is based on an extension of the prisoner's dilemma where the cooperate/defect decision is based on a dyadic relational model driven by trust, knowledge, and dependence levels within each relationship. The results from the simulation suggest that cyclical patterns, similar to those in automotive recalls, emerge as well as "behavioral clustering" within the network, where connected firms exhibit highly similar behaviors that tend to cycle within small clusters. Therefore, opportunistic behavior in supply networks might be an important, relational determinant of product recalls. Our dynamic modeling approach differs from current perspectives on understanding product recalls, contributing to the current literature.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB The Mexican jumping bean, Laspeyresia saltitans, consists of a hollow seed housing a moth larva. Heating by the sun induces movements by the larva which appear as rolls, jumps and flips by the bean. In this combined experimental, numerical and robotic study, we investigate this unique means of rolling locomotion. Time-lapse videography is used to record bean trajectories across a series of terrain types, including one-dimensional channels and planar surfaces of varying inclination. We find that the shell encumbers the larva's locomotion, decreasing its speed on flat surfaces by threefold. We also observe that the two-dimensional search algorithm of the bean resembles the run-and-tumble search of bacteria. We test this search algorithm using both an agent-based simulation and a wheeled Scribbler robot. The algorithm succeeds in propelling the robot away from regions of high temperature and may have application in biomimetic micro-scale navigation systems.

AB This study utilizes an agent-based simulation model to conduct a public policy simulation of firms' networking and cooperation in innovation. The simulation game tests the differences in sector responses to internal and external changes, including cross-sector spillovers, when applying three different policy strategies to promote cooperation in innovation. The public policy strategies include clustering to develop certain industries, incentives to encourage cooperative research and development (R&D), and spin-off policies to foster entrepreneurship among R&D personnel. These policies are compared to a 'no-policy' alternative, which serves as a benchmark to verify the gains (or loses) in the number of firms cooperating and networking. The simulation model defines firms' behavior according to empirical findings from an analysis of determinants of the firms' participation in cooperation in innovation with other organizations using a Korean Innovation Survey. The exercise indicates possible appropriate policy strategies that can be applied depending on the target industries. We have applied a few examples and showed how the results may be interpreted. Agent-based models are found to have a great potential in decision-support systems for policy makers.

AB This work presents a numerical simulation of the aerodynamics of a swirling turbulent flow in a vortex chamber of a combined pneumatic centrifugal machine with a rotor located in its upper part and consisting of a system of rotating blades. Numerical analysis of the swirling turbulent flow made it possible to determine the main patterns in the behavior of the carrier agent in the machine. As a result, a modification of the rotor blade shape is proposed, which allows the distribution change of the radial velocity field as necessary. Numerical studies have shown the promise of this approach for controlling the radial velocity component in the rotor, which is a necessary condition for the separator to operate efficiently. The conducted numerical calculations are validated using test studies and a comparison with experimental data.

AB In this experiment, we analyzed live fish (silver carp) trajectories recorded in an experimental vertical-slot fishway. Combined with a numerical simulation, we demonstrated that randomness shown in fish trajectories might not merely be attributed to the fish's random choices in its swimming, but could also be a consequence of adaption to the bulk unsteady turbulent flow structures. Simple superposition of a fish trajectory on the time-averaged flow field obtained either by interpolating on discrete point measurements or numerical simulation data is not an ideal method for description of fish movement. How to model the fish paths in transient flow and the necessity of simultaneous recording of the flow field and the fish locomotion are challenging topics. We also discussed the possible integration of currently existing methods to promote the development of fish trajectory modeling.

DE Modified ray optimization; Snell's refraction law; optimal design; truss

AB The ray optimization algorithm is a recently developed meta-heuristic algorithm which was conceptualized using the relationship between the angles of incidence and fraction based on Snell's law. In ray optimization, each agent is modeled as a ray of light that moves in the search space in order to find the global or near-global optimum solution. This paper develops an Improved Ray Optimization (IRO) algorithm for solving optimization problems. IRO employs a new approach for generating new solution vectors which has no limitation on the number of variables, so in the process of algorithm there is no need to divide the variables into groups like RO. The procedure which returns the violated agents into feasible search space is also modified. These improvements enhance the accuracy and convergence rate of the RO. The Simulation results of the IRO for benchmark mathematical optimization problems and truss structures are compared to those of the standard RO and some well-known meta-heuristic algorithms, respectively. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed IRO.

AB In the automotive industry the selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which converts nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water in the presence of a reducing agent, namely the so-called AdBlue urea-water solution, becomes major importance as a powerful emission reduction technique. Thermal engineering of SCR-tanks is a great challenge due to the melting and freezing behaviour of the AdBlue-fluid. In this paper, an efficient use of computational fluid dynamics and numerical heat transfer methods is presented for developing and optimising automotive SCR-tank systems. These thermal simulations include the phase change (melting and freezing), heat conduction, power generation, and natural convection effects within the liquid. The accuracy of the numerical scheme is assessed by comparisons with benchmark cases and experimental data. Typical industrial application examples are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

SO DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The Styrene Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Chemical Industry Council (CEFIC) sponsored this work to address any concern that styrene dimers and trimers that might migrate from polystyrene containers into food could possess some estrogenic activity and thus possibly affect human health. All phases of the study were conducted in conformance with GLP regulations and without knowledge of the oligomer migrates tested. All activities were managed and audited under a third-party contract between the SSC and Argus International.
   Low and high doses of the styrene oligomer migrates of 23 polystyrene samples [i.e. 9 general purpose polystyrenes (GPPS), 8 high impact polystyrenes (HIPS) and 6 expandable polystyrenes (EPS)] were tested for estrogenicity in an in vivo uterotrophic assay (immature female rat model). This model is considered to be the "gold standard" for use in screening for estrogenic effects because it evaluates both direct and indirect potential effects. The two concentrations of migrates of each of the 23 polystyrenes tested were selected to simulate daily human consumption of a low anal high amount of food. Representative dimer and trimer concentrations were obtained in conformance with EEC Council Directives and calculated to be at levels simulating human consumption of 0.5 or 5 kg of food for the GPPS and the HIPS samples and of 0.5 or 3.15 kg of food for the EPS samples, respectively.
   The study was conducted in a series of three blocks. Each block included concurrent untreated control (negative control), vehicle control (25% ethanol, 20 ml/kg/day) and positive control (diethylstilbestral-dipropionate, DES-DP, 5 mu g/kg/day) groups, and low and high doses of each of 7 (1 block) or 8 (2 blocks) polystyrene oligomer migrates. Each group in each black consisted of 10 immature Wistar (Chbb: THOM-SPF)female rats. Beginning when the rats were 22 +/- 1 days of age, each rat was appropriately handled (untreated control group) or administered twice daily oral (gavage) dosages of the vehicle, positive control agent or one of the two doses of the migrates of each polystyrene for 4 consecutive days and then sacrificed at 26 +/- 1 days of age. The uterus of each rat was weighed, and the uterine weight was compared with the terminal body weight.
   The positive control agent (DES-DP, 5 mu g/kg/day) significantly increased both absolute and relative (to terminal body weight) uterine weights, as compared to the untreated and vehicle control group values in each block, demonstrating sensitivity and response of the animals to an estrogenic agent. None of the 23 polystyrene oligomer migrates tested at low and high doses demonstrated biologically important or statistically significant differences from the untreated or vehicle control group values for absolute or relative (to body weight) uterine weights. Based an these data, it is concluded that low and high doses of the 23 polystyrene oligomer migrates tested did not induce an estrogenic response.

A variety of electrochemical experimental techniques viz., electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and potentiodynamic polarization coupled with different microscopic techniques viz., scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were run to evaluate the corrosion resistive behaviour of inhibitors. The surface feature of mild steel was further analysed by measuring contact angle in different electrolytic solutions. Furthermore, these wet-chemical experimental outcomes are well complemented from results analysed from ab initio DFT study and MD simulation. Furthermore, the MD simulation outcomes helped in visualization of interaction and thereby adsorption of inhibitors on Fe (110) surface. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Two recent studies testing navigation of rats in swimming pools have posed problems for any account of the use of purely geometric properties of space in navigation (M. Graham, M. A. Good, A. McGregor, & J. M. Pearce, 2006; J. M. Pearce, M. A. Good, P. M. Jones, & A. McGregor, 2004). The authors simulated I experiment from each study in a virtual reality environment to test whether experimental results could be explained by view-based navigation. The authors recorded a reference image at the target location and then determined global panoramic image differences between this image and images taken at regularly spaced locations throughout the arena. A formal model, in which an agent attempts to minimize image differences between the reference image and current views, generated trajectories that could be compared with the search performance of rats. For both experiments, this model mimics many aspects of rat behavior. View-based navigation provides a sufficient and parsimonious explanation for a range of navigational behaviors of rats under these experimental conditions.

ID SOIL CARBON SEQUESTRATION; FARMING SYSTEMS; COOKSTOVES; FUELWOOD;
   IMPACTS
AB One billion vulnerable subsistence farmers across the global south depend on risky livelihoods in need of adaptation to climate change impacts. Simultaneously, their aggregated emission of greenhouse gases from land use and fuelwood consumption is substantial. Synergies between adaptation to climate change and mitigation should therefore be actively promoted. In the context of poverty, such synergies should ideally be designed specifically for the poorest of the poor who are notoriously difficult to reach by policies and projects. In this experimental case on subsistence farming in western Kenya we assume that only the poorest inhabit the most degraded lands and use the simplest form of cooking over open fire. As the study location is typical of sub-Saharan areas affected by drought, flooding, land degradation, diseases and persistent poverty, findings can be scaled up, transferred to and tested in similar settings. Seeking multiple synergies of adaptation, mitigation, and social change while using sustainability science in intervention research, we reframed peasant farmers from vulnerable victims into agents fighting livelihood stressors and climate change impacts. In collaboration with them we performed small-scale experiments on agricultural production practices and domestic energy efficiency resulting in multiple synergies. Findings show that the 'smokeless kitchen' and carbon sequestration from improved land management can mitigate climate change while increasing energy efficiency, health standards, food security, and community-based adaptive capacity. Preferably, climate policy should therefore explicitly address synergies and support peasant farmers' efforts to create synergies when the 'food imperative' limits their agency to fight climate change alone.

AB Aim: Neurodegeneration is one of the serious adverse effects of stimulant agents such as nicotine. Minocycline possess established neuroprotective properties. The role of CREB-BDNF signaling pathway in mediating the neuroprotective effects of minocycline against nicotine-induced neurodegeneration in rats was evaluated in current study.
   Methods: Seventy adult male rats were divided randomly into seven groups. Group 1 and 2, received 0.7 ml/rat of normal saline (i.p) and nicotine (10 mg/kg, s.c) respectively. Groups 3, 4, 5 and 6, treated concurrently with nicotine (10 mg/kg) and minocycline (10, 20, 30 and 40 mg/kg, i.p, respectively) for 21 days. Group 7 received minocycline alone (40 mg/kg, i.p) for 21 days. From 17th to 21 A days of experiment, Morris water maze (MWM) was used to evaluate learning and spatial memory in rats treated in different groups. According to the critical role of hippocampus in cognitive behavior, hippocampal neurodegenerative parameters (oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers) and also cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels were evaluated in isolated hippocampus in day 22 of experiment and after drug treatment. Also hippocampal cell density and tissue changes were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin staining.
   Result: Nicotine administration impaired the learning and spatial memory in rats and simultaneous treatment with various doses of minocycline attenuated the nicotine-induced cognition disturbances. In addition, nicotine treatment increased lipid peroxidation and the levels of oxidized form of glutathione (GSSG), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and Bax protein, while decreasing reduced form of glutathione (GSH), Bcl-2 protein, P-CREB and BDNF levels in the hippocampus of experimental animals. Nicotine also reduced the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GR) in the hippocampus. Minocycline attenuated nicotine-induced neurodegeneration and elevating CREB (both forms) and BDNF levels. Also minocycline treatment alone increases the cognitive activity and increased CREB (both forms) and BDNF levels and decreased oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptotic biomarkers. Minocycline at high doses cause inhibition of nicotine induced cell density and changes in both area of dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1 in hippocampus.
   Conclusion: It can be concluded that minocycline, probably through activation of P-CREB/BDNF signaling pathway, confers neuroprotection against nicotine-induced neurodegeneration in rat hippocampus.

AB In this article, we investigate the Lyapunov stability problem for impulsive systems via event-triggered impulsive control, where dynamical systems evolve according to continuous-time equations most of the time, but occasionally exhibit instantaneous jumps when impulsive events are triggered. We provide some Lyapunov-based sufficient conditions for uniform stability and globally asymptotical stability. Unlike normal time-triggered impulsive control, event-triggered impulsive control is triggered only when an event occurs. Thus our stability conditions rely greatly on the event-triggering mechanism given in terms of Lyapunov functions. Moreover, the Zeno behavior can be excluded in our results. Then, we apply the theoretical results to the nonlinear impulsive control system, where event-triggered impulsive control strategies are designed to achieve stability of the addressed system. Finally, two numerical examples and their simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

AB One year of mobile phone location data from Senegal is analysed to determine the characteristics of journeys that result in an overnight stay, and are thus relevant for malaria transmission. Defining the home location of each person as the place of most frequent calls, it is found that approximately 60% of people who spend nights away from home have regular destinations that are repeatedly visited, although only 10% have 3 or more regular destinations. The number of journeys involving overnight stays peaks at a distance of 50 km, although roughly half of such journeys exceed 100 km. Most visits only involve a stay of one or two nights away from home, with just 4% exceeding one week. A new agent-based migration model is introduced, based on a gravity model adapted to represent overnight journeys. Each agent makes journeys involving overnight stays to either regular or random locations, with journey and destination probabilities taken from the mobile phone dataset. Preliminary simulations show that the agent-based model can approximately reproduce the patterns of migration involving overnight stays.

AB This paper presents a cognitive model for an action execution process-the sensory motor system (SMS)-as a new module of the system-level cognitive model for "Learning Intelligent Distribution Agent" (LIDA). Action execution refers to a situation in which a software agent or robot transforms a selected goal-directed action into low-level executable actions and executes them in the real world. A sensorimotor system derived from the subsumption architecture has been implemented into the SMS; several cognitive neuroscience hypotheses have been incorporated as well, including the two visual systems. A computational SMS has been created inside a LIDA-based software agent in Webots to model the execution of a grip action; its simulated results have been verified against human performance. This computational verification by the comparison of model and human behaviors supports the SMS as a qualitatively reasonable cognitive model for action execution. Finally, the SMS has been compared with other alternative models of action execution; this supports the assertion that our new action execution module is applicable across a range of cognitive architectures.

AB Agent-based models (ABMs) have tended to become more complicated in recent years, going along with challenges of fully understanding model behaviour. While partly answered using simple and abstract models, the question of the role of different aspects of model detail for controlling model outcomes still has not been explored with empirical ABMs. We therefore use a detailed model built upon an empirical survey of residential mobility to explore the effects of three domains of model detail - agent heterogeneity, structural model detail and detail in the data used - on model performance. Evaluation is done by measuring the ability to predict empirical patterns for different topics, population, relocations and vacancies at different scales. Our diverse results indicate that a good data basis is crucial, heterogeneity strongly controls small-scale patterns and different design aspects must be tested thoroughly. This outcome calls for caution when interpreting the results of such models. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Thoroughly planned and implemented maintenance strategies save time and cost. However, the integration of maintenance work into reliability analysis is difficult as common modeling techniques are often not applicable due to state explosion which calls for restrictive model assumptions and oversimplification. From authors' point of view, agent-based modeling (ABM) of technical and organizational systems is a promising approach to overcome such problems. But since ABM is not well established in reliability analysis its feasibility in this area still has to be demonstrated. For this purpose ABM is compared with Markov chains, namely by analyzing the reliability of a maintained n-unit system with dependent repair events, applying both modeling approaches. Although ABM and Markov chains lead to the same numerical results, the former points out the potentiality of an improved system state handling. This is demonstrated by extending the ABM with operators as additional "agents" featuring their location (x;y) availability (0:1) and different maintenance strategies. This extension highlights the capability of ABM to analyze complex emergent system behavior and allows a systematic refinement and optimization of the maintenance strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Understanding of polypropylene (PP) foaming is critically important to reduce the weight of automotive parts. In this study, we used a batch foaming simulation system with visualization cell, to observe the foaming behaviors of PP that is blown with CO2 and N-2 under various experimental conditions. We found that the nucleating agent content, initial temperature, pressure (i. e., gas content), and pressure drop rate during foaming have a significant effect on cell nucleation and cell growth. The cell density and the void fraction of PP foamed with CO2 and N-2, respectively, were separately observed and compared. It was found that under the same experimental conditions, the maximum cell density of PP foamed with CO2 was higher than that of PP foamed with N-2. However, the maximum cell density of PP foamed with CO2 was determined to be lower than that of PP foamed with N-2, when the same gas mole numbers were employed. Based on the experimental results, optimum foaming conditions and effective processing strategies jar PP-CO2 system are suggested.

AB Predicting efficacy and optimal drug delivery strategies for small molecule and biological therapeutics is challenging due to the complex interactions between diverse cell types in different tissues that determine disease outcome. Here we present a new methodology to simulate inflammatory disease manifestation and test potential intervention strategies in silico using agent-based computational models. Simulations created using this methodology have explicit spatial and temporal representations, and capture the heterogeneous and stochastic cellular behaviours that lead to emergence of pathology or disease resolution. To demonstrate this methodology we have simulated the prototypic murine T cell-mediated autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. In the simulation immune cell dynamics, neuronal damage and tissue specific pathology emerge, closely resembling behaviour found in the murine model. Using the calibrated simulation we have analysed how changes in the timing and efficacy of T cell receptor signalling inhibition leads to either disease exacerbation or resolution. The technology described is a powerful new method to understand cellular behaviours in complex inflammatory disease, permits rational design of drug interventional strategies and has provided new insights into the role of TCR signalling in autoimmune disease progression.

AB There is an increasing demand for composite resins with both strong antibacterial activity and satisfactory mechanical properties. This study tested the hypothesis that the new antibacterial agent tetrapod-like zinc oxide whisker (T-ZnOw) could simultaneously enhance the antibacterial activity and mechanical properties of a two-component composite resin. The antibacterial activities of the materials were assessed by the broth dilution test and direct contact test. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and measurements of the flexural strength, compressive strength, and diametral tensile strength were carried out for mechanical characterization. The results revealed that T-ZnOw provided the resin with strong antibacterial activity and improved mechanical properties in all tested groups. However, the antibacterial activity of the resin with 10% T-ZnOw in the powder component significantly decreased after aging treatment. The incorporation of 5% T-ZnOw into the resin powder was optimal to give appropriate antibacterial activity, long-term antibacterial effectiveness, and mechanical properties.

AB This paper provides a detailed description of the Eurace@Unibi model, which has been developed as a versatile tool for macroeconomic analysis and policy experiments. The model explicitly incorporates the decentralized interaction of heterogeneous agents across different sectors and regions. The modeling of individual behavior is based on heuristics with empirical microfoundations. Although Eurace@Unibi has been applied successfully to different policy domains, the complexity of the structure of the model, which is similar to other agent-based macroeconomic models, makes it hard to communicate to readers the exact working of the model and enable them to check the robustness of obtained results. This paper addresses these challenges by describing the details of all decision rules, interaction protocols and balance sheet structures used in the model. Furthermore, we discuss the use of a virtual appliance as a tool allowing third parties to reproduce the simulation results and to replicate the model. The paper illustrates the potential use of the virtual appliance by providing some sensitivity analyses of the simulation output carried out using this tool.

AB Theories for the origins of agriculture are still debated, with a range of different explanations offered. Computational models can be used to test these theories and explore new hypotheses; Bowles and Choi [Bowles S, Choi J-K (2013) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 110(22):8830-8835] have developed one such model. Their model shows the coevolution of farming and farming-friendly property rights, and by including climate variability, replicates the timings for the emergence of these events seen in the archaeological record. Because the processes modeled occurred a long time ago, it can be difficult to justify exact parameter values; hence, we propose a fitting to idealized outcomes (FIO) method to explore the model's parameter space in more detail. We have replicated the model of Bowles and Choi, and used the FIO method to identify complexities and interactions of the model previously unidentified. Our results indicate that the key parameters for the emergence of farming are group structuring, group size, conservatism, and farming-friendly property rights (lending further support to Bowles and Choi's original proposal). We also find that although advantageous, it is not essential that farming productivity be greater than foraging productivity for farming to emerge. In addition, we highlight how model behaviors can be missed when gauging parameter sensitivity via a fix-all-but-one variation approach.

ID AGENT-BASED MODEL; FINANCIAL-MARKETS; PRICE CHANGES; LIQUIDITY;
   INVESTORS; VOLATILITY
AB To investigate the relationship between the liquidity and the divergent degree of heterogeneous investors with different investment horizons, we propose an agent-based model based on the assumptions of the fractal market hypothesis. A laboratory market is used to investigate the impact of the divergent degree on the stability of the financial market. Simulation results indicate that the market becomes more stable as investors become increasingly divergent and are more likely to absorb the orders of the other side and maintain a narrow trade gap. Moreover, with highly heterogeneous investors, the market is more efficient, less liable to crash and less volatile. The simulation, based on the agent-based model, demonstrates that the interactions and herding behaviours of investors lead to a market crash when the divergent structure shrinks and only limited investment horizons are available. The result also suggests an alternate explanation of the anomaly of efficient market hypothesis, which shows why the momentum and contrarian strategies can earn excess returns in the short term and the long term, respectively. It also verifies the hypothesis that heterogeneous investors with different investment horizons provide market liquidity.

AB This article develops a mathematical model for residential location choice in which previous experience is considered via a dynamic learning process and each agent evaluates location decisions according to their utility. Agents' idiosyncratic behavior is modeled, assuming a stochastic willingness to pay based on dwelling and neighborhood attributes and households' socioeconomics. Additionally, the willingness to pay is affected by the agent's experience of the urban context in previous periods. Numerical examples are given, and simulations are conducted using linear bid functions. Additionally, concepts of urban dynamics are used in the long-term, assuming quasi-equilibrium in the bids considering the externalities of urban configurations. The results are compared with a static outcome corresponding to the equilibrium model of land use. The comparison is performed using indices of urban segregation and both short-and long-term configurations. The studied dynamics show that static modeling does not explain all the features associated with such a configuration of the urban system (in both short and long term).

AB A simulation of high-frequency market data is performed with the Genoa Artificial Stock Market. Heterogeneous agents trade a risky asset in exchange for cash. Agents have zero intelligence and issue random limit or market orders depending on their budget constraints. The price is cleared by means of a limit order book. A renewal order-generation process is used having a waiting-time distribution between consecutive orders that follows a Weibull law, in line with previous studies. The simulation results show that this mechanism can reproduce fat-tailed distributions of returns without ad-hoc behavioral assumptions on agents. In the simulated trade process, when the order waiting-times are exponentially distributed, trade waiting times are exponentially distributed. However, if order waiting times follow a Weibull law, analogous results do not hold. These findings are interpreted in terms of a random thinning of the order renewal process. This behavior is compared with order and trade durations taken from real financial data.

TI Involving Motor Capabilities in the Formation of Sensory Space
   Representations
SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID STATISTICS
AB A goal of sensory coding is to capture features of sensory input that are behaviorally relevant. Therefore, a generic principle of sensory coding should take into account the motor capabilities of an agent. Up to now, unsupervised learning of sensory representations with respect to generic coding principles has been limited to passively received sensory input. Here we propose an algorithm that reorganizes an agent's representation of sensory space by maximizing the predictability of sensory state transitions given a motor action. We applied the algorithm to the sensory spaces of a number of simple, simulated agents with different motor parameters, moving in two-dimensional mazes. We find that the optimization algorithm generates compact, isotropic representations of space, comparable to hippocampal place fields. As expected, the size and spatial distribution of these place fields-like representations adapt to the motor parameters of the agent as well as to its environment. The representations prove to be well suited as a basis for path planning and navigation. They not only possess a high degree of state-transition predictability, but also are temporally stable. We conclude that the coding principle of predictability is a promising candidate for understanding place field formation as the result of sensorimotor reorganization.

AB Objective: The 1-34 amino acid segment of the parathyroid hormone (PTH [1-34]) mediates anabolic effects in chondrocytes and osteocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether systemic application of PTH [1-34] improves the repair of non-osteoarthritic, focal osteochondral defects in vivo.
   Design: Standardized cylindrical osteochondral defects were bilaterally created in the femoral trochlea of rabbits (n = 8). Daily subcutaneous injections of 10 mu g PTH [1-34]/kg were given to the treatment group (n = 4) for 6 weeks, controls (n = 4) received saline. Articular cartilage repair was evaluated by macroscopic, biochemical, histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Reconstitution of the subchondral bone was assessed by micro-computed tomography. Effects of PTH [1-34] on synovial membrane, apoptosis, and expression of the PTH receptor (PTH1R) were determined.
   Results: Systemic PTH [1-34] increased PTH1R expression on both, chondrocytes and osteocytes within the repair tissue. PTH [1-34] ameliorated the macro- and microscopic aspect of the cartilaginous repair tissue. It also enhanced the thickness of the subchondral bone plate and the microarchitecture of the subarticular spongiosa within the defects. No significant correlations were established between these coexistent processes. Apoptotic levels, synovial membrane, biochemical composition of the repair tissue, and type-I/II collagen immunoreactivity remained unaffected.
   Conclusions: PTH [1-34] emerges as a promising agent in the treatment of focal osteochondral defects as its systemic administration simultaneously stimulates articular cartilage and subchondral bone repair. Importantly, both time-dependent mechanisms of repair did not correlate significantly at this early time point and need to be followed over prolonged observation periods.

   CELL-DEATH; MEDIATED APOPTOSIS; EXPRESSION; FAS/APO-1; FLUID
AB Purpose: To examine the role of soluble Fas (sFas) in patients with Behcet's uveitis.
   Methods: We measured the sFas levels in both sera and aqueous humor (AH) of patients (n = 40) with uveitis and of non-uveitis controls (n = 27) using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The patients with uveitis comprised 24 with Behcet's disease, 6 pan-uveitis, 5 anterior uveitis, 2 lens-induced uveitis, I Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease, I sarcoidosis, and I retinal vasculitis. The severity of uveitis was determined by the Hogan grading method (0-4 grade) at the time of sampling.
   Results: The concentration of aqueous sFas in uveitis patients was significantly higher than that in non-uveitis controls, while there was no difference in the serum concentration of sFas between the two groups. In the paired samples of serum and AH, obtained simultaneously, the aqueous sFas levels were higher than serum Fas levels in patients with uveitis, whereas the non-uveitis controls displayed significantly lower sFas levels in AH than in the serum. The sFas levels in AH or serum were not different between Behcet's uveitis patients and non-Behcet's uveitis patients. However, in patients with Behcet's uveitis, circulating sFas strongly correlated with aqueous sFas, which was not so in those with non-Behcet's uveitis, Patients (n = 29) with more active (grade greater than or equal to 2) uveitis had significantly higher levels of aqueous sFas than those (n = 11) with less active (grade < 2) uveitis. After treatment with Steroids and/or immunosuppressive agents, aqueous sFas levels decreased in parallel with a reduction in the number of inflammatory cells.
   Conclusions: The levels of sFas were elevated in patients with Behcet's uveitis and correlated well with the uveitis severity in these patients. Jpn J Ophthalmol 2002;46:18-23 (C) 2002 Japanese Ophthalmological Society.

AB Nicergoline is an ergot alkaloid derivative acting as a neuroprotective agent. In the present investigation, b-wave time-course recovery profiles under both light-and dark-adapted conditions, were studied in order to evaluate the possible effectiveness of nicergoline in the protection of the rabbit retina. Retinal ischaemia was induced by bilateral occlusion of common carotid artery in male rabbit of the Dutch strain. Groups of animals were subjected to 15-, 30- and 60-min periods of ischaemia under pentobarbital anaesthesia. Electroretinogram recordings were simultaneously obtained from both eyes, using, as the stimulus, the brightest flash from a stimulator positioned 15 cm in front of each eye. The treatment with nicergoline, administered immediately before the carotid occlusion, induced a significant protection only when the ischaemia seemed to cause retinal damage that the reperfusion alone was not able to recover completely. Nicergoline did not modify the recovery rate after 15-min or 30-min light-adapted and 15-min dark-adapted ischaemia; in these conditions the controls showed a full recovery. After 30-min dark-adapted ischaemia, the maximum recovery of the controls was 82%, and nicergoline significantly improved b-wave amplitude at all time points of reperfusion up to the complete recovery. Rabbit retina was irreversibly damaged by a 60-min ischaemia. In these conditions nicergoline significantly increased the percentage of b-wave recovery both in light-and dark-adapted ERG. Nicergoline, probably on the basis of its metabolic actions, seems to be effective in severe conditions of hypoxia and is more potent in dark than in light-adapted conditions. Its effectiveness in these experimental conditions could be justified by the different oxygen consumption of the photoreceptors in light and dark and the different sensitivity of cones and rods to the ischaemia.

AB Agent-based micro-simulation models require a complete list of agents with detailed demographic/socioeconomic information for the purpose of behavior modeling and simulation. This paper introduces a new alternative for population synthesis based on Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution, encoding probabilistic relationships among a set of variables in an efficient way. Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efficient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and confidentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overfitting of data can be avoided as much as possible.

AB An animal experiment was conducted to assess the antitumor effects of chitosan-coated liposomes on myeloma SP2. The animal experimental groups designed for myeloma SP2 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were provided with five different drinks: (I) control (double-distilled water); (II) squid phospholipid liposomes alone 1.0 mg/mL; (III) chitosan alone 5.0 mg/mL; (IV) squid phospholipid liposomes 1.0 mg/mL with chitosan 5.0 mg/mL in the form of a simple mixture; and (V) squid phospholipid liposomes 1.0 mg/mL coated with chitosan 5.0 mg/mL. At 20 days after implantation of the myeloma SP2 cells into mice, oral administration of the experimental drinks was provided for 35 days. There was significant suppression of tumor growth when chitosan and squid phospholipids were administered simultaneously in a simple mixture or as chitosan-coated liposomes. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activity was significantly less in the serum of mice that consumed chitosan-coated liposomes than in control mice. We found that decreased tumor burden was related to NIMP secretion. Therefore, chitosan-coated marine phospholipid liposomes might be useful as potential agents for the treatment of myeloma SP2.

ID VISCOUS-LIQUIDS; POLYMER FOAMS; GAS BUBBLE; DYNAMICS
AB Viscoelastic simulations of bubble growth in polypropylene (PP) physical foaming were performed. A multimode Phan-Thien Tanner (PTT) model was used to analyze the dynamic growth behavior of spherically symmetric bubbles with the diffusion of a foaming agent (CO2). Changes in the dissolved foaming agent concentration in the polymer and in the strain of the polymer melt surrounding the bubbles were simulated with the Lagrangian FEM method. The simulation technique was validated by comparison with the bubble growth data, which were experimentally obtained from visual observations of the PP/CO2 batch foaming system. The simulation results demonstrated that the strain-hardening characteristic of polymer does not strongly affect the bubble growth rate. The linear viscoelastic characteristic is more influential, and the relaxation mode around 0.01 s is the most important factor in determining the bubble growth rate during the early stage of foaming. A multivariate analysis for the simulation results was also carried out. This clarified that bubble nucleus population density, surrounding pressure, initial dissolved foaming agent concentration, and diffusion coefficient are more important factors than the viscoelastic characteristics.

AB Purpose: This study evaluated the effects of adhesive cements on marginal adaptation and fracture resistance of ceramic molar crowns.
   Materials and Methods: Seventy-five extracted maxillary molars were selected. The occlusal morphology of 15 molars (control) was scanned and transferred to the crowns in the test groups by CAD/CAM. Sixty molars received full-coverage crown preparations with 6-degree axial taper, 1.0-mm shoulder, and 2.0-mm occlusal reduction. They were assigned to four groups, and pulpal pressure was simulated. The 15 crowns in each test group were seated with resin-based self-adhesive cements, Rely-X (RX) and Multilink (MS), one multistep bonded adhesive luting composite resin, Variolink (VL), and glass-ionomer cement, Ketac Cem (KC). Test and control molars were subjected to thermal and mechanical fatigue stress (TMS: 12,000 x 5 degrees C to 50 degrees C; 2.4 million x 49 N) for 18 days in a masticator. Marginal adaptation ["continuous margin%" (CM%)] of the crowns was determined by scanning electron microscopy (200x). Finally, molars were occlusally loaded until fracture in a testing machine, and fracture load (N) was recorded. Marginal adaptation and strength data were statistically analyzed.
   Results: TMS significantly (p < 0.001) reduced CM% in all groups. After TMS, CM% at the cement-dentin interface was significantly (p < 0.001) higher for RX than for all other cements. At the crown-cement interface both self-adhesive cements MS and RX had significantly better CM% than VL (p < 0.05) and KC (p < 0.001). Fracture resistance of natural untreated molars was significantly (p < 0.001) higher than that of experimental crowns. Fracture resistance of RX cemented crowns was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than that of other crowns. Occlusal morphology significantly influenced fracture resistance (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Self-adhesive cement RX offers a valid alternative to multistep resin-based luting composite with respect to marginal adaptation to dentin and fracture resistance. The latter is also influenced by occlusal morphology, necessitating careful monitoring of occlusal contacts.

AB Background: Tissue morphogenesis is a complex process whereby tissue structures self-assemble by the aggregate behaviors of independently acting cells responding to both intracellular and extracellular cues in their environment. During embryonic development, morphogenesis is particularly important for organizing cells into tissues, and although key regulatory events of this process are well studied in isolation, a number of important systems-level questions remain unanswered. This is due, in part, to a lack of integrative tools that enable the coupling of biological phenomena across spatial and temporal scales. Here, we present a new computational framework that integrates intracellular signaling information with multi-cell behaviors in the context of a spatially heterogeneous tissue environment.
   Results: We have developed a computational simulation of mesendoderm migration in the Xenopus laevis explant model, which is a well studied biological model of tissue morphogenesis that recapitulates many features of this process during development in humans. The simulation couples, via a JAVA interface, an ordinary differential equation-based mass action kinetics model to compute intracellular Wnt/beta-catenin signaling with an agent-based model of mesendoderm migration across a fibronectin extracellular matrix substrate. The emergent cell behaviors in the simulation suggest the following properties of the system: maintaining the integrity of cell-to-cell contact signals is necessary for preventing fractionation of cells as they move, contact with the Fn substrate and the existence of a Fn gradient provides an extracellular feedback loop that governs migration speed, the incorporation of polarity signals is required for cells to migrate in the same direction, and a delicate balance of integrin and cadherin interactions is needed to reproduce experimentally observed migratory behaviors.
   Conclusion: Our computational framework couples two different spatial scales in biology: intracellular with multicellular. In our simulation, events at one scale have quantitative and dynamic impact on events at the other scale. This integration enables the testing and identification of key systems-level hypotheses regarding how signaling proteins affect overall tissue-level behavior during morphogenesis in an experimentally verifiable system. Applications of this approach extend to the study of tissue patterning processes that occur during adulthood and disease, such as tumorgenesis and atherogenesis.

AB This paper considers communication in terms of inference about the behaviour of others (and our own behaviour). It is based on the premise that our sensations are largely generated by other agents like ourselves. This means, we are trying to infer how our sensations are caused by others, while they are trying to infer our behaviour: for example, in the dialogue between two speakers. We suggest that the infinite regress induced by modelling another agent - who is modelling you - can be finessed if you both possess the same model. In other words, the sensations caused by others and oneself are generated by the same process. This leads to a view of communication based upon a narrative that is shared by agents who are exchanging sensory signals. Crucially, this narrative transcends agency and simply involves intermittently attending to and attenuating sensory input. Attending to sensations enables the shared narrative to predict the sensations generated by another (i.e. to listen), while attenuating sensory input enables one to articulate the narrative (i.e. to speak). This produces a reciprocal exchange of sensory signals that, formally, induces a generalised synchrony between internal (neuronal) brain states generating predictions in both agents. We develop the arguments behind this perspective, using an active (Bayesian) inference framework and offer some simulations (of birdsong) as proof of principle. (C) 2014 The Authors.

AB Transition modelling is an emerging but growing niche within the broader field of sustainability transitions research. The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of this niche in relation to a range of existing modelling approaches and literatures with which it shares commonalities or from which it could draw. We distil a number of key aspects we think a transitions model should be able to address, from a broadly acknowledged, empirical list of transition characteristics. We review some of the main strands in modelling of socio-technological change with regards to their ability to address these characteristics. These are: Eco-innovation literatures (energy-economy models and Integrated Assessment Models), evolutionary economics, complex systems models, computational social science simulations using agent based models, system dynamics models and socio-ecological systems models. The modelling approaches reviewed can address many of the features that differentiate sustainability transitions from other socio-economic dynamics or innovations. The most problematic features are the representation of qualitatively different system states and of the normative aspects of change. The comparison provides transition researchers with a starting point for their choice of a modelling approach, whose characteristics should correspond to the characteristics of the research question they face. A promising line of research is to develop innovative models of co-evolution of behaviours and technologies towards sustainability, involving change in the structure of the societal and technical systems.

AB In this paper, a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy is presented with an artificial neural network (ANN) as reaction simulation environment, to obtain a fed-batch control strategy for an experimental bioreactor. The proposed method is a fundamental attempt to control reactions by employing state-of-the-art machine learning tools without the aid of well-established mechanistic understanding of the reaction system. This application utilizes the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, a member of the DRL family, that takes advantage of actor-critic algorithm and asynchronous learning by parallel learning agents to achieve stability and efficiency of the learning process. The resulting controller demonstrates robust performance in the fed-batch bioreactor since it can be adjusted to meet varying constraining factors including nutrient limitations and culture lengths. Results are presented for a bioreactor that produces cyanobacterial-phycocyanin (C-PC) in Plectonema sp. UTEX 1541. Experimental validations show a 52.1% increase in the product yield, and a 20.1% increase in C-PC concentration compared to a control group with the same total nutrient input replenished in a non-optimized manner.

AB In this article are reviewed available experimental and clinical studies on vitamin D analogs, and molecular and cellular mechanisms of their antineoplastic activity. In more detail are discussed the antiproliferative and pro-differentiative effects, inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis and induction of apoptosis. The use of vitamin D analogs is however hampered by their toxicity. In various experimental systems it was shown that the activities of vitamin D analogs can be enhanced by combined application with retinoids or other biological active compounds, such as cytokines and growth factors. Retinoids and vitamin D analogs were found to have synergistic inhibitory effects on tumor cell proliferation and angiogenic capability, and both agents applied simultaneously are efficacious in small doses. Thus combined therapy could find application in clinical practice. There are up to now only very limited data on the treatment of cutaneous malignancies with vitamin D analogs, and it appears that a combined therapy, preferably with retinoids, could be more beneficial. The new synthetic, more potent and less calcemic analogs might find wide application in chemotherapy of premalignant and early malignant cutaneous tumors, and could be especially useful for chemoprevention in the high-risk groups, eg, xeroderma pigmentosum, organ transplant recipients, arsenical keratoses and others.

ID BISPECTRAL INDEX; SEVOFLURANE; ANESTHESIA; CHILDREN
AB P>Aim:
   To assess if titrating anesthesia with entropy would result in faster awakening in children undergoing day care surgery.
   Background:
   Entropy, an EEG-based anesthesia depth monitor, has been used in children; however, only one other study has evaluated the effectiveness of entropy monitoring in decreasing awakening time and for titrating anesthetic agents in children undergoing short procedures under anesthesia.
   Methods:
   In a randomized prospective single-blind parallel group trial, 50 ASA grade I-II children, aged 2-12 years, scheduled for lower abdominal or urological surgeries were studied after ethics committee approval and parental consent. The children were randomized to the entropy or control group. Following laryngeal mask airway insertion and caudal analgesia, anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen, isoflurane. In the control group, anesthesia was titrated according to the hemodynamic parameters and the simultaneously monitored entropy values obscured from the anesthesiologist. In the entropy group, the entropy values (between 45 and 65) were used to titrate the anesthesia.
   Results:
   Time to awakening from anesthesia was 7 (3-18) min in the entropy group when compared to 10 (5-21) min in the control group. (P < 0.05) The difference in the mean time to awakening was 2.72 min 95% CI (0.34, 5.1). The end tidal isoflurane concentrations were lower in the entropy group when compared to the control group 15 s following airway insertion (0.78 +/- 0.14 vs 1.24 +/- 0.19), 15 s post caudal and skin incision (0.68 +/- 0.40 vs 0.84 +/- 0.05, 0.68 +/- 0.03 vs 0.77 +/- 0.32, respectively) as well as 5 min after skin incision 0.67 +/- 0.04 vs 0.79 +/- 0.02), (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion:
   In pediatric day care surgery, entropy monitoring resulted in statistically though not clinically significant faster awakening and significantly lower end - tidal isoflurane concentrations.

AB The effects of chemical injury with oxidizing agents on voltage-gated Na+ current (I-Na) in differentiated NG108-15 neuronal cells were investigated in this study. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, the challenge of these cells with t-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP; 1 mM) decreased the peak amplitude of I-Na with no modification in the current-voltage relationship. It caused a slowing of current inactivation, although there was no alteration in the activation time course of I-Na Cell exposure to t-BHP also increased a non-inactivating I-Na (I-Na(NI) elicited by long-lasting ramp pulses. The t-BHP-induced increase of I-Na(NI) was reversed by a further application of riluzole (10 mu M) or oxcarbazepine (10 mu M). When I-Na was elicited by simulated waveforms of action potentials (APs), during exposure to t-BHP, the amplitude of this inward current was diminished, accompanied by a reduction in inactivation/deactivation rate and an increase in current fluctuations. Under current-clamp recordings, addition of t-BHP (0.3 mM) enhanced AP firing in combination with clustering-like activity and sub-threshold membrane oscillations. In the simulation study, when the fraction of non-inactivating Na-v channels was elevated, the simulated window component of I-Na in response to a long-lasting ramp pulse was reduced; however, the persistent I-Na was markedly enhanced. Moreover, when simulated firing of APs was generated from a modeled neuron, changes of AP firing caused by the increased fraction of non-inactivating Nav channels used to mimic the t-BHP actions were similar to the experimental observations. Taken together, it is anticipated that the effects of oxidizing agents on I-Na(NI) could be an important mechanism underlying their neurotoxic actions in neurons or neuroendocrine cells occurring in vivo.

AB Purpose: To establish a fluorescence-based method to simultaneously assess micro-permeability and collagen cross-linking induced by chemical agents at the resin-dentin interface.
   Materials and Methods: Three chemical agents were investigated (proanthocyanidin-rich grape seed extract: GSE; carbodiimide hydrochloride/N-hydroxysuccinimide: EDC/NHS; glutaraldehyde: GD) along with a control (distilled water) as primers applied on flat occlusal dentin surfaces of 48 teeth and restored with two commercially available etch-and-rinse adhesives. Resin-dentin interfaces were polished and infiltrated with rhodamine-B solution for confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis. Parameters were chosen that would allow acquisition of a simultaneous appearance of collagen and interfacial micro-permeability (rhodamine-B). Fluorescence emission intensity (FEI) was converted into numerals and values were calculated for each group. Data were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Scheffe's and multiple comparisons tests (alpha = 0.05). T-tests with Pearson correlations were used to investigate correlations between collagen cross-linking and micro-permeability.
   Results: The FEI of collagen was the highest for GD, followed by GSE, with no significant differences between EDC/NHS and the control group (p > 0.05). Micro-permeability was significantly affected by the adhesives (p < 0.05). Micro-permeability was the lowest for GSE groups, regardless of the adhesives (p < 0.001). Weak correlations were found between micro-permeability and collagen auto-fluorescence.
   Conclusions: Non-enzymatic collagen cross-linking induced by GSE and GD can be detected by increased collagen auto-fluorescence, and results in reduced interfacial micro-permeability. Increased collagen auto-fluorescence was correlated with fluorescent collagen cross-links and decreased micro-permeability at the resin-dentin interface. Collagen auto-fluorescence is a useful tool to detect auto-fluorescent exogenous cross links and their potential impact on the quality of the resin-dentin interface.

AB Using a top-down approach, an agent-based model was developed within NetLogo where cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers were composed of multiple agents to create deformable structures capable of exerting, reacting to, and transmitting mechanical force. At the beginning of the simulation, long fibers were randomly distributed and cross linked. Throughout the simulation, imposed rules allowed cells to exert traction forces by extending pseudopodia, binding to fibers and pulling them towards the cell. Simulated cells remodeled the fibrous matrix to change both the density and alignment of fibers and migrated within the matrix in ways that are consistent with previous experimental work. For example, cells compacted the matrix in their pericellular regions much more than the average compaction experienced for the entire matrix (696% versus 21%). Between pairs of cells, the matrix density increased (by 92%) and the fibers became more aligned (anisotropy index increased from 0.45 to 0.68) in the direction parallel to a line connecting the two cells, consistent with the "lines of tension" observed in experiments by others. Cells migrated towards one another at an average rate of similar to 0.5 cell diameters per 10,000 arbitrary units (AU); faster migration occurred in simulations where the fiber density in the intercellular area was greater. To explore the potential contribution of matrix stiffness gradients in the observed migration (i.e., durotaxis), the model was altered to contain a regular lattice of fibers possessing a stiffness gradient and just a single cell. In these simulations cells migrated preferentially in the direction of increasing stiffness at a rate of similar to 2 cell diameter per 10,000 AU. This work demonstrates that matrix remodeling and durotaxis, both complex phenomena, might be emergent behaviors based on just a few rules that control how a cell can interact with a fibrous ECM.

TI Detecting online auction shilling frauds using supervised learning
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Supervised fraud detection; Online auction fraud; Agent-based simulation
AB Online auction sites are a target for fraud due to their anonymity, number of potential targets and low likelihood of identification. Researchers have developed methods for identifying fraud. However, these methods must be individually tailored for each type of fraud, since each differs in the characteristics important for their identification. Using supervised learning methods, it is possible to produce classifiers for specific types of fraud by providing a dataset where instances with behaviours of interest are assigned to a separate class. However this requires multiple labelled datasets: one for each fraud type of interest. It is difficult to use real-world datasets for this purpose since they are difficult to label, often limited in size, and contain zero or multiple suspicious behaviours that may or may not be under investigation.
   The aims of this work are to: (1) demonstrate the approach of using supervised learning together with a validated synthetic data generator to create fraud detection models that are experimentally more accurate than existing methods and that is effective over real data, and (2) to evaluate a set of features for use in general fraud detection is shown to further improve the performance of the created detection models.
   The approach is as follows: the data generator is an agent-based simulation modelled on users in commercial online auction data. The simulation is extended using fraud agents which model a known type of online auction fraud called competitive shilling. These agents are added to the simulation to produce the synthetic datasets. Features extracted from this data are used as training data for supervised learning. Using this approach, we optimise an existing fraud detection algorithm, and produce classifiers capable of detecting shilling fraud.
   Experimental results with synthetic data show the new models have significant improvements in detection accuracy. Results with commercial data show the models identify users with suspicious behaviour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spin market model [S. Bornholdt, Int. J. Mod. Phys. C 12 (2001) 667] is generalized by employing co-evolutionary principles, where strategies of the interacting and competitive traders are represented by local and global couplings between the nodes of dynamic directed stochastic network. The co-evolutionary principles are applied in the frame of Bak-Sneppen self-organized dynamics [P. Bak, K. Sneppen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 71 (1993) 4083] that includes the processes of selection and extinction actuated by the local (node) fitness. The local fitness is related to orientation of spin agent with respect to the instant magnetization. The stationary regime is formed due to the interplay of self-organization and adaptivity effects. The fat tailed distributions of log-price returns are identified numerically. The non-trivial model consequence is the evidence of the long time market memory indicated by the power-law range of the autocorrelation function of volatility with exponent smaller than one. The simulations yield network topology with broad-scale node degree distribution characterized by the range of exponents 1.3 < gamma(in) < 3 coinciding with social networks. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Residential Location Choice (RLC) and Real Estate Price(REP) have been considered as highly correlated and therefore have been jointly studied. This paper develops an agent-based RLC-REP joint model as a key component of an integrated land use-transport model, SelfSim. RLC-REP is capable of simultaneously simulating purchasing, renting and investing behaviour, considering the interactions and competitions between different agent types in the housing market, including renter, landlord, purchaser, seller and investor agents, resulting in new residential locations and real estate prices. In addition, the demographic evolution model in SelfSim that is directly linked to the RLC-REP model is also introduced. Next, both global and local sensitivity analyses (SAs), which employ the Elementary Effect Method (EEM) and Once-At-A-Time (OAT) Method, respectively, are carried out to fully test RLC-REP in a numerical example set up based on a Chinese medium-sized city, Baoding. The EEM-based global SAs identify four influential parameters (among the thirty-four) that could significantly influence the outputs of interests. The OAT-based local SAs further explore how these four important parameters influence the outputs, suggesting that the interactions between parameters could heavily influence the model sensitivity. Finally, the potential applications of the SA results to calibrate the model and to set up "what-if" scenarios are discussed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This study evaluated the influence of irradiation on dentin bond strength. Sixty irradiated and 60 non-irradiated human third molars were used. The irradiation dose of 60 Gy was fractionally applied over 6 weeks (2 Gy day(-1), 5 days week(-1)). All teeth were prepared in a special manner allowing the simulation of intra-pulpal pressure and dentin perfusion. Dentin specimens with a thickness of 2.0 mm. were obtained under standardized conditions. The specimens were randomly assigned to four experimental groups. Tensile bond strength of four different dentin bonding agents (Scotchbond(TM) 1, Solobond Plus(R), Prime&Bond(TM) 2.1 and Syntac(R)) was evaluated using an Instron Universal testing machine. Pairwise comparison did not show any significant differences between the irradiated and non-irradiated groups. The influence of the different dentin adhesives was significant (P = 0.0001; ANOVA). Compared with Solobond Plus' and Prime&Bond(TM) 2.1, the use of Scotchbond(TM) 1 resulted in a significantly higher tensile bond strength in non-irradiated specimen (P < 0.05; closed test procedure based on Kruskal-Wallis test). within the limitations of an in vitro study, it can be concluded that adhesive restoration procedures can be successfully used in patients irradiated for cancer of the head and neck.

AB BACKGROUND: This work evaluates hollow fiber liquid-liquid membrane contactors (HFMC) as a polishing step for the removal of low levels of ammonium from water purified by (or being supplied to) a membrane distillation unit in order to fulfil the conductivity requirements of hydrogen production by water electrolysis.
   RESULTS: The influence of the operating conditions (flow, pH, ammonium concentration, buffer capacity) were evaluated under a closed-loop setup in order to achieve a reduction of total ammonia concentration in water, from 15 to 1 mg L-1 to assure the production of water in the membrane distillation with a conductivity lower than 1 mu S cm(-1). These values were used to validate a numerical algorithm describing the system performance. In order to reach the ammonia concentration requirements and considering the low concentration of bicarbonate (low pH buffer capacity) in the treated water a buffer agent was added to the working solution.
   CONCLUSIONS: HFMC technology is a suitable solution to remove low levels of ammonium from water to values as low as 1mgL(-1)NH(3) through appropriate control of pH. The ammonium removal efficiency of the HFMC was improved by raising the pH or the flow rate. Finally, the model proposed provides a good description of the membrane contactor performance with minimal deviations when compared with experimental results. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Background. Combination antimicrobial therapy is clinically used as a last-resort strategy to control multidrugresistant bacterial infections. However, selection of antibiotics is often empirical, and conventional assessment of combined drug effect has not been correlated to clinical outcomes. Here, we report a quantitative method to assess combined killing of antimicrobial agents against 2 multidrug-resistant bacteria.
   Methods. Combined time-kill studies were performed using clinically achievable concentrations for each 2-agent combination against clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacterial burden observed at 24 h was mathematically modeled using a 3-dimensional response surface. Subsequently, a neutropenic murine pneumonia model with simulated clinical dosing exposures was used to validate our quantitative assessment of combined killing.
   Results. Different antimicrobial combinations were found to have varying efficacy against the multidrugresistant bacteria. As predicted by our quantitative method, cefepime plus amikacin was found to be the most superior combination, which was evidenced by a reduction in tissue bacterial burden and prolonged survival of infected animals.
   Conclusions. The consistency between the predictions of the mathematical model and in vivo observations substantiated the robustness of our quantitative method. These data highlighted a novel and promising method to guide rational selection of antimicrobial combination in the clinical setting.

AB Despite an increasing recognition that human activity is currently the dominant force modifying landscapes, and that this activity has been increasing through the Holocene, there has been little integrative work to evaluate human interactions with geomorphic processes. We argue that agent-based models (ABMs) are a useful tool for overcoming the limitations of existing, highly empirical approaches. In particular, they allow the integration of decision-making into process-based models and provide a heuristic way of evaluating the compatibility of knowledge gained from a wide range of sources, both within and outwith the discipline of geomorphology. The application of ABMs to geomorphology is demonstrated from two different perspectives. The SPASIMv1 (Special Protection Area SIMulator version 1) model is used to evaluate the potential impacts of land-use change particularly in relation to wildfire and subsequent soil conditions, runoff and erosion - over a decadal timescale from the present day to the mid-twenty-first century. It focuses on the representation of farmers with traditional versus commercial perspectives in central Spain, and highlights the importance of land-tenure structure and historical contingencies of individuals' decision-making. CYBEROSION, however, considers changes in erosion and deposition over the scale of at least centuries. It represents both wild and domesticated animals and humans as model agents, and investigates the interactions of them in the context of early agriculturalists in southern France in a prehistoric context. We evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the ABM approach, and consider some of the major challenges. These challenges include potential process-scale mismatches, differences in perspective between investigators from different disciplines, and issues regarding model evaluation, analysis and interpretation. If the challenges can be overcome, this fully integrated approach will provide geomorphology a means to conceptualize soundly the study of human landscape interactions by bridging the gap between social and physical approaches.

ID UNIT-ROOT
AB This paper presents a new stochastic asset pricing model in a context of bounded rationality, where beliefs about future prices are formed via an expectations updating rule characterized by a stochastic multiplicative random variable, working as an agent-based time dependent weight of the conditional expectation of the fundamental. The agent's belief about future prices depends on his confidence in the forecasts made by other agents, measured by the distribution type of agents and by a confidence parameter. The resulting stochastic dynamical system is firstly analyzed in a deterministic setting, deriving conditions for uniqueness and stability of steady states and proving that, for high values of the confidence parameter, no complicated dynamics can be exhibited, hence the new component has a stabilizing effect on the qualitative dynamics. Differently, for small values of the confidence parameter, we prove the existence of a stability region in the parameters plane where the only possible dynamics is convergence to a steady state, while complexity is exhibited outside such region. Starting from the results obtained in the deterministic case, the model is then explored by reintroducing randomness. More specifically, we analyze the stability region in three directions: first of all, a robust estimate of the stability region's measure is provided; second, a long run equilibrium relation between the parameters of the system is obtained; third, the persistence properties of the series describing the bifurcation curves is performed. We finally underline some economic implications.

AB Climate change and the efficient use of freshwater for irrigation pose a challenge for sustainable agriculture. Traditionally, the prediction of agricultural production is carried out through crop-growth models and historical records of the climatic variables. However, one of the main flaws of these models is that they do not consider the variability of the soil throughout the cultivation area. In addition, with the availability of new information sources (i.e., aerial or satellite images) and low-cost meteorological stations, it is convenient that the models incorporate prediction capabilities to enhance the representation of production scenarios. In this work, an agent-based model (ABM) that considers the soil heterogeneity and water exchanges is proposed. Soil heterogeneity is associated to the combination of individual behaviours of uniform portions of land (agents), while water fluxes are related to the topography. Each agent is characterized by an individual dynamic model, which describes the local crop growth. Moreover, this model considers positive and negative effects of water level, i.e., drought and waterlogging, on the biomass production. The development of the global ABM is oriented to the future use of control strategies and optimal irrigation policies. The model is built bottom-up starting with the definition of agents, and the Python environment Mesa is chosen for the implementation. The validation is carried out using three topographic scenarios in Colombia. Results of potential production cases are discussed, and some practical recommendations on the implementation are presented.

AB The enzyme organophosphorous hydrolase (OPH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of a wide variety of organophosphorous Compounds with high catalytic efficiency and broad substrate specificity. The immobilization of OPH in functionalized mesoporous Silica (FMS) surfaces increases significantly its catalytic specific activity, as compared to the enzyme ill Solution, with important applications for the detection and decontamination of insecticides and chemical warfare agents. Experimental measurements of immobilization efficiency as a function of the charge and coverage percentage of different functional groups have been interpreted as electrostatic forces being the predominant interactions underlying the adsorption of OPH onto FMS Surfaces. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations have been performed for OPH in bulk Solution and adsorbed onto two distinct interaction potential models of the FMS functional groups to investigate the relative contributions of nonbonded interactions to the conformational dynamics and adsorption of the protein. Our results support the Conclusion that electrostatic interactions are responsible for the binding of OPH to the FMS surface. However, these results also show that van der Waals forces are detrimental for interfacial adhesion. In addition, it is found that OPH adsorption onto the FMS models favors a protein conformation whose active site is fully accessible to the Substrate, in Contrast to the unconfined protein.

AB Simple expressions are derived for the development of monomer conversion, as well as propagating radical, adduct radical, dormant chain, and dead chain concentrations in reverse addition-fragmentation transfer polymerization (RAFT). The relations for the profiles of propagating radical concentration and conversion versus time are derived and depend on group parameters of rate constants and chemical recipe. The analytical equations are verified against numerical solutions of the mass-balance differential equations. This derivation involves the steady-state hypothesis for radical and RAFT agent concentrations. The errors introduced by these assumptions are negligible when the fragmentation rate constant, k(f), is higher than 10 s(-1) or when the cross-termination rate constant, k(ct), is higher than 10(5) L.mol(-1) s(-1).

AB This paper estimates a structural model of optimal life-cycle consumption expenditures in the presence of realistic labor income uncertainty. We employ synthetic cohort techniques and Consumer Expenditure Survey data to construct average age-profiles of consumption and income over the working lives of typical households across different education and occupation groups. The model fits the profiles quite well. In addition to providing reasonable estimates of the discount rate and risk aversion, we find that consumer behavior changes strikingly over the life cycle. Young consumers behave as buffer-stock agents. Around age 40, the typical household starts accumulating liquid assets for retirement and its behavior mimics more closely that of a certainty equivalent consumer. Our methodology provides a natural decomposition of saving and wealth into its precautionary and life-cycle components.

AB Hog producers' operational decisions can be informed by an awareness of risks associated with emergent and endemic diseases. Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) have been re-occurring every year since the first onset in 2013 with substantial losses across the hog production supply chain. Interestingly, a decreasing trend in PEDv incidence is visible. We assert that changes in human behaviors may underlie this trend. Disease prevention using biosecurity practices is used to minimize risk of infection but its efficacy is conditional on human behavior and risk attitude. Standard epidemiological models bring important insights into disease dynamics but have limited predictive ability. Since research shows that human behavior plays a driving role in the disease spread process, the explicit inclusion of human behavior into models adds an important dimension to understanding disease spread. Here we analyze PEDv incidence emerging from an agent-based model (ABM) that uses both epidemiological dynamics and algorithms that incorporate heterogeneous human decisions. We investigate the effects of shifting fractions of hog producers between risk tolerant and risk averse positions. These shifts affect the dynamics describing willingness to increase biosecurity as a response to disease threats and, indirectly, change infection probabilities and the resultant intensity and impact of the disease outbreak. Our ABM generates empirically verifiable patterns of PEDv transmission. Scenario results show that relatively small shifts (10% of the producer agents) toward a risk averse position can lead to a significant decrease in total incidence. For significantly steeper decreases in disease incidence, the model's hog producer population needed at least 37.5% of risk averse. Our study provides insight into the link between risk attitude, decisions related to biosecurity, and consequent spread of disease within a livestock production system. We suggest that it is possible to create positive, lasting changes in animal health by nudging the population of livestock producers toward more risk averse behaviors. We make a case for integrating social and epidemiological aspects in disease spread models to test intervention strategies intended to improve biosecurity and animal health at the system scale.

TI Learning by failure vs learning by habits Entrepreneurial learning

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explain the emergence of collaboration networks in entrepreneurial clusters as determined by the way entrepreneurs exchange knowledge and learn through business transactions needed to implement temporary supply chains in networks of co-located firms.
   Design/methodology/approach - A socio-computational approach is adopted to model business transactions and supply chain formation in Marshallian industrial districts (IDs). An agent-based model is presented and used as a virtual lab to test the hypotheses between the firms' behaviour and the emergence of structural properties at the system level.
   Findings - The simulation findings and their validation based on the comparison with a real world cluster show that the topological properties of the emerging network are influenced by the learning strategies and decisionmaking criteria firms use when choosing partners. With reference to the specific case of Marshallian IDs it is shown that inertial learning based on history and past collaboration represents in the long term a major impediment for the emergence of hubs and of a network topology that is more conducive to innovation and growth.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper offers an alternative view of entrepreneurial learning (EL) as opposed to the dominant view in which learning occurs as a result of exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure). The results presented in this work show that adaptive, situated, and day-by-day learning has a profound impact on the performance of entrepreneurial clusters. These results are encouraging to motivate additional research in areas such as in modelling learning or in the application of the proposed approach to the analysis of other types of entrepreneurial ecosystems, such as start-up networks and makers' communities.
   Practical implications - Agent-based model can support policymakers in identifying situated factors that can be leveraged to produce changes at the macro-level through the identification of suitable incentives and social networks re-engineering.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a novel perspective on EL and offers evidence that micro-learning strategies adopted and developed in routine business transactions do have an impact on firms' performances (survival and growth) as well as on systemic performances related to the creation and diffusion of innovation in firms networks.

ID HIERARCHICAL LEADERSHIP; ASYMPTOTIC FLOCKING; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS
AB In this paper, we consider the flocking problem of modified continuous-time and discrete-time Cucker-Smale models where every agent has its own intrinsic dynamics with Lipschitz property. The dynamics of the models are governed by the interplay between agents' own intrinsic dynamics and Cucker-Smale coupling dynamics. Based on the explicit construction of Lyapunov functionals, we show that conditional flocking would occur. And then we study the relationship between the Lipschitz constant L of the intrinsic dynamics and exponent beta measuring the strength of the interaction between agents when flocking occurs. We also give two examples to show flocking might not occur for enough large L or unconditionally for beta > 0. At last, we provide several numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results.

AB Public policymakers and managers use collaborative governance processes strategically to involve relevant stakeholders in developing plans, designing programs, and implementing policies. Although intuitive and normatively popular, such deliberative processes pose a tension between the prospective benefits of broader involvement (both instrumental benefits such as information and support for implementation and normative benefits related to representation) and the challenges of reaching agreements amongst disparate stakeholders. This paper builds upon empirical studies of complex policy networks to explore what happens when a public official initiates a collaborative governance process within a policy network. We use agent-based modeling (ABM) to simulate the impact of process attributes, such as how many people are involved, how invitees are selected, and the presence of difficult participants, within different network contexts, including network size, policy uncertainty, and preference distributions. This simulation-based approach does not rely upon survey instruments or subjective responses, and thereby complements existing empirical studies of collaborative governance. ABM provides a platform to explore the implications of key network assumptions, test different initiation strategies, model emergent properties resulting from inter-actor deliberation, and simulate long-run outcomes. Our results show how network and system conditions modulate the impact of group convening and design strategies. More generally, we demonstrate how ABM can be used to examine potential collaborative governance outputs under different design choices and network contexts when large data sets are unavailable.

AB Modelling and simulating the traffic of heavily used but secure environments such as seaports and airports are of increasing importance. Errors made when simulating these environments can have long standing economic, social and environmental implications. This article discusses issues and problems that may arise when designing a simulation strategy. Data for the Port is presented, methods for lightweight vehicle assessment that can be used to calibrate and validate simulations are also discussed along with a diagnosis of overcalibration issues. We show that decisions about where the intelligence lies in a system has important repercussions for the reliability of system statistics. Finally, conclusions are drawn about how microsimulations can be moved forward as a robust planning tool for the 21st century. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this work, a simultaneous optimization by phase compatibilization of four mechanical proprieties (flexural and tensile moduli, impact strength, and tensile stress at yield) of natural fiber/plastic composites was performed with respect to raw materials cost. In particular, a recycled resin of postconsumer origin (blend of high density polyethylene and polypropylene) with flax fibers was extruded with an additives package: a coupling agent (maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene) and an impact modifier (maleic anhydride grafted ethylene octene metallocene copolymer) to improve the interface between each phase. Then, the compounds were injection molded and tested. The analysis was performed according to a Box-Behnken experimental design to study the effect of fiber concentration, total additives concentration, and impact modifier fraction in the additives package. The optimization process required three steps: to model the relationships between mechanical properties and selected factors by a multiple linear regression analysis, to identify the potentially optimum conditions using the desirability function approach (Derringer-Suich and Ch'ng et al.), and to determine the best composite composition (optimum condition) by a comparative analysis of the material quality/cost ratios.

AB Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have received interest as an attractive reinforcing agent metal matrix composites regarded as an increase to mechanical properties of the final product. Aluminum/carbon nanotubes (Al/CNTs) nanocomposites were observed with different raw material at the optimized experimental condition. In this study, Al-based CNTs composites were three different samples, including un-milled Al, un-milled Al with CNTs, and milled Al with CNTs nanocomposites in the presence of additional CNTs with various experimental conditions while using a traditional ball mill (TBM). The particle morphology and CNT dispersions of milled composites were respectively analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and the mechanical properties of the fabricated composites were tested. In each sample, CNTs were well dispersed on the surface of Al powder at different experimental conditions for milling in a TBM. The Al/CNTs nanocomposites were processed by compacting, sintering and rolling process. The Vickers hardness was used to characterize the mechanical properties. The hardness of Al/CNTs nanocomposites that were fabricated with milled Al with CNT was higher than the reached to in the nanocomposites prepared with the use of un-milled Al with CNT nanocomposites. Therefore, the discrete element method (DEM) simulation was used to complete quantitative analysis. The flow pattern, impact force, and energy at various experimental conditions are considered. The results of the simulations are compared with experimental data.

AB Green turtle fibropapillomatosis (GTFP), characterized by multiple benign fibroepithelial tumors on the skin and eyes, has become a growing threat to green turtle Chelonia mydas populations worldwide. The cause of GTFP is unknown, but a viral etiology is suspected. This study investigated whether GTFP could be experimentally transmitted to young captive-reared green turtles using cell-free fibropapilloma extracts prepared from free-ranging turtles with spontaneous disease. Turtles raised from eggs collected from 4 separate clutches in the wild were assigned to 4 experimental groups and 1 control group. For each experiment a crude homogenate (33% w/v) was prepared from fibropapillomas removed from a free-ranging turtle with spontaneous disease. The crude tumor homogenates were freeze-thawed and centrifuged to yield cell-free extracts that were used (both filtered and unaltered) for inoculation. Recipients were inoculated by intradermal injection or by scarification; control turtles were not treated but were housed with treated turtles. Fibropapillomas developed in all 12 turtles receiving 3 of the 4 tumor extracts, and were first detected between 15 and 43 wk post inoculation. Both filtered and unfiltered tumor extracts successfully induced tumor development. During the 10 and 12 mo monitoring periods, fibropapillomas did not develop in control turtles or in any turtles inoculated with the fourth tumor extract. Although 2 sets of experiments were performed 8 wk apart, most of the tumors in both sets became evident simultaneously after water temperatures rose. Experimental tumors were histologically indistinguishable from spontaneous fibropapillomas found in free-living turtles but lacked evidence of endoparasites. Scattered foci of epidermal degeneration were found in most sections of experimentally induced fibropapillomas and within some sections taken from donor turtles. Electron microscopy revealed virus-like particles conforming in size, morphology, and intranuclear location with herpesvirus. Negative-staining electron microscopy of transmission-positive tumor extracts failed to demonstrate intact virus particles. This study demonstrates that the etiology of GTFP is an infectious filterable subcellular agent. The herpesvirus identified in this study is 1 possible candidate for the etiology of GTFP.

AB We report on the nonlinear reconstruction of local absorption and fluorescence contrast in tissuelike scattering media from measured time-domain diffuse reflectance and transmittance of laser as well as laser-excited fluorescence radiation. Measurements were taken at selected source-detector offsets using slablike diffusely scattering and fluorescent phantoms containing fluorescent heterogeneities. Such measurements simulate in vivo data that would be obtained employing a scanning, time-domain fluorescence mammograph, where the breast is gently compressed between two parallel glass plates, and source and detector optical fibers scan synchronously at various source-detector offsets, allowing the recording of laser and fluorescence mammograms. The diffusion equations modeling the propagation of the laser and fluorescence radiation were solved in frequency domain by the finite element method simultaneously for several modulation frequencies using Fourier transformation and preprocessed experimental data. To reconstruct the concentration of the fluorescent contrast agent, the Born approximation including higher-order reconstructed photon densities at the excitation wavelength was used. Axial resolution was determined that can be achieved by various detection schemes. We show that remission measurements increase the depth resolution significantly. (C) 2009 Optical Society of America

AB Gold nanoparticles functionalized with polyethylene glycol of different chain lengths are used to determine the influence of the capping layer thickness on the radiosensitizing effect of the particles. The size variations in organic coating, built up with polyethylene glycol polymers of molecular weight 1-20 kDa, allow an evaluation of the decrease in dose enhancement percentages caused by the gold nanoparticles at different radial distances from their surface. With localized eradication of malignant cells as a primary focus, radiosensitization is most effective after internalization in the nucleus. For this reason, we performed controlled radiation experiments, with doses up to 20 Gy and particle diameters in a range of 5-30 nm, and studied the relaxation pattern of supercoiled DNA. Subsequent gel electrophoresis of the suspensions was performed to evaluate the molecular damage and consecutively quantify the gold nanoparticle sensitization. In conclusion, on average up to 58.4% of the radiosensitizing efficiency was lost when the radial dimensions of the functionalizing layer were increased from 4.1 to 15.3 nm. These results serve as an experimental supplement for biophysical simulations and demonstrate the influence of an important parameter in the development of nanomaterials for targeted therapies in cancer radiotherapy.

AB We discuss the potential for inert biopolymers existing in cells to play a role in regulating the macromolecular crowding effect via their ability to undergo shape changing structural transitions. We have explored this possibility by the use of theory and experiment. The theoretical component utilized Monte-Carlo based simulations to examine the folding of a hypothetical protein in a concentrated environment of hard spheres which are themselves capable of reversible expansion and contraction. The experimental component of the study involved examination of the effect of different sized crowding agents on the thermally induced denaturation of cytochrome c [in phosphate buffered saline solution containing 1.0 M guanidinium hydrochloride at pH 7.0]. On the basis of our findings we suggest that in a crowded solution environment the presence of a non-reactive polymer capable of reversible expansion/contraction via folding and unfolding may alter the excluded volume component of the solution. This ability would confer on the non-reactive polymer a novel role in influencing other processes in solution affected by macromolecular crowding.

AB A new class of water-soluble C-60 transfecting agents has been prepared using Hirsch-Bingel chemistry and assessed for their ability to act as gene-delivery vectors in vitro. In an effort to elucidate the relationship between the hydrophobicity of the fullerene core, the hydrophilicity of the water-solubilizing groups, and the overall charge state of the C-60 vectors in gene delivery and expression, several different C-60 derivatives were synthesized to yield either positively charged, negatively charged, or neutral chemical functionalities under physiological conditions. These fullerene derivatives were then tested for their ability to transfect cells grown in culture with DNA carrying the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene. Statistically significant expression of GFP was observed for all forms of the C-60 derivatives when used as DNA vectors and compared to the ability of naked DNA alone to transfect cells. However, efficient in vitro transfection was only achieved with the two positively charged C-60 derivatives, namely, an octa-amino derivatized C-60 and a dodeca-amino derivatized C-60 vector. All C-60 vectors showed an increase in toxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Increased levels of cellular toxicity were observed for positively charged C-60 vectors relative to the negatively charged and neutral vectors. Structural analyses using dynamic light scattering and optical microscopy offered further insights into possible correlations between the various derivatized C-60 compounds, the C-60 vector/DNA complexes, their physical attributes (aggregation, charge) and their transfection efficiencies. Recently, similar Gd@C-60-based compounds have demonstrated potential as advanced contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thus, the successful demonstration of intracellular DNA uptake, intracellular transport, and gene expression from DNA using C-60 vectors Suggests the possibility of developing analogous Gd@C-60-based vectors to serve simultaneously as both therapeutic and diagnostic agents.

AB A highly sensitive sensor for determination of carbamate pesticides based rhodamine B (RB) modified silver nanoparticle (RB-AgNPs) was developed. Compared with the classical method, it combined colorimetric with fluorescence for detecting carbamate pesticides in complex solutions. Carbamate pesticides can inhibit the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), thus preventing the generation of thiocholine. On the other hand, thioncholine can transform the yellow RB-AgNPs solutions gray color and unquenches the fluorescence of RB simultaneously. Once the activity of AChE was inhibited by the pesticide, the color of the RB-AgNPs solution remains yellow and the fluorescence of RB molecules remains quenched. Under optimized experimental conditions, carbaryl was detected in a concentration range from 0.1 ng/L to 8.0 ng/L with a detection limit of 0.023 ng/L (it was detected by fluorescence spectra). This simple method is suitable for determination of carbamate pesticides in complex samples, such as tomato, apple and river water.

AB Background and Objectives: Malignant tumors of various abdominal organs are blamed to be the cause of death in approximately 40% of cases per year in Western Europe. At the time of death, about half of them show peritoneal carcinomatosis which is considered an unfavorable prognostic factor. In case of peritoneal carcinomatosis, there is no curative treatment available for any of the tumors in the abdominal cavity. The aim of this experimental study was to evaluate the preventive potential of intraoperative or early postoperative local adminstration of gemcitabine into the abdominal cavity against peritoneal carcinomatosis.
   Methods: Peritoneal carcinomatosis was induced in male WAG rats (n = 18) by transfer of 5 x 10(6) cells of the adenocarcinoma cell line CC-531 via minilaparotomy carried out in all rats under general anesthesia. Thirty days after cell transfer, rats were sacrificed and peritoneal carcinomatosis was confirmed using histologic investigation in specimens obtained from the peritoneal site. Extension of this carcinomatosis was quantified by (i) counting tumor nodes per square centimeter (mean of several counts) and (ii) determining tumor weight (weight of the greater omentum plus the resected mesentery). Rats were subdivided into three groups (n = 6 per group): group 1 (controls); group 2, simultaneously with tumor cell transfer 24 mg/kg of gemictabine were administered into the abdominal cavity; group 3, postoperative intraperitoneal irrigation with 24 mg/kg of gemictabine was achieved via a previously implanted port-a-cath on days(d) 15, 21, and 27.
   Results: On the 30th postoperative day, all six animals of the control group showed extensive tumor growth at the peritoneum and greater omentum, indicating carcinomatosis. In contrast, none of the rats of group 2 revealed any traces of intraperitoneal tumor growth. While all rats of group 3 demonstrated intraperitoneal tumor growth, but early postoperative treatment with gemcitabine, however, resulted in a significant reduction of the number of tumor nodes and tumor weight in comparison with group 1 (controls).
   Conclusions: Immediate, i.e., simultaneous intraoperative application of a cytostatic agent such as gemcitabine into the abdominal cavity may completely prevent the generation of peritoneal carcinomatosis from occuring tumor cells, whereas early postoperative locoregional chemotherapy into the abdominal cavity can only reduce the severity of the peritoneal carcinomatosis.

AB Simultaneously integrating mesocrystalline stacking superstructures, porous nanosheets and defective oxygen vacancies (OVs) into BiOCl crystals is an available strategy to enhance the visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity. Herein, we report a facile etching agent-assisted hydrothermal approach to achieve one-pot fabrication of mesocrystalline BiOCl porous nanosheet stacking superstructures with defective OVs, which show high catalytic activities towards to the visible-light-driven degradation of organic dyes. The formation of stacking superstructure in a mesocrystalline BiOCl is responsibility for increasing the transport of charge carriers. Experimental results and theoretical calculations suggest that the presence of OVs is beneficial to tuning the energy band structure for the improvement of visible light harvesting, prolonging the lifetime and enhancing the oxidation activity of photogenerated charge carriers. Additionally, the porous morphology and thin nanosheet building block could supply abundant active sites for photocatalysis. This research might arouse in-depth investigations on the development of novel precursor-modified strategy for the synthesis of high-active BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I)-based photocatalysts.

AB Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with clinical signs of neuroinflammation and the central nervous system's demyelination. Numerous studies have identified the role of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) overexpression and the low level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) in MS pathogenesis. Guggulsterone (GST), an active component derived from 'Commiphora Mukul,' has been used to treat various diseases. Traditional uses indicate that GST is a suitable agent for anti-inflammatory action. Therefore, we assessed the therapeutic potential of GST (30 and 60 mg/kg) in ethidium bromide (EB) induced demyelination in experimental rats and investigated the molecular mechanism by modulating the JAK/STAT and PPAR-gamma receptor signaling. Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups (n = 6). EB (0.1%/10 mu l) was injected selectively in the intracerebropeduncle (ICP) region for seven days to cause MS-like manifestations. The present study reveals that long-term administration of GST for 28 days has a neuroprotective effect by improving behavioral deficits (spatial cognition memory, grip, and motor coordination) associated with lower STAT-3 levels. While elevating PPAR-gamma and myelin basic protein levels in rat brains are consistent with the functioning of both signaling pathways. Also, GST modulates the neurotransmitter level by increasing Ach, dopamine, serotonin and by reducing glutamate. Moreover, GST ameliorates inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1 beta), and oxidative stress markers (AchE, SOD, catalase, MDA, GSH, nitrite). In addition, GST prevented apoptosis, as demonstrated by the reduction of caspase-3 and Bax. Simultaneously, Bcl-2 elevation and the restoration of gross morphology alterations are also recovered by long-term GST treatment. Therefore, it can be concluded that GST may be a potential alternative drug candidate for MS-related motor neuron dysfunctions.

AB The capture Of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, particularly in coal-fired power plants, represents a critical component of efforts aimed at stabilizing greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. Alkanolamines have traditionally been used to this end; however, drawbacks such as volatility, degradation, and regeneration costs have been drivers for the development of new, superior technologies. Recently, several seminal studies with ionic liquids (ILs), both experimental and computational, have demonstrated their potential as CO2 capture agents. In traditional ILs, experimental studies with CO2 have revealed its unusually high physical solubility in these media. Complementary simulation studies have provided evidence that this is attributable to CO2 occupying void space within the liquid and favorably interacting with the anion. Recently, a series of second-generation task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs) containing amine functional groups have been synthesized and demonstrated to have much higher capacities for CO2 due to their reactivity with CO2, as well unusually high viscosities in both the neat and complexed states. The current work extends the seminal studies Of CO2 capture with ILs by providing insight from simulations into the mechanism responsible for the dramatic increase in viscosity upon complexation. Simulations conclusively demonstrate that the slow translational and rotational dynamics, which are manifest in the high viscosity, may be attributable to the formation of a strong, pervasive hydrogen-bonded network. Serniquantitative estimates of the cation and anion self-diffusion coefficients and rotational time constants, as well as detailed hydrogen bond analysis, are consistent with the experimentally observed formation of glassy or gel-like materials upon contact with CO2. This has significant implications for the design of new approaches or materials involving ILs that take advantage of these preconceived limitations, in the synthesis or manipulation of new TSIL frameworks for CO2 capture, and in novel experimental studies of chemistries and dynamics in persistent heterogeneous environments.

AB A simulation of simultaneous bubble nucleation and growth was performed for a batch physical foaming process of polypropylene (PP)/CO2 system under finite pressure release rate. In the batch physical foaming process, CO2 gas is dissolved in a polymer matrix under pressure. Then, the dissolved CO2 in the polymer matrix becomes supersaturated when the pressure is released. A certain degree of supersaturation produces CO2 bubbles in the polymer matrix. Bubbles are expanded by diffusion of the dissolved CO2 into the bubbles. The pressure release rate is one of the control factors determining number density of bubbles and bubble growth rate.
   To study the effect of pressure release rate on foaming, this paper developed a simple kinetic model for the creation and expansion of bubbles based on the model of Flumerfelt's group, established in 1996 [Shafi, M.A., Lee, J.G., Flumerfelt, R.W., 1996. Prediction of cellular structure in free expansion polymer foam processing. Polymer Engineering and Science 36, 1950-1959]. It was revised according to the kinetic experimental data on the creation and expansion of bubbles under a finite pressure release rate. The model involved a bubble nucleation rate equation for bubble creation and a set of bubble growth rate equations for bubble expansion. The calculated results of the number density of bubbles and bubble growth rate agreed well with experimental results. The number density of bubbles increased with an increase in the pressure release rate. Simulation results indicated that the maximum bubble nucleation rate is determined by the balance between the pressure release rate and the consumption rate of the physical foaming agent by the growing bubbles. The bubble growth rate also increased with an increase in the pressure release rate. Viscosity-controlled and diffusion-controlled periods exist between the bubble nucleation and coalescence periods.

AB DMXAA (5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid), a novel anti-tumour agent currently undergoing clinical evaluation, appears to mediate its anti-tumour effects through immune modulation and the production of the cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). Our previous studies have shown that thalidomide, a potent inhibitor of TNF biosynthesis that has numerous biological effects, including inhibition of tumour angiogenesis, unexpectedly augments the anti-tumour response in mice to DMXAA. We show here that thalidomide (100 mg kg(-1)) has no effect when administered with inactive doses of DMXAA, and that it must be given simultaneously with an active dose of DMXAA to have its maximum potentiating effect on the growth of the murine Colon 38 adenocarcinoma. To address the issue of whether inhibition of serum TNF production is important for potentiation of anti-tumour activity, we have tested three potent analogues of thalidomide. All three analogues, when cc-administered with DMXAA to mice at doses lower than those used with thalidomide, inhibited TNF production and were effective in potentiating the anti-tumour activity of DMXAA against transplanted Colon 38 tumours. One of the analogues, N-phenethyltetrafluorophthalimide, was 1000-fold more potent than thalidomide and at a dose of 0.1 mg kg(-1) in combination with DMXAA (30 mg kg(-1)) cured 100% of mice, compared with 67% for the group treated with DMXAA alone. We also tested pentoxifylline and found it to suppress TNF production in response to DMXAA and to potentiate the anti-tumour effect of DMXAA. The results are compatible with the hypothesis that pharmacological reduction of serum TNF levels might benefit the anti-tumour effects of DMXAA and suggest new strategies for therapy using this agent.

Potts model, a generalization of the Ising model to more than two components, is a model of interacting spins on a crystalline lattice which describes the interaction strength among the agents. We present numerical research in conjunction with statistical analysis and correlation analysis in an attempt to study the volatilities of financial time series. The fluctuation behavior of logarithmic returns of the proposed model is investigated by multiscale entropy and time-dependent intrinsic correlation. Furthermore, in order to obtain a robust conclusion, the daily returns of Shanghai Composite Index and Shenzhen Component Index are considered, and the comparisons of return behaviors between the simulation data and the actual data are exhibited.

AB Feeding is an essential behaviour for body maintenance in pigs and closely related to their growth and productivity performance. Mechanisms underlying feeding behaviour in pigs are still unclear. Understanding these mechanisms can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions among various factors affecting feeding behaviour and help to improve growth and productivity of pigs. The aim of this study was to increase our understanding of internal causation and development of short-term feeding patterns in a pig, and the relation between feeding patterns and productivity of a pig during the growth period. We developed a mechanistic simulation model that represents an individually housed growing pig. The model integrates knowledge from physiology and ethology, and combines growth with a behavioural decision model based on motivation. Combining growth with behaviour allowed exploring the development of a pig over time, in particular the causation of growth and feeding patterns over a 24h period and during the entire growing period. Physiological factors, affected by pig and feed characteristics, are important internal factors controlling feeding behaviour. Model output included short-term feeding behaviours in pigs (e.g. meal size, meal frequency and meal duration), and growth characteristics (e.g. energy use, body weight gain). The model yielded feeding patterns that were validated against empirical data. This modelling study provided insight in how growth and motivation explain the development of feeding patterns of an individually housed pig over time. Pig and feed characteristics affected the motivation to reach a desired level of daily feed intake. Without feeding restrictions, pigs adapted feeding patterns to reach this daily feed intake without affecting growth. The developed model is suitable to further study mechanisms underlying feeding behaviour and performance of group-housed pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Woodland resources provide livelihoods for millions of people in Africa. Concerns about the impact of human utilization of woodlands have led to vigorous debates on woodland degradation. Ecological and socio-economic empirical data and understanding of the socio-ecological system have been synthesized in an agent-based model (ABM) to explore different woodland management options for a dynamic, semi-arid region in Kenya. In our simulations we accounted for the impacts of drought frequency, charcoal price changes, improved management practices and taxation of charcoal for a 20-year period to assess woodland changes in a spatially explicit way and evaluate the numbers of actors that can benefit from charcoal harvesting as a livelihood option.
   The model is based on an agent typology derived from 150 household interviews that focused on livelihood strategies and decision-making processes. Furthermore, the model integrates knowledge from vegetation plots and focus group meetings. From the model simulations we learn that favorable prices, improved management and taxation do not directly have the anticipated impact on woodland resources, as the improved conditions lead to fewer constraints on involvement in charcoal making. This reduces the positive impacts of these measures on the woodland quality but, at the same time, allows a larger number of actors to benefit from charcoal harvesting. Results show a very strong decrease in woodland area under the base scenario thereby reducing possibilities for households to supplement their incomes with charcoal making. Increased droughts and low prices for charcoal lead to early depletion of woodlands and reduction in livelihood options. Taxation stabilizes the number of charcoal producers but does not stop the depletion of woodland area. Woodland loss can only be prevented by controlling the number of charcoal makers and the amount of charcoal harvesting.

Lett. 45:103-111, 1994; Levy et al. in Microscopic Simulation of Financial Markets: From Investor Behavior to Market Phenomena, Academic Press, San Diego, 2000) using the methods of kinetic theory and consists of a linear Boltzmann equation for the wealth distribution of the agents coupled with an equation for the price of the stock. From this model, under a suitable scaling, we derive a Fokker-Planck equation and show that the equation admits a self-similar lognormal behavior. Several numerical examples are also reported to validate our analysis.

AB Background: The maintenance of adequate tissue oxygenation during acute anemia depends on an increase in both cardiac output and tissue oxygen extraction. This study tested the hypothesis that anesthesia blunts the cardiac output response associated with acute normovolemic hemodilution.
   Methods: Forty patients undergoing major abdominal surgery were prospectively randomized to undergo acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) either awake (awake group, n = 20) or with fentanyl-nitrous oxide-isoflurane anesthesia (anesthetized group, n = 20). Radial and pulmonary artery catheters were placed in all patients. After hemodynamic measurements were taken, patients In the two groups underwent hemodilution to decrease their hemoglobin concentration from 13 to 8 g/dl. A total of 1,875 +/- 222 ml (mean +/- SD) of blood was collected and simultaneously replaced by the same volume of medium molecular weight hydroxyethylstarch in both groups.
   Results: In the awake group, ANH resulted in a significant increase in cardiac index (from 3.1 +/- 0.5 to 4.8 +/- 1.01 . min(-1) . m(-2)) related to both an increase in heart rate and stroke index. Oxygen delivery remained unchanged, but oxygen consumption increased significantly, resulting in an increase in oxygen extraction ratio. In the anesthetized group, ANH. resulted in a significantly smaller increase in cardiac index (from 2.3 +/- 0.5 to 3.1 +/- 0.71 . min(-1) . m(-2)) related solely to an increase in stroke index. Oxygen delivery decreased but oxygen consumption was maintained as oxygen extraction increased.
   Conclusions: Anesthesia significantly reduces the cardiac output response associated with ANH. This could be related to the effects of the anesthetic drugs on the autonomic and the cardiovascular systems.

ID ULTRAFAST COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION
AB A cubital intravenous iodine contrast agent enhancement is used to visualize coronary arteries using EBT. The quality of the coronary artery visualization however is limited by the nearly simultaneous approximation of CT values in coronary arteries and myocardial tissue. The objective of the study was to evaluate if "under real clinical circumstances" the lower iodine concentration and the dimeric based characteristic or iodixanol may effect the kinetic of the applied contrast agent and the visualization of coronary arteries studied noninvasively by EBT. A double-blind, randomized, parallel study was performed in 111 cardiac patients, using iodixanol 270 mg I/ml or iohexol 300 mg I/ml. The kinetics of contrast enhancement was studied in the flow mode measuring following parameters: mean arrival time and mean time to reach peak CT values in the pulmonary trunk, transit time from the pulmonary trunk to the aorta as well as mean and maximum CT values in the left ventricular chamber and in the myocardium with respect to the body mass index. The mean difference of CT values in the left ventricular chamber and the myocardium was calculated. The length of the visualized coronary arteries was assessed and the diagnostic quality of coronary artery visualization scored on a visual analogue scale. Although iodixanol was used with a Power iodine concentration than iohexol there was no significant statistical difference between both groups with respect to the diagnostic visualization and length assessment of the coronary arteries as well as in the mean difference of CT values in the left ventricular chamber and the myocardium. This means that the advantageous dimeric characteristics of iodixanol may be used to reduce the amount of applicated iodine in contrast agents without loss of diagnostic image quality and information.

AB Background: Hypodynamic septic shock is associated with a poor prognosis. The present randomized-controlled laboratory experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the vasodilatory peptide hormone adrenomedullin (ADM) is a useful agent to prevent and reverse the development of hypodynamic circulation in ovine endotoxaemia.
   Methods: Twenty-four healthy ewes were chronically instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and randomly allocated to either the control, treatment, or prophylaxis group (n = 8 each). After a baseline (BL) measurement in the healthy state, all sheep were subjected to a continuous endotoxin infusion started at 10 ng kg(-1) min(-1) and doubled every hour six times. After 4 h of endotoxin challenge, the treatment group received ADM (50 ng kg(-1) min(-1)) for the remaining 3 h of the experiment. The prophylaxis group received a simultaneous infusion of endotoxin and ADM (50 ng kg(-1) min(-1)) from the beginning to the end of the 7 h intervention period.
   Results: In the control and treatment groups, the ewes exhibited a hypodynamic circulation at 4 h (> 20% reduction in cardiac index, both P < 0.01 vs BL). Endotoxin also increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) and arterial lactate concentrations. Prophylactic infusion of ADM prevented the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension and hypodynamic circulation and thereby blunted the increase in arterial lactate concentrations. In the treatment group, ADM administration increased CI (P < 0.001) and reduced both MPAP (P = 0.023) and arterial lactate concentrations (P < 0.001 each at 7 h) when compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that exogenous ADM prevents and reverses hypodynamic circulation, attenuates pulmonary hypertension, and limits lactic acidosis in ovine endotoxaemia.

ID CELL NUCLEATION; THERMOPLASTIC FOAM; EXTRUSION; LIQUID
AB In this paper, we undertook an experimental and theoretical analysis of the pressure-drop behaviors of a batch foaming system with a visualization window that was designed for microcellular foaming simulation. A polystyrene (PS)-CO2 system was used in the experiment and analysis. The maximum pressure-drop rate achievable was 2.5 GPa/s from the designed system. Some experimental simulation results at high pressure-drop rates and at low pressure-drop rates are also discussed. We observed that the application of a higher pressure-drop rate results in a higher cell density (and, thereby, a smaller cell size) for plastic foams. This confirms that the pressure-drop rate is one of the most important parameters to control the cell density of plastic foams. In addition, the results show that the content of the blowing agent (CO2) dissolved into a given polymer has a significant effect on bubble nucleation and growth.

AB Purpose: To show the influence of retentive cavity, cavity wall preparation and different luting techniques on the fracture resistance of severely damaged teeth restored with adhesive core build-ups and monolithic zirconium crowns. Methods: Extracted molars were prepared with 2 mm ferrule height and divided into eleven groups (n = 8/group). In nine groups a retentive occlusal cavity with a width and depth of 1 or 2 mm was prepared. Two control groups without a retentive cavity were made. Zirconium crowns were manufactured. 48 copings were cemented with glass-ionomer cement (Ketac Cem), the others (n = 40) with adhesive resin cement (Panavia F 2.0). Artificial ageing was carried out in the following way: n = 88, thermocycling (10,000 cycles, 6 degrees C/60 degrees C), n = 80 chewing simulation (1,200,000 cycles, 64 N). The samples were tested for load at first damage and fracture load with non-axial force. For statistical analysis ANCOVA with post hoc, Bonferroni-adjusted t-test were used (p <= 0.05). Results: No differences between the tested cements were detected. Influence of the cavity wall thickness was significant (p = 0.001). Mostly, the samples with wall thickness of 2 mm showed better results. Both control groups (no cavity) showed results comparable to study groups with cavity. Conclusions: Retentive cavity is most likely not mandatory. However, if prepared, the cavity wall thickness is of higher importance than cavity depth. Glass-ionomer and adhesive resin cement are comparable for use with zirconia crowns.

TI Modeling of stochastic motion of bacteria propelled spherical microbeads
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS

ID MOTOR
AB This work proposes a stochastic dynamic model of bacteria propelled spherical microbeads as potential swimming microrobotic bodies. Small numbers of S. marcescens bacteria are attached with their bodies to surfaces of spherical microbeads. Average-behavior stochastic models that are normally adopted when studying such biological systems are generally not effective for cases in which a small number of agents are interacting in a complex manner, hence a stochastic model is proposed to simulate the behavior of 8-41 bacteria assembled on a curved surface. Flexibility of the flagellar hook is studied via comparing simulated and experimental results for scenarios of increasing bead size and the number of attached bacteria on a bead. Although requiring more experimental data to yield an exact, certain flagellar hook stiffness value, the examined results favor a stiffer flagella. The stochastic model is intended to be used as a design and simulation tool for future potential targeted drug delivery and disease diagnosis applications of bacteria propelled microrobots.

AB Background: HIV transmission among injecting and non-injecting drug users (IDU, NIDU) is a significant public health problem. Continuing propagation in endemic settings and emerging regional outbreaks have indicated the need for comprehensive and coordinated HIV prevention. We describe the development of a conceptual framework and calibration of an agent-based model (ABM) to examine how combinations of interventions may reduce and potentially eliminate HIV transmission among drug-using populations.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: A multidisciplinary team of researchers from epidemiology, sociology, geography, and mathematics developed a conceptual framework based on prior ethnographic and epidemiologic research. An ABM was constructed and calibrated through an iterative design and verification process. In the model, "agents" represent IDU, NIDU, and non-drug users who interact with each other and within risk networks, engaging in sexual and, for IDUs, injection-related risk behavior over time. Agents also interact with simulated HIV prevention interventions (e. g., syringe exchange programs, substance abuse treatment, HIV testing) and initiate antiretroviral treatment (ART) in a stochastic manner. The model was constructed to represent the New York metropolitan statistical area (MSA) population, and calibrated by comparing output trajectories for various outcomes (e. g., IDU/NIDU prevalence, HIV prevalence and incidence) against previously validated MSA-level data. The model closely approximated HIV trajectories in IDU and NIDU observed in New York City between 1992 and 2002, including a linear decrease in HIV prevalence among IDUs. Exploratory results are consistent with empirical studies demonstrating that the effectiveness of a combination of interventions, including syringe exchange expansion and ART provision, dramatically reduced HIV prevalence among IDUs during this time period.
   Conclusions/Significance: Complex systems models of adaptive HIV transmission dynamics can be used to identify potential collective benefits of hypothetical combination prevention interventions. Future work will seek to inform novel strategies that may lead to more effective and equitable HIV prevention strategies for drug-using populations.

AB Iron oxide nanoparticles are the most used magnetic nanoparticles in biomedical and biotechnological field because of their nontoxicity respect to the other metals. The investigation of iron oxide nanoparticles behaviour in aqueous environment is important for the biological applications in terms of polydispersity, mobility, cellular uptake and response to the external magnetic field. Iron oxide nanoparticles tend to agglomerate in aqueous solutions; thus, the stabilisation and aggregation could be modified tuning the colloids physical proprieties. Surfactants or polymers are often used to avoid agglomeration and increase nanoparticles stability. We have modelled and synthesised iron oxide nanoparticles through a co-precipitation method, in order to study the influence of surfactants and coatings on the aggregation state. Thus, we compared experimental results to simulation model data. The change of Z-potential and the clusters size were determined by Dynamic Light Scattering. We developed a suitable numerical model to predict the flocculation. The effects of Volume Mean Diameter and fractal dimension were explored in the model. We obtained the trend of these parameters tuning the Z-potential. These curves matched with the experimental results and confirmed the goodness of the model. Subsequently, we exploited the model to study the influence of nanoparticles aggregation and stability by Z-potential and external magnetic field. The highest Z-potential is reached up with a small external magnetic influence, a small aggregation and then a high suspension stability. Thus, we obtained a predictive model of Iron oxide nanoparticles flocculation that will be exploited for the nanoparticles engineering and experimental setup of bioassays.

AB Randomized clinical trials testing putative disease-modifying agents in Parkinson's disease (PD) have yielded controversial results that have not influenced evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of PD. We argue that the failure of these clinical trials may be linked to end point-based statistical analyses that must make prior assumptions about the magnitude and the time course of wash-in and wash-out of drug effects. Many of these shortcomings may be avoided with quantitative modeling of the entire time course of the clinical trial and examining evidence for three concomitant processes, disease progression, symptomatic drug effects and disease modifying effects. The power of this approach is illustrated by modeling of DATATOP and ELLDOPA trial data. (C) 2011 Movement Disorder Society

AB In this work we study a 3-state (+1, -1, 0) opinion model in the presence of noise and disorder. We consider pairwise competitive interactions, with a fraction p of those interactions being negative (disorder). Moreover, there is a noise q that represents the probability of an individual spontaneously change his opinion to the neutral state. Our aim is to study how the increase/decrease of the fraction of neutral agents affects the critical behavior of the system and the evolution of opinions. We derive analytical expressions for the order parameter of the model, as well as for the stationary fraction of each opinion, and we show that there are distinct phase transitions. One is the usual ferro-paramagnetic transition, that is in the Ising universality class. In addition, there are para-absorbing and ferro-absorbing transitions, presenting the directed percolation universality class. Our results are complemented by numerical simulations.

AB Although systems science has emerged as a set of innovative approaches to study complex phenomena, many topically focused researchers including clinicians and scientists working in public health are somewhat befuddled by this methodology that at times appears to be radically different from analytic methods, such as statistical modeling, to which the researchers are accustomed. There also appears to be conflicts between complex systems approaches and traditional statistical methodologies, both in terms of their underlying strategies and the languages they use. We argue that the conflicts are resolvable, and the sooner the better for the field. In this article, we show how statistical and systems science approaches can be reconciled, and how together they can advance solutions to complex problems. We do this by comparing the methods within a theoretical framework based on the work of population biologist Richard Levins. We present different types of models as representing different tradeoffs among the four desiderata of generality, realism, fit, and precision.

AB Molecular modeling and pharmacophore study has been performed on a series of 2-Substituted-1-naphthols derivatives with potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. Structural features responsible for the activity of the compounds were characterized by using physicochemical, topological, and electrotopological descriptors, calculated from the Molecular Design Suite Software (V-life MDS (TM) 3.5). The relationship developed between biological activity and electrostatic, steric, hydrophobicity parameters was explored to generate combinatorial library with various substitution. This library can be explored for the synthesis and study of future potential anti-inflammatory agent. The requirements for the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity are explored with 2D-QSAR, group based QSAR (G-QSAR), and k-nearest neighbour studies. The statistically significant 2D-QSAR model having r (2) = 0.8502 and q (2) = 0.8144 with pred_r (2) = 0.8072 and the best group based QSAR (G-QSAR) model having r (2) = 0.9137 and q (2) = 0.7808 with pred_r (2) = 0.8490 was developed by simulated annealing based partial least squares method. Further analysis using k-nearest neighbour 3D-QSAR technique identifies two models obtained by simulated annealing (SA) and genetic algorithm (GA)-based partial least squares methods leading to 5-lipoxygenase activity prediction. The best simulated annealing QSAR model showed q (2) = 0.8547, r (2) = 0.8963, and standard error = 0.3677. It was observed that steric properties predicted by k-nearest neighbour MFA contours can be related to 5-lipoxygenase activity. The predictive ability of the resultant model was evaluated using a test set molecules and the predicted r (2) = 0.8162. The best pharmacophore model with hydrophobic, hydrogen bond donor (HBD), and aromatic features has root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.5746. The QSAR model suggests that electron-withdrawing character is favorable for the 5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity. This suggests that electron-withdrawing groups like a chlorine or fluorine atoms at naphthol moiety are good for anti-inflammatory activity. In addition to the electron-withdrawing character, electron-donating groups, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond donor groups positively contribute to the 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. The results of 2D-QSAR, Group based QSAR, and k-nearest neighbour 3D-QSAR studies give detailed structural insights as well as highlights important binding features of these 2-Substituted-1-naphthols derivatives as anti-inflammatory agents which can provide guidance for the rational design of novel potent 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors.

AB Heat conductivity, curing rate and fatigue crack growth properties of carbon black-filled styrene butadiene rubber (SBR)/butadiene rubber (BR) blend that is frequently used in passenger car tire treads were simultaneously improved by a hybrid filler system of carbon black, high dispersible precipitated silica, modified layered silicate and ultra-light mixed filler of alumina and aluminum sulfate. An optimum formulation was obtained and a study of mechanisms governing composite properties has been performed according to the filler variables through the designing of experiments and the regression and statistical analysis and with the aid of composite characterization techniques such as dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and FE-SEM/EDX. Alumina could improve thermal conductivity, DeMatia crack growth, and the tensile strength of the rubber composite, along with relative maintenance of hardness and modulus. The effects of statistically significant interactions between silica and alumina on the abrasion behavior and thermal conductivity were observed, which was attributed to the presence of the silane coupling agent and the effect of modifying the alumina surface with the ethoxysilanes groups. The partial substitution of carbon black by high dispersible silica resulted in an increase in thermal diffusion coefficient, the improvement of heat buildup, resilience and DeMatia crack growth, and relative maintaining of tensile properties as well as a slight loss in abrasion and aging behavior of the tire tread composite. Through the increase of thermal diffusivity coefficient and a slightly improvement in the aging behavior, modified layered silicate (organoclay) caused a significant reduction in the optimum curing time of the tire tread composite. Some evidence has been provided for the interactions between modified layered silicate and silane coupling agent. The improvement in crack growth and thermal conductivity of the elastomer composite was attributed to smaller interparticle distances of hybrid filler system compared to those of carbon black filler system.

AB Operational Research models are well established as an effective tool for tackling a vast range of health care problems. Many of these models involve parameters which depend on human behaviour, and thus individuals' characteristics or personality traits should be included. In this paper we describe a discrete event simulation model of attendance for screening for diabetic retinopathy, a sight-threatening complication of diabetes. This model takes into account the physical states, emotions, cognitions and social status of the persons involved. The model also uses some ideas from the discipline of health psychology. We believe that this approach provides what is potentially a far more accurate method of modelling patients' attendance behaviour, compared with the standard approach of simple random sampling of patients. However, further empirical work is required, firstly to derive and validate more realistic forms of the model equations, secondly to select the appropriate psychological variables, and thirdly and inevitably to collect data.

ID EMERGENCE; CATEGORY; MODELS
AB To assess the effectiveness of a simulation-based approach to linguistic category evolution, a language evolution model is applied to the natural color categorizations of 108 linguistic communities from the World Color Survey (2009). This dynamic model is derived from Komarova et al. [J. Math. Psychol. 51, 359 (2007)] and evolves colornaming systems to a stable equilibrium through agent interactions. This simulation-based approach remedies the sparseness of empirical, diachronic data by broadly approximating evolutionary trends in an idealized form. Additionally, we present novel explorations of evaluating equilibrium stability and determining category boundaries. Results show that all 108 systems evolve to a stable equilibrium while maintaining key features of the original categorizations, suggesting that our simulations are a suitable representation of natural evolutionary processes. This approach can have valuable insights and implications for research where diachronic data are sparse. For example, on the linguistic debate between the Partition Hypothesis and an Alternative Hypothesis that asserts categories evolve by expanding their boundaries from fixed best exemplars, our analysis finds that the Alternative Hypothesis best explains the observed changes in the simulations of the World Color Survey language populations.

AB A QSAR analyses of 32 aminomethyl and acylaminomethyl substituents derivatives were carried out to interpret the relationship between structural properties and angiotensin II AT(1) receptor activity. Two-dimensional (2D-QSAR), Group-based (G-QSAR), 3D-QSAR, and pharmacophore mapping studies were performed using partial least square and k-nearest neighbor methodology coupled with various feature selection methods, viz. stepwise, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing (SA) to derive QSAR models which were further validated for statistical significance and predictive ability by internal and external validation. The activity contributions of whole compounds and their substituents were determined from regression equation. The statistically significant best 2D-QSAR model 1 having r(2) = 0.8754 and q(2) = 0.7231 with pred_r(2) = 0: 8389 was developed by GA-PLS with the descriptors like SdssCcount, SssNHcount and SaaaCcount. The best Group-based QSAR model-5 having r(2) = 0.7516 and q(2) = 0.6714 with pred r(2) - 0.7309 was developed by GA-PLS. The 2D-QSAR results agreed with those from the Group based QSAR model and suggested the structural features of SssOE-index, Mol.Wt and SssNHE-index functionality that would enhance the antihypertensive activity of the imidazole derivatives in this series. The results of two-dimensional, Group-based QSAR showed that a combination of topological indices, hydrophobic properties, and auto-correlation descriptors of different atomic properties could be explored to design potent antihypertensive agents. The k-nearest neighbor approach was used to generate three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models for these sets of molecules. The present study is an attempt in this direction seeking for the development and comparison of QSAR models of substituted imidazoles by different feature selection methods, which ultimately establishes the superiority of the GA-based models. Statistically genetic algorithm (GA) selection k-nearest neighbor (GA-kNN-MFA) model with respect to both the internal (q(2) = 0.7856) as well as external (pred_r(2) = 0.8193) model validation and correctly predicts the activity of calculated 78.56 % and calculated 81.93 % for the training and test set, respectively. Continuing with the series of substituted imidazoles derivatives, chemical feature-based pharmacophore models with lowest RMSD value (0.1397 angstrom), consisting of one aromatic carbon center, two hydrogen bond acceptor, and one hydrogen bond donor features, was developed. The information rendered by 2D-QSAR, Group-based QSAR, k-nearest neighbor, and pharmacophore identification models may lead to a better understanding of structural requirements of antihypertensive agents and can help in the design of novel potent molecules.

AB The optical clearing method has been widely used for different spectral ranges where it provides tissue transparency. In this work, we observed the enhanced penetration of the terahertz waves inside biological samples (skin, kidney, and cornea) treated with glycerol solutions inducing changes of optical and dielectric properties. It was supported by the observed trend of free-to-bound water ratio measured by the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) method. The terahertz clearing efficiency was found to be less for diabetic samples than for normal ones. Results of the numerical simulation proved that pulse deformation is due to bigger penetration depth caused by the reduction of absorption and refraction at optical clearing.

AB Bulletin Board Systems (BBSs) have demonstrated their usefulness in spreading information. In BBS forums, a few posts that address currently popular social topics attract a lot of attention, and different users are interested in many different discussion topics. We investigate topic cluster features and user interests of an actual BBS forum, analyzing user posting and replying behavior. According to the growing process of BBS, we suggest a network model in which each agent only replies to the posts that belong to its specific topics of interest. A post that is replied to will be immediately assigned the highest priority on the post list. Simulation results show that characteristics of our model are similar to those of the real BBS. The model with heterogeneous user interests promotes the occurrence of popular posts, and the user relationship network possesses a large clustering coefficient. Bursts and long waiting time exist in user replying behavior, leading to non-Poisson user activity pattern. In addition, the model produces an analogous evolving trend of Gini coefficients for posts' and clusters' participants as BBS forums.

AB We describe a prototype emergency response system. This dynamic data driven application system (DDDAS) uses wireless call data, including call volume, who calls whom, call duration, services in use, and cell phone location information. Since all cell phones (that are powered on) maintain contact with one or more local cell towers, location data about each phone is updated periodically and available throughout the cellular phone network. This permits the cell phones of a city to serve as an ad hoc mobile sensor net, measuring the movement and calling patterns of the population. Social network theory and statistical analysis on normal call activity and call locations establish a baseline. A detection and alert system monitors streaming summary cell phone call data. Abnormal call patterns or population movements trigger a simulation and prediction system. Hypotheses about the anomaly are generated by a rule-based system, each initiating an agent-based simulation. Automated dynamic validation of the simulations against incoming streaming data is used to test each hypothesis. A validated simulation is used to predict the evolution of the anomaly and made available to an emergency response decision support system.

AB Decisions involving the use of tools may require an agent to consider more levels of relational complexity than merely deciding between an immediate and a delayed option. Using a new experimental approach featuring two different types of tools, two apparatuses as well as two different types of reward, we investigated the Goffin cockatoos' ability to make flexible and profitable decisions within five different setups. Paralleling previous results in primates, most birds overcame immediate drives in favor of future gains; some did so even if tool use involved additional work effort. Furthermore, at the group level subjects maximized their profit by simultaneously considering both the quality of an immediate versus a delayed food reward (accessible with a tool) and the functionality of the available tool. As their performance levels remained stable across trials in all testing setups, this was unlikely the result of a learning effect. The Goffin cockatoos' ability to focus on relevant information was constrained when all task components (both food qualities, both apparatuses and both tools) were presented at the same time.

AB Objectives: This clinical study investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of gadobutrol, a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging extracellular contrast agent, in pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years.
   Materials and Methods: In this open-label, multicenter study, patients scheduled for routine contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the brain, spine, liver or kidney, or MR angiography received a single intravenous injection of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg/0.1 mL/kg). Patients were stratified by age groups (2-6, 7-11, and 12-17 years), Blood and urine samples were collected at prespecified time points and analyzed for gadolinium concentrations. Plasma data were evaluated by means of a nonlinear mixed effects model, and urine data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In addition, the safety of gadobutrol was evaluated.
   Results: A total of 130 patients (2-6 years, n = 45; 7-11 years, n = 39; 12-17 years, n = 46) were included in the final population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gadobutrol pharmacokinetics in children aged 2 to 17 years were adequately described by an open 2-compartment model with elimination from the central compartment. The median estimates (2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile) of body weight-normalized total body clearance (L/h/kg) per age group were 0.10 (0.051, 0.17) for all ages, 0.13 (0.09, 0.17) in the 2 to 6 year age group, 0.10 (0.05, 0.17) in the 7 to 11 year age group and 0.09 (0.05, 0.10) in the 12 to 17 year age group. The body weight-normalized median estimates of total volume of distribution (L/kg) were 0.20 (0.12, 0.28) for all ages, 0.24 (0.20, 0.28) in the 2 to 6 year age group, 0.19 (0.14, 0.23) in the 7 to 11 year age group and 0.18 (0.092, 0.23) in the 12 to 17 year age group. Median gadolinium plasma concentrations at 20 minutes postinjection were simulated using the population pharmacokinetic model and ranged from 414 (13 kg subject) to 518 mu mol/L (65 kg subject). Body weight was identified as the major covariate influencing the pharmacokinetic parameters of total body clearance and central volume of distribution. Age was not found to be an additional independent parameter. The median amount of renally excreted gadolinium was 77.0% of the administered dose within 6 hours postinjection, indicating that gadobutrol was renally excreted in this pediatric population aged 2 to 17 years. Gadobutrol was well tolerated, with drug-related adverse events of mild intensity reported for 8 (5.8%) of 138 patients.
   Conclusions: Observed differences in pharmacokinetics were attributed to body weight, with no additional independent effect of age. Thus, no dose adjustment from the standard dose of gadobutrol in adults based on body weight (0.1 mmol/kg) is necessary in pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years. Gadobutrol was safe and well tolerated in the pediatric population in this study.

AB BACKGROUND: There are numerous treatment approaches for sciatica. Previous systematic reviews have not compared all these strategies together.
   PURPOSE: To compare the clinical effectiveness of different treatment strategies for sciatica simultaneously.
   STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.
   METHODS: We searched 28 electronic databases and online trial registries, along with bibliographies of previous reviews for comparative studies evaluating any intervention to treat sciatica in adults, with outcome data on global effect or pain intensity. Network meta-analysis methods were used to simultaneously compare all treatment strategies and allow indirect comparisons of treatments between studies. The study was funded by the UK National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment program; there are no potential conflict of interests.
   RESULTS: We identified 122 relevant studies; 90 were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs. Interventions were grouped into 21 treatment strategies. Internal and external validity of included studies was very low. For overall recovery as the outcome, compared with inactive control or conventional care, there was a statistically significant improvement following disc surgery, epidural injections, nonopioid analgesia, manipulation, and acupuncture. Traction, percutaneous discectomy, and exercise therapy were significantly inferior to epidural injections or surgery. For pain as the outcome, epidural injections and biological agents were significantly better than inactive control, but similar findings for disc surgery were not statistically significant. Biological agents were significantly better for pain reduction than bed rest, nonopioids, and opioids. Opioids, education/advice alone, bed rest, and percutaneous discectomy were inferior to most other treatment strategies; although these findings represented large effects, they were statistically equivocal.
   CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, many different treatment strategies for sciatica have been compared in the same systematic review and meta-analysis. This approach has provided new data to assist shared decision-making. The findings support the effectiveness of nonopioid medication, epidural injections, and disc surgery. They also suggest that spinal manipulation, acupuncture, and experimental treatments, such as anti-inflammatory biological agents, may be considered. The findings do not provide support for the effectiveness of opioid analgesia, bed rest, exercise therapy, education/advice (when used alone), percutaneous discectomy, or traction. The issue of how best to estimate the effectiveness of treatment approaches according to their order within a sequential treatment pathway remains an important challenge. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Severe charge recombination and slow surface water oxidation kinetics seriously limit the practical application of ZnIn2S4 photoanodes for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Herein, an in situ strategy to introduce sulfate (SO42-) anions and controlled bulk sulfur vacancies (S-v) into a ZnIn2S4 photoanode is developed, and its PEC performance is remarkably enhanced, achieving a photocurrent density of 3.52 mA cm(-2) at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (V-RHE) and negatively shifted onset potential of 0.01 V-RHE in phosphate buffer without a sacrificial agent under AM 1.5G illumination. The experimental characterizations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the SO42- groups enhance the oxygen evolution reaction kinetics, while bulk S-v improves the bulk carrier separation. The remarkable bulk carrier separation efficiency of 75.01% and surface carrier injection efficiency of 79.69% are achieved at 1.23 V-RHE. This work provides a new route to design efficient photoanodes by the simultaneous manipulation of metal-free anions and sulfur vacancies.

AB We investigated the formation of UCx from UO2+x and graphite in situ using neutron diffraction at high temperatures with particular focus on resolving the conflicting reports on the crystal structure of nonquenchable cubic UC2. The agents were UO2 nanopowder, which closely imitates nano grains observed in spent reactor fuels, and graphite powder. In situ neutron diffraction revealed the onset of the UO2 + 2C -> UC + CO2 reaction at 1440 degrees C, with its completion at 1500 degrees C. Upon further heating, carbon diffuses into the uranium carbide forming C-2 groups at the octahedral sites. This resulting high temperature cubic UC2 phase is similar to the NaCl-type structure as proposed by Bowman et al. Our novel experimental data provide insights into the mechanism and kinetics of formation of UC as well as characteristics of the high temperature cubic UC2 phase which agree with proposed rotational rehybridization found from simulations by Wen et al.

AB A kinetic study of nitrate reduction by green rust (GR), a group of layered Fe(II)-Fe(III) hydroxide solids, was performed using a batch reactor system. The reduction rate of nitrate by GRs was affected by the anion content in the interlayer of GRs. GR containing F- (GR-F) showed the fastest reduction rate while GR-SO4 showed 9 times slower reaction rate than GR-F. The addition of 1 mM Pt or Cu to GR that contained 85 mM Fe(II) improved the reduction kinetics of nitrate by up to 200 times. Pt was an effective activating agent for all GRs. The sequential step reaction model that we proposed appropriately simulated the experimental data. The fastest nitrate reduction by GR-F with Pt was achieved at pH 9 among 7.5 to 11. At that condition, 1 mM nitrate transformed completely into ammonium within 23 min. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In a pure exchange economy, agents have the possibility of behaving strategically by putting only a part of their initial endowments on the market. An oligopoly equilibrium is defined to be a Nash equilibrium of the game in which agents choose simultaneously quantities to be put on the market. It is proved that under standard hypotheses, the oligopoly equilibrium leads to the competitive equilibrium when the economy is replicated an infinite number of times.

AB Theoretical methods are used to analyze the thermodynamics of ZSM-11 synthesis from amorphous silica and an aqueous solution of tetraalkylammonium hydroxide (TAAOH). The overall process is represented by the reaction 96SiO(2)(a) + n(TAA(+)/OH-/200H(2)O) = (nTAA(+)/Z(n-)) + 200nH(2)O. Both tetrapropylammonium (TPA(+)) and tetrabutylammonium (TBA(+)) cations are considered as the structure-directing agents, and calculations are performed for occlusion of either three or four TAA(+) cations per unit cell of the zeolite. Both estimates of the change in internal energy and Gibbs free energy reveal that the synthesis of ZSM-11 should be favored by the occlusion of three TBA(+) cations per unit cell, consistent with experimental observation. The present analysis also demonstrates the importance of energy and entropy changes associated with the dehydration of TAA(+) and OH- ions and with the occlusion of TAA(+) cations into the zeolite. The interactions of OH- anions with the zeolite framework to form defects in the form of siloxy (=SiO-) groups are also considered.

AB Background: Ivabradine is a pure heart rate lowering agent that acts by inhibiting I(f), an important ionic current involved in pacemaker activity in the cells of the sinoatrial node. In the 2012 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Heart Failure, it was recommended that patients with a persistently high heart rate, despite treatment with an evidence-based dose of a p-blocker, should be considered for treatment with ivabradine.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties and safety profile of ivabradine in healthy Chinese men.
   Methods: This Phase I, randomized, open-label, parallel-arm, single- and multiple-dose study was conducted at the Clinical Pharmacology Center of the Cardiovascular Institute and Fu Wai Hospital at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Healthy, nonsmoking volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups based on treatment with 5, 10 or 20 mg of ivabradine. After a single dose, the subjects assigned to the 3 dose groups received repeated oral doses of ivabradine BID for 6 days. The plasma concentrations of ivabradine were determined by using a HPLC-MS/MS method. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate measurements were taken, and ECG and Holter monitoring was performed. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study by physical and ophthalmologic examinations, vital signs measurement, laboratory analyses, and monitoring of adverse effects.
   Results: A total of 36 healthy Chinese men were enrolled in the study. After the single dose, plasma ivabradine C-max. and AUC increased approximately linearly with dosage, no statistically significant differences were found in t(1/2) or T-max between the dose groups. After multiple doses, there was no significant change in T-max compared with the results after a single dose. After repeated doses, t(1/2), C-max, and AUC increased significantly (P < 0.001). After a single dose, a significant reduction in heart rate at 2 hours' postdose was observed in the highest dose group, whereas after repeated doses, a significant reduction in heart rate was observed from 2 to 4 hours' postdose for all 3 groups. The mean (SD) heart rate after repeated doses decreased 12.5 (4.8), 12.4 (6.9), and 20.5 (5.8) beats/min for the 5-, 10-, and 20-mg dose groups, respectively. No clear trend in the changes in QTc, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, or respiration rate was observed. Ivabradine was well tolerated in these healthy Chinese men.
   Conclusions: The results of the study in a small population of healthy Chinese men suggest that the PK properties of ivabradine are linear with respect to dosing. After single and repeated oral administration of ivabradine, a significant decrease in heart rate was observed. Ivabradine appeared well tolerated in the population studied.

AB The inter-layer interactions and the possible arrangements of MWW-type layers were investigated computationally at the non-local density functional theory level. Powder XRD patterns were simulated for structures obtained computationally and compared with experimental data. The MCM-22P material corresponds to the layers bound with relatively strong hydrogen bonds between surface silanol groups that is an energetically preferred structure in the presence of a structure directing agent (hexamethyleneimine). The powder XRD pattern of MCM-56 is best matched for relatively disordered (in the ab plane) MWW layers that are partially condensed. The appearance of the powder XRD pattern in the 2 theta range of 7.5-10 degrees depends on the extent of interlayer condensation. The combination of density functional investigation of interactions between MWW layers together with simulation of powder XRD patterns brings atomistic insight into the inter-layer arrangement and better understanding of the effects responsible for the differences between various layered materials of the MWW family.

TI Optical property of nanocomposite of mesoporous silica thin films

SO CHINESE OPTICS LETTERS

ID MICROSCOPE LITHOGRAPHY; BEAM LITHOGRAPHY; NANOWIRES; ARRAYS
AB Amino-functionalized mesoporous silica thin films (MTFs) are produced using surface active agent F127, and then gold nanoparticles are introduced into the pore channels to prepare the Au/SiO(2) nanocomposite. After assembling the gold, the amino-functionalized MTF undergoes some shrinkage but remains a periodic structure as demonstrated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The nanocomposite shows an acute characteristic diffraction peak assigned to (111) plane of the face-centered-cubic structure of gold, indicating that gold nanoparticles crystallize well and grow in a preferred orientation in the pore channels. The surface plasma resonance (SPR) absorption peak near 570 nm undergoes a red-shift accompanied by a strengthening of intensity when HAuCl(4) is used to react with the amino groups on the internal pore surfaces for 4, 6, and 8 h. The simulative results are consistent with the experimental ones shows that the absorption property of the Au/SiO(2) nanocomposite is influenced by the dipping time, which affects the size and volume fraction of embedded gold nanoparticles.

AB The Laboratory of Computational Chemistry and Biochemistry is active in the development and application of first-principles based simulations of complex chemical and biochemical phenomena. Here, we review some of our recent efforts in extending these methods to larger systems, longer time scales and increased accuracies. Their versatility is illustrated with a diverse range of applications, ranging from the determination of the gas phase structure of the cyclic decapeptide gramicidin S, to the study of G protein coupled receptors, the interaction of transition metal based anti-cancer agents with protein targets, the mechanism of action of DNA repair enzymes, the role of metal ions in neurodegenerative diseases and the computational design of dye-sensitized solar cells. Many of these projects are done in collaboration with experimental groups from the Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering (ISIC) at the EPFL.

AB D-400, a herbomineral preparation has proven antidiabetic activity in experimental models as well as in clinical trials. The possibility of concomitant use of this drug with sulphonylureas was explored in animal models. D-400 has been investigated for its interaction with oral hypoglycaemic agents namely, tolbutamide and glibenclamide in alloxan-induced diabetic rabbits. Administration of D-400 at a dose of 1 g/kg for 15 days significantly elevated plasma tolbutamide and glibenclamide concentrations with simultaneous reduction of blood glucose. Plasma tolbutamide and glibenclamide concentrations were significantly lowered after withdrawal of D-400 treatment. Elevation of plasma concentration of tolbutamide was observed only for the first 4 h after which it declined towards normal levels and no significant difference between D-400 treated and control group was observed at the end of 8 h. Significant elevation of plasma glibenclamide levels was observed at 2, 4 and 8 h with D-400 treatment. Incubation, of D-400 with tolbutamide in plasma resulted in a significant increase in free tolbutamide levels.

DE Financial crash; Contagion; Heterogeneous agents
ID HETEROGENEOUS AGENTS; MARKETS
AB Inspired by the empirical findings, we include international traders to capture linkage between markets and propose a two-market heterogeneous agents model to simulate financial crisis with contagion effect. This paper manages to calibrate sudden crash behavior of US and UK stock markets during "Black Monday" of 1987 besides smooth crisis and disturbing crisis categorized in literature. It is implied that financial crisis and its contagion could be endogenous, which supports a scenario of over-valuation causing a financial crisis. In addition, the model shows that financial system could be fragile in which small shock(s) hitting individual market's fundamental could cause financial crisis spreading to the other market. This also supports a scenario of external shock triggering a financial crisis. Lastly, to demonstrate the relevance of our model to financial markets, we manage to match typical stylized facts, especially cross-correlation which is exclusive to a multiple-market case.

AB Purpose-This paper aims to contribute to the tactical and operational decision making of manufacturing and logistics operations by providing novel insights into modelling and simulation, based on complex adaptive systems (CAS).
   Design/methodology/approach-The research approach is theoretically based on CAS with agent-based modelling (ABM) as the implementation method. A case study is presented where an agent-based model has contributed to increased understanding and precision in decision making at a packaging company in the UK.
   Findings-The results suggest that ABM provides decision-makers with robust and accurate "what-if" scenarios of the dynamic interplay among several business functions. These scenarios can guide managers in the process of moving from policy space to performance space, i.e. concerning priorities of improvement efforts and choices of production/manufacturing policies, warehouse policies, customer service policies and logistics policies. Furthermore, it is found that ABM can include and pay attention to several aspects of CAS and thus provide understanding of, and explanation for, the patterns and effects which emerge in manufacturing and logistics settings.
   Practical implications-Aided by agent-based models and simulations, practitioners' levels of intuition can be enhanced since patterns on the macro level emerge from agents' interactive behaviour. Together with insights from CAS these emergent patterns can be explained and understood, and are thus beneficial for the improvement of decision making in companies.
   Originality/value-The case presented distinguishes this paper from what has been written in previous articles on the application of ABM, since such articles have not produced any empirically verified results after implementation of ABM.

AB A new set of charges specifically developed for biologically relevant N7-alkylated purine adducts have been implemented in the AMBER* force field of the MacroModel package and applied to the conformational search of azinomycin B-DNA interactions. To perform a sequence dependent reactivity relationship study, four DNA triplets known to interact differently with the drug, 5'-GCT-3', 5'-GCC-3', 5'-GTC-3', and 5'-GTT-3', have been modeled in B-form and intercalative conformations. Monte Carlo simulations of all possible monoadducts and intercalative complexes have been carried out and analyzed using a filtering criterion that estimates the probability of covalent bond formation and covalent cross-linking. We observed a good correlation between existing experimental data and our computational estimations that validate the approach. The comparison of the conformational properties of the drug-DNA monoadducts and complexes confirms the most probable mechanism of action involving an initial aziridine and subsequent epoxide alkylation. The different hydrogen bond network in the monoadducts and in the intercalative complexes between the drug and the three base-pair receptor is the primary reason for the different cross-linking reactivity. In addition, steric hindrance of the major groove exposed methyl group of central thymine-based triplets plays an important role in the lack of the reactivity of these sequences. Synthetic work on the azinomycins and the information coming from this computational study will be important for the design of more potent or DNA sequence-selective agents based on the azinomycin skeleton.

An age-structured population model with discrete development class is used to separate the destructive activity of Euhrychiopsis lecontei Dietz larvae from the relatively benign activity of the other developmental stages. Empirical model behavior is evaluated and agrees with expected system characteristics. Simulation results demonstrate diminishing returns in the control impact of E. lecontei Dietz as a function of population stocking density. These results indicate that predictive modeling of this type may be used to optimize the utilization of Euhrychiopsis lecontei Dietz as a biological control agent.

AB This paper illustrates the use of the nonparametric Wald-Wolfowitz test to detect stationarity and ergodicity in agent-based models. A nonparametric test is needed due to the practical impossibility to understand how the random component influences the emergent properties of the model in many agent-based models. Nonparametric tests on real data often lack power and this problem is addressed by applying the Wald-Wolfowitz test to the simulated data. The performance of the tests is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations of a stochastic process with known properties. It is shown that with appropriate settings the tests can detect non-stationarity and non-ergodicity. Knowing whether a model is ergodic and stationary is essential in order to understand its behavior and the real system it is intended to represent; quantitative analysis of the artificial data helps to acquire such knowledge.

AB The efflux of anticancer agents mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance (MDR) and eventually leads to chemotherapy failure. To overcome this problem, the delivery of anticancer agents in combination with a P-gp inhibitor using nanocarrier systems is considered an effective strategy. On the basis of the physiological compatibility and excellent drug loading ability of erythrocytes, we hypothesized that nanoerythrocytes could be used for the codelivery of an anticancer agent and a P-gp inhibitor to overcome MDR in breast cancer. Herein, a folic acid-modified nanoerythrocyte system (PTX/TQR NPs@NanoRBC-PEG/FA) was prepared to simultaneously transport paclitaxel and tariquidar, and the in vitro and in vivo characteristics of this delivery system were evaluated through several experiments. The results indicated that the average diameter and surface potential of this nanocarrier system were 159.8 +/- 1.4 nm and-10.98 mV, respectively. Within 120 h, sustained release of paclitaxel was observed in both pH 6.5 media and pH 7.4 media. Tariquidar release from this nanocarrier suppressed the P-gp function of MCF-7/Taxol cells and significantly increased the intracellular paclitaxel level (p < 0.01 versus the PTX group). The results of the MTT assay indicated that the simultaneous transportation of paclitaxel and tariquidar could significantly inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells or MCF-7/Taxol cells. After 48 h of incubation with PTX/TQR NPs@NanoRBC-PEG/FA, the viability of MCF-7 cells and MCF-7/Taxol cells decreased to 7.37% and 30.2%, respectively, and the IC50 values were 2.49 mu M and 6.30 mu M. Pharmacokinetic results illustrated that, compared with free paclitaxel, all test paclitaxel nanoformulations prolonged the drug release time and showed similar plasma concentration-time profiles. The peak concentration (Cmax), area under the curve (AUC(0-infinity)), and half-life (t(1/2)) of PTX/TQR NPs@NanoRBC-PEG/FA were 3.33 mg/L, 6.02 mg/L.h, and 5.84 h, respectively. Moreover, this active targeting nanocarrier dramatically increased the paclitaxel level in tumor tissues. Furthermore, compared with those of the other paclitaxel formulations, the cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels of the PTX/TQR NPs@ NanoRBC-PEG/FA group increased by 1.38-fold (p < 0.01) and 1.36-fold (p < 0.01), respectively, and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) decreased to 67.8% (p < 0.01) and 65.4% (p < 0.001), respectively. More importantly, in vivo antitumor efficacy results proved that the PTX/TQR NPs@NanoRBC-PEG/FA group exerted an outstanding tumor inhibition effect with no marked body weight loss and fewer adverse effects. In conclusion, by utilizing the inherent and advantageous properties of erythrocytes and surface modification strategies, this biomimetic targeted drug delivery system provides a promising platform for the codelivery of an anticancer agent and a P-gp inhibitor to treat MDR in breast cancer.

AB This work describes an efficient, generalizable approach towards the identification (and mitigation) of interferences for colorimetric detection using microfluidic paper-based analytical devices. Colorimetric detection is commonly used in conjunction with microfluidic paper-based analytical devices; however, many colorimetric reagents lack selectivity. The selectivity problem is particularly true for metal detection where colorimetric ligands can complex with multiple metals. Many solution-based studies have investigated methods to mask interfering metals, but solution-based procedures do not always apply to paper sensors where the reagents are dried and the cellulosic functional groups may also interact with metals. Here, a simple eight-armed microfluidic paper-based analytical device has been designed to rapidly screen masking agents for the detection of transition metals using the non-specific colorimetric ligand 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol as a model system to optimize conditions. The combination of dimercaptosuccinic acid and triethylenetetramine in pH 10 borate buffer was identified for selective determination of Mn(II) with greater than 87% masking of interfering metals. A combination of ethylenediaminetetracetic acid and triethylenetetramine in pH 10 phosphate buffer was identified for selective determination of Co(II) with greater than 96% masking for most of the interfering metals although Fe(II), Fe(III), and Ni(II) still interfere. While used for this specific system, the approach described here is generalizable for ligand and interference screening with potential applications to a number of different assays performed on mu PADs.

AB Complex behaviors are often driven by an internal model, which integrates sensory information over time and facilitates long-term planning to reach subjective goals. A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is, How can we use behavior and neural activity to understand this internal model and its dynamic latent variables? Here we interpret behavioral data by assuming an agent behaves rationally-that is, it takes actions that optimize its subjective reward according to its understanding of the task and its relevant causal variables. We apply a method, inverse rational control (IRC), to learn an agent's internal model and reward function by maximizing the likelihood of its measured sensory observations and actions. This thereby extracts rational and interpretable thoughts of the agent from its behavior. We also provide a framework for interpreting encoding, recoding, and decoding of neural data in light of this rational model for behavior. When applied to behavioral and neural data from simulated agents performing suboptimally on a naturalistic foraging task, this method successfully recovers their internal model and reward function, as well as the Markovian computational dynamics within the neural manifold that represent the task. This work lays a foundation for discovering how the brain represents and computes with dynamic latent variables.

AB Background: There is a growing recognition of the significance of host-pathogen interactions (HPIs) in gut biology leading to a reassessment of the role of bacteria in intestinal anastomotic leak. Understanding the complexities of the early postsurgical gut HPI requires integrating knowledge of both epithelial and bacterial behaviors to generate hypotheses of potential mechanisms of interaction. Agent-based modeling is a computational method well suited to achieve this goal, and we use an agent-based model (ABM) to examine alterations in the HPI affecting reestablishment of the epithelial barrier that may subsequently lead to anastomotic leak.
   Methods: Computational agents representing Pseudomonas aeruginosa were added to a previously validated ABM of epithelial restitution. Simulated experiments were performed examining the effect of radiation on bacterial binding to epithelial cells, plausibility of putative binding targets, and potential mechanisms of epithelial cell killing by virulent bacteria.
   Results: Simulation experiments incorporating radiation effects on epithelial monolayers produced binding patterns akin to those seen in vitro and suggested that promotility integrin-laminin associations represent potential sites for bacterial binding and disruption of restitution. Simulations of potential mechanisms of epithelial cell killing suggested that an injected cytotoxin was the means by which virulent bacteria produced the tissue destruction needed to generate an anastomotic leak, a mechanism subsequently confirmed with genotyping of the virulent P aeruginosa strain.
   Conclusions: This study emphasizes the utility of ABM as an adjunct to traditional research methods and provides insights into the potentially critical role of HPI in the pathogenesis of anastomotic leak. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Traditionally, researchers have employed statistical methods to model crime. However, these approaches are limited by being unable to model individual actions and behaviour. Brantingham and Brantingham (1993) described that in their opinion a useful and productive model for simulating crime would have the ability to model the occurrence of crime and the motivations behind it both temporally and spatially. This paper presents the construction and application of an agent-based model (ABM) for simulating occurrences of residential burglary at an individual level. It presents a novel framework that allows both human and environmental factors to be simulated. Although other agent-based models of crime do exist, this research represents the first working example of integrating a behavioural framework into an ABM for the simulation of crime. An artificial city, loosely based on the real city of Leeds, UK, and an artificial population were constructed, and experiments were run to explore the potential of the model to realistically simulate the main processes and drivers within this system. The results are highly promising, demonstrating the potential of this approach for both understanding processes behind crime and improving policies and developing effective crime prevention strategies.

AB The development of novel antimicrobials is a top priority to address the growing epidemic of multidrug-resistant pathogens. Since cationic nonamphiphilic star-shaped antimicrobials are promising molecular scaffolds that provide a high charge density in binding anionic bacterial bilayers, this research aimed to further increase their membrane perturbation capability by introducing guanidinium groups to the antimicrobials via enhancing membrane insertion. In particular, computational simulation and experimental investigations revealed that our designed guanidinium-rich alternating copolypeptide, four-armed poly(arginine-alt-glycine), can interact with both the headgroups and unsaturated tails of phospholipids in bacterial membranes through multiple interactions, including electrostatic, cation-p, and T-shaped p-p interactions, allowing it to penetrate deeper inside the biologically inaccessible high-energy barrier of the hydrophobic lipid bilayer interior to cause membrane permeabilization and precipitation of the bacterial cytoplasm. Furthermore, glycine was observed to have a unique effect in enhancing the performance of arginine-based copolypeptide. Four-armed poly(arginine-alt-glycine) exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, high bactericidal efficiency, and negligible hemolysis. The in vivo antibacterial performance of the copolypeptide was superior to that of doxycycline in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin infection, accompanied by negligible local and systemic toxicity. Our results demonstrate that this guanidinium-rich, nonamphiphilic, star-shaped structure may promote the development of next-generation antimicrobials.

AB TRPM8 member of the TRP superfamily of membrane proteins participates to various cellular processes ranging from Ca2+ uptake and cold sensation to cellular proliferation and migration. TRPM8 is a large tetrameric protein with more than 70% of its residues located in the cytoplasm. TRPM8 is N-glycosylated, with a single site per subunit. This work focuses on the N-glycosylation of TRPM8 channel that was previously studied by our group in relation to proliferation and migration of tumoral cells. Here, experimental data performed with deglycosylating agents assess that the sole glycosylation site contains complex glycans with a molecular weight of 2.5 kDa. The glycosylation state of TRPM8 in cells untreated and treated with a deglycosylating agent was addressed with Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Results show a clear difference between cells comprising glycosylated and deglycosylated TRPM8, the first presenting an increased THz absorption. Human TRPM8 was modelled using as templates the available TRPM8 and other TRPM channels structures. Glycosylations were modelled by considering two glycan structures with molecular weight close to the experiment shorter and branched at the first sugar unit (glc1) and longer and unbranched (glc2). Simulation of THz spectra based on the molecular dynamics of unglycosylated and the two glycosylated TRPM8 models in lipid membrane and solvation box showed that glycan structure strongly influences the THz spectrum of the channel and of other components from the simulation system. Only spectra of TRPM8 with glc1 glycans were in agreement with the experiment, leading to the validation of glc1 glycan structure.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to use noninvasive dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to study, in vivo, the distribution and elimination of the hepatobiliary contrast agent gadoxetate in the human body and characterize the transport mechanisms involved in its uptake into hepatocytes and subsequent efflux into the bile using a novel tracer kinetic model in a group of healthy volunteers.
   Materials and Methods: Ten healthy volunteers (age range, 18-29 years), with no history of renal or hepatic impairment, were recruited via advertisement. Participants attended 2 MRI visits (at least a week apart) with gadoxetate as the contrast agent. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI data were acquired for approximately 50 minutes with a 3-dimensional gradient-echo sequence in the axial plane, at a temporal resolution of 6.2 seconds. Data from regions of interest drawn in the liver were analyzed using the proposed 2-compartment uptake and efflux model to provide estimates for the uptake rate of gadoxetate in hepatocytes and its efflux rate into the bile. Reproducibility statistics for the 2 visits were obtained to examine the robustness of the technique and its dependence in acquisition time.
   Results: Eight participants attended the study twice and were included into the analysis. The resulting images provided the ability to simultaneously monitor the distribution of gadoxetate in multiple organs including the liver, spleen, and kidneys as well as its elimination through the common bile duct, accumulation in the gallbladder, and excretion in the duodenum. The mean uptake (k(i)) and efflux (k(ef)) rates in hepatocytes, for the 2 visits using the 50-minute acquisition, were 0.22 +/- 0.05 and 0.017 +/- 0.006/min, respectively. The hepatic extraction fraction was estimated to be 0.19 +/- 0.04/min. The variability between the 2 visits within the group level (95% confidence interval; k(i): +/- 0.02/min, k(ef): +/- 0.004/min) was lower compared with the individual variability (repeatability; k(i): +/- 0.06/min, k(ef): +/- 0.012/min). Data truncation demonstrated that the uptake rate estimates retained their precision as well as their group and individual reproducibility down to approximately 10 minutes of acquisition. Efflux rate estimates were underestimated (compared with the 50-minute acquisition) as the duration of the acquisition decreased, although these effects were more pronounced for acquisition times shorter than approximately 30 minutes.
   Conclusions: This is the first study that reports estimates for the hepatic uptake and efflux transport process of gadoxetate in healthy volunteers in vivo. The results highlight that dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with gadoxetate can provide novel quantitative insights into liver function and may therefore prove useful in studies that aim to monitor liver pathology, as well as being an alternative approach for studying hepatic drug-drug interactions.

AB Effective management of demand information is a critical factor in the successful operation of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. This paper classifies, measures and evaluates the demand information for an AMoD system. First, the paper studies demand information at both individual and aggregate levels and measures two critical attributes: dynamism and granularity. We identify the trade-offs between both attributes during the data collection and information inference processes and discuss the compatibility of the AMoD dispatching algorithms with different types of information. Second, the paper assesses the value of demand information through agent-based simulation experiments with the actual road network and travel demand in a major European city, where we assume a single operator monopolizes the AMoD service in the case study area but competes with other transportation modes. The performance of the AMoD system is evaluated from the perspectives of travelers, AMoD operators, and transportation authority in terms of the overall system performance. The paper tests multiple scenarios, combining different information levels, information dynamism, and information granularity, as well as various fleet sizes. Results show that aggregate demand information leads to more served requests, shorter wait time and higher profit through effective rebalancing, especially when supply is high and demand information is spatially granular. Individual demand information from inadvance requests also improves the system performance, the degree of which depends on the spatial disparity of requests and their coupled service priority. By designing hailing policies accordingly, the operator is able to maximize the potential benefits. The paper concludes that the strategic trade-offs of demand information need to be made regarding the information level, information dynamism, and information granularity. It also offers a broader discussion on the benefits and costs of demand information for key stakeholders including the users, the operator, and the society.

ID ANALYTICAL-MODEL; BOND STRENGTH; PERFORMANCE; BEHAVIOR; BOLTS
AB In order to study the anchoring instability mechanism of surrounding rock in deep roadway, the failure mechanism of the bolt-anchoring agent interface was studied by simulating different strength rock mass and ground temperature environment, using C20, C40, and C60 strength concrete and steel pipe to simulate different surrounding rock strength environments. Indoor pull-out tests were carried out to study the pull-out load displacement relationship, ultimate pull-out force, residual anchoring force, the distribution law of axial stress and tangential stress along the bar, and the energy consumption value of drawing failure at 20, 50, and 70 degrees C. The test results show that, with the decrease of surrounding rock strength or the increase of ambient temperature, the pull-out force, residual anchoring force, and energy consumption value of anchorage interface gradually decrease; under different axial forces, the axial force distribution of the rod body decreases exponentially from the anchoring end to the opposite end; and the shear stress transfers to the deep part of the anchor body with the increase of the load. According to the failure phenomenon of the specimen, the failure modes of the bolt bolt-anchorage agent interface can be divided into shear slip mode and shear expansion slip mode. The shear expansion slip formula of anchorage interface is derived. Using high-strength and temperature-resistant resin anchoring agent for comparative test, the rationality of the mechanism analysis is proved, which provides more clear guidance for the construction of anchor support.

ID MORAL HAZARD
AB Systems engineering processes (SEPs) coordinate the effort of different individuals to generate a product satisfying certain requirements. As the involved engineers are self-interested agents, the goals at different levels of the systems engineering hierarchy may deviate from the system-level goals, which may cause budget and schedule overruns. Therefore, there is a need of a systems engineering theory that accounts for the human behavior in systems design. As experience in the physical sciences shows, a lot of knowledge can be generated by studying simple hypothetical scenarios, which nevertheless retain some aspects of the original problem. To this end, the objective of this article is to study the simplest conceivable SEP, a principalagent model of a one-shot, shallow SEP. We assume that the systems engineer (SE) maximizes the expected utility of the system, while the subsystem engineers (sSE) seek to maximize their expected utilities. Furthermore, the SE is unable to monitor the effort of the sSE and may not have complete information about their types. However, the SE can incentivize the sSE by proposing specific contracts. To obtain an optimal incentive, we pose and solve numerically a bilevel optimization problem. Through extensive simulations, we study the optimal incentives arising from different system-level value functions under various combinations of effort costs, problem-solving skills, and task complexities. Our numerical examples show that, the passed-down requirements to the agents increase as the task complexity and uncertainty grow and they decrease with increasing the agents' costs.

AB While much is known about the relationship between Clark's nutcracker and whitebark pine, information on nutcracker energetic behavioural strategies the driving factors behind nutcracker emigration and the impact of nutcracker behaviour on whitebark pine communities remain uncertain. To investigate nutcracker energetic behaviour, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioural mechanisms nutcrackers are most likely to employ during foraging in the South Cascades near Mt. Rainier, Washington. The ABM is comprised of cognitive nutcracker agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize energy acquisition and loss. Environmental data layers for elevation and basal area of tree species were used to represent the landscape in terms of habitat and energy resources. We employed the evaludation approach for an organized sequence of model development and analysis, including: data evaluation, conceptual model evaluation, implementation, verification, model output verification (calibration consisting of comparison of parameters informed by nutcracker ecology to real-world empirical values; pattern-oriented modeling POM), model analysis (sensitivity of model to changes in parameters and processes), and model output corroboration (use of POM to compare model output to real-world patterns from empirical investigations of nutcracker ecology, independent of calibration). Simulations were conducted on alternative nutcracker behavioural-energetic mechanism strategies by assigning different fitness-maximizing goals to agents. We found that an integrated energetic requirement (IER) mechanism, which includes both the shortterm and long-term energetic needs of nutcracker agents to be the best-fit scenario. Our results affirm previous research that nutcrackers are responsive to changes in their energetic environment, and that they are capable of projecting energy budgets well into the future. The development of this ABM provides a basis for future research, such as a means to assess the driving conditions necessary for nutcrackers when choosing between a resident and emigrant strategy and as a planning tool to model nutcracker responses to potential landscape changes, which may facilitate long-term WBP conservation.

AB Hypoxanthine (Hx) with specific N-15 labels has been used to probe hydrogen-bonding interactions with purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) by NMR spectroscopy. Hx binds to human PNP as the N-7H tautomer, and the N-7H H-1 and N-15 chemical shifts are located at 13.9 and 156.5 ppm, respectively, similar to the solution values. In contrast, the 1H and 15N chemical shifts of N-1H in the PNP.Hx complex are shifted downfield by 3.5 and 7.5 ppm to 15.9 and 178.8 ppm, respectively, upon binding. Thus, hydrogen bonding at N-1H is stronger than at N-7H in the complex. Ab initio chemical shift calculations on model systems that simulate Hx in solution and bound to PNP are used to interpret the NMR data. The experimental N-7H chemical shift changes are caused by competing effects of two active site contacts. Hydrogen bonding of Glu201 to N-1H causes upfield shifts of the N-7H group, while the local hydrogen bond (C=O to N-7H from Asn243) causes downfield shifts. The observed N-7H chemical shift can be reproduced by a hydrogen bond distance similar to0.13 Angstrom shorter (but within experimental error) of the experimental value found in the X-ray crystal structure of the bovine PNP-Hx complex. The combined use of NMR and ab initio chemical shift computational analysis provides a novel approach to understand enzyme-ligand interactions in PNP, a target for anticancer agents. This approach has the potential to become a high-resolution tool for structural determination.

AB Twenty-four hour ratios of area under the curve (AUC(24)) to MIC of 200-240 h providing quinolone concentrations above the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) protected from enrichment of resistant Staphylococcus aureus in our recent study that simulated the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. These protective AUC(24)/MICs might also be achieved by using antibiotic combinations, assuming additive effects of two anti-staphylococcal agents. To test this hypothesis, changes in S. aureus susceptibility were examined in a dynamic model that simulates 5-day treatment with moxifloxacin and doxycycline, alone and in combination at sub-optimal AUC(24)/MICs of each agent. Significant increases in MIC were observed with monotherapy where moxifloxacin or doxycycline concentrations fell into the mutant selection window (MSW) for more than 80% of the dosing interval (AUC(24)/MIC 60 h). Less pronounced changes in MIC occurred when the summed concentrations of moxifloxacin (AUC(24)/MIC 30 and 60 h) and doxycycline (AUC(24)/MIC 30 and 60 h) were inside the MSWs for the individual drugs for 30-50% of the dosing interval. No loss in susceptibility was found at moxifloxacin or doxycycline AUC(24)/MIC 170 h combined with the smaller AUC(24)/MIC (60 h) of the second compound. These data suggest that the total AUC(24)/MIC of 230 h might protect against S. aureus resistance. As this value is very close to that predicted in monotherapy with moxifloxacin (220 h), an additive protective effect of quinolone+doxycycline on the selection of resistant S. aureus is proposed. The use of drug combinations may be useful for restricting the enrichment of resistant mutants with agents whose clinically achievable AUC(24)/MICs do not provide concentrations above the MPC.

AB Tributyl phosphate (TBP) is used as a complexing agent in the Plutonium Uranium Extraction (PUREX) liquid-liquid phase extraction process for recovering uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear reactor fuel. Here, we address the molecular and microstructure of the organic phases involved in the extraction process, using molecular dynamics to show that when TBP is mixed with a paraffinic diluent, the TBP self-assembles into a bi-continuous phase. The underlying self-association of TBP is driven by intermolecular interaction between its polar groups, resulting in butyl moieties radiating out into the organic solvent. Simulation predicts a TBP diffusion constant that is anomalously low compared to what might normally be expected for its size; experimental nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies also indicate an extremely low diffusion constant, consistent with a molecular aggregation model. Simulation of TBP at an oil/water interface shows the formation of a bilayer system at low TBP concentrations. At higher concentrations, a bulk bi-continuous structure is observed linking to this surface bilayer. We suggest that this structure may be intimately connected with the surprisingly rapid kinetics of the interfacial mass transport of uranium and plutonium from the aqueous to the organic phase in the PUREX process.

SO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REVIEW

DE knowledge representation; hybrid structural and spatial representations;
   situated communication
AB In an experimental setting of mechanical-object assembly, the CODY (''Concept Dynamics'') project is concerned with the development of knowledge representations and inference methods that are able to dynamically conceptualize the situation in the task environment. A central aim is to enable an artificial agent to understand and process natural-language instructions of a human partner. Instructions may build on the current perception of the assembly environment on the one hand, and on the other on the knowledge-based understanding of grouped structures in the developing construct. To this end, a dynamic conceptualization must integrate information not only describing the types of the objects involved, but also their changing functional roles when becoming part of structured assemblies.
   We have developed an operational knowledge representation formalism, COAR (''Concepts for Objects, Assemblies, and Roles''), by which processes of dynamic conceptualization in sequences of assembly steps can be formally reconstructed. Inferences concern the assertion or retraction of aggregate representations in a dynamic knowledge base, as well as the computation of role changes for individual objects associated herewith. The structural representations integrate situated spatial features and relations, such as position, size, distance, or orthogonality, which are inferred on need from a geometry description of the task environment. The capacity of our approach has been evaluated in a 3D computergraphics simulation environment.

TI BIO-LGCA: A cellular automaton modelling class for analysing collective
   cell migration
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID EQUATION MODELS; SIMULATION; SINGLE; RULES
AB Collective dynamics in multicellular systems such as biological organs and tissues plays a key role in biological development, regeneration, and pathological conditions. Collective tissue dynamics-understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells-can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments.

AB Studies on noble-metal-decorated carbon nanostructures are reported almost on a daily basis, but detailed studies on the nanoscale interactions for well-defined systems are very rare. Here we report a study of reduced graphene oxide (rGOx) homogeneously decorated with palladium (Pd) nanoclusters with well-defined shape and size (2.3 +/- 0.3 nm). The rGOx was modified with benzyl mercaptan (BnSH) to improve the interaction with Pd clusters, and N,N-dimethylformamide was used as solvent and capping agent during the decoration process. The resulting Pd nanoparticles anchored to the rGOx-surface exhibit high crystallinity and are fully consistent with six-shell cuboctahedral and icosahedral clusters containing similar to 600 Pd atoms, where 45% of these are located at the surface. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, the Pd clusters exhibit an oxidized surface forming a PdOx shell. Given the well-defined experimental system, as verified by electron microscopy data and theoretical simulations, we performed ab initio simulations using 10 functionalized graphenes (with vacancies or pyridine, amine, hydroxyl, carboxyl, or epoxy groups) to understand the adsorption process of BnSH, their further role in the Pd cluster formation, and the electronic properties of the graphene-nanoparticle hybrid system. Both the experimental and theoretical results suggest that Pd clusters interact with fiinctionalized graphene by a sulfur bridge while the remaining Pd surface is oxidized. Our study is of significant importance for all work related to anchoring of nanoparticles on nanocarbon-based supports, which are used in a variety of applications.

AB Poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are promising nanocarriers in a wide range of biomedical applications including gene and drug delivery and as imaging agents. They have unique structural properties and are characterized by high size uniformity, low polydispersity, and a large number of modifiable surface groups. Drug-dendrimer systems are usually further modified through the conjugation of ligands in order to confer the carriers' specific characteristics designed to enhance their efficacy. The chemistry and structure of the solvated ligand-conjugated dendrimer nanocarriers (DNCs) will dictate how they interact with the physiological environment and, therefore, their fate and function. Understanding the microstructures of ligand-conjugated DNCs is, therefore, of great relevance within the context of drug delivery applications. In this work, we investigate the effect of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) on the microstructure of solvated, NH2-terminated PAMAM DNCs using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Several variables including dendrimer generation (2-5), PEGylation density (0-50%), and PEG M-w (500 and 1000) were investigated. The results obtained showed a good match with available experimental results, including size as a function of dendrimer degeneration (G2NH(2)-G5NH(2)). No back-folding is observed for PAMAM dendrimers with generation lower than G5NH(2). G2NH(2) and G3NH(2) showed a dense-packed, nonglobular structure, and G4NH(2) and G5NH(2) have a segmented, "open" structure. Our results help settle a long-standing debate with respect to "back-folding" as the microstructural information obtained here is reconciled with experimental results. PEGylation was found to influence the microstructure in a different way, including an expected increase in the overall size of the DNCs, while not affecting much the solvation of unmodified terminal (primary) amines. It also serves to expand the core of dendrimers, reduce the surface charge, and change solvation behavior of different generation branching amines. We show that the microstructure of a PEG layer with the same number of repeat units can be significantly altered by changing the grafting density and size of PEG. Potential consequences in the design of PEGylated dendrimers for drug delivery and targeting are discussed based on the obtained microstructural information.

AB We propose a simple agent-based computational model in which speculators' trading behavior may cause bubbles and crashes, excess volatility, serially uncorrelated returns, fat-tailed return distributions and volatility clustering, thereby replicating five important stylized facts of stock markets. Since each speculator bets on his own (technical and fundamental) trading signals, stock prices are excessively volatile and oscillate erratically around their fundamental value. However, speculators' heterogeneity occasionally vanishes, e.g. due to panic-induced herding behavior, yielding extreme returns. Lasting regimes with high volatility originate from the fact that speculators extract stronger trading signals out of past stock price movements when stock prices fluctuate strongly. Simulations furthermore suggest that circuit breakers may be an effective tool to combat financial market turbulences.

AB Chemical plants are complex dynamical systems. Optimising plant operation for non-stationary scenarios, such as changing the output product and recovering from abrupt disturbances, is challenging because a chemical plant has many operation points and complex responses. A plant simulator can be used to compute the optimal procedures. However, because of modelling errors or contingent changes in the external conditions, such as weather and feed purity, there exist gaps between the behaviour of a simulator and that of a real plant. This poses another challenge in a simulator-based approach, which adds to the computational complexity of the problem. In this study, we propose a simulator-based approach for optimising chemical plant operations using deep reinforcement learning and knowledge-based automated reasoning. Specifically, a reinforcement learning agent is trained on a whole-plant simulator with a policy gradient algorithm, using automated reasoning to narrow down the action space of the agent. To maintain the optimality of the procedures in a real plant, a simple method for the state and parameter estimation of the system at run time is introduced. This method can improve the accuracy of the response prediction model (i.e. the plant simulator) on which the agent depends. The presented method is evaluated on a real chemical distillation plant. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach consumed only half the time and steam (heat energy) in comparison with that in the case of human-emulated procedures.

AB There is ample evidence that polymer brushes reduce friction between surfaces. Several industrial applications take advantage of this fact, such as those in plastic bag production, where the brushes act as slip agents; however, the complex mechanisms that give rise to such reduction of friction are not yet fully understood. In this work we report coarse grained, dissipative particle dynamics simulations carried out for surfaces functionalized with erukamide brushes, a polymer commonly used in the plastics industry as a slip agent between surfaces. We calculate their rheological properties, such as the coefficient of friction (COF) and the viscosity, eta, as functions of the number of chains grafted on the surfaces under the influence of stationary, Couette flow. Moreover, we consider also the case when a fraction of the erukamide chains is not adsorbed and moves freely between the surfaces. We show that the COF reaches an equilibrium value of about 0.29 in these two cases, in agreement with experimental results. On other hand, the viscosity grows monotonically, as a result of the increasing collisions when the erukamide content is increased. The force between brushes is found to be in agreement with predictions from scaling theories. We find that the addition to free chains helps stabilize the film formed by the brushes and the solvent, as others have found experimentally. The mechanisms that give rise to these phenomena are studied in detail. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this study, citric acid-functionalized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (CA-MNPs) were prepared via a coprecipitation method and were fully characterized. Doxorubicin (DOX) and melittin (MEL), as anticancer agents, were loaded onto CA-MNPs surface through electrostatic interactions with the aim to achieve an effective co-delivery system for cancer therapy. The loading efficiency and in vitro release profiles of DOX and MEL were investigated by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The MS/MS step was performed in the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mode which enabled simultaneous quantification of the analytes with high specificity and sensitivity. An excellent loading efficiency of about 100% was achieved for DOX and MEL in a drug to nanocarrier ratio of 1:10. The in vitro release of the drugs from CA-MNPs was evaluated for 8h at pH 7.4, 5.5 and 4.5. The experimental results revealed that the release behaviour of both of the anticancer agents was strongly pH-dependent and significantly enhanced at pH 4.5. The in vitro MTT assay on MCF-7 breast cancer cell line exhibited a synergistic effect between DOX and MEL which led to substantially greater antitumor efficacy, compared to single administration of these anticancer agents at equivalent doses. The results indicated that the co-delivery system of (DOX/MEL)-loaded CA-MNPs is highly capable to be used in magnetically targeted cancer therapy.

AB An experimental model of proliferative vitreoretionpathy (PVR) induced by macrophages simulates a special form of wound healing process in the eye and mimics the development of PVR from its initial stage. We used this model for the evaluation of drug efficacy in the prevention of PVR. One mg triamcinolone acetonide (TA), 10 mug daunomycin-liposome (DL), 5 mug free daunomycin (FD) and 0.1 ml saline or empty liposomes (as controls) were injected into the vitreous in four groups of animals (30 or 40 rabbit eyes each) after macrophage injection. Retinal detachment developed in 77.5 % of the control eyes on day 28, compared to 13.3 % of the TA-treated eyes (P<0.01), to 33.3 % of the eyes treated with DL (P<0.01), and 50 % of the FD-treated eyes (P<0.05). TA cleared up from the vitreous within 35-63 days (average 45.5 days). The half-time of FD clearance was 145.5 min. Although DL declined rapidly during the first 2 days, there was an average of 0.64 mug/ml daunomycin in the vitreous on day 14. Transmission electron microscopy showed that FD at a dosage of over 5 mug or DL over 20 mug was toxic to the retina and that up to 4 mg TA was nontoxic. These results suggest that steroids such as TA, given at the inflammatory stage, can effectively and savely prevent the development of PVR, and that encapsulation in liposomes of cytotoxic agents such as daunomycin can enhance drug efficacy and reduce toxicity. The time course of initiation and development of PVR is important in the selection of particular drugs.

AB Anthropogenic N deposition can slow the decay of plant detritus, leading to an accumulation of soil organic matter and the production of phenolic dissolved organic C (DOG), which can leach from soil to ground and surface waters. Actinobacteria are one of the few groups of saprotrophic microorganisms that oxidatively depolymerize lignin, producing substantial soluble polyphenolics in the process. In combination, these observations present the possibility that lignolytic Actinobacteria may become more important agents of lignin decay as atmospheric N deposition continues to increase during the next decade. To test this idea, we quantified actinobacterial abundance and community composition in a well-replicated field study in which atmospheric N deposition has been experimentally increased since 1994. Actinobacterial abundance was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction of 16S rRNA and community composition was evaluated using clone libraries and phylogenetic community analyses (i.e., LIBSHUFF and UniFrac). Contrary to our expectation, experimental atmospheric N deposition had no effect on actinobacterial abundance in the forest floor (similar to 10(10) gene copies kg(-1)); however, it significantly decreased actinobacterial abundance by 47% and total DNA by 31% in surface soil. Our analyses revealed that experimental N deposition further elicited a significant membership change in forest floor and surface soil communities, as well as significant differences in the phylogenetic diversity of forest floor Actinobacteria. This shift in community composition occurred in concert with a slowing of plant litter decay, accumulation of soil organic matter, and a greater production of phenolic DOG. These observations are consistent with the idea that changes in actinobacterial community composition may underlie biogeochemical responses to experimental N deposition.

AB The study of mechanisms has received increased attention in recent years and contributed to the formation of so-called 'analytical sociology' that has put the idea of social mechanisms at its core. We discuss the crucial characteristics of mechanism-based explanations and their relation to the longstanding tradition of explanatory sociology. Looking at the widespread and growing number of references to 'mechanisms' in the current research literature, we identify typical deviations from the ideal of a mechanism-based explanation. Many references come down to mechanism talk insofar as it is not explicated in detail how and why particular inputs tend to result in particular outputs. To this end, researchers have to give a detailed verbal account of how exactly a mechanism is thought to unfold under specified conditions, or to specify a formal generative model which can be analysed analytically or by simulation. This agenda has been at the core of methodological individualism, sociological rational choice theory, and explanatory sociology for some time, but has received a new coat of whitewash by analytical sociology. This more recent theoretical movement offers a fresh problem-centred agenda based on the well-known macro-micro-macro model and could inspire a new generation of research that places greater weight on analysing social dynamics than on developing theories of action. However, we submit that, rather than constituting a competing approach, these impulses should be located within the longstanding and multifaceted explanatory agenda in sociology.

AB The present study investigates and models the effect of laser ablated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the development of the aquatic macrophyte Lemna minor. Toxic effects of five different AgNP concentrations (8, 16, 32, 96 and 128 mu g L-1) on L minor were recorded over seven days under simulated natural conditions. Biosorption of AgNPs by L minor was modeled using four sorption isotherms, and the sorption behavior was found to agree most closely with the Langmuir-Freundlich model (R-2 = 0.997). While toxic effects of AgNPs could be observed in all models and concentrations, the greatest increase in toxicity was in the 8-32 mu g L-1 range. Dry weight- and frond number-based inhibition experiments suggest that growth inhibition does not necessarily scale with AgNP concentration, and that slight fluctuations in inhibition rates exist over certain concentration ranges. Very close fits (R-2 = 0.999) were obtained for all removal models, suggesting that the fluctuations are not caused by experimental variation. In addition, L minor was found to be a successful bioremediation agent for AgNPs, and displayed higher removal rates for increasing AgNP doses. FT-IR spectroscopy suggests that carbonyl groups are involved in AgNP remediation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Agent-based simulation; Travel demand; Hurricane evacuation
AB This paper presents an agent-based travel demand model system for hurricane evacuation simulation, which is capable of generating comprehensive household activity-travel plans. The system implements econometric and statistical models that represent travel and decision-making behavior throughout the evacuation process. The system considers six typical evacuation decisions: evacuate/stay, accommodation type choice, evacuation destination choice, mode choice, vehicle usage choice, and departure time choice. It explicitly captures the shadow evacuation population. In addition, the model system captures pre-evacuation preparation activities using an activity-based approach.
   A demonstration study that predicts activity-travel patterns using model parameters estimated for the Miami-Dade area for a hypothetical category-4 hurricane is discussed. The simulation results clearly indicate the model system produces a distribution of choice patterns that is consistent with sample observations and existing literature. The model system also identifies the proportion of the shadow evacuation population and their geographical extent. About 23% of the population outside the designated evacuation zone would evacuate. The shadow evacuation demand is mainly located within 5 km of the coastline. The output demand of the model system works with agent-based traffic simulation tools and conventional trip-based simulation tools. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We present herein the results of a pharmacokinetic (PK) study of Cu-II mixed-chelate coordination compound CasIII-La {[Cu(5,6-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(acetylacetonate)( H2O)] NO3}, which belongs to the antineoplastic family of compounds known as Casiopenas. The main interest in this molecule lies in the big difference in its lethal dose and PK parameters in Wistar rats compared with its structural isomer CasIII-Ea {[Cu(4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline)(acetylacetonate)(H2O)]NO3}. For instance, the half-lives of these compounds are 9.6 +/- 1.15 and 48 +/- 4.6 h for CasIII-La and CasIII-Ea, respectively. The differences in the half- lives have been attributed to their different capacities to cross cellular membranes. Molecular dynamics studies of a fraction of a cell membrane and Casiopenas were developed to identify the possible intermolecular interactions responsible for the retention of the compound inside the cellular membrane. Also, quantum theory of atoms-in-molecules studies was developed to determine the capacity of the hydrogen atoms of methyl groups to participate in intermolecular interactions. In addition, peripheral human blood lymphocyte and macrophage samples were used to determine the cross-membrane effect on cytotoxicity.

ID PEDESTRIAN CROWD; DYNAMICS; LEVEL
AB Crowding force is an important index in evaluating the safety of those within high density crowds. However, studies on high density crowd simulation models have not been sufficiently developed, and related experimental studies are not sufficiently detailed to guide modeling research. Models that can reproduce real high density crowds and enable calibration of key parameters are lacking. In this study, we improved the typical social force model to simulate high density crowd motion with the calculation of crowding forces. To simulate high density crowds, pedestrians were modeled using the three-circle model, and an agent-based pedestrian model was formulated that can regulate the psychological force automatically according to crowd density. An individual crowd density calculation method is proposed that is more suitable for high density crowds. To calculate real crowding force, body stiffness was formulated and the corresponding parameters were calibrated by a series of experiments. Field experiments show that passengers bear greater force on their backs than the force on each shoulder in metro carriage. The modified model was verified by comparing the simulation results with observed data. We applied this model to the Beijing subway, and the theoretical maximum crowd densities in different seasons were calculated from the perspective of crowding force to ensure the safety of passengers, which are 7.2 people/m(2) in winter and 10.3 people/m(2) in summer. Therefore, to ensure passenger safety, the subway operation department should arrange more trains during winter peak hours.

AB Socio-demographics of urban US populations have been associated with poor health status and chronic disease. Patterns of rising chronic disease prevalence have persisted in populations with lower socio-economic status despite substantial and costly public health efforts to the contrary. In this paper, we used a system dynamics model to simulate chronic disease prevalence, along with potential interventions, for a low-income urban community in Chicago, Illinois. We hypothesized that the 'triple bottom line' of sustainability-addressing economic, social, and environmental issues-would be key to mitigation and reduction of chronic disease over time in such a community. The aim was to inform decision making about urban design and public health programme planning towards formulation of approaches-some beyond the traditional boundaries of health interventions-to improve community chronic disease outcomes over time. We found that single interventions on the constructs of Income and Employment, Neighbourhood Attractiveness, and Social Cohesion were most impactful in reducing or reversing the rise of chronic disease prevalence. Increasing Housing Capacity allowed the Neighbourhood Attractiveness intervention to have a greater impact. In addition, interventions in Neighbourhood Attractiveness and Chronic Disease Prevention produced a greater combined mitigating effect on chronic disease prevalence than the sum of the individual intervention effects. Findings suggest that socio-environmental conditions should be addressed, with consideration of population migration dynamics, in formulating viable and sustainable solutions to improve community-level health outcomes such as chronic disease prevalence.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate surface roughness and changes in the composition of enamel submitted to different bleaching protocols and toothbrushing with regular and whitening toothpastes. Background data: Bleaching treatment could promote morphological and chemical changes in enamel surface. Methods: Enamel blocks were randomized into nine groups (n=10) according to the bleaching treatment (no bleaching, control group; 6% hydrogen peroxide, HP; or 10% carbamide peroxide, CP) and toothpaste used (placebo, PL; regular, R; or whitening dentifrice, W). Bleaching was performed according to manufacturers' instructions and all groups were submitted to 30,000 cycles of simulated toothbrushing with toothpaste (PL, R, or W). Mineral content evaluation and enamel roughness were evaluated initially (T-1), after bleaching (T-2), and after toothbrushing (T-3), using an energy-dispersive micro X-ray fluorescence spectrometer and profilometry, respectively. Data were statistically analyzed with two way ANOVA, Tukey, and Dunnett tests (5%). Results: Enamel surface roughness was influenced by bleaching and toothbrushing. Surface roughness increased for the groups that brushed with the placebo dentifrice (CP+PL, HP+PL, C+PL) and for the control group that brushed with whitening dentifrice (C+W). Enamel Ca/P ratio decreased after bleaching, but toothbrushing, regardless of the dentifrice used, did not reduce the enamel mineral content. Conclusions: The bleaching treatment resulted in a decrease of enamel mineral content, but the studied dentifrices did not contribute to surface mineral loss.

AB Socio-economic related properties of a city grow faster than a linear relationship with the population, in a log-log plot, the so-called superlinear scaling. Conversely, the larger a city, the more efficient it is in the use of its infrastructure, leading to a sublinear scaling on these variables. In this work, we addressed a simple explanation for those scaling laws in cities based on the interaction range between the citizens and on the fractal properties of the cities. To this purpose, we introduced a measure of social potential which captured the influence of social interaction on the economic performance and the benefits of amenities in the case of infrastructure offered by the city. We assumed that the population density depends on the fractal dimension and on the distance-dependent interactions between individuals. The model suggests that when the city interacts as a whole, and not just as a set of isolated parts, there is improvement of the socio-economic indicators. Moreover, the bigger the interaction range between citizens and amenities, the bigger the improvement of the socio-economic indicators and the lower the infrastructure costs of the city. We addressed how public policies could take advantage of these properties to improve cities development, minimizing negative effects. Furthermore, the model predicts that the sum of the scaling exponents of social-economic and infrastructure variables are 2, as observed in the literature. Simulations with an agent-based model are confronted with the theoretical approach and they are compatible with the empirical evidences.

ID SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS
AB Agent-based simulation models are excellent tools for addressing questions about the spread of infectious diseases in human populations because realistic, complex behaviors as well as random factors can readily be incorporated. Agent-based models are flexible and allow for a wide variety of behaviors, time-related variables, and geographies, making the calibration process an extremely important step in model development. Such calibration procedures, including verification and validation, may be complicated, however, and usually require incorporation of substantial empirical data and theoretical knowledge of the populations and processes under study. This paper describes steps taken to build and calibrate an agent-based model of epidemic spread in an early 20th century fishing village in Newfoundland and Labrador, including a description of some of the detailed ethnographic and historical data available. We illustrate how these data were used to develop the structure of specific parts of the model. The resulting model, however, is designed to reflect a generic small community during the early 20th century and the spread of a directly transmitted disease within such a community, not the specific place that provided the data. Following the description of model development, we present the results of a replication study used to confirm the model behaves as intended. This study is also used to identify the number of simulations necessary for high confidence in average model output. We also present selected results from extensive sensitivity analyses to assess the effect that variation in parameter values has on model outcomes. After careful calibration and verification, the model can be used to address specific practical questions of interest. We provide an illustrative example of this process.

AB Multiscale models that couple agent-based modeling (ABM) and finite-element modeling (FEM) allow the dynamic simulation of tissue remodeling and wound healing, with mechanical environment influencing cellular behaviors even as tissue remodeling modifies mechanics. One of the challenges in coupling ABM to FEM is that these two domains typically employ grid or element sizes that differ by several orders of magnitude. Here, we develop and demonstrate an interpolation-based method for mapping between ABM and FEM domains of different resolutions that is suitable for linear and nonlinear FEM meshes and balances accuracy with computational demands. We then explore the effects of refining the FEM mesh and the ABM grid in the setting of a fully coupled model. ABM grid refinement studies showed unexpected effects of grid size whenever cells were present at a high enough density for crowding to affect proliferation and migration. In contrast to an FE-only model, refining the FE mesh in the coupled model increased strain differences between adjacent finite elements. Allowing strain-dependent feedback on collagen turnover magnified the effects of regional heterogeneity, producing highly nonlinear spatial and temporal responses. Our results suggest that the choice of both ABM grid and FEM mesh density in coupled models must be guided by experimental data and accompanied by careful grid and mesh refinement studies in the individual domains as well as the fully coupled model.

AB We describe and document an end-to-end model of anchovy and sardine population dynamics in the California Current as a proof of principle that such coupled models can be developed and implemented. The end-to-end model is 3-dimensional, time-varying, and multispecies, and consists of four coupled sub-models: hydrodynamics, Eulerian nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton (NPZ), an individual-based full life cycle anchovy and sardine submodel, and an agent-based fishing fleet submodel. A predator roughly mimicking albacore was included as individuals that consumed anchovy and sardine. All submodels were coded within the ROMS open-source community model, and used the same resolution spatial grid and were all solved simultaneously to allow for possible feedbacks among the submodels. We used a super-individual approach and solved the coupled models on a distributed memory parallel computer, both of which created challenging but resolvable bookkeeping challenges. The anchovy and sardine growth, mortality, reproduction, and movement, and the fishing fleet submodel, were each calibrated using simplified grids before being inserted into the full end-to-end model. An historical simulation of 1959-2008 was performed, and the latter 45 years analyzed. Sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) for the historical simulation showed strong horizontal gradients and multi-year scale temporal oscillations related to various climate indices (PDO, NPGO), and both showed responses to ENSO variability. Simulated total phytoplankton was lower during strong El Nino events and higher for the strong 1999 La Nina event. The three zooplankton groups generally corresponded to the spatial and temporal variation in simulated total phytoplankton. Simulated biomasses of anchovy and sardine were within the historical range of observed biomasses but predicted biomasses showed much less inter-annual variation. Anomalies of annual biomasses of anchovy and sardine showed a switch in the mid-1990s from anchovy to sardine dominance. Simulated averaged weights- and lengths-at-age did not vary much across decades, and movement patterns showed anchovy located close to the coast while sardine were more dispersed and farther offshore. Albacore predation on anchovy and sardine was concentrated near the coast in two pockets near the Monterey Bay area and equatorward of Cape Mendocino. Predation mortality from fishing boats was concentrated where sardine age-1 and older individuals were located close to one of the five ports. We demonstrated that it is feasible to perform multi-decadal simulations of a fully-coupled end-to-end model, and that this can be done for a model that follows individual fish and boats on the same 3-dimensional grid as the hydrodynamics. Our focus here was on proof of principle and our results showed that we solved the major technical, bookkeeping, and computational issues. We discuss the next steps to increase computational speed and to include important biological differences between anchovy and sardine. In a companion paper (Fiechter et al., 2015), we further analyze the historical simulation in the context of the various hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the sardine and anchovy cycles.

AB Objectives: Sodium magnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides noninvasive insights to cellular processes by measuring tissue sodium concentration (TSC). Many clinical studies combine sodium MR imaging with clinical standard MR procedures, in which contrast media is frequently administered. This work investigates the influence of gadolinium-based contrast agents on quantification of TSC. Thus, either scan pauses between early and late contrast-enhanced acquisitions can be used efficiently or sodium imaging can be performed as the final scan after dynamic contrast-enhanced acquisition.
   Materials and Methods: For this study, 2 gadolinium-based contrast agents, Dotarem and Gadovist, were diluted with saline solution covering contrast agent concentrations in a clinical range. In addition, agarose-based sample series were created to simulate tissue relaxation time behavior. In vivo, the influence of Dotarem on sodium acquisition and TSC quantification was investigated in 1 ischemic stroke patient.
   Results: Proton relaxation times decreased for increasing contrast agent concentrations as hyperbolic functions. Sodium relaxation times displayed a negative slope in regression analysis in most cases. The largest influence (-1.52 milliseconds per mmol/L contrast agent) was measured for sodium T-1. Worst case calculations in ultrashort echo time sequence signal analysis showed a signal drop of (1.21% +/- 0.56%) on tissue sodium quantification. In vivo sodium brain acquisitions of a stroke patient before and after Dotarem injection resulted in statistically nonsignificant differences in TSC quantification of relevant tissues and stroke areas (P > 0.05).
   Conclusions: Our study showed a quantitative influence of Dotarem and Gadovist on sodium relaxation times. However, quantification of TSC was not impaired, which was proven by worst case calculations and nonsignificant differences in vivo in an ischemic stroke patient. We suggest performing sodium imaging in useful clinical positions in protocols regardless of included Dotarem or Gadovist administrations. Being flexible in the study protocol design will strengthen ongoing sodium imaging investigations for various pathologies.

AB An imaging technique was used to investigate wetting behavior of wood-PVC composites in this study. Two-dimensional and time-dependent profiles of water droplets on maleated wood surface and wood-PVC interface were observed. Experimental results indicated that coupling agents Epolene E-43 (a maleated polypropylene copolymer with low molecular weight)- and polyethylene-maleic anhydride (PEMA)-treated veneers had a hydrophilic Surface, whereas the coupling agent Epolene G-3015 (a maleated polypropylene copolymer with high molecular weight)-treated veneer had a hydrophobic surface. For E43- and PEMA-treated veneers, a water droplet had an elliptical shape after initial contact with the wood surface. However, a sessile droplet on G-3015-treated specimens was closer to a circular shape. During wetting, contact an-le changes on E-43- and PEMA-treated specimens were larger than those on G-3015-treated specimens. Contact angles on maleated specimen with heat treatment and maleated interphases were almost independent of wetting time. Initial contact angle was influenced by coupling agent type. acid e, Pe number, and retention and directions of wood grains. Initial contact angle decreased with increase of E-43 I retention, but it was proportional to PEMA retention. However. it was independent of G-3015 retention. Wettability of fractured wood-PVC interface was similar to that of maleated wood surface with he-at treatment. Thus, the interfacial characteristics of wood-PVC interface can be simulated with maleated wood with heat treatment.

AB A new method based on modification of cloud point extraction for simultaneous enrichment of cadmium, lead and copper in water and fish muscle samples was proposed. The extraction efficiency by modified cloud point extraction (m-CPE) was compared with conventional cloud point extraction (c-CPE) method. The procedure for both CPE methods was comprised of formation of metal complexes with a hydrophobic chelating agent, dithizone, followed by entrapment of the chelates in a nonionic surfactant, Triton X-114. For c-CPE, the surfactant rich phase was treated with ethanolic solution of nitric acid and analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectrometer (FAAS). Whereas for m-CPE, aqueous nitric acid was used to back extract the metal ions from the surfactant rich phase and finally determined. The efficiency of the methods was tested by analyzing certified reference material and standard addition to a real sample. All the experimental parameters were optimized. At optimized experimental conditions, preconcentration and enhancement factors were 62.5 and 78.0 to 83.0 respectively for m-CPE, 25.0 and 56.0% higher than that of c-CPE. This improvement might be due to elimination of the effects of surfactant on the signal of analytes by FAAS. The developed method of m-CPE was applied successfully for analysis of the selected heavy metals in water and muscle tissues samples of fish of different lakes in Sindh, Pakistan.

AB The efficiency of spatial repellents and long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) is a key research topic in malaria control. Insecticidal nets reduce the mosquito-human contact rate and simultaneously decrease mosquito populations. However, LLINs demonstrate dissimilar efficiency against different species of malaria mosquitoes. Various factors have been proposed as an explanation, including differences in insecticide-induced mortality, flight characteristics, or persistence of attack. Here we present a discrete agent-based approach that enables the efficiency of LLINs, baited traps and Insecticide Residual Sprays (IRS) to be examined. The model is calibrated with hut-level experimental data to compare the efficiency of protection against two mosquito species: Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis. We show that while such data does not allow an unambiguous identification of the details of how LLINs alter the vector behavior, the model calibrations quantify the overall impact of LLINs for the two different mosquito species. The simulations are generalized to community-scale scenarios that systematically demonstrate the lower efficiency of the LLINs in control of An. arabiensis compared to An. gambiae.

AB The high penetration of distributed generation power plants, based on renewable energy sources (RESs), is boosting the connection of power converters to the electrical network. This generation concept would permit to form local networks, microgrids, when the main grid falls due to any kind of contingency in the network. However, the connection and disconnection of these local networks may give rise to undesired transient overcurrents that should be avoided. In order to solve this drawback, this paper presents a method oriented to carry out a stable intentional disconnection/reconnection of local grids from the main electrical network under grid-fault conditions. This control method has been implemented in a grid-connected power converter that acts as an intelligent connection agent (ICA) and adapts its operation mode according to its connection state. The proposed control also manages the operation of a controlled switch, which is responsible of disconnecting/reconnecting the microgrid from the mains. In this paper, the behavior of the ICA under transient conditions will be discussed, and finally, its simulated and experimental performance will be shown.

AB A general theoretical approach to the development of zero-thickness encapsulation models for contrast microbubbles is proposed. The approach describes a procedure that allows one to recast available rheological laws from the bulk form to a surface form which is used in a modified Rayleigh-Plesset equation governing the radial dynamics of a contrast microbubble. By the use of the proposed procedure, the testing of different rheological laws for encapsulation can be carried out. Challenges of existing shell models for lipid-encapsulated microbubbles, such as the dependence of shell parameters on the initial bubble radius and the "compression-only" behavior, are discussed. Analysis of the rheological behavior of lipid encapsulation is made by using experimental radius-time curves for lipid-coated microbubbles with radii in the range 1.2-2.5 mu m. The curves were acquired for a research phospholipid-coated contrast agent insonified with a 20 cycle, 3.0 MHz, 100 kPa acoustic pulse. The fitting of the experimental data by a model which treats the shell as a viscoelastic solid gives the values of the shell surface viscosity increasing from 0.30 x 10 (8) kg/s to 2.63 x 10 (8) kg/s for the range of bubble radii, indicated above. The shell surface elastic modulus increases from 0.054 N/m to 0.37 N/m. It is proposed that this increase may be a result of the lipid coating possessing the properties of both a shear-thinning and a strain-softening material. We hypothesize that these complicated rheological properties do not allow the existing shell models to satisfactorily describe the dynamics of lipid encapsulation. In the existing shell models, the viscous and the elastic shell terms have the linear form which assumes that the viscous and the elastic stresses acting inside the lipid shell are proportional to the shell shear rate and the shell strain, respectively, with constant coefficients of proportionality. The analysis performed in the present paper suggests that a more general, nonlinear theory may be more appropriate. It is shown that the use of the nonlinear theory for shell viscosity allows one to model the "compression-only" behavior. As an example, the results of the simulation for a 2.03 mu m radius bubble insonified with a 6 cycle, 1.8 MHz, 100 kPa acoustic pulse are given. These parameters correspond to the acoustic conditions under which the "compression-only" behavior was observed by de Jong et al. [Ultrasound Med. Biol. 33 (2007) 653-656]. It is also shown that the use of the Cross law for the modeling of the shear-thinning behavior of shell viscosity reduces the variance of experimentally estimated values of the shell viscosity and its dependence on the initial bubble radius.

AB Shape memory polymer composites have attracted significant attention due to novel properties and great applications. In this article, we focus on the fabrication and simulation of polyurethane/polycaprolactone nanocomposites. The polyurethane/polycaprolactone blends containing ZnO nanoparticles (5 to 30 wt%) are fabricated using a solution mixing and casting method. It is found that significant improvement of polyurethane/polycaprolactone composites in Young's modulus is achieved by incorporating 20 wt% of ZnO nanoparticles; also, the results of the shape recovery ratio reveal that adding an optimum amount of ZnO (the reinforcement) can increase the shape recovery ratio (for 20 wt% of ZnO). These results could most likely be explained by the fact that some particles restrict the hard segment-soft segment interactions and provide more mobility to polycaprolactone components, while the other nanoparticles can act as the nucleating agent for polycaprolactone chains. A generalized Maxwell model is then used to examine the shape memory behavior of shape memory polymer composites. The dynamic mechanical thermal analysis results are utilized to define the model coefficients and the simulation is carried out to determine the shape recovery ratio. Simulation of this shape recovery ratio for shape memory polymer composites reveals that the numerical results are in good agreement with those of the experimental data.

AB Metallic foams are new materials mainly produced by expansion in a proper chamber and mainly characterized by internal voids: a material characterized by a very low density is obtained in this way. A lot of foamed components are commonly produced, directly by injecting a gas or foaming agent into molten metal inside a closed die. However, secondary operations on these materials can play an important role in order to enhance the foam production flexibility. From the above considerations, the deformation behaviour of an aluminium foam was investigated by compression tests. The study compares three different numerical analyses highlighting their points of strength and weakness in order to verify their applicability in process design. More in detail, two models based on the implicit formulation were investigated; in one case, the billet material was set as porous object with the material density which was calculated and updated as part of the simulation. The second implicit analysis. instead, was built using the plastic material formulation; the porosity, in this case, was physically created introducing voids within the workpiece.
   The latter simulation class was carried out through an explicit investigation; an efficient model construction was proposed introducing spherical surfaces connected each other with plans. Experimental data were used to validate the calculated results and a discussion concerning the three different numerical analyses was finally reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND Selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) is a proven technique to lessen nitric oxide (NO) emissions from stationary sources. However, the process using ammonia or urea as a reducing agent is only effective in a narrow and high temperature window, with the maximum NO abatement declining when increasing the oxygen (O-2) content. Large industrial boilers may be often under a variable load and an excess of O-2, which could decrease the effectiveness of the de-NOx process. This study investigated hydrazine (N2H4) as a reagent to improve SNCR performance. RESULTS NO reduction by N2H4 was experimentally investigated in a pilot-scale flow reactor. The effect of reaction temperature, molar ratio of NH2 to NO (normalized stoichiometric ratio, NSR), initial NO level and O-2 concentration on the NO reduction in flue gas containing 7.4-17.4% (v/v) O-2 at temperatures between 450 and 1100 degrees C was determined. The experimental results indicated that NO reduction by N2H4 was possible in dual temperature ranges, and the optimum reaction temperatures were about 580 and 1060 degrees C at NSR = 2.0. Moreover, the N2H4-NO reaction is less O-2-sensitive. A chemical kinetic model was developed to correctly describe the non-catalytic reduction of NO by N2H4 in the presence of O-2. CONCLUSION Hydrazine-based SNCR is an alternative method for NO reduction occurring in dual temperature ranges and excess O-2. The present model provided a satisfactory prediction of the experimental results, offering an effective tool for process simulation over a wide range of operating conditions.

AB This document provides the specification of the Process Interchange Format (PIF) version 1.2. The goal of this work is to develop an interchange format to help automatically exchange process descriptions among a wide variety of business process modelling and support systems such as workflow software, flow charting tools, planners, process simulation systems and process repositories. Instead of having to write ad hoc translators for each pair of such systems each system will only need to have a single translator for converting process descriptions in that system into and out of the common PIF format. Then any system will be able to automatically exchange basic process descriptions with any other system. This document describes the PIE-CORE 1.2, i.e. the core set of object types (such as activities, agents and prerequisite relations) that can be used to describe the basic elements of any process. The document also describes a framework for extending the core set of object types to include additional information needed in specific applications. These extended descriptions are exchanged in such a way that the common elements are interpretable by any PIF translator, and the additional elements are interpretable by any translator that knows about the extensions. The PIF format was developed by a working group including representatives from several universities and companies, and has been used for experimental automatic translations among systems developed independently at three of these sites. This document is being distributed in the hopes that other groups will comment upon the interchange format proposed here, and that this format (or future versions of it) may be useful to other groups as well. The PIF Document 1.0 was released in December 1994, and the current document reports the revised PIF that incorporate the feedback received since then.

AB This research compares the rheological behavior of different cold-recycled mixtures (CRMs) produced in-place through full-depth reclamation. Reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) obtained from the milling of the old asphalt layers was blended with reclaimed unbound aggregate from the existing subgrade. Asphalt emulsion, foamed asphalt, and portland cement were employed as stabilizing agents. The complex modulus was measured on cylindrical cores, applying a sinusoidal strain with an amplitude of 30 microstrain at testing temperatures ranging from 0 degrees C to 50 degrees C and frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 20 Hz. The Huet-Sayegh (HS) rheological model was applied to simulate the experimental data. The results showed that the behavior of CRM is thermo- and frequency-dependent and that the time-temperature superposition principle can be applied. The HS model provides an excellent fitting of the dynamic modulus data, whereas fitting of the loss angle data was improved, introducing a temperature- and frequency-independent correction. The RAP influences the rheological behavior, but viscous dissipation is mainly due to the asphalt-stabilizing agents (emulsion residue or foamed asphalt).

TI On combining recursive partitioning and simulated annealing to detect
   groups of biologically active compounds
SO JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL INFORMATION AND COMPUTER SCIENCES

ID DESCRIPTORS; SETS
AB Statistical data mining methods have proven to be powerful tools for investigating correlations between molecular structure and biological activity. Recursive partitioning (RP), in particular, offers several advantages in mining large, diverse data sets resulting from high throughput screening. When used with binary molecular descriptors, the standard implementation of RP splits on single descriptors. We use simulated annealing (SA) to find combinations of molecular descriptors whose simultaneous presence best separates off the most active, chemically similar group of compounds. The search is incorporated into a recursive partitioning design to produce a regression tree for biological activity on the space of structural fingerprints. Each node is characterized by a specific combination of structural features, and the terminal nodes with high average activities correspond, roughly, to different classes of compounds. Using LeadScope structural features as descriptors to mine a database from the National Cancer Institute, the merging of RP and SA consistently identifies structurally homogeneous classes of highly potent anticancer agents.

ID EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENTS
AB This paper attempts to evaluate the role of wide spreading accounting education and strengthens the governmental supervision for accounting disclosure process to reduce information asymmetry level in capital market and also increase the protection of stockholders and other financial information users' rights. In order to test the hypotheses, a suitable questionnaire with some questions about current conditions of forging factors' role in highlighting and improving understandability of accounting information for different users was used. A total of 281 questionnaires were distributed among agents of Iranian financial society after assuring of its validity and reliability. Collected data is tested by Mann-Whitney and Spearman's correlation statistical methods. The results show that in comparison with the academics, practitioners and professionals are more willing to wide spreading general accounting education and increasing governmental supervision and also practitioners complain more about lack of adequate governmental supervision, the same as stockholders' weak protection laws and also inconvenience of current general education of accounting information usage. The results also revealed that in contrast to experience, education, and gender variables as fields of education which do not have significant effect on the perceiving importance of role of two forgoing factors, but participants' age are reversely related to the perceiving importance of those factors. This result is in accordance with preceding findings which finally leads SEC to issue Regulation Fair Disclosure Rule in October 2000 (Previts et al., 2005). This regulation prohibits firms from disclosing value relevant information to selective capital market participants without simultaneously disclosing the same information publicly. A key technical result is that the primary condition to improve accounting system usefulness, needs concentrating not only on the quality of information or optimal level of accounting disclosure, but also on the increasing efforts to improve education of accounting information application ways and strengthen accounting regulating authorities for assuring the perpetual and the fairness manner of releasing accounting information to meet all users' and market contributors' needs. The paper will be of interest to professional bodies to support and empower their accounting regulatory bodies' activities in order to assure fairly releases of accounting information and also to academics investigation of the condition and value of accounting education and its prescribed rules. The paper reports an original application of the role of wide spreading accounting general education as well as strengthening government presence in the capital market to improve financial wisdom in Iran's financial society.

AB Objectives: This work was conducted to study the prophylactic efficacy of 2 topical antibiotic ointments (mupirocin and nitrofurazone) against wound infection in experimental contaminated crush wounds.
   Methods: Male Wistar rats underwent two 2-cm incisions at the back side and randomized into 3 groups-placebo (n = 14), inupirocin (n = 14), and nitrofurazone (n 14)-and infected with either Staphylococcus aureus or S. pyogenes. All wound edges were crushed for 5 seconds with hemostats to simulate crush injury before inoculation of the microorganisms. Half of the wounds were sutured and the other half left open. These wounds were treated 3 times daily for 6 days with topical mupirocin, nitrofurazone, or petrolatum (as placebo). At the end of 6 days, excisional biopsies were taken from wound edges and histopathologic assessments were made based on neutrophilic infiltration, edema formation, myofibroblastic proliferation, and granulation tissue formation. For the microbiologic assessments, quantitative tissue cultures were made.
   Results: In S aureus-inoculated wounds, mupirocin showed higher antibacterial activity against bacterial colonization and reduced infection rates compared to placebo groups. The same effect was observed for the infection rates in S pyogenes-inoculated wounds. In S pyogenes-inoculated open wounds, nitrofurazone showed higher antibacterial activity against infection, but this effect was not observed in closed wounds. In S. pyogenes- and S aureus-infected wounds, inupirocin treatment significantly lowered infection rates compared to nitrofurazone treatment. Histopathologic examination showed higher myofibroblastic proliferation and higher volume of granulation tissue in the nitrofurazon groups compared to the mupirocin groups.
   Conclusion: Topical mupirocin application was effective against crush wound infections inoculated with S pyogenes and S aureus. Nitrofurazone provides better granulation tissue formation, but did not effectively prevent bacterial colonization and infection in crush contaminated wounds. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB The proportion of vibrio E, dominant in healthy turbot larvae, was artificially increased in the rotifer enrichment medium. The maid effect of this vibrio enrichment was to improve the resistance of larval turbot challenged with a pathogenic strain of Vibrio splendidus, vibrio P. The improvement of the survival rates was significant with 1.5 x 10(6) CFU of vibrio E added per mi of enrichment medium, and it was still maximum at the hi hest dose tested (5 x 10(7) CFU.ml(-1); 80 +/- 2% of survivors after 48 h of challenge, versus 50 +/- 2 % for the control group).
   Further in vitro characterisation showed that vibrio E was able to grow in the presence of the chelating agents EDDHA and EDTA, while producing siderophore, as revealed by chrome azurol S dyeing. The pathogenic vibrio P did not grow on iron-depleted medium, and it did not seem to produce siderophore. Consequently, a second experiment attempted to appraise the role of iron availability in the interaction between the pathogenic and probiotic vibrios. To this end, turbot larvae were fed with rotifers treated by the bacterial siderophore deferoxamine. This treatment significantly increased the resistance of larvae challenged with vibrio P in comparison with the control group, but to a lesser extent than the group enriched with vibrio E. There was also an increase of the growth rate due to either the siderophore treatment or the vibrio enrichment, as well. No further improvement was observed when the rotifers were simultaneously both treated and enriched. It was concluded that the probiotic effect of vibrio E may be at least partly due to competition for iron with the pathogen.

AB In this paper, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out to explore the influence of surface modification of glass fiber on interfacial binding energy and failure behavior of GF/PEEK composites. The silane coupling agent and sulfonated PEEK (SPEEK) are employed to modify the surface of glass fibers (GF), and the results reveal that the SPEEK can be employed as an adhesive sizing agent to improve the interfacial bonding strength of GF/PEEK composites. In addition, the synergistic mechanism of non-bonding and mechanical interlocking is investigated by using MD simulations. The interface shear simulation results demonstrate that the interfacial shear strength of composite increased and more resin molecules are found on the surface after SPEEK is incorporated into the GF surface. Moreover, compared with surface-untreated short GF-reinforced PEEK composite, the experimental results demonstrate that the tensile and bending strength of SGF/PEEK composite are improved after interface modification with SPEEK by 21.4% and 30.2%, respectively. The current study presents the utilization of MD simulation for interface design to enhance the mechanical properties of fiber reinforced PEEK composites.

AB The photoluminescence (PL) emission from zinc sulfide (ZnS) synthesized by the microwave-assisted solvothermal method in the presence/absence of a capping agent was examined to understand the key role of its PL activity. In addition, we also investigated the electronic structure using a first-principle calculation based on density functional theory (DFT) applied to periodic models at B.LYP level. Two models were selected to simulate the effects of structural deformation on the electronic structure; the ordered o-ZnS model and the disordered d-ZnS model, dislocating the Zn atom, 0.1 angstrom, in the z-direction. The PLemission in the visible region showed different peak positions and intensities in capped and uncapped ZnS. The PL emission was linked to distinct distortions in lattices and the emission of two colors, green in the capped and blue in the uncapped, was also examined in the light of favorable structural and electronic conditions. The computational simulations indicate that the electronic behavior can be associated with the new electronic levels above the valence band. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB Reduction leaching behaviors of Fe and Mn from an iron-rich manganese oxide ore using waste tobacco stem concrete as reducing agent were investigated in this paper with a view to determining the feasibility of tobacco stem concrete used in reduction leaching of Mn from iron-rich manganese oxide ore. Results indicated that the leaching processes of Fe and Mn were both dominated by internal diffusion, but the effects of leaching parameters on leaching ratios of Fe and Mn were different based on established leaching kinetic equations. The leaching ratio of Mn reached up to 96.18% while that of Fe kept a lower concentration (17.66%) under optimal leaching conditions, which achieved high selectivity recovery of Mn from iron-rich manganese oxide ore. In addition, the leached solution can be used as electrolytic stock solution in the production of electrolytic manganese. Characterization of the obtained electrolytic manganese product indicated that the quality of electrolytic manganese fully met the standards of YB/T051-2003, which disclosing a novel recycling approach of utilizing the resource coming from the tobacco industry.

Body weight, blood pressure, and blood levels of lipids, glucose, insulin, and inflammatory markers were measured. Co-administration of CLA and telmisartan resulted in significant (P < 0.05) reductions in body weight, visceral fat, serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, plasma insulin concentrations, and systolic blood pressure compared with those in the control group. Moreover, plasma levels of IL1-alpha and IFN-gamma were reduced and levels of IL1-beta, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10, plus TNF-alpha were increased in the co-therapy group, compared with controls. In conclusion, this study suggests that a combination of CLA with telmisartan may modify several risk factors of cardiovascular disease commonly seen in metabolic syndrome. This combination of nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals may be a safe and cost-effective strategy in a number of high-risk subjects. Future studies will further document clinical benefits of such combination therapy.

AB Respiratory diseases are responsible for major economic losses in poultry farms. While in most cases a single pathogen is not alone responsible for the clinical outcome, the impact of co-infections is not well known, especially in turkeys. The purpose of this study was to assess the possible synergism between Escherichia coli (O78) and low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV, H6N1), in the turkey model. Four-week-old commercial turkeys were inoculated with either H6N1, O78 or both agents simultaneously or three days apart. We have established an experimental infection model of turkeys using aerosolization that better mimics field infections. Birds were observed clinically and swabbed on a daily basis. Necropsies were performed at 4 and 14 days post single or dual inoculation and followed by histological and immunohistochemical analyses. Combined LPAIV/E. coli infections resulted in more severe clinical signs, were associated with higher mortality and respiratory organ lesions (mucous or fibrinous exudative material in lungs and air sacs), in comparison with the groups given single infections (P<0.05). The time interval or the sequence between H6N1 and E. coli inoculation (none or three days) did not have a significant effect on the outcome of the dual infection and disease although slightly greater (P>0.05) respiratory signs were observed in turkeys of the E. coli followed by H6N1 inoculated group. Microscopic lesions and immunohistochemical staining supported clinical and macroscopic findings. Efficient virus and bacteria replication was observed in all inoculated groups. E. coli and H6N1 thus exercise an additive or synergistic pathogenic effect in the reproduction of respiratory disease.

AB BackgroundBlood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are useful methods for investigating the morphology and function of the kidneys, including revealing unilateral renal damage. Nevertheless, these techniques have not yet been applied for bilateral renal function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the combination of DTI and BOLD could be used to examine different degrees of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) in bilateral kidneys compared to standard methods such as serum creatinine (SCr) detection.MethodsForty-Two New Zealand white rabbits were divided into two groups: the experimental group and the control group. Physiological saline and iodine contrast agent (iohexol, 1.0g iodine/kg, 1.0ml/sec) were injected via the right renal artery. DTI and BOLD-MR data were acquired longitudinally at the baseline and 1, 24, 48, and 72h after high-pressure syringe injection to measure the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), fractional anisotropy (FA) and relative transverse relaxation rate (R2*). After the MR scan at each time point, three rabbits in each group were sacrificed, and changes in SCr and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) were analyzed using histopathology and immunochemistry.ResultsTwenty-four hours after iohexol administration, the values of ADC and FA decreased significantly (P<0.05), while R2* values increased (P<0.05) in the renal cortex (CO), outer medulla (OM) and inner medulla (IM). Besides, significant negative correlations were observed among ADC, FA, and R2* in CO, OM, and IM (all P<0.001, r=-0.654-0.828).ConclusionsDTI and BOLD can simultaneously and non-invasively assess different degrees of CI-AKI in bilateral kidneys.

AB Background Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a highly curable disease when treated with all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The combination of ATO and ATRA has become the standard therapeutic protocol for induction therapy in non-high-risk APL. An oral arsenic realgar-indigo naturalis formula (RIF) has also showed high efficacy and it has a more convenient route of administration than the standard intravenous regimen. Unlike in previous trials, the arsenical agent was used simultaneously with ATRA during post-remission therapy in this trial. Methods This study was designed as a multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The trial has a non-inferiority design with superiority being explored if non-inferiority is identified. All patients receive ATRA-ATO during the induction therapy. After achieving hematologic complete remission (HCR), patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive treatment with ATRA-RIF (experimental group) or ATRA-ATO (control group) as the consolidation therapy. During the consolidation therapy, the two groups receive ATRA plus RIF or intravenous ATO 2 weeks on and 2 to similar to 4 weeks off until molecular complete remission (MCR), then ATRA and oral RIF 2 weeks on and 2 to similar to 4 weeks off giving a total of six courses. Discussion This trial aims to compare the efficacy of ATRA-ATO versus ATRA-RIF in non-high-risk patients with APL, to demonstrate that oral RIF application reduces the total hospitalization days and medical costs. The simple schedule was studied in this trial.

TI Hyper-branched sensing polymer directly constructed on a resonant
   micro-cantilever for the detection of trace chemical vapor
SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY
LA English
DT Article
ID ORGANOPHOSPHORUS VAPOR; SENSORS; WARFARE; FILMS
AB A hyper-branched polymer is layer-by-layer self-assembled on a resonant micro-cantilever and, then, functionalized with sensing-terminals for the specific detection of the trace chemical vapor of dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP, a typical simulant for nerve agents). The hyper-branched polymer is directly constructed on the SiO2 surface of the cantilever via an A(2) + B-4 layer-by-layer route, where A(2) and B-4 are complementary interacting groups which undergo coupled linking. After modification with 4-(2-(4-(allyloxy)phenyl)-1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoropropan-2-yl)phenol (APHFPP) groups specific to DMMP, the high specific-surface-area hyper-branched polymer provides very dense sensing sites to adsorb a great number of DMMP molecules for micro-gravimetric detection. Moreover, the sensing polymer possesses a "more branches but fewer roots" configuration on the cantilever surface to depress the cross-talk effect caused by adsorption induced cantilever spring-stiffening. Experimental results indicate that, self-assembled with the hyper-branched sensing polymer, the resonant cantilevers exhibit rapid and reproducible detection of trace DMMP (with the detection limit lower than 7.2 ppb) and effectively depressed parasitic frequency-shift from the cantilever spring stiffening effect. In addition, the sensor features satisfactory selectivity in the presence of water and organic solvents. When an alternative sensing-group of 2-allylhexafluoroisopropanol (AHFIP) is modified on the hyper-branched architecture, the cantilever becomes specifically sensitive to trace explosive vapor. Therefore, the developed technique for the functionalization of hyper-branched polymer directly grown on a cantilever provides a widely usable micro/nano sensing-platform for the detection of trace chemical vapors.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID AGGREGATION; REMOVAL; BLIND; MODEL; TASK
AB When an ant dies within a nest, a worker ant carries its corpse away from the nest and drops it onto a pile known as an ant cemetery. These ant cemeteries form cluster patterns, and the dynamics of the corpse piles have been studied experimentally. The aim of the present study was to investigate how sensitivity to the presence of nest-mates would influence the corpse-carrying behaviour of ants, and how this would impact the dynamics of corpse pile clustering. This was achieved by developing an agent-based computational model in which simulated 'ants' (the agents) carry and drop 'corpses', resulting in the growth of the corpse pile. In the model, the probability of an ant dropping a corpse was tuned according to the presence or absence of nest-mates. The pile dynamics of the resulting model showed a partial match with the time series evolution of corpse piles observed with real ants in previous experimental studies. Although the switch of probabilities is a thought experiment, our results suggest that the corpse-carrying behaviour of worker ants might be influenced by interactions with their nestmates because there is evidence that ant behaviour can be influenced by encounter rates.

AB Dispersal of functional microorganisms is a rate-limiting process during in situ bioremediation of contaminated soil and groundwater. In this work, series of column experiments were conducted to investigate the retention and transport behaviors of Herbaspirillum chlorophenolicum FA1, a promising bacterial agent for bioremediation, in saturated porous media under conditions of different combinations of grain size, solution pH, solution ionic strength (IS), and humic acid (HA) concentration. Experimental data showed that the mobility of FA1 in saturated porous media was strongly dependent on the physicochemical conditions. The breakthrough curves (BTCs) indicated that the amounts of FA1 in the effluent increased with increasing in sand size, solution pH, and HA concentration, but decreased with increase of solution IS. The shape of retention profiles (RPs) was hyper-exponential. The amounts of retained bacteria in the media also varied with the experimental conditions with opposite trends to that of effluent. Both experimental BTCs and RPs were simulated by a mathematical model that accounted for deposition kinetics to better interpret the effects of physicochemical conditions on FA1 deposition dynamics. Findings from this study showed that fate and transport of the functional bacterium FA1 in porous media strongly relied on the environmental conditions. Both experimental and modeling results can provide guidelines for field application of functional bacteria for soil and groundwater remediation.

AB Introduction and goal: Proinflammatory cytokines and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) play an important role in the pathophysiology of osteolysis and implant loosening. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of pharmacological agents in the inhibition of Interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and PGE(2) in explants of interface membranes from failed total hip replacements (fTHR).
   Material and methods: Membranes from fTHR were retrieved (N=20) and explants were incubated for 72 h in the absence or presence of tenidap at three different concentrations (5, 20 or 50 mug/ml) or diclofenac; (125 mug/l). IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and PGE(2) levels were measured in the culture medium using ELISA Capture or EIA kits. Statistical analysis was done using the Mann-Whitney U-test.
   Results: A statistically significant inhibition in IL-1beta synthesis was found at tenidap concentrations of 20 mug/ml (71.3%, P<0.05) and 50 mug/ml (79.3%, P<0.02). Tenidap reduced IL-6 levels by 90.4% at 20 mug/ml (P<0.005) and 96.0% (P<0.05) at 50 mug/ml. Tenidap also reduced the synthesis of TNF-alpha. by 66.9% (P<0.05) and 77.4% at concentrations of 20 mug/ml and 50 mug/ml. Tenidap had a marked suppressive effect of over 90% (P<0.0001) on PGE(2) synthesis in all three concentrations. Diclofenac (125 mug/l) decreased PGE(2) production by 95% (P<0.0001), but had no significant effect in IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels in the culture medium.
   Conclusion: The ability to simultaneously suppress the release of proinflammatory cytokines and PGE2 may help control osteolysis and prevent aseptic loosening of THR. This effect could increase implant longevity and lead the way to the pharmacological treatment of this pathology.

AB Large numbers of acoustic signals from single lipid-shelled Definity (R) microbubbles have been measured using a calibrated microacoustic system and a two population response observed. Theoretical results based on the Mooney-Rivlin strain softening shell model have been used to identify these populations as primary resonant and off-primary resonant scatter. An experimentally measured size distribution was used to provide the initial resting radius for the simulations, and the responses agree well with the experimental data. In this way, the primary resonant or off-primary resonant behavior of a microbubble can be studied, with potential benefits to both signal processing techniques and microbubble manufacture.

AB Modeling complex collective animal movement presents distinct challenges. In particular, modeling the interactions between animals and the nonlinear behaviors associated with these interactions, while accounting for uncertainty in data, model, and parameters, requires a flexible modeling framework. To address these challenges, we propose a general hierarchical framework for modeling collective movement behavior with multiple stages. Each of these stages can be thought of as processes that are flexible enough to model a variety of complex behaviors. For example, self-propelled particle (SPP) models (e.g., Vicsek et al. in Phys Rev Lett 75:1226-1229, 1995) represent collective behavior and are often applied in the physics and biology literature. To date, the study and application of these models has almost exclusively focused on simulation studies, with less attention given to rigorously quantifying the uncertainty. Here, we demonstrate our general framework with a hierarchical version of the SPP model applied to collective animal movement. This structure allows us to make inference on potential covariates (e.g., habitat) that describe the behavior of agents and rigorously quantify uncertainty. Further, this framework allows for the discrete time prediction of animal locations in the presence of missing observations. Due to the computational challenges associated with the proposed model, we develop an approximate Bayesian computation algorithm for estimation. We illustrate the hierarchical SPP methodology with a simulation study and by modeling the movement of guppies.

AB In vitro model systems are used to study epithelial cell growth, morphogenesis, differentiation, and transition to cancer-like forms. MDCK cell lines (from immortalized kidney epithelial cells) are widely used examples. Prominent in vitro phenotypic attributes include stable cyst formation in embedded culture, inverted cyst formation in suspension culture, and lumen formation in overlay culture. We present a low-resolution system analogue in which space, events, and time are discretized; object interaction uses a two-dimensional grid similar to a cellular automaton. The framework enables "cell" agents to act independent using an embedded logic based on axioms. In silico growth and morphology can mimic in vitro observations in four different simulated environments. Matched behaviors include stable "cyst" formation. The in silico system is designed to facilitate experimental exploration of outcomes from changing components and features, including the embedded logic (the in silico analogue of a mutation or epigenetic change). Some simulated behaviors are sensitive to changes in logic. In two cases, the change caused cancer-like growth patterns to emerge.

AB In addition to improving image contrast, microbubbles have shown great potential in molecular imaging and drug/gene delivery. Previous work by the authors showed that considerable improvements in gene transfection efficiency were obtained using microbubbles loaded with magnetic nanoparticles under simultaneous exposure to ultrasound and magnetic fields. The aim of this study was to characterise the effect of nanoparticles on the dynamic and acoustic response of the microbubbles. High-speed video microscopy indicated that the amplitude of oscillation was very similar for magnetic and nonmagnetic microbubbles of the same size for the same ultrasound exposure (0.5 MHz, 100 kPa, 12-cycle pulse) and that this was minimally affected by an imposed magnetic field. The linear scattering to attenuation ratio (STAR) was also similar for suspensions of both bubble types although the nonlinear STAR was similar to 50% lower for the magnetic microbubbles. Both the video and acoustic data were supported by the results from theoretical modelling. (E-mail: eleanor.stride@eng.ox.ac.uk) (C) 2012 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology.

AB A combination of drugs may be preferred over the use of a single agent to induce deep sedation. A synergistic interaction between the drugs reduces the dose requirements of the drugs thereby minimising the unwanted side effects associated with each drug and improving recovery. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the suitability of dexmedetomidine and dexmedetomidine in combination with midazolam-fentanyl or midazolam-fentanyl-ketamine for different levels of sedation, analgesia and anaesthesia in dogs. In a prospective, blinded, randomised clinical trial, 12 mixed breed dogs were divided into three groups. Animals of Group I were injected with dexmedetomidine 20 mu g/kg. Animals of Group H received 20 mu g/kg dexmedetomidine + 0.2 mg/kg midazolam + 4 mu g/kg fentanyl and animals of Group III were administered with 20 mu g/kg dexmedetomidine + 0.2 mg/kg midazolam + 4 mu g/kg fentanyl + 10 mg/kg ketamine. All the drugs were given simultaneously via the intramuscular route. Jaw relaxation, palpebral reflex, pedal reflex and response to intubation were recorded and graded on a numerical scale. Values of heart rate, respiratory rate, rectal temperature and mean arterial pressure were recorded at baseline and then at predetermined intervals up to 120 min. Onset of sedation time, onset of recumbency time, time to return of righting reflex, standing recovery time and complete recovery time were recorded. Maximal muscle relaxation, sedation and analgesia were observed in animals of Group III, which was followed in decreasing order by Groups II and I. Heart rate decreased significantly (P < 0.05) after administration of drugs in Groups I and II but a significant (P < 0.05) increase was recorded in Group III. Respiratory rate decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in all the groups. Rectal temperature decreased non-significantly in all the groups. Mean arterial pressure initially increased significantly (P < 0.01) in Groups I and III followed by a decrease in Group I, but in Group III it remained above the base line. In Group II, MAP decreased throughout the study period. Onset of sedation time and onset of recumbency time were significantly (P < 0.05) shorter in Group III as compared to Group I. Time to return of righting reflex, standing recovery time and complete recovery time did not differ significantly between the groups. It is concluded that dexmedetomidine provides a reliable moderate sedation and analgesia. Addition of midazolam and fentanyl enhances sedation, analgesia and muscle relaxation induced by dexmedetomidine. Addition of ketamine produced deep sedation and complete anaesthesia with lesser cardiopulmonary depression. Thus, dexmedetomidine can be used safely in combination with midazolam, fentanyl and ketamine for different levels of sedation, analgesia and anaesthesia in dogs.

AB Statement of problem. Whether topical anticaries medicaments used in the oral environment will affect the surface integrity of restorative materials is uncertain.
   Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of various anticaries agents on the surface roughness of 3 different restorative materials.
   Material and methods. Sixty-four specimens of each restorative material (feldspathic porcelain, Ni-Cr metal ceramic alloy, and Ti-6Al-4V titanium alloy) were prepared and separated into 4 equal groups for soaking in anticaries agents (Prevident Dental Rinse, ACT mouth wash, chlorhexidine gluconate, and water). A profilometer was used to measure surface roughness before and after soaking the materials for 2 years of simulated usage. The mean change in surface roughness for each specimen was calculated. Statistical analysis was performed with a 2-way ANOVA, followed by the Tukey HSD test (alpha=.05).
   Results. A significant interaction was found between the materials and anticaries agents (F=2.64, P=.02). The significant interaction was between Prevident and chlorhexidine gluconate. Porcelain specimens soaked in Prevident produced a negative change (-0.072 +/- 0.35 gm) in surface roughness (smoother surface), while chlorhexidine gluconate produced a positive change (0.094 +/- 0.42 mu m) in surface roughness (rougher surface).
   Conclusion. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, it can be concluded that Prevident Dental Rinse and chlorhexidine gluconate may cause a change in the surface roughness of feldspathic porcelain.

AB Social behavior confers numerous benefits to animals but also risks, among them an increase in the spread of pathogenic diseases. We examined the trade-off between risk of predation and disease transmission under different scenarios of host spatial structure and disease avoidance behavior using a spatially explicit, individual-based model of the host pathogen interaction between juvenile Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) and Panulirus argus Virus 1 (PaV1). Spiny lobsters are normally social but modify their behavior to avoid diseased conspecifics, a potentially effective means of reducing transmission but one rarely observed in the wild. We found that without lobster avoidance of diseased conspecifics, viral outbreaks grew in intensity and duration in simulations until the virus was maintained continuously at unrealistically high levels. However, when we invoked disease avoidance at empirically observed levels, the intensity and duration of outbreaks was reduced and the disease extirpated within five years. Increased lobster (host) spatial aggregation mimicking that which occurs when sponge shelters for lobsters are diminished by harmful algal blooms, did not significantly increase PaV1 transmission or persistence in lobster populations. On the contrary, behavioral aversion of diseased conspecifics effectively reduced viral prevalence, even when shelters were limited, which reduced shelter availability for all lobsters but increased predation, especially of infected lobsters. Therefore, avoidance of diseased conspecifics selects against transmission by contact, promotes alternative modes of transmission, and results in a more resilient host pathogen system.

AB Although islands as natural laboratories have held the attention of scientists for centuries, they continue to offer new study questions, especially in the context of the current biodiversity crisis. To date, habitat diversity on islands and spatial configuration of archipelagos have received less attention than classical island area and isolation. Moreover, in the field where experiments are impossible, correlative methods have dominated, despite the call for more mechanistic approaches. We developed an agent-based computer simulation to study the effect of habitat diversity and archipelago configuration on plant species richness and composition in five archipelagos worldwide (Hawaii, Galapagos, Canary Islands, Cape Verde and Azores) and compared simulated diversity patterns to the empirical data. Habitat diversity proved to be an important factor to achieve realistic simulation results in all five archipelagos, whereas spatial structure of archipelagos was important in more elongated archipelagos. In most cases, simulation results correlate stronger with spermatophyte than with pteridophyte data, which we suggest can be attributed to the different dispersal and evolution rates of the two species groups. Correlation strength between simulated and observed diversity also varied among archipelagos, suggesting that geological and biogeographic histories of archipelagos have affected the species richness and composition on the islands. Our study demonstrates that a relatively simple computer simulation involving just a few essential processes can largely emulate patterns of archipelagic species richness and composition and serve as a powerful additional method to complement empirical approaches.

AB Introduction: Accidental and suicidal exposures to organophosphorus compounds (OPC) are frequent. The inhibition of esterases by OPC leads to an endogenous ACh poisoning. Recently, the FDA approved, based on animal experiments, for military combat medical use oral pyridostigmine (PSTG) for pre-exposure treatment of soman; the concept is to block the cholinesterase reversibly using the carbamate pyridostigmine in order to deny access to the active site of the enzyme to the irreversible inhibitor (OPC) on subsequent exposure. We have shown previously that tiapride (TIA) is in vitro a weak inhibitor of AChE. We also have shown recently that in rats coadministration of TIA with the organophosphate paraoxon significantly decreases mortality without having an impact on red blood cell cholinesterase (RBC-AChE) activity.
   Purpose of the study: To establish in a prospective, non-blinded study in a rat model of acute high dose OPC (paraoxon; POX) exposure the ideal point in time for TIA pre-treatment administration and to correlate it with measured TIA plasma levels.
   Material and Methods: There were six groups of rats in each cycle of the experiment and each group contained six rats. The procedure was repeated twelve times (cycles) (n = 72 for each arm; half male and half female). All substances were applied ip.
   All groups (1-6) received 1 mu Mol POX (approximate to LD75); groups 1-5 also received 50 mu Mol TIA at different points in time.
   Group 1 (G(1)): TIA 120 min before POX
   Group 2 (G(2)): TIA 90 min before POX,
   Group 3 (G(3)): TIA 60 min before POX,
   Group 4 (G(4)): TIA 30 min before POX,
   Group 5 (G(5)): TIA & POX simultaneously,
   Group 6 (G(6)): POX only.
   The animals were monitored for 48 hours and mortality/survival times were recorded at 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 24 and 48 h. AChE activities were determined at 30 min, 24 and 48 h in surviving animals.
   Statistical analysis was performed on the mortality data, cumulative survival times and enzyme activity data. Mortality data was compared using Kaplan-Meier plots. Cumulative survival times and enzyme activites were compared using the Mann-Whitney rank order test. No Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied and an alpha <= 0.05 was considered significant.
   Results: Mortality is statistically significantly reduced by TIA pre-treatment at all points-in-time. Highest protection is achieved if TIA is given 90 to 0 min before OPC exposure. The reduction in mortality is not correlated to TIA plasma levels (C-max approximate to 120 min post ip-administration). TIA pre- treatment is not affecting AChE activity regardless of the timing of administration.
   Conclusion: The lack of correlation between TIA plasma levels and degree of mortality reduction as well as the lack of protective effect on enzyme activity seem to indicate that the site of action of TIA is not the blood. While our hypothesis that TIA would protect AChE in a pyridostigmine-like manner (via protection of the enzyme) could not be confirmed, the reduction in mortality with TIA pre-treatment is nevertheless of potential interest.

AB Matrix habitats are known to influence the movement patterns of a variety of species but it is less well known whether these effects have strong implications for spatial population dynamics, including the spread of biological introductions. Using a spatially explicit simulation model parameterized with empirical data, we examine how grass and shrub matrix habitats, each offering different resistance to dispersal, influence the spread and impact of a biocontrol agent, Aphthona lacertosa, on the invasive weed, leafy spurge. Model predictions indicate that differential responses to matrix habitat have little effect on the agent's spread over the study landscape and this is supported by statistical models fit to observed A. lacertosa incidence on the same landscape. Subsequent experimentation with the simulation model suggested that A. lacertosa colonization rates were largely unaffected by increases in amount of the more restrictive shrub matrix. However, simulations of an hypothetical species with greater overall dispersal ability but reduced dispersal rate through shrub matrix showed that colonization rates were noticeably reduced when the percentage of shrub matrix on the landscape approached 50%. Combined these results suggest that some tailoring of release strategies may be required to accommodate the unique dispersal capabilities of different biocontrol agents on particular release landscapes, but for A. lacertosa there appears to be little effect of matrix habitat structure on rates of spread.

AB Event-triggered control approaches of networked control systems are motivated by applications of embedded microprocessors with limited computation and storage resources . This paper investigates an event-triggered consensus control scheme with random switching directed topologies and time-varying transmission delay in a general class of networked control systems. A distributed sampling scheme triggering at node's independent time instants is designed for updates of control inputs. The desired properties of the resulted error dynamical system, such as stability and convergence can be preserved. It is not only proven that the event-triggered consensus is reachable, but also given an estimation of the convergence rate. It is shown that before the consensus is achieved, the inner-event interval is lower bounded by a positive constant, which excludes the Zeno behavior. The results are also applied to other special cases including time-delay free, fixed topology and leader-following consensus cases. Numerical simulation examples are presented to demonstrate the correctness of the theoretical results.

AB Systems of interacting particles, or agents, have wide applications in many disciplines, including Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Economics. These systems are governed by interaction laws, which are often unknown: estimating them from observation data is a fundamental task that can provide meaningful insights and accurate predictions of the behaviour of the agents. In this paper, we consider the inverse problem of learning interaction laws given data from multiple trajectories, in a nonparametric fashion, when the interaction kernels depend on pairwise distances. We establish a condition for learnability of interaction kernels, and construct an estimator based on the minimization of a suitably regularized least squares functional, that is guaranteed to converge, in a suitable L-2 space, at the optimal min-max rate for 1-dimensional nonparametric regression. We propose an efficient learning algorithm to construct such estimator, which can be implemented in parallel for multiple trajectories and is therefore well-suited for the high dimensional, big data regime. Numerical simulations on a variety examples, including opinion dynamics, predator-prey and swarm dynamics and heterogeneous particle dynamics, suggest that the learnability condition is satisfied in models used in practice, and the rate of convergence of our estimator is consistent with the theory. These simulations also suggest that our estimators are robust to noise in the observations, and can produce accurate predictions of trajectories in large time intervals, even when they are learned from observations in short time intervals.

AB Recursive reasoning of the form what do I think that you think that I think (and so on) arises often while acting in multiagent settings. Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way. While we do not claim the cognitive plausibility of the models in the absence of more evidence, they represent promising steps toward understanding and computationally simulating strategic human behavior.

AB Theory: The need for the development and use of a concept of joint, political-economic equilibrium is increasingly recognized by students of democracy and markets. Yet, to date, no adequate theoretical and methodological synthesis of this kind has been produced. The few works which have attempted it suffer from a lack of theoretical balance between economic and political theory; unrealistic, temporally aggregated conceptions of political-economic equilibrium; failure to incorporate theoretically meaningful stochastic elements of economic and political processes; and the absence of a coherent methodology for gauging the empirical power of political-economic models.
   Methods: In the spirit of the AJPS workshop, it is shown how these problems can be solved. An improved model is built, one which fuses a branch of real business cycle theory and the theory of presidential approval. This model produces a notion of computable political-economic equilibrium that provides for market clearing and simultaneous stochastic optimization by economic and political agents. Then, using data analysis techniques developed in parallel by real business cycle theorists (Hansen and Heckman 1996; Kydland and Prescott 1990, 1996; Lucas 1987; Prescott 1986a, 1986b, 1991; Sims 1996) and political methodologists (Brady 1996; Jackson 1995), the model is parameterized for the United States. More specifically, on the basis of estimates from economics and political science and some numerical experimentation, certain of its parameters are set so that, when simulated, the model mimics the United States political economy in the 1980s.
   Results: The parameterized model is used to study some important counterfactuals. The first is the impact of increased approval volatility on political-economic equilibration. Such volatility is expected in view of America's likely involvement in the post Cold War era's increasing number of "low intensity" international conflicts. The second is the impact of presidents pursuing relatively high-nonminimum winning-levels of approval. This kind of behavior is attributed to certain presidents along with the claim that it has harmful effects on markets and hence on various facets of social welfare. The former analysis shows how "business cycle phenomena" (Lucas 1987) can be traced, in part, to government approval management in an increasingly volatile international polity, management which is associated with a slight drop in social welfare. The latter investigation demonstrates that the president's pursuit of a consensual approval target is not necessarily socially harmful.

AB This paper presents a new framework for synchronization of complex network by introducing a mechanism of event-triggering distributed sampling information. A kind of event which avoids continuous communication between neighboring nodes is designed to drive the controller update of each node. The advantage of the event-triggering strategy is the significant decrease of the number of controller updates for synchronization task of complex networks involving embedded microprocessors with limited on-board resources. To describe the system's ability reaching synchronization, a concept about generalized algebraic connectivity is introduced for strongly connected networks and then extended to the strongly connected components of the directed network containing a directed spanning tree. Two sufficient conditions are presented to reveal the underlying relationships of corresponding parameters to reach global synchronization based on algebraic graph, matrix theory and Lyapunov control method. A positive lower bound for inter-event times is derived to guarantee the absence of Zeno behavior. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.

AB In this paper, a new output-based adaptive event-triggered control (AETC) method is introduced for a general class of nonlinear systems. A crucial aspect of the AETC method is to design an event-triggering mechanism (ETM) determining when the sampling operation should be done. The proposed ETM, which is derived from the finite-gain L-2 stability condition, reduces the number of updating operations while the performance of the closed-loop system is maintained. Thanks to the Lipschitz property, the avoidance of Zeno behavior is also guaranteed by introducing a positive lower bound on the inter-event times. This lower bound is obtained by solving a set of proposed ordinary differential equations. In addition, the proposed method is developed into robust control of uncertain linear time invariant (LTI) systems through some matrix inequalities (such as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs)). Finally, several numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to achieve greater average inter-event times and to preserve the system performance rather than other references.

AB Gaze following, the ability to redirect one's visual attention to look at what another person is seeing, is foundational for imitation, word learning, and theory-of-mind. Previous theories have suggested that the development of gaze following in human infants is the product of a basic gaze following mechanism, plus the gradual incorporation of several distinct new mechanisms that improve the skill, such as spatial inference, and the ability to use eye direction information as well as head direction. In this paper, we offer an alternative explanation based on a single learning mechanism. From a starting state with no knowledge of the implications of another organism's gaze direction, our model learns to follow gaze by being placed in a simulated environment where an adult caregiver looks around at objects. Our infant model matches the development of gaze following in human infants as measured in key experiments that we replicate and analyze in detail.

AB This paper investigates the cooperative platoon control problem of heterogeneous vehicles. Under a leader and predecessor following communication structure, each following vehicle tracks the state of the leader while maintaining a constant spacing between successive vehicles. To reduce the utilization of communication resources, a new event-triggered communication strategy (ETCS) is proposed, where the current data of the following vehicle is transmitted to its direct successor only when the difference between the current data and the last transmitted data exceeds a state-dependent threshold. By properly designing the threshold, the number of data transmissions near the steady state is greatly reduced. The tracking errors of all vehicles are shown to be bounded while Zeno behavior can be avoided under the ETCS. The advantages of the proposed ETCS are discussed by comparing with the existing strategies. Moreover, to deal with the heterogeneity of the vehicles' dynamics, a decentralized and computationally efficient method is presented to solve the non-identical control gains of all the vehicles. The numerical simulations have been conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB Todays' networks are becoming increasingly complex. They must provide a growing variety of services to a wide range of devices. In order to do so, they must make efficient use of modern technologies including MIMO, macrodiversity, power control, channel allocation, beamforming, and so on.
   In this context, the centralized management of radio resources on a large scale is rapidly becoming intractable. Distributed intelligence constitutes an increasingly attractive solution to provide network-wide self-configuration and adaptation capabilities. This article presents the design of a swarming system for autonomous power control which adapts naturally to the changing conditions of mobile networks where interference patterns are in constant flux. Empirical methods proposed by Parunak [1997] to develop MultiAgent Systems with Swarming (MASS) are applied to the current context while emphasizing the key concepts that lead to swarming (emergent behavior). A simulation-based study reveals how the system can be fine-tuned to obtain various solutions, balancing resources differently to achieve different trade-off points. Finally, it is shown that the distributed approach based on swarming is not only feasible but leads to higher global QoS levels than comparable centralized approaches.

AB This paper investigates the resource allocation problem for a group of agents communicating over a strongly connected directed graph, where the total objective function of the problem is composted of the sum of the local objective functions incurred by the agents. With local convex sets, we first design a continuous-time projection algorithm over a strongly connected and weight-balanced directed graph. Our convergence analysis indicates that when the local objective functions are strongly convex, the output state of the projection algorithm could asymptotically converge to the optimal solution of the resource allocation problem. In particular, when the projection operation is not involved, we show the exponential convergence at the equilibrium point of the algorithm. Second, we propose an adaptive continuous-time gradient algorithm over a strongly connected and weight-unbalanced directed graph for the reduced case without local convex sets. In this case, we prove that the adaptive algorithm converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the considered problem, where the local objective functions and their gradients satisfy strong convexity and Lipachitz conditions, respectively. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of our algorithms.

AB Noise is widely regarded as a residual categorythe unexplained variance in a linear model or the random disturbance of a predictable pattern. Accordingly, formal models often impose the simplifying assumption that the world is noise-free and social dynamics are deterministic. Where noise is assigned causal importance, it is often assumed to be a source of inefficiency, unpredictability, or heterogeneity. We review recent sociological studies that are noteworthy for demonstrating the theoretical importance of noise for understanding the dynamics of a complex system. Contrary to widely held assumptions, these studies identify conditions in which noise can increase efficiency and predictability and reduce diversity. We conclude with a methodological warning that deterministic assumptions are not an innocent simplification.

AB In this paper we are concerned with multiscale modeling, control, and simulation of self-organizing agents leaving an unknown area under limited visibility, with special emphasis on crowds. We first introduce a new microscopic model characterized by an exploration phase and an evacuation phase. The main ingredients of the model are an alignment term, accounting for the herding effect typical of uncertain behavior, and a random walk, accounting for the need to explore the environment under limited visibility. We consider both metrical and topological interactions. Moreover, a few special agents, the leaders, not recognized as such by the crowd, are "hidden" in the crowd with a special controlled dynamic. Next, relying on a Boltzmann approach, we derive a mesoscopic model for a continuum density of followers, coupled with a microscopic description for the leaders' dynamics. Finally, optimal control of the crowd is studied. It is assumed that leaders aim at steering the crowd towards the exits so to ease the evacuation and limit clogging effects, and locally optimal behavior of leaders is computed. Numerical simulations show the efficiency of the control techniques in both microscopic and mesoscopic settings. We also perform a real experiment with people to study the feasibility of such a bottom-up control technique.

AB Port traffic is affected by many factors, which may lead to certain problems in terms of maritime traffic safety and efficiency. To further study the maritime traffic flow of ships under the influence of multiple factors, our work combines artificial intelligence and an agent-based architecture to carry out port traffic flow simulation research. Moreover, considering an actual situation, a theoretical research method is used to analyze the feasibility of cellular automata combined with an agent architecture, and the basic framework is constructed. Simultaneously, in order to improve the computational efficiency, a system framework based on the Internet of Things structure is constructed, and the authenticity of the simulation process is improved. In addition, through a field investigation, the corresponding cellular automata model is established, and the cellular automata model and agent architecture are combined to establish the port traffic flow simulation model. Finally, the actual port operational data are collected to simulate various conditions, and the simulation results are obtained. The research shows that the model constructed in this paper has certain effects on the study of ship behavior in ports and can provide a theoretical reference for subsequent related research.

AB When a network of vision-based sensors is emplaced in an environment for applications such as surveillance or monitoring the spatial relationships between the sensing units must be inferred or computed for self-calibration purposes. In this paper we describe a technique to solve one aspect of this self-calibration problem: automatically determining the topology and connectivity information of a network of cameras based on a statistical analysis of observed motion in the environment. While the technique can use labels from reliable cameras systems, the algorithm is powerful enough to function using ambiguous tracking data. The method requires no prior knowledge of the relative locations of the cameras and operates under very weak environmental assumptions. Our approach stochastically samples plausible agent trajectories based on a delay model that allows for transitions to and from sources and sinks in the environment. The technique demonstrates considerable robustness both to sensor error and non-trivial patterns of agent motion. The output of the method is a Markov model describing the behavior of agents in the system and the underlying traffic patterns. The concept is demonstrated with simulation data for systems containing up to 10 agents and verified with experiments conducted on a six camera sensor network. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB In recent years forward osmosis (FO) process has attracted considerable attention in the field of water treatment and desalination. However, the lack of sufficient information on all possible parameters, affecting the process performance, is a major obstacle that avoids improving the function of this method. In this study, an algorithm based upon a reliable model was developed for osmosis through asymmetric membrane oriented in FO mode to be applied in agent-based model. This model was built in the NetLogo platform, which is a programmable modeling environment for simulating natural phenomena. The feasibility of this modeling was proven by comparing the simulation results and empirical data obtained from literature. The influence of net bulk osmotic pressure difference between the draw solution (DS) and the feed solution (FS) on average water flux was studied for various draw solutes. Furthermore, the effects of process parameters, including temperature, length of module, FS cross-flow velocity, pure water permeability coefficient, and structural parameter of membrane on average water flux were investigated. As a result, it could be concluded that Netlogo agent-based model had the quite well potential to simulate the FO process. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The aim of the study was to determine optimal measurement conditions for assessment of brain perfusion with the use of optical contrast agent and time-resolved diffuse reflectometry in the near-infrared wavelength range. The source-detector separation at which the distribution of time of flights (DTOF) of photons provided useful information on the inflow of the contrast agent to the intracerebral brain tissue compartments was determined. Series of Monte Carlo simulations was performed in which the inflow and washout of the dye in extra-and intracerebral tissue compartments was modeled and the DTOFs were obtained at different source-detector separations. Furthermore, tests on diffuse phantoms were carried out using a time-resolved setup allowing the measurement of DTOFs at 16 source-detector separations. Finally, the setup was applied in experiments carried out on the heads of adult volunteers during intravenous injection of indocyanine green. Analysis of statistical moments of the measured DTOFs showed that the source-detector separation of 6 cm is recommended for monitoring of inflow of optical contrast to the intracerebral brain tissue compartments with the use of continuous wave reflectometry, whereas the separation of 4 cm is enough when the higher-order moments of DTOFs are available.

AB Dendritic cells (DCs) may arise from multiple lineages and progress through a series of intermediate stages until fully mature, at which time they are capable of optimal antigen presentation and T-cell activation. High cell surface expression of CD83 is presumed to correlate with full maturation of DCs, and a number of agents have been shown to increase CD83 expression on DCs, We hypothesized that interleukin 12 (IL-12) expression would be a more accurate marker of functionally mature DCs capable of activating antigen-specific T cells. We used combinations of signaling through CD40, using CD40 ligand trimer (CD40L), and interferon gamma to demonstrate that CD83 expression is necessary but not sufficient for optimal production of IL-12 by DCs, Phenotypically mature DCs could be induced to produce high levels of IL-12 p70 only when provided 2 simultaneous stimulatory signals. By intracellular cytokine detection, we determined that only a subset of cells that express high levels of CD80 and CD83 generate large amounts of IL-12, DCs matured with both signals are superior to DCs stimulated with the individual agents in activating antigen-specific T cell in vitro. These findings have important implications regarding the identification, characterization, and clinical application of functionally mature DCs, (C) 2000 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB Introduction: The increasing clinical and microbiologic resistance of Candida spp. isolates to several antifungal agents is becoming a serious problem. It is now reasonable to propose the use of antifungal. susceptibility testing in Candido spp. isolates from patients who have failed conventional therapy, before the selection of an empirical therapy.
   Methods: One hundred and fifty eight isolates of Candida spp. were evaluated simultaneously by broth microdilution (NCCLS standard) and well diffusion testing (WD), a diffusion method similar to disc diffusion.
   Results: According to the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test performed, there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) between both methodologies for all antifungal agents tested (fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B, with C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. dubliniensis, C. guillermondii, C. parapsilosis, C. albicans and C. glabrata). A significant difference was observed when comparing well. diffusion with NCCLS for fluconazole WD 80% (p = 0.008) in C. glabrata, as well as WD 80% (p = 0.002) and WD 50% (p = 0.002) in C. albicans.
   Conclusions: The well diffusion test is simple, easy to reproduce, inexpensive, easy both to read and interpret, and has a good correlation to the reference NCCLS microdilution test and may represent an alternative method for antifungal drug susceptibility testing of Candido spp., mainly in laboratories with few resources.

AB A financial time series agent-based model is reproduced and investigated by the statistical physics system, the finite-range interacting voter system. The voter system originally describes the collective behavior of voters who constantly update their positions on a particular topic, which is a continuous-time Markov process. In the proposed model, the fluctuations of stock price changes are attributed to the market information interaction amongst the traders and certain similarities of investors' behaviors. Further, the complexity of return series of the financial model is studied in comparison with two real stock indexes, the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and the Hang Seng Index, by composite multiscale entropy analysis and recurrence analysis. The empirical research shows that the simulation data for the proposed model could grasp some natural features of actual markets to some extent.

AB This article has two objectives: to critique the dominant opportunity discovery and creation literatures and to propose a new, critical realist-inspired analytical framework to theorise the causes, processes and consequences of entrepreneurial action - one that needs no concept of opportunity. We offer three reasons to support our critique of opportunity studies. First, there are important absences, contradictions and inconsistencies in definitions of opportunity in theoretical and empirical work that mean the term cannot signal a clear direction for theorising or empirical research. Our central criticism is that the concept of opportunity cannot refer simultaneously, without contradiction, to a social context offering profit-making prospects, to particular practices and to agents' subjective beliefs or imagined futures. Second, a new definition of opportunity would perpetuate the conceptual chaos. Third, useful concepts to capture important entrepreneurial processes are readily available, for instance, combining resources, creating new ventures and achieving product sales, which render a concept of opportunity superfluous. Instead, we conceptualise entrepreneurial action as investments in resources intended to create new goods and services for market exchange emergent from the interaction between agential, social-structural and cultural causal powers.

AB A method for familiarity mediated encoding of episodic memories for their inferential use in spatial navigation task is proposed. The method is strongly inspired by the state-of-the-art understanding of the hippocampal functioning and especially its role in novelty detection and episodic memory formation in relation to spatial context. The model is constructed on the presumption that episodic memory formation has behavioral, as well as sensory and perceptual correlates. In addition, the findings regarding hippocampal involvement in the novelty/familiarity detection and episodic memory formation, together with the existence of a straightforward parallel between internal hippocampal and abstract spatial representations are incorporated in the model. A navigation task is used to provide an experimental setup for behavioral testing with a rat-like agent. For this purpose, a framework that connects robot navigation and episodic memory representation is suggested. The computations are adapted for a real-time application. Simulation results show encoding of episodes and their use for navigation.

AB This paper studies a version of the classical Bertrand model in which consumers exhibit some strategic behavior when deciding from what seller they will buy. We use two related but different tools. Both consider a probabilistic learning (or evolutionary) mechanism, and in the two of them consumers' behavior influences the competition between the sellers. The results obtained show that, in general, developing some sort of loyalty is a good strategy for the buyers as it works in their best interest. First, we consider a learning procedure described by a deterministic dynamic system and, using strong simplifying assumptions, we can produce a description of the behavior of the process. Second, we use finite automata to represent the strategies played by the agents and an adaptive process based on genetic algorithms to simulate the stochastic process of learning. By doing so we can relax some of the strong assumptions used in the first approach and still obtain the same basic results. It is suggested that the limitations of the first approach (analytical) provide a good motivation for the second approach (Agent-Based). Indeed, although both approaches address the same problem, the use of Agent-Based computational techniques allows us to relax hypothesis and overcome the limitations of the analytical approach while obtaining the same basic results.

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a blood-borne virus that disproportionately affects people who inject drugs (PWIDs). Based on extensive interview and blood test data from a longitudinal study in Melbourne, Australia, we describe an individual-based transmission model for HCV spread amongst PWID. We use this model to simulate the transmission of HCV on an empirical social network of PWID. A feature of our model is that sources of infection can be both network neighbours and non-neighbours via "importing". Data-driven estimates of sharing frequency and rate of importing are provided. Compared to an appropriately calibrated hilly connected network, the empirical network provides some protective effect on the time to primary infection. We also illustrate heterogeneities in incidence rate of infection, both across and within node degrees (i.e., number of network partners). We explore the reduced risk of infection from spontaneously clearing cutpoint nodes whose infection status oscillates, both in theory and in simulation. Further, we show our model-based estimate of per-event transmission probability largely agrees with previous estimates at the lower end of the range 1-3% commonly cited. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB An ITP separation of eight lanthanides on a serpentine PMMA microchip with a tee junction and a 230-mm-long serpentine channel is described. The cover of the PMMA chip is 175 m thick so that a (CD)-D-4 in microchip mode can be used to detect the lanthanides as they migrate through the microchannel. Acetate and -hydroxyisobutyric acid are used as complexing agents to increase the electrophoretic mobility difference between the lanthanides. Eight lanthanides are concentrated within approximate to 6 min by ITP in the microchip using 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 4.5 as the leading electrolyte and 10 mM acetic acid at approximate to pH 3.0 as the terminating electrolyte. In addition, a 2D numerical simulation of the lanthanides undergoing ITP in the microchip is compared with experimental results using COMSOL Multiphysics v4.3a.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL
LA English

DE Sliding-Mode Control; Finite-Time Observers; Quad-Rotor systems;
   Formation control
ID FORMATION TRACKING; DESIGN; DIFFERENTIATION; ORDER
AB This paper deals with the robust tracking problem for a group of Quad-Rotors forming a time-varying geometric pattern, i.e. formation control, in the presence of external disturbances. Such a robust control strategy is able to deal with any formation scheme such that there exists a directed spanning tree from the leader agent to all other agents. The proposed output-control strategy is based on a Continuous Sliding-Mode Control (Continuous-SMC) approach which is composed of a Finite-Time Sliding-Mode Observer (FT-SMO) and hierarchical cascade Continuous-SMCs. It is assumed that only the positions and angles of each Quad-Rotor are available to measure. Despite the disturbances acting on all the Quad-Rotor dynamics, this control strategy provides uniform finite-time stability for the altitude and yaw angle tracking and formation errors, and uniform exponential stability for the forward and lateral tracking and formation errors. Moreover, four different types of Continuous-SMCs can be used in the proposed strategy. Numerical simulations illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy.

DT Article
ID INFECTIOUS-DISEASE
AB We present numerical results obtained from the modeling of a stochastic, highly connected, and mobile community. The spread of attributes like health and disease among the community members is simulated using cellular automata on a planar two-dimensional surface. With remarkably few assumptions, we are able to predict the future course of propagation of such a disease as a function of time and the fine-tuning of parameters related to interactions among the automata. Published under license by AIP Publishing.
   Epidemic modeling is a multidisciplinary field whose insights can be used by policy makers to make informed choices to prevent and also contain the spread of disease through a population. This is achieved by identifying the most significant factors that affect the spread of a disease and suggesting ways to tune it in real life for the benefit of the population. It is also useful to test the potential effects of changes in a parameter on the disease spreading dynamics. In this work, we suggest an agent-based stochastic model of an epidemic that is computationally frugal yet captures the essential underlying physics of agent interactions and mobility. The effects of factors such as social distancing from the infected, restriction of movement, virulence, and infection probability are studied. The maximum number of simultaneously infected individuals is the chief metric used to compare the spread of the disease in various scenarios.

AB We introduce an agent-based model describing a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) system of humans and mosquitoes to predict malaria epidemiological scenarios in realistic biological conditions. Emphasis is given to the transition from endemic behavior to eradication of malaria transmission induced by combined drug therapies acting on both the gametocytemia reduction and on the selective mosquito mortality during parasite development in the mosquito. Our mathematical framework enables to uncover the critical values of the parameters characterizing the effect of each drug therapy. Moreover, our results provide quantitative evidence of what was up to now only partially assumed with empirical support: interventions combining gametocytemia reduction through the use of gametocidal drugs, with the selective action of ivermectin during parasite development in the mosquito, may actively promote disease eradication in the long run. In the agent model, the main properties of human-mosquito interactions are implemented as parameters and the model is validated by comparing simulations with real data of malaria incidence collected in the endemic malaria region of Chimoio in Mozambique. Finally, we discuss our findings in light of current drug administration strategies for malaria prevention, which may interfere with human-to-mosquito transmission process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper addresses a problem of sweep coverage by deploying a network of autonomous mobile robots. We propose a decentralized control algorithm for the robots to accomplish the sweep coverage. The sweep coverage is achieved by coordinating the robots to move along a given path that is unknown to the vehicles a priori. The motion coordination algorithm is developed based on simple consensus algorithms. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated via numerical simulations. The proposed algorithm would have applications to military and civilian operations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TOPOLOGICAL DEFECTS; DENSITY-FLUCTUATIONS; DYNAMICS; MOTION
AB In nature, interactions between biopolymers and motor proteins give rise to biologically essential emergent behaviors. Besides cytoskeleton mechanics, active nematics arise from such interactions. Here we present a study on 3D active nematics made of microtubules, kinesin motors, and depleting agent. It shows a rich behavior evolving from a nematically ordered space-filling distribution of microtubule bundles toward a flattened and contracted 2D ribbon that undergoes a wrinkling instability and subsequently transitions into a 3D active turbulent state. The wrinkle wavelength is independent of the ATP concentration and our theoretical model describes its relation with the appearance time. We compare the experimental results with a numerical simulation that confirms the key role of kinesin motors in cross-linking and sliding the microtubules. Our results on the active contraction of the network and the independence of wrinkle wavelength on ATP concentration are important steps forward for the understanding of these 3D systems.

In task-partitioning, tasks such as the collection of resources are divided into subtasks in which the material is passed from one worker to another. Previous models have assumed that worker-worker interactions are random, but experimental evidence suggests that receivers can have preferences to handle familiar materials. We used an agent-based simulation model to explore how non-random interactions during task-partitioning with direct transfer affect colony work efficiency. Because task-partitioning also allows receivers and donors to acquire foraging related information we analysed the effect of non-random interactions on informative interaction patterns. When receivers non-randomly rejected donors offering certain materials, donors overall experienced increased time delays, hive stay durations and a decreased number of transfer partners. However, the number of transfers was slightly increased, which can improve the acquisition and quality of information for donors. When receivers were non-randomly attracted to donors offering certain materials, donors experienced reduced transfer delays, hive stay durations and an increased number of simultaneous receivers. The number of transfers is slightly decreased. The effects of the two mechanisms "non-random rejection" and "non-random attraction" are biggest if the number of foragers and receivers is balanced. In summary, our results show that colony ergonomics are improved if receivers do not reject donors and if mechanisms exist that help receivers detect potential donors, such as learning the odour of the transferred food. Finally, our simulations suggest that non-random interactions can potentially affect the foraging patterns of colonies in changing environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is concerned with the input-to-state stabilization problem for a class of delayed differential systems. Both time-delay in state and bounded exogenous disturbances are taken into account in the model. An event-triggered strategy, which depends simultaneously on the latest sampled state and a non-negative threshold, is proposed to reduce the transmission frequency of the feedback control signals with guaranteed performance requirements. The notion of input-to-state practical stability is introduced to evaluate the dynamical performance of the controlled systems with considering the effects from both exogenous disturbances and event-triggered scheme. The estimations of the upper bounds for the system state and the measurement error are employed to analyze and further exclude the Zeno behavior for the proposed event-triggered scheme. The controller gain and the event-trigger parameters are co-designed in terms of the feasibility of certain matrix inequalities. A numerical simulation example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of theoretical results.

AB The variation of the journal impact factor is affected by many statistical and sociological factors such as the size of citation window and subject difference. In this work, we develop an impact factor dynamics model based on the parallel system, which can be used to analyze the correlation between the impact factor and certain elements. The parallel model aims to simulate the submission and citation behaviors of the papers in journals belonging to a similar subject, in a distributed manner. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to show how the model parameters influence the impact factor dynamics. Through extensive simulations, we reveal the important role that certain statistics elements and behaviors play to affect impact factors. The experimental results and analysis on actual data demonstrate that the value of the JIF is comprehensively influenced by the average review time, average number of references, and aging distribution of citation.

AB Purpose:To evaluate the effects of two commercial silicone hydrogel contact lenses (CLs) soaked with natamycin (NA) or fluconazole (FL) on the growth of Candida albicans in an in vitro eye model.Methods:Three-D printed molds were used as a cast for making eye-shaped models comprising potato dextrose agar. Senofilcon A (SA) and lotrafilcon B (LB) CLs were incubated with either 2 mL of NA or FL at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for 24 hr. To simulate a fungal infection, the eye models were coated with C. albicans. The drug-soaked lenses were placed on top of the eye models. Seven experimental conditions were examined: (1) NA-SA, (2) NA-LB, (3) FL-SA, (4) FL-LB, (5) SA, (6) LB, and (7) controlno lens. At specified time points (t=1, 8, 16, 24, 48 hr), the agar eyes from each experimental condition were removed from the incubator and photographed. The yeast cells from the 24 and 48 hr time point were also analyzed using light microscopy.Results:At 24 and 48 hr, there was considerable growth observed for all conditions except for the NA-SA and NA-LB conditions. When observed under the microscope at 24 and 48 hr, the morphology of the yeast cells in the FL-SA and SA condition were similar to that of the control (oval shaped). There was limited hyphae growth observed for LB and significant visible hyphae growth for the NA-LB group. For NA-SA, NA-LB, and FL-LB groups, the cells were significantly smaller compared with the control.Conclusions:For NA-SA and NA-LB, there was limited growth of C. albicans observed on the eye models even after 48 hr. Under the microscope, the cell morphology differ noticeably between each testing condition, and is dependent on drug-lens combinations.

AB Phenol is considered as pollutant due to its toxicity and carcinogenic effect. Thus, variety of innovative methods for separation and recovery of phenolic compounds is developed in order to remove the unwanted phenol from wastewater and obtain valuable phenolic compound. One of potential method is extraction using green based liquid organic solvent. Therefore, the feasibility of using palm oil was investigated. In this research, palm oil based organic phase was used as diluents to treat a simulated wastewater containing 300 x 10(-6) of phenol solution using emulsion liquid membrane process (ELM). The stability of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion on diluent composition and the parameters affecting the phenol removal efficiency and stability of the emulsion; such as emulsification speed, emulsification time, agitation speed, surfactant concentration, pH of external phase, contact time, stripping agent concentration and treat ratiowere carried out. The results of ELM study showed that at ratio 7 to 3 of palm oil to kerosene, 5 min and 1300 r.min(-1) of emulsification process the stabile primary emulsion were formed. Also, no carrier is needed to facilitate the phenol extraction. In experimental conditions of 500 r.min(-1) of agitation speed, 3% Span 80, pH 8 of external phase, 5 min of contact time, 0.1 mol.L-1 NaOH as stripping agent and 1:10 of treat ratio, the ELM process was very promising for removing the phenol from the wastewater. The extraction performance at about 83% of phenol was removed for simulated wastewater and an enrichment of phenol in recovery phase as phenolate compound was around 11 times.

AB Chagas' disease is caused by unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi (T cruzi). It is endemic throughout Latin America, but nowadays has become a global challenge due to tourism and migration. Non-treated infection may result in health-threatening complications and lead to death. Current medications for-this infection are nifurtimox (NFT) and benznidazol. Both drugs may cause side effects and are ineffective in the chronic phase. Therefore, new antichagasic compounds are urgently required. Nitazoxanide (NTZ) is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug, proposed recently as a potential candidate to be added to the list of essential medicines for integrated neglected tropical disease control and elimination. Although the effect of NTZ against T cruzi epimastigotes in vitro was reported, the corresponding experiments in animal models of T. cruzi infection have never been undertaken. The present work was designed to fill this gap and evaluate the effect of NTZ on experimental murine trypanosomiasis, in comparison with classical antichagasic agent NFT. Highly sensitive to T. cruzi BALB/c mice were infected using Albarrada T cruzi strain, recently isolated in Mexico. Experimental groups were either left untreated, or otherwise treated with NFT, NTZ (100 and 1000 mg/kg), or with both drugs simultaneously. The severity of the infection was estimated based on criteria such as parasitemia, lesions in target tissues (heart, muscles and lungs) and mortality. Despite the expected protective effect, NTZ drastically aggravates the course of T. cruzi infection. Namely, parasitemia, tissue lesions and mortality caused by T. cruzi infection were significantly higher in NTZ-treated mice groups, even in comparison with untreated infected animals. NTZ by itself no produced mortality o tissue damage, and NFT showed an expected protective effect. Our results indicate that NTZ cannot be considered for Chagas' disease treatment. Moreover, NTZ should be used with caution in patients positive for T. cruzi infection. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In complex systems with stochastic components, systems laws often emerge that describe higher level behavior regardless of lower level component configurations. In this paper, emergent laws for describing mechanochemical systems are investigated for processive myosin-actin motility systems. On the basis of prior experimental evidence that longer processive lifetimes are enabled by larger myosin ensembles, it is hypothesized that emergent scaling laws could coincide with myosin-actin contact probability or system energy consumption. Because processivity is difficult to predict analytically and measure experimentally, agent-based computational techniques are developed to simulate processive myosin ensembles and produce novel processive lifetime measurements. It is demonstrated that only systems energy relationships hold regardless of isoform configurations or ensemble size, and a unified expression for predicting processive lifetime is revealed. The finding of such laws provides insight for how patterns emerge in stochastic mechanochemical systems, while also informing understanding and engineering of complex biological systems.

AB This paper aims at exploring the mean-square bounded synchronization of clustered stochastic systems under deception attack which is a ubiquitous phenomenon in cyber-physical network. Actually, when controllers in network send controlling signal to physical plants, controller-to-actuator channel may be injected with wrong signal by malicious hackers intending to destroy the system's performance. To describe attacker's behavior, some random variables are introduced to describe whether the cluster's channel is attacked or not in the controlled moment. Meanwhile, it has been proved that pinning impulsive control is effective to offset both stochastic effect and attack effect, where the nodes with bigger error will be chosen to be pinned in impulsive instants. By applying Gronwall-Bellman inequality and Lyapunov method on stochastic network, several kinds of mean-square bounded synchronization criteria based on pinning impulsive strategy are derived in terms of algebraic conditions and some reasonable assumptions. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results in this paper. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID PROPAGATION BEHAVIOR
AB Degradable fiber can temporarily plug a natural fracture or artificial fracture. It has been successfully applied in the stimulated reservoir volume (SRV) fracturing or re-fracturing of unconventional reservoirs. Based on the classical analytical stress field equation, a new mathematical model is established in this paper to model the crack reorientation path after injecting fiber diversion fluid according to the tensile failure criterion. Factors influencing the diverting radius are intensively analyzed through numerical simulation. The results indicate that the horizontal stress difference, fracturing fluid viscosity, and injection time (fracturing fluid volume) have larger effects on the diverting radius than do the formation permeability (1-50 mD) and bottomhole pressure (90-160 MPa). The simulation results are successfully verified, matching well with the experimental data from the true tri-axial fracture reorientation tests in the laboratory. The model is successfully applied to the heterogeneous carbonate reservoirs in northwest China. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Reactor modeling and scale-up of a multiphase reaction-extraction

SO CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB A mathematical model was developed to describe the transient and steady-state behavior of a multiphase reaction-extraction system in a batch stirred-tank reactor used for the metallothermic reduction of rare earth oxides. The model includes thermodynamic, kinetic and transport parameters as well as reactor design and operating parameters. The model was applied to the metallothermic reduction of Nd2O3 by Ca using molten salts as the phase transfer agent. Mathematical analyses of the model have indicated that the steady-state performance of the reactor can be characterized by the reactor eigenvalue which is a linear function of the interfacial equilibrium constant of the rare earth metals. Important scale-up parameters were identified from dimensional analysis of the model, whereas the rate-controlling step of the process was identified through the numerical simulation of the model. The results of numerical simulation of the model were consistent with experimental observations on both the laboratory and the pilot reactor.

AB Curcumin is the most bioactive compound of turmeric (Curcuma longa) plant, which has a wide range of beneficial biological and pharmacological activities, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer agents. The application of curcumin is limited due to low solubility and low bioavailability. Today, the use of nanotechnology in curcumin formulations has been considered to improve the performance of curcumin. Particularly nanoemulsions can be used as agents of increasing penetration in the pharmaceutical and food industries. Despite the extensive empirical research on nano-curcumin, the behavior and formation of the curcumin nanoemulsion have not been theoretically investigated. Molecular dynamics Simulation of nanoemulsion systems is performed to have a better understanding of molecular behavior. Here, the simulation was performed on the base on the ratios obtained in experimental work, and by reviewing the trajectory, the variety of assemblies was determined at different times. This study revealed that molecular assemblies formed in the absence and presence of curcumin have different size and arrangement. The Variety of assemblies was studied after reaching to the constant number of assemblies in the equilibrium. The average radius of gyrations was estimated for assemblies composed of more than three molecules in the curcumin nanoemulsion system and the effective radius of the different assemblies was determined based on the related relationship. The size of particles was determined to be in the range of 2-6.3 nm. The size of particles were determined to be in the range of 2-6.3 nm. The necessary information was gained by analyzing the average ratio of the principal moments of inertia in order to determine the shape of the assemblies and it was found that the assemblies have almost spherical and prolate spheroid shapes. Particle size and shape results were in good agreement with experimental results. The arrangement of various assemblies showed that all molecules except curcumin were placed into the assemblies in the way that hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts were located inside and at the surface of the assemblies, respectively. While curcumin selected surface in all assemblies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Climate change is considered a major threat to society and nature. UV irradiation is the most important environmental genotoxic agent. Thus, how elevated UV irradiation may influence human health and ecosystems has generated wide concern in the scientific community, as well as with policy makers and the public in general. In this study, we investigated patterns and mechanisms of UV adaptation in natural ecosystems by studying a gene-specific variation in the potato late blight pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. We compared the sequence characteristics of radiation sensitive 23 (RAD23), a gene involved in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway and UV tolerance, in P. infestans isolates sampled from various altitudes. We found that lower genetic variation in the RAD23 gene was caused by natural selection. The hypothesis that UV irradiation drives this selection was supported by strong correlations between the genomic characteristics and altitudinal origin (historic UV irradiation) of the RAD23 sequences with UV tolerance of the P. infestans isolates. These results indicate that the RAD23 gene plays an important role in the adaptation of P. infestans to UV stress. We also found that different climatic factors could work synergistically to determine the evolutionary adaptation of species, making the influence of climate change on ecological functions and resilience more difficult to predict. Future attention should aim at understanding the collective impact generated by simultaneous change in several climate factors on species adaptation and ecological sustainability, using state of the art technologies such as experimental evolution, genome-wide scanning, and proteomics.

ID ELECTRICITY MARKET
AB Transaction costs are considered an essential factor that can adversely affect the performance of emissions trading markets. However, most studies are based on a static analyzing framework, making it difficult to simulate real economic situations, in which the dynamic behavior and interaction between firms in an emission trading system are fairly complicated and appear irrational to some extent. Based on an agent-based modeling approach, an artificial sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission trading market is developed to identify the dynamic influence of transaction costs on market efficiency. The simulation results based on empirical data from Jiangsu Province in China reveal that transaction costs have a negligible effect on the market price. However, transaction costs can block a small amount of trading as well as decrease total emission trading amount and market efficiency. Therefore, the policy design of emission trading in China should treat transaction costs carefully. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with chronic schizophrenia-related disorders are at a heightened risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The presence and interpretation of cerebral vascular lesions in neuroimaging tests in these patients represents a common clinical challenge. Nevertheless, the literature on cerebrovascular disease in this population is scarce and contradictory. The aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between schizophrenia-related disorders and cerebrovascular morbidity. A case-control study compared cerebrovascular morbidity in a group of patients with schizophrenia-related disorder versus a group of patients with another severe mental illness. The risk of presenting cerebrovascular morbidity was four times higher and statistically significant in patients with schizophrenia-related disorders compared with controls, paired by age and sex. However, both groups were homogeneous in terms of cardiovascular risk factors. There were significant differences between the two groups only in the time using first-generation antipsychotic drugs and taking two or more antipsychotic medications simultaneously. The relationship between chronic schizophrenia-related disorders and cerebrovascular disease may be beyond the classic cardiovascular risk factors and related to certain medications. This is one of the first studies to focus on the relation among cerebrovascular morbidity, antipsychotic drugs and disorders related to schizophrenia in middle-aged and elderly adults.

AB This paper investigates a two market heterogeneous agents model with biased trend followers and fundamentalists. The two separate and identically modelled markets are mutually dependent only through the introduced bias of the chartists' belief and co-evolve over time. The bias term depends on the state of the other market. Agents update their prediction rules for tomorrow's price according to their relative past performance as in Brock and Hommes (1997,1998). Using both analytical and numerical methods we find that the bias may have destabilising spillover effects between two otherwise stable markets, leading to irregular and unpredictable price dynamics with bubbles and crashes, as the the intensity of choice to switch prediction rules becomes high. Our behavioural model provides a simple and intuitive explanation of co-movements in asset markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Snakebite causes more than 1.8 million envenoming cases annually and is a major cause of death in the tropics especially for poor farmers. While both social and ecological factors influence the chance encounter between snakes and people, the spatio-temporal processes underlying snakebites remain poorly explored. Previous research has heavily focused on statistical correlates between snakebites and ecological, sociological, or environmental factors, but the human and snake behavioral patterns that drive the spatio-temporal process have not yet been integrated into a single model. Here we use a bottom-up simulation approach using agent-based modelling (ABM) parameterized with datasets from Sri Lanka, a snakebite hotspot, to characterise the mechanisms of snakebite and identify risk factors. Spatio-temporal dynamics of snakebite risks are examined through the model incorporating six snake species and three farmer types (rice, tea, and rubber). We find that snakebites are mainly climatically driven, but the risks also depend on farmer types due to working schedules as well as species present in landscapes. Snake species are differentiated by both distribution and by habitat preference, and farmers are differentiated by working patterns that are climatically driven, and the combination of these factors leads to unique encounter rates for different landcover types as well as locations. Validation using epidemiological studies demonstrated that our model can explain observed patterns, including temporal patterns, and relative contribution of bites by each snake specie. Our predictions can be used to generate hypotheses and inform future studies and decision makers. Additionally, our model is transferable to other locations with high snakebite burden as well.
   Author summary
   Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease affecting millions, and a major cause of death of agricultural workers in the tropics. In this research, the authors have developed a simulation model that includes data for agricultural activity across the days and seasons, as well as snake behavioral patterns, and the times and locations humans and snakes meet. Using this model, they predicted observed seasonal snakebite patterns in Sri Lanka, and they successfully showed how these patterns vary between different agricultural activities, including seasonal rice cultivation, and rubber and tea harvests. The findings arising from this study demonstrate that different combinations of human and snake activity, including species and farming practice differences, are likely to generate differences in snakebite patterns across locations. This model could be applied to analyze and predict snakebite in tropical regions around the globe to help mitigate the problem.

AB A kinetic inhomogeneous Boltzmann-type equation is proposed to model the dynamics of the number of agents in a large market depending on the estimated value of an asset and the rationality of the agents. The interaction rules take into account the interplay of the agents with sources of public information, herding phenomena, and irrationality of the individuals. In the formal grazing collision limit, a nonlinear nonlocal Fokker-Planck equation with anisotropic (or incomplete) diffusion is derived. The existence of globalin-time weak solutions to the Fokker-Planck initial-boundary-value problem is proved. Numerical experiments for the Boltzmann equation highlight the importance of the reliability of public information in the formation of bubbles and crashes. The use of Bollinger bands in the simulations shows how herding may lead to strong trends with low volatility of the asset prices, but eventually also to abrupt corrections.

AB Firm dynamics on a transaction network is considered from the standpoint of econophysics, agent-based simulations, and game theory. In this model, interacting firms rationally invest in a production facility to maximize net present value. We estimate parameters used in the model through empirical analysis of financial and transaction data. We propose two different methods (analytical method and regression method) to obtain an interaction matrix of firms. On a subset of a real transaction network, we simulate firm's revenue, cost, and fixed asset, which is the accumulated investment for the production facility. The simulation reproduces the quantitative behavior of past revenues and costs within a standard error when we use the interaction matrix estimated by the regression method, in which only transaction pairs are taken into account. Furthermore, the simulation qualitatively reproduces past data of fixed assets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Molecular systems orchestrating the biology of the cell typically involve a complex web of interactions among various components and span a vast range of spatial and temporal scales. Computational methods have advanced our understanding of the behavior of molecular systems by enabling us to test assumptions and hypotheses, explore the effect of different parameters on the outcome, and eventually guide experiments. While several different mathematical and computational methods are developed to study molecular systems at different spatiotemporal scales, there is still a need for methods that bridge the gap between spatially-detailed and computationally-efficient approaches. In this review, we summarize the capabilities of agent-based modeling (ABM) as an emerging molecular systems biology technique that provides researchers with a new tool in exploring the dynamics of molecular systems/pathways in health and disease.

AB Studies on the deformation behaviours of cellular entities, such as coated microbubbles and liposomes subject to a cavitation flow, become increasingly important for the advancement of ultrasonic imaging and drug delivery. Numerical simulations for bubble dynamics of ultrasound contrast agents based on the boundary integral method are presented in this work. The effects of the encapsulating shell are estimated by adapting Hoff's model used for thin-shell contrast agents. The viscosity effects are estimated by including the normal viscous stress in the boundary condition. In parallel, mechanical models of cell membranes and liposomes as well as state-of-the-art techniques for quantitative measurement of viscoelasticity for a single cell or coated microbubbles are reviewed. The future developments regarding modelling and measurement of the material properties of the cellular entities for cutting-edge biomedical applications are also discussed.

AB This is a study of migration responses to climate shocks. We construct an agent-based model that incorporates dynamic linkages between demographic behaviors, such as migration, marriage, and births, and agriculture and land use, which depend on rainfall patterns. The rules and parameterization of our model are empirically derived from qualitative and quantitative analyses of a well-studied demographic field site, Nang Rong district, northeast Thailand. With this model, we simulate patterns of migration under four weather regimes in a rice economy: (1) a reference, "normal" scenario; (2) 7 years of unusually wet weather; (3) 7 years of unusually dry weather; and (4) 7 years of extremely variable weather. Results show relatively small impacts on migration. Experiments with the model show that existing high migration rates and strong selection factors, which are unaffected by climate change, are likely responsible for the weak migration response.

AB This article introduces an agent-based simulation model representing the dynamic processes of cooperative R&D in the manufacturing sector of South Korea. Firms' behaviors were defined according to empirical findings on a data set from the internationally standardized Korean Innovation Survey in 2005. Simulation algorithms and parameters were defined based on the determinants of firms' likelihood to participate in cooperation with other firms when conducting innovation activities. The calibration process was conducted to the point where artificially generated scenarios were equivalent to the one observed in the real world. The aim of this simulation game was to create a basic implementation that could be extended to test different policies strategies in order to observe sector responses (including cross-sector spillovers) when promoting cooperative innovation. Based on the evaluation of simulated research collaboration data, sector responses to strategies concerning government intervention in R&D of the firms can now be assessed.

ID FREQUENCY FINANCIAL DATA
AB Exploiting a precise reproduction of a stock exchange, the robustness of the continuous double auction (CDA) mechanism, evaluated by means of the waiting time distributions, has been proved versus 36 different setups made by varying both the operators' behavior and the market micro structure. The obtained results demonstrate that the CDA remains able to clear strongly different order flows, although the Milan stock exchange seemed to be a little more efficient than the NYSE under the allocative point of view, evidencing the intrinsic complexity of the stock market. The simulation has been built as an agent-based model in order to obtain a plausible order flow. The decisions of single agents and their interaction through the market book are realistic and reproduce some empirical analysis results. The mentioned results have been obtained either by the analysis of the complete pending time series or the same computation of the asks and bids series alone.

AB Background: Intravascular-thrombosis and extravascular-lipid-deposition are the two key pathogenic events considered to interrupt intraosseous blood supply during steroid-associated osteonecrosis (ON) development. However, there are no reported candidate agents capable of simultaneously targeting these two key pathogenic events. The authors' published experimental studies have shown that Epimedium-derived flavonoids possess an anti-ON effect. Further, the authors have recently identified a small molecule Icaritin as an intestinal metabolite of Epimedium-derived flavonoids.
   Objective: The present study was to evaluate the prevention effect of the available semisynthesized small molecule Icaritin on steroid-associated ON development in a rabbit model.
   Methods: After receiving an established inductive protocol for inducing steroid-associated ON. eighty-four male 28-week-old New-Zealand white rabbits were divided into the following three daily oral administration groups, including low close Icaritin group (L-ICT; n=28; 5 mg.kg(-1) day(-1)), high dose Icaritin group (H-ICT: n=28; 10 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)), and control vehicle group (CON: n=28). Before and after induction, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI was performed on proximal femur for intra-osseous perfusion function index. Meanwhile, blood samples were examined for coagulation, fibrinolysis, lipid-transportation, endothelium injury, oxidative stress, and hepatocyte injury index, while marrow samples were quantified for adipogenic potential index of mesenchymal stein cell by in vitro culture and proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) protein expression by western blot. At baseline, week 1 and 2 post-induction, 4, 8 and 16 rabbits in each group were sacrificed, respectively. After sacrifice, femora were dissected for micro-CT-based micro-angiography, followed by histological examination of ON lesion, intravascular thrombosis, extravascular fat-cell and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) localized expression.
   Results: The ON incidence in the L-ICT and H-ICT groups was both significantly lower than that in the CON group (p<0.05 for both). The ON incidence in the H-ICTgroup was significantly lower than that in the L-ICT group (p<0.05). A significant decrease in the vascularization index and a significant increase in the permeability index seen in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and almost prevented in the H-ICT group at week 1 post-induction. Reduced perfusion to vessel-like Structural units was more rarely found in the H-ICT group than in the L-ICT group. Regarding intravascular thrombosis, a significant increase in the thrombotic vessel count, endothelium injury index, coagulation index, and a significant decrease in both the fibrinolysis and oxidative stress index in the CON group were attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. For extravascular lipid-deposition, a significant increase in the fat cell area fraction, adipogenic potential index, PPARgamma expression and lipid-transportation index in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Increased immunoreactivity of VEGF in the CON group was attenuated in the L-ICT group and prevented in the H-ICT group. Regarding safety, the hepatocyte injury index did not show significant change from baseline in any group.
   Conclusion: Icaritin, a novel semisynthesized small molecule with osteoprotective potential, exerts dose-dependent effect oil reducing incidence of steroid-associated ON with inhibition of both intravascular thrombosis and extravascular lipid-deposition. Suppression of the Lip-regulated PPARgamma expression for extravascular adipogenesis of mesenchymal stem cells and protection from activated oxidative stress for intravascular endothelium injury were found to be involved in the underlying mechanisms.

ID CONFIDENCE
AB We consider the Hegselmann-Krause bounded confidence dynamics for n equally spaced, opinions in R. We completely determine the evolution when the initial separation d equals the confidence bound r = 1. Every fifth time step, three agents disconnect at either end before collapsing to a cluster. This continues until fewer than 6 agents remain in the middle, and these finally collapse to a cluster, if n is not a multiple of 6. The configuration thus freezes in time 5n/6 + O(1). We show that for values approximate to 0.81, the evolution is similarly periodic but with a freezing time of n + O(1), and conjecture that this is maximal for equidistant configurations. Finally, we consider the dynamics for arbitrary spacings d is an element of [0, 1]. Based on a mix of rigorous analysis and simulations, we propose hypotheses concerning the regularity of the evolution for arbitrary d, and a limiting behaviour as d -> 0.

AB Controlling the swelling ratio, diffusion rate, and mechanical properties of a crosslinked polymer is important in hydrogel design for biomedical applications. Each of these factors depends strongly on the degree of crosslinking. Primary cyclization, where a propagating radical reacts intramolecularly with a pendant double bond on the same chain, decreases the crosslinking density and increases the molecular weight between crosslinks. Processing conditions, specifically the solvent concentration, strongly affect the extent of primary cyclization. In this work the effects of solvent concentration and comonomer composition on primary cyclization are investigated using a novel kinetic model and experimental measurement of mechanical properties. Two divinyl crosslinking agents were investigated, diethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (DEGDMA) and polyethyleneglycol 600 dimethacrylate (PEG(600)DMA), and each was copolymerized with hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) and octyl methacrylate (OcMA). The model is further used to predict the gel point conversion and swelling ratio of PAA hydrogels polymerized in the presence of varying amounts of water. Model results show how increasing the solvent concentration during the polymerization increases the molecular weight between crosslinks by nearly a factor of three and more than doubles the swelling ratio. Where possible, experimental results provide quantitative agreement with model predictions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE E-commerce; Neural networks; Pricing
AB Internet markets allow online sellers to rapidly update prices. By employing intelligent software agents known as pricebots, the re-pricing process can be streamlined and automated. Developing the pricebot repricing logic requires an understanding of the optimal pricing strategy in relation to competitors' strategies.
   We use simulation to construct a decision table of the most effective counterstrategy for several competitor strategy combinations. We then design a neural network for classifying the strategies of the competition, which allows us to look up the optimal counterstrategy in the decision table. Our findings indicate that a pricebot armed with the decision table and neural network classifier can recognize when the market is such that no entrant can gain a profit advantage beyond the profit achieved at a common price floor, and in other cases where higher profits are possible, the agent is able to achieve statistically significant profit improvements over the no-pricebot case.

AB In order to mitigate Greenhouse Gas emissions, emission trading and renewable energy support schemes have been or are going to be implemented in some developed countries or regions. Inevitably, the implementation of these two schemes would bring some new problems to electricity market operation. Given this background, with the implementation of these two schemes, an agent-based market simulation method is proposed in this study for analysing the gaming behaviours of generation companies in an electricity market environment. Replicator dynamics algorithm is employed to simulate the bidding strategies of agents (generation companies) for profit maximisation. The operation process of a specified electricity market is simulated over a studied time horizon and some indices are employed to evaluate the market operation performance. A numerical example is served for demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed model and methodology. The impacts of the two schemes on the electricity market operation are examined through the comparisons of the indices in different scenarios.

AB Nucleic acid is the key unit and a predominant genetic material for interpreting the fundamental basis of genetic information in an organism and now it is used for the evolution of a novel group of therapeutics. To identify the potential impact on the biological science, it receives high recognition in therapeutic applications. Due to its selective recognition of molecular targets and pathways, DNA significantly imparts tremendous specificity of action. Examining the properties of DNA holds numerous advantages in assembly, interconnects, computational elements, along with potential applications of DNA self-assembly and scaffolding include nanoelectronics, biosensors, and programmable/autonomous molecular machines. The interaction of low molecular weight, small molecules with DNA is a significant feature in pharmacology. Based on the mode of binding mechanisms, small molecules are categorized as intercalators and groove binders having a significant role in target-based drug development. The understanding mechanism of drug-DNA interaction plays an important role in the development of novel drug molecules with more effective and lesser side effects. This article attempts to outline those interactions of drug-DNA with both experimental and computational advances, including ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectroscopy, fluorescent spectroscopy, circular dichroism, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking and dynamics, and quantum mechanical applications.

AB Pregnancy is associated with decreases of blood pressure and vascular sensitivity to vasopressor agents.  We have hypothesized that the increased liberation of endogenous vasodilator(s) by the vascular endothelium or other structures could mediate these blunted responses.  Thoracic aorta rings of nonpregnant, 21 days pregnant, and first day post partum rats respond similarly to acetylcholine, an endothelium-dependent vasorelaxant.  In contrast, the potency of the response to sodium nitroprusside, an endothelium-independent vasorelaxant, is unchanged in tissues of pregnant rats and increased (p < 0.05) in those of post partum animals.  In the presence of indomethacin (10-mu-mol/L) the three groups of tissues show a decreased potency.  The effects of phenylephrine on aortic rings of both nonpregnant and pregnant rats are markedly increased in the presence of N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine.  Indeed, the concentration producing 50% of the maximum response of phenylephrine decreases (p < 0.001) from 50.7 to 8.02, from 93.8 to 37.6, and from 60.4 to 5.97 nmol/L with the use of N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine (0.1 mmol/L) in rings from nonpregnant, pregnant, and postpartum rats, respectively.  Simultaneously, the maximum response to phenylephrine increases markedly in three groups of tissues.  In the presence of N(g)-monomethyl-L-arginine, indomethacin does not influence the response to phenylephrine.  Our results do not support the possible involvement of an endogenous vasodilator (prostaglandin-like or endothelium-derived) in the blunted responses to vasoconstrictors during pregnancy.

AB A mechanical drainage system, the "artificial lymphatic system" (ALS), consisting of a vacuum source and drain, is evaluated for its ability to aspirate the interstitial fluids responsible for the elevated interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) observed in solid tumors. IFP, pH, and pO(2) radial profiles were measured before and after aspiration using wick-in-needle (WIN) probes, needle pH and oxygen electrodes, respectively. Laser Doppler flowmetry measured temporal changes in blood flow rate (BFR) at the tumor surface during aspiration. The WIN probe and IFP profile data were analyzed using numerical simulation and distributed mathematical models, respectively. The model parameter, p(E), reflecting central tumor IFP, was reduced from 15.3 to 5.7 mm Hg in neuroblastoma and from 13.3 to 12.1 mm Hg in Walker 256, respectively, following aspiration. The simulation demonstrated that spatial averaging inherent in WIN measurements reduced the calculated magnitude of the model parameter changes. IFP was significantly lower (p<0.05), especially in regions surrounding the drain, and BFR was significantly higher (p<0.05) following 25 and 45 min of aspiration, respectively; pH and pO(2) profiles increased following aspiration. The experimental and mathematical findings suggest that ALS aspiration may be a viable way of reducing IFP and increasing BFR, pO(2) and pH and should enhance solid tumor chemo and radiation therapy.

AB The human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) is the most frequent agent of respiratory infections in infants and children with no currently approved vaccine. The M2-1 protein is an important transcriptional antitermination factor and a potential target for viral replication inhibitor development. Hesperetin (HST) and hesperidin (HSD) are flavonoids from the flavanone group, naturally found in citrus and have, as one of their properties, antiviral activity. The present study reports on the interactions between hRSV M2-1 and these flavanones using experimental techniques in association with computational tools. STD-NMR results showed that HST and HSD bind to M2-1 by positioning their aromatic rings into the target protein binding site. Fluorescence quenching measurements revealed that HST had an interaction affinity greater than HSD towards M2-1. The thermodynamic analysis suggested that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions are important for the molecular stabilization of the complexes. Computational simulations corroborated with the experimental results and indicated that the possible interaction region for the flavonoids is the AMP-binding site in M2-1. Therefore, these results point that HST and HSD bind stably to a critical region in M2-1, which is vital for its biological function, and thus might play a possible role antiviral against hRSV.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of various irrigants on the dislodgement resistance of MTA Repair HP, MTA Angelus, and MTA Flow to root dentin. Three slices (1.0 +/- 0.1 mm) were prepared from the middle third of 20 human maxillary anterior teeth. On each dentin disc, three perpendicular simulated perforation holes with a standardized 0.8 mm diameter were created. The sections from the same root were distributed arbitrarily into three groups (n = 20) for smear layer removal procedure: ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), chitosan-based silver nanoparticles (AgNPs-chitosan), and maleic acid (MA). Afterwards, the holes were randomly filled with one of the three investigated cements. The samples were submitted to the push-out test using a universal measuring system. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were used to assess statistical differences among the groups. When the results were evaluated, it was found that the types of cement and chelating agents significantly affected the dislocation resistance (P < 0.05). EDTA provided a higher dislocation resistance with the investigated cements in comparison to MA and AgNPs-chitosan (P < 0.05). Furthermore, it was observed that MTA Flow and MTA Angelus presented improved dislocation resistance values than the MTA Repair HP when used with EDTA (P < 0.05). The findings indicated that EDTA increased the dislodgement resistance of the investigated cements. In conclusion, when EDTA used, MTA Flow, and MTA Angelus showed higher dislocation resistance values.

AB Recent investigations have found a higher incidence of adverse events associated with hematopoietic cell donation in related donors (RDs) who have morbidities that if present in an unrelated donor (UD) would preclude donation. In the UD setting, regulatory standards ensure independent assessment of donors, one of several crucial measures to safeguard donor health and safety. A survey conducted by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) Donor Health and Safety Working Committee in 2007 reported a potential conflict of interest in >70% of US centers, where physicians had simultaneous responsibility for RDs and their recipients. Consequently, several international organizations have endeavored to improve practice through regulations and consensus recommendations. We hypothesized that the changes in the 2012 Foundation for the Accreditation of Cellular Therapy and the Joint Accreditation Committee International Society for Cellular Therapy and European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation standards resulting from the CIBMTR study would have significantly impacted practice. Accordingly, we conducted a follow-up survey of US transplantation centers to assess practice changes since 2007, and to investigate additional areas where RD care was predicted to differ from UD care. A total of 73 centers (53%), performing 79% of RD transplantations in the United States, responded. Significant improvements were observed since the earlier survey; 62% centers now ensure separation of RD and recipient care (P < .0001). This study identifies several areas where RD management does not meet international donor care standards, however. Particular concerns include counseling and assessment of donors before HLA typing, with 61% centers first disclosing donor HLA results to an individual other than the donor, the use of unlicensed mobilization agents, and the absence of long-term donor follow-up. Recommendations for improvement are made. (C) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

AB Despite the critical role that replication plays in the advancement of science, its presence in modelling literature is rare. To encourage others to conduct replication and report success and challenges that facilitate or hinder replication, we present the replication of an agent-based model (ABM) of residential sprawl using the Replication Standard. Replication results achieved relational equivalence. Through the replication process, issues with the original research were identified and corrected in an Improved model, which qualitatively supported original results. A specific challenge affecting alignment of original and Replicate models included capturing model output variability and publishing all original output data for statistical analysis. Through the replication of agentbased models, additional confidence in model behaviour can be garnered and replicated ABMs can become accredited for reuse by others. Future research in the development and refinement of replication methodology and assessments should be cultivated along with a culture of value for replication efforts.

AB Purpose: Administration of several cataractogenic agents is effective during the first 21 days of rat lens development, a period of the highest sensitivity of the tissue. Thus, cataract formation and lens maturation affect the biochemical profile of rat lens simultaneously and might be difficult to evaluate separately. The purpose of this study was to use high-resolution magic angle spinning proton nuclear magnetic resonance (HR-MAS H-1 NMR) to investigate exclusively the effect of maturation on the metabolic profile of rat lens. Methods: Albino Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 15) were divided into five groups of three animals and sacrificed at designated times (7, 14, 20, 30, and 60 days). The lenses were dissected, frozen, and thereafter analyzed with HR-MAS H-1 NMR spectroscopy. Special grouping patterns among the tissue samples of different age and the relative percentage changes in particular metabolite concentrations were evaluated using appropriate statistical methods (principal components, one-way ANOVA). Results: Time-dependent alterations in the metabolic profile of the rat lens tissue were dominated by a significant increase in taurine, hypotaurine, and myolnositol concentrations at the age of 30 days. Contents of the energy metabolites and amino acids were nearly constant between the ages of 14 and 30 days, showing a significant decrease in the 60-day-old rat lenses. Conclusions: HR-MAS H-1 NMR spectroscopy showed its suitability to assess the natural alterations in the metabolic profile of maturing rat lens. The results can be used in future cataract research designed to evaluate the metabolic effect of different cataractogenic agents during this postnatal period.

ID TRANSACTION TAXES; FINANCIAL MARKET; PRICE IMPACT; BEHAVIOR; DEPTH
AB We explore possible effects of a Tobin tax on exchange rate dynamics in a heterogeneous agent model. To assess the impact of the Tobin tax in this framework, we extend the model of De Grauwe and Grimaldi (Eur Econ Rev 50(1):1-33, 2006) by including transaction costs and perform numerical simulations. Motivated by the importance of the market microstructure, we choose to model the market as being cleared by a Walrasian auctioneer. This setting could more closely resemble the two-layered structure of foreign exchanges at daily frequency than a price impact function, which is often adopted in similar studies. We find that the Tobin tax can deliver a moderate reduction of return volatility and kurtosis. In addition, simulations indicate that the Tobin tax reduces the degree of mispricing in the time series, which is primarily achieved by eliminating long-lasting deviations from fundamental value.

TI Spatial game in cellular automaton evacuation model
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; FASTER
AB For numerical simulations of crowd dynamics in an evacuation we need a computationally light environment, such as the cellular automaton model (CA). By choosing the right model parameters, different types of crowd behavior and collective effects can be produced. But the CA does not answer why, when, and how these different behaviors and collective effects occur. In this article, we present a model, where we couple a spatial evacuation game to the CA. In the game, an agent chooses its strategy by observing its neighbors' strategies. The game matrix changes with the distance to the exit as the evacuation conditions develop. In the resulting model, an agent's strategy choice alters the parameters that govern its behavior in the CA. Thus, with our model, we are able to simulate how evacuation conditions affect the behavior of the crowd. Also, we show that some of the collective effects observed in evacuations are a result of the simple game the agents play.

AB Purpose: To compare the effects of a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, diclofenac, and prednisolone acetate on wound healing, postoperative inflammation, and other clinical parameters in laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) patients.
   Setting: Fundacion VER, Cordoba, Argentina.
   Methods: Laser in situ keratomileusis for myopia was performed simultaneously in both eyes of 16 patients by 1 surgeon. Patients were prospectively randomized to receive diclofenac eyedrops in the right eyes and prednisolone acetate eyedrops in the left, Postoperatively, the drops were administered topically every 2 hours the first day, every 6 hours the first week, every 8 hours the second week, and once a day the fourth week. Preoperatively and at each postoperative visit, evaluation of visual acuity, slitlamp biomicroscopy, corneal topography, and clinical scoring (0-III) of pain and photophobia were done; epithelial interface opacities were objectively evaluated. Follow-up was at 24, 48, and 72 hours, 1, 2, and 3 weeks, and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months. A paired t test was used for statistical analysis.
   Results: Mean age of the 16 patients was 29.4 years +/- 6.5 (SD). Preoperatively, mean spherical equivalent was -5.83 +/- 3.61 diopters (D) in the right eyes and -6.96 +/- 4.66 D in the left eyes. At 6 months postoperatively, it was -1.83 +/- 1.87 D and -1.88 +/- 2.13 D, respectively. In the first 24 hours, there were significant clinical symptoms in the diclofenac group.
   Conclusions: Wound healing was stable, with no regression, in the diclofenac and prednisolone groups. Both anti-inflammatory agents worked well in LASIK patients. J Cataract Refract Surg 1999; 25:836-841 (C) 1999 ASCRS and ESCRS.

AB Group concept mapping (GCM) has been successfully employed in program planning and evaluation for over 25 years. The broader set of systems thinking methodologies (of which GCM is one), have only recently found their way into the field. We present an overview of systems thinking emerging from a system dynamics (SD) perspective, and illustrate the potential synergy between GCM and SD. As with GCM, participatory processes are frequently employed when building SD models; however, it can be challenging to engage a large and diverse group of stakeholders in the iterative cycles of divergent thinking and consensus building required, while maintaining a broad perspective on the issue being studied. GCM provides a compelling resource for overcoming this challenge, by richly engaging a diverse set of stakeholders in broad exploration, structuring, and prioritization. SD provides an opportunity to extend GCM findings by embedding constructs in a testable hypothesis (SD model) describing how system structure and changes in constructs affect outcomes over time. SD can be used to simulate the hypothesized dynamics inherent in GCM concept maps. We illustrate the potential of the marriage of these methodologies in a case study of BECOMING, a federally-funded program aimed at strengthening the cross-sector system of care for youth with severe emotional disturbances.

AB Background
   Peritonitis is a common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) that is associated with significant morbidity including death, hospitalisation, and need to change from PD to haemodialysis. Treatment is aimed to reduce morbidity and recurrence. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.
   Objectives
   To evaluate the benefits and harms of treatments for PD-associated peritonitis.
   Search methods
   For this review update we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to March 2014 through contact with the Trials Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE, and handsearching conference proceedings.
   Selection criteria
   We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the treatment of peritonitis in PD patients (adults and children). We included any study that evaluated: administration of an antibiotic by different routes (e. g. oral, intraperitoneal (IP), intravenous (IV)); dose of an antibiotic agent; different schedules of administration of antimicrobial agents; comparisons of different regimens of antimicrobial agents; any other intervention including fibrinolytic agents, peritoneal lavage and early catheter removal.
   Data collection and analysis
   Multiple authors independently extracted data on study risk of bias and outcomes. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model. We expressed summarised treatment estimates as a risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.
   Main results
   We identified 42 eligible studies in 2433 participants: antimicrobial agents (36 studies); urokinase (4 studies), peritoneal lavage (1 study), and IP immunoglobulin (1 study). We did not identify any optimal antibiotic agent or combination of agents. IP glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) had uncertain effects on primary treatment response, relapse rates, and need for catheter removal compared to first generation cephalosporins, although glycopeptide regimens were more likely to achieve a complete cure (3 studies, 370 episodes: RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.72). For relapsing or persistent peritonitis, simultaneous catheter removal and replacement was better than urokinase at reducing treatment failure rates (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.91) although evidence was limited to a single small study. Continuous and intermittent IP antibiotic dosing schedules had similar treatment failure and relapse rates. IP antibiotics were superior to IV antibiotics in reducing treatment failure in one small study (RR 3.52, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.81). Longer duration treatment (21 days of IV vancomycin and IP gentamicin) had uncertain effects on risk of treatment relapse compared with 10 days treatment (1 study, 49 patients: RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.60 to 3.95) although may have increased ototoxicity.
   In general, review conclusions were based on a small number of studies with few events in which risk of bias was generally high; interventions were heterogeneous, and outcome definitions were often inconsistent. There were no RCTs evaluating optimal timing of catheter removal and data for automated PD were absent.
   Authors' conclusions
   Many of the studies evaluating treatment of PD-related peritonitis are small, out-dated, of poor quality, and had inconsistent definitions and dosing regimens. IP administration of antibiotics was superior to IV administration for treating PD-associated peritonitis and glycopeptides appear optimal for complete cure of peritonitis, although evidence for this finding was assessed as low quality. PD catheter removal may be the best treatment for relapsing or persistent peritonitis.
   Evidence was insufficient to identify the optimal agent, route or duration of antibiotics to treat peritonitis. No specific antibiotic appears to have superior efficacy for preventing treatment failure or relapse of peritonitis, but evidence is limited to few trials. The role of routine peritoneal lavage or urokinase is uncertain.

AB This article is concerned with the stochastic dynamic analysis of structures constructed with composite materials. Depending on many aspects (manufacturing process, material uncertainty, boundary conditions, etc.) real composite structures may have deviations with respect to the calculated response (or deterministic response). These aspects lead to a source of uncertainty in the structural response associated with constituent proportions, geometric parameters or other unexpected agents. Uncertainties should be considered in a structural system in order to improve the predictability of a given modeling scheme. In this study a model of shear deformable composite beams is employed as the mean model. The probabilistic model is constructed by adopting random variables for the uncertain parameters of the model. This strategy is called parametric probabilistic approach. The probability density functions of the random variables are constructed appealing to the Maximum Entropy Principle. The continuous model is discretised by finite elements and the Monte Carlo method is employed to perform the simulations, thereafter a statistical analysis is performed. Numerical studies are carried out to show the main advantages of the modeling strategies employed, as well as to quantify the propagation of the uncertainty in the dynamics of slender composite structures.

AB Background:
   EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) assessed the impact of once-weekly exenatide 2 mg versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, while aiming for glycemic equipoise. Consequently, greater drop-in of open-label glucose-lowering medications occurred in the placebo group. Accordingly, we explored the potential effects of their unbalanced use on major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke, and all-cause mortality (ACM), given that some of these agents are cardioprotective.
   Methods:
   Cox hazard models were performed by randomized treatment for drug classes where >5% open-label drop-in glucose-lowering medication occurred, and for glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs; 3.0%) using three methodologies: drop-in visit right censoring, inverse probability for treatment weighting (IPTW), and applying drug class risk reductions.
   Results:
   Baseline glucose-lowering medications for the 14 752 EXSCEL participants (73.1% with previous cardiovascular disease) did not differ between treatment groups. During median 3.2 years follow-up, open-label drop-in occurred in 33.4% of participants, more frequently with placebo than exenatide (38.1% versus 28.8%), with metformin (6.1% versus 4.9%), sulfonylurea (8.7% versus 6.9%), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (10.6% versus 7.5%), SGLT-2i (10.3% versus 8.1%), GLP-1 RA (3.4% versus 2.4%), and insulin (13.8% versus 9.4%). The MACE effect size was not altered meaningfully by right censoring, but the favorable HR for exenatide became nominally significant in the sulfonylurea and any glucose-lowering medication groups, while the ACM HR and p-values were essentially unchanged. IPTW decreased the MACE HR from 0.91 (P=0.061) to 0.85 (P=0.008) and the ACM HR from 0.86 (P=0.016) to 0.81 (P=0.012). Application of literature-derived risk reductions showed no meaningful changes in MACE or ACM HRs or P values, although simulations of substantially greater use of drop-in cardioprotective glucose-lowering agents demonstrated blunting of signal detection.
   Conclusions:
   EXSCEL-observed HRs for MACE and ACM remained robust after right censoring or application of literature-derived risk reductions, but the exenatide versus placebo MACE effect size and statistical significance were increased by IPTW. Effects of open-label drop-in cardioprotective medications need to be considered carefully when designing, conducting, and analyzing cardiovascular outcome trials of glucose-lowering agents under the premise of glycemic equipoise.

AB Evolutionary research continues to discover new features of human mate preferences, but the downstream consequences of these preferences for mate selection have been insufficiently explored. Some have inferred that stated preferences have few behavioral consequences given seemingly weak effects of preferences in predicting mating outcomes. Here we test this inference with data from simulated mating markets as well as from real-world couples. We generate a series of agent-based models in which preferences either do or do not drive mate selection. We compare these simulations with 3 empirical studies of real-world couples (Study 1, n = 214; Study 2, n = 259; Study 3, n = 294). Preference-driven agent based models produce several effects that emerge in real couples, but not within random simulations. These include low-magnitude correlations between stated preferences and the individual traits of chosen partners; the novel finding that people with high mate value leverage that value into securing partners with more desirable traits; and the finding that couples assort based on overall mate value. Moreover, real-world mate choices correspond strongly with preference-driven simulations, but not to simulations in which mate selection is random with respect to preferences. Finally, we provide evidence that these effects are due to the causal role of stated preferences, and are not better explained by people updating their mate preferences to match chosen mates. These results provide new evidence that stated mate preferences guide actual mate selections under real mating-market constraints.

DT Article
DE Opinion dynamics; Interaction; Disagreement; External information;
   Numerical simulations
ID MODEL; COORDINATION; EVOLUTION; MEDIA
AB Opinion dynamics concerns social processes through which populations or groups of individuals agree or disagree on specific issues. As such, modelling opinion dynamics represents an important research area that has been progressively acquiring relevance in many different domains. Existing approaches have mostly represented opinions through discrete binary or continuous variables by exploring a whole panoply of cases: e.g. independence, noise, external effects, multiple issues. In most of these cases the crucial ingredient is an attractive dynamics through which similar or similar enough agents get closer. Only rarely the possibility of explicit disagreement has been taken into account (i.e., the possibility for a repulsive interaction among individuals' opinions), and mostly for discrete or 1-dimensional opinions, through the introduction of additional model parameters. Here we introduce a new model of opinion formation, which focuses on the interplay between the possibility of explicit disagreement, modulated in a self-consistent way by the existing opinions' overlaps between the interacting individuals, and the effect of external information on the system. Opinions are modelled as a vector of continuous variables related to multiple possible choices for an issue. Information can be modulated to account for promoting multiple possible choices. Numerical results show that extreme information results in segregation and has a limited effect on the population, while milder messages have better success and a cohesion effect. Additionally, the initial condition plays an important role, with the population forming one or multiple clusters based on the initial average similarity between individuals, with a transition point depending on the number of opinion choices.

AB BACKGROUND: An animal model of chronic optic nerve injury is necessary to further understand the pathological mechanisms involved.
   OBJECTIVE: To establish a stabilized, chronic, optic nerve crush model, which is similar to the clinical situation to explore histopathological and optic electrophysiological changes involved in this injury.
   DESIGN, TIME AND SETTING: A randomized and controlled animal trial was performed at Shanghai Institute of Neurosurgery from May to October 2004.
   MATERIALS: A BAL3XRAY undetachable balloon and Magic-BD catheter were provided by BLAT, France; JX-2000 biological signal processing system by Second Military Medical University of Chinese PLA, China; inverted phase contrast microscopy by Olympus, Japan.
   METHODS: A total of twenty normal adult cats were randomly assigned to control (n = 5) and model (n = 15) groups, according to different doses of contrast agent injected through balloons as follows: 0.2 mL injection, 0.25 mL injection, and 0.35 mL injection, with each group containing 5 animals. Imitating the clinical pterion approach, the optic nerves were exposed using micro-surgical methods. An engorged undetachable balloon was implanted beneath the nerve and connected to a catheter. Balloon size was controlled with a contrast agent injection (0.1 mL/10 min) to form an occupying lesion model similar to sellar tumors.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The visually evoked potential examination was used to study optical electrophysiology changes in pre-post chronic optical nerve injury. Ultrastructural pathological changes to the optic nerve were analyzed by electron microscopy.
   RESULTS: During the early period (day 11 after modeling), visually evoked potential demonstrated no significant changes. In the late period (day 51 after modeling), recorded VEP demonstrated that P1 wave latency was prolonged and P1 wave amplitude was obviously reduced. Following injury, the endoneurium, myelin sheath, lamella, axolemma, and axon appeared disordered.
   CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated that the chronic, intracranial, optical nerve crush model was stable and could simulate optic nerve lesions induced by sellar tumors. Under the condition of chronic optical nerve crush, visually evoked potentials were aggravated.

AB The paper develops an agent-based model populated by heterogeneous consumers, a production sector and a banking sector. Taking a bottom up approach, the paper aims at providing a first tool to analyze households' borrowing dynamics in the different phases of the business cycle by relaxing some assumptions of mainstream consumption models and considering more realistic household borrowing behaviors. Although very simple, the model allows us to grasp the main implications of the interaction between consumers' wants (desired consumption), consumers' beliefs (their expectations about their future income), the behavior of the banking sector (rationing) and the behavior of the production sector (forecasting future demand). After presenting and discussing sensitivity analysis over a set of parameters, the paper reports simulation results and the ex-post validation by comparing artificial and empirical distributions computed using the European Household Finance and Consumption Survey data set.

AB A novel microporous two-dimensional (2D) Ni-based phosphonate metal-organic framework (MOF; denoted as IEF-13) has been successfully synthesized by a simple and green hydrothermal method and fully characterized using a combination of experimental and computational techniques. Structure resolution by single-crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that IEF-13 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-i having bi-octahedra nickel nodes and a photo/electroactive tritopic phosphonate ligand. Remarkably, this material exhibits coordinatively unsaturated nickel(II) sites, free-PO3H2 and-PO3H acidic groups, a CO2 accessible microporosity, and an exceptional thermal and chemical stability. Further, its in-deep optoelectronic characterization evidences a photoresponse suitable for photocatalysis. In this sense, the photocatalytic activity for challenging H-2 generation and overall water splitting in absence of any co-catalyst using UV-Vis irradiation and simulated sunlight has been evaluated, constituting the first report for a phosphonate-MOF photocatalyst. IEF-13 is able to produce up to 2,200 mu mol of H-2 per gram using methanol as sacrificial agent, exhibiting stability, maintaining its crystal structure and allowing its recycling. Even more, 170 mu mol of H-2 per gram were produced using IEF-13 as photocatalyst in the absence of any co-catalyst for the overall water splitting, being this reaction limited by the O-2 reduction. The present work opens new avenues for further optimization of the photocatalytic activity in this type of multifunctional materials.

AB 211 compounds containing a benzodiazepine moiety (BZD) and belonging to 4 groups of different biological activity (H - inhibitors of reverse transcriptase of HIV-I virus, A - antiarrhythmic agents, G - ligands of benzodiazepine receptor in GABAergic system and C - cholecystokinin receptor antagonists) were subjected to structure activity relationship (SAR) analysis.
   SAR investigations of all 211 BZD were based on Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) of physicochemical data connected with BBB (blood brain barrier) permeability of studied compounds. DFA was performed with STATISTICA 10.0 software by the stepwise method and resulted in 3 discriminant functions whose quality was assessed by Wilk's lambda parameter. Calculated discriminant functions (roots) were applied to draw the scatter diagram of canonical values that showed all 211 cases divided into 4 groups of different biological activity. The method was successfully validated with a set of 38 BZD derivatives expected to belong to groups H, A, G and C. The reliability of the obtained model was confirmed with a cross-validation test. Classification functions presented in this study may be used as a practical tool for predicting new BZD drugs activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Mammary gland ductal elongation is spearheaded by terminal end buds (TEBs), where populations of highly proliferative cells are maintained throughout post-pubertal organogenesis in virgin mice until the mammary fat pad is filled by a mature ductal tree. We have developed a hybrid multiscale agent-based model to study how cellular differentiation pathways, cellular proliferation capacity, and endocrine and paracrine signaling play a role during development of the mammary gland. A simplified cellular phenotypic hierarchy that includes stem, progenitor, and fully differentiated cells within the TEB was implemented. Model analysis finds that mammary gland development was highly sensitive to proliferation events within the TEB, with progenitors likely undergoing 2-3 proliferation cycles before transitioning to a non-proliferative phenotype, and this result is in agreement with our previous experimental work. Endocrine and paracrine signaling were found to provide reliable ductal elongation rate regulation, while variations in the probability a new daughter cell will be of a proliferative phenotype were seen to have minimal effects on ductal elongation rates. Moreover, the distribution of cellular phenotypes within the TEB was highly heterogeneous, demonstrating significant allowable plasticity in possible phenotypic distributions while maintaining biologically relevant growth behavior. Finally, simulation results indicate ductal elongation rates due to cellular proliferation within the TEB may have a greater sensitivity to upstream endocrine signaling than endothelial to stromal paracrine signaling within the TEB. This model provides a useful tool to gain quantitative insights into cellular population dynamics and the effects of endocrine and paracrine signaling within the pubertal terminal end bud.

AB Adaptive behavior emerges through a dynamic interaction between cognitive agents and changing environmental demands. The investigation of information processing underlying adaptive behavior relies on controlled experimental settings in which individuals are asked to accomplish demanding tasks whereby a hidden regularity or an abstract rule has to be learned dynamically. Although performance in such tasks is considered as a proxy for measuring high-level cognitive processes, the standard approach consists in summarizing observed response patterns by simple heuristic scoring measures. With this work, we propose and validate a new computational Bayesian model accounting for individual performance in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), a renowned clinical tool to measure set-shifting and deficient inhibitory processes on the basis of environmental feedback. We formalize the interaction between the task's structure, the received feedback, and the agent's behavior by building a model of the information processing mechanisms used to infer the hidden rules of the task environment. Furthermore, we embed the new model within the mathematical framework of the Bayesian Brain Theory (BBT), according to which beliefs about hidden environmental states are dynamically updated following the logic of Bayesian inference. Our computational model maps distinct cognitive processes into separable, neurobiologically plausible, information-theoretic constructs underlying observed response patterns. We assess model identification and expressiveness in accounting for meaningful human performance through extensive simulation studies. We then validate the model on real behavioral data in order to highlight the utility of the proposed model in recovering cognitive dynamics at an individual level. We highlight the potentials of our model in decomposing adaptive behavior in the WCST into several information-theoretic metrics revealing the trial-by-trial unfolding of information processing by focusing on two exemplary individuals whose behavior is examined in depth. Finally, we focus on the theoretical implications of our computational model by discussing the mapping between BBT constructs and functional neuroanatomical correlates of task performance. We further discuss the empirical benefit of recovering the assumed dynamics of information processing for both clinical and research practices, such as neurological assessment and model-based neuroscience.

AB Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effects on enamel surface treated with hydrogen peroxide bleaching and acidic soft drink immersion and/or brushing with whitening dentifrices. Materials and Methods: Fifty-six standardized enamel slabs obtained from labial surfaces of bovine incisors were used. Enamel slabs were ground flat, polished, and randomly assigned to one of seven treatment groups: (1) control, in which no treatment was performed, (2) soft drink immersion, (3) 38% hydrogen peroxide bleaching, (4) simulated toothbrushing with whitening dentifrice, (5) soft drink immersion and bleaching, (6) soft drink immersion, bleaching, and toothbrushing, and (7) bleaching and toothbrushing. The mineral concentration of enamel surfaces was determined before and after treatments by means of Fourier transform (FT)-Raman spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometry (EDXRF). Data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA and Tukey test (p < 0.05). Results: Raman spectroscopy results indicated that enamel mineral content decreased after all treatments except in group 1, whereas EDXRF results exhibited mineral decrease in groups 3, 4, 5, and 7. Conclusion: Bleaching alone or in combination with soft drink immersion and brushing decreases enamel mineral content.

AB Objective: There are several reports of the use of adenosine as a cardioprotective agent during cardiac surgery. Adenosine treatment might affect neutrophils and inflammatory mediators. The present prospective randomized study was designed to investigate the effect of adenosine pretreatment on myocardial recovery and inflammatory response in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery.
   Design: A prospective, randomized, controlled study.
   Setting: Operative unit and ICU in a university, hospital in Finland.
   Patients: Thirty male patients undergoing primary, elective coronary revascularization.
   Interventions: Patients in the adenosine group received a 7-min infusion of adenosine (total, 650 mug/kg) before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.
   Measurements: Postoperative creatine kinase (CK)-MB release and hemodynamics were recorded. Perioperative leukocyte and cytokine release were measured.
   Results: Adenosine pretreatment resulted in less CK-MB release and an improved postbypass cardiac index. Similar leukocyte counts and cytokine responses were seen in both groups perioperatively. Neutrophil counts were similar between the groups before and after myocardial ischemia when measured simultaneously in arterial and coronary sinus blood.
   Conclusions: The present results support the hypothesis that adenosine pretreatment is cardioprotective in humans, but the present dose failed to regulate the inflammatory responses after coronary artery bypass grafting.

AB Methylmercury (MeHg) is a highly neurotoxic pollutant, whose mechanisms of toxicity are related to its pro-oxidative properties, A previous report showed under in vivo conditions the neuroprotective effects of plants of the genus Polygala against MeHg-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, the flavonoid quercetin, isolated from Polygala sabulosa, displayed beneficial effects against MeHg-induced oxidative damage under in vitro conditions. In this study, we sought for potential beneficial effects of quercetin against the neurotoxicity induced by MeHg in Swiss female mice. Animals were divided into six experimental groups: control, quercetin low dose (5 mg/kg), quercetin high dose (50 mg/kg), MeHg (40 mg/L, in tap water), MeHg + quercetin low dose, and MeHg + quercetin high dose. After the treatment (21 days), a significant motor deficit was observed in MeHg + quercetin groups. Biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress showed that the simultaneous treatment with quercetin and MeHg caused a higher cerebellar oxidative damage when compared to the individual exposures. MeHg plus quercetin elicited a higher cerebellar lipid peroxidation than MeHg or quercetin alone. The present results indicate that under in vivo conditions quercetin and MeHg cause additive pro-oxidative effects toward the mice cerebellum and that such phenomenon is associated with the observed motor deficit.

AB This study compares the temporal pattern of discharges of extracellularly recorded substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) single units in two experimental conditions: Equithesin- and ketamine-induced anesthesia. The analysis of the statistical properties of the spike trains recorded in the Equithesin group of animals showed that this experimental condition could be considered as a control condition with respect to previous data reported in the literature. We investigated the glutamatergic modulation of SNr activity at spike train level in a steady-state condition by using the anesthetic agent ketamine, which is a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors. The most relevant effect of ketamine at single unit level was to induce burst discharges, with an intraburst frequency rate near 50 Hz, specifically in units characterized by an initial long refractoriness in the Equithesin condition. The other classes of single units tended to discharge at a higher rate without any significant change in their temporal pattern of firing. Simultaneous recording of the spike trains of 108 SNr pairs (46 and 62 during Equithesin and ketamine condition, respectively) were equally distributed between pairs of units simultaneously recorded from the same electrode and from distinct electrodes at a distance up to 400 mu m in the same hemisphere. Ketamine induced a significant increase in the number of pairs with synchronous firing (from 4 to 49%), which was strongly, but not exclusively, associated with an increased tendency to fire in bursts. Neighboring cells tended to fire with a similar pattern in either condition of recording, whereas synchronous firing between distant cells was observed only during ketamine condition.

AB We present results of a study of the early-time response of the innate immune system to influenza virus infection in an agent-based model (ABM) of epithelial cell layers. We find that the competition between the anti-viral immune response and viral antagonism can lead to viral titers non-monotonic in the initial infection fraction as found in experiments. Our model includes a coarse-grained version of intra-cellular processes and inter-cellular communication via cytokine and virion diffusion. We use ABM to follow the propagation of viral infection in the layer and the increase of the viral load as a function of time for different values of the multiplicity of infection (MOI), the initial number of viruses added per cell. We find that for moderately strong host immune response, the number of infected cells and viral load for a smaller MOI exceeds that for larger MOI, as seen in experiments. We elucidate the mechanism underlying this result as the synergistic action of cytokines secreted by infected cells in controlling viral amplification for larger MOI. We investigate the length and time scales that determine this non-monotonic behavior within the ABM. We study the diffusive spread of virions and cytokines from a single infected cell in an absorbing medium analytically and numerically and deduce the length scale that yields a good estimate of the MOI at which we find non-monotonicity. Detailed computations of the temporal behavior of averaged quantities and spatial measures provide further insights into host-viral interactions and connections to experimental observations.

ID INNOVATION
AB The objective of this research is to explore the relation between personal characteristics of pedestrians and their crossing behaviour in front of an automated vehicle (AV). For this purpose, a simulation experiment was developed using Agent-Based Modelling (ABM) techniques. Sixty participants were asked to cross the road in a virtual environment displayed on a computer screen, allowing to record their crossing behaviour when in the presence of AVs and conventional vehicles (CVs). In some experimental configurations, the AVs communicated their intention to continue or not to continue their trajectories through the use of lights. The ABM allowed controlling the behaviour of the vehicles when interacting with the simulated avatar of the respondents. The subjects of the experiment were also asked to fill in a questionnaire about usual behaviour in traffic, as well as attitudes and risk perceptions toward crossing roads. The questionnaire data were used to estimate individual specific behavioural latent variables by means of principal component analysis which resulted in three main factors named: violations, lapses, and trust in AVs. The results of generalized linear mixed models applied to the data showed that besides the distance from the approaching vehicle and existence of a zebra crossing, pedestrians' crossing decisions are significantly affected by the participants' age, familiarity with AVs, the communication between the AV and the pedestrian, and whether the approaching vehicle is an AV. Moreover, the introduction of the latent factors as explanatory variables into the regression models indicated that individual specific characteristics like willingness to take risks and violate traffic rules, and trust in AVs can have additional explanatory power in the crossing decisions.

AB Rationale: Switching patients from one antipsychotic to another can lead to tolerability problems or transient symptom exacerbations. It is important to compare switching strategies to determine which methods produce the best possible patient outcomes. Objective: To investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral aripiprazole monotherapy. Method: Patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient study were randomized to: 1) immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2) immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off cur-rent antipsychotic over 2 weeks; or 3) up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. Efficacy assessments included PANSS, CGI-S, and CGI-I scores. Safety assessments included: adverse events (AEs) recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), vital signs, ECG, and clinical laboratory tests.
   Results Efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. The overall incidence of AEs was broadly comparable across all groups, and AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. Discontinuations due to AEs were comparable across the groups. No deterioration in EPS occurred in any group. The reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups. Conclusion: Any of the three strategies evaluated can be used safely for switching patients to aripiprazole from antipsychotic monotherapy. Furthermore, patients' symptoms may continue to improve after switching to aripiprazole.

AB Objective The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of simulated gastric acid solution on surface topography and bending properties of esthetic coated nickel-titanium (NiTi) archwires. Materials and methods Three brands of as-received white-coated superelastic NiTi upper archwires were used in this study: Dany, Perfect, and Nitanium. Uncoated metallic areas for each white-coated NiTi archwire were used for comparison with the coated areas. The specimens for each archwire were divided into two groups according to coating as follows: Group A, uncoated, and group B, coated. Then, each group was further subdivided into two subgroups according to the immersion medium as follows: Subgroup 1, immersed in artificial saliva, and subgroup 2, immersed in simulated gastric acid. Surface roughness, surface morphology, and three-point bending test were performed. The data were analyzed statistically using ANOVA and Tukey test. Results The archwires immersed in simulated gastric acid solution showed significantly higher surface roughness and lower forces on loading and unloading than the archwires immersed in artificial saliva (P < 0.001). Perfect archwire showed significantly the highest surface roughness compared with Dany and Nitanium archwires (P < 0.001). The uncoated archwires showed higher loading and unloading forces compared with coated archwires for all groups (P < 0.001). Nitanium archwire showed the lowest loading and unloading forces at different deflections (P < 0.001). Conclusions The simulated gastric acid solution decreased considerably the amount of force applied at a given deflection. The loading-deflection and surface roughness properties of coated archwires were affected by the type of coating material.

AB Pseudomonas aeruginosa often colonises immunocompromised patients and the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. It exhibits resistance to many antibiotics by forming biofilms, which makes it hard to eliminate. P. aeruginosa biofilms form mushroom-shaped structures under certain circumstances. Bacterial motility and the environment affect the eventual mushroom morphology. This study provides an agent-based model for the bacterial dynamics and interactions influencing bacterial biofilm shape. Cell motility in the model relies on recently published experimental data. Our simulations show colony formation by immotile cells. Motile cells escape from a single colony by nutrient chemotaxis and hence no mushroom shape develops. A high number density of non-motile colonies leads to migration of motile cells onto the top of the colonies and formation of mushroom-shaped structures. This model proposes that the formation of mushroom-shaped structures can be predicted by parameters at the time of bacteria inoculation. Depending on nutrient levels and the initial number density of stalks, mushroom-shaped structures only form in a restricted regime. This opens the possibility of early manipulation of spatial pattern formation in bacterial colonies, using environmental factors.

AB In its full sense, perception rests on an agent's model of how its sensory input comes about and the inferences it draws based on this model. These inferences are necessarily uncertain. Here, we illustrate how the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) offers a principled and generic way to deal with the several forms that uncertainty in perception takes. The HGF is a recent derivation of one-step update equations from Bayesian principles that rests on a hierarchical generative model of the environment and its (in)stability. It is computationally highly efficient, allows for online estimates of hidden states, and has found numerous applications to experimental data from human subjects. In this paper, we generalize previous descriptions of the HGF and its account of perceptual uncertainty. First, we explicitly formulate the extension of the HGF's hierarchy to any number of levels; second, we discuss how various forms of uncertainty are accommodated by the minimization of variational free energy as encoded in the update equations; third, we combine the HGF with decision models and demonstrate the inversion of this combination; finally, we report a simulation study that compared four optimization methods for inverting the HGF/decision model combination at different noise levels. These four methods (Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, Gaussian process-based global optimization, variational Bayes and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling) all performed well even under considerable noise, with variational Bayes offering the best combination of efficiency and informativeness of inference. Our results demonstrate that the HGF provides a principled, flexible, and efficient-but at the same time intuitive-framework for the resolution of perceptual uncertainty in behaving agents.

AB The exploitation of shale oil and gas has become commercial in the Sichuan basin, China. However, initial fracture closure will result in low production. Therefore, temporary plugging fracturing technology is proposed to create new fractures in alternate directions using a temporary plugging agent that blocks initial fractures, which will lead to a complex fracture morphology. The mechanism of temporary plugging and fracture propagation behavior remains ambiguous, even with many successful operations. Hence, five shale outcrops are used to conduct large-size true tri-axial temporary plugging fracturing simulation experiments to study the issues mentioned above. The effects of horizontal stress difference and temporary plugging agent amount on plugging effectiveness as well as fracture propagation behavior are discussed. The results reveal that the initial fractures are sealed successfully by a water soluble temporary plugging agent. Two plugging positions, fracture heel and tip, result in three main fracture diversion patterns: fracture diversion at the old fracture heel, fracture diversion inside the old fracture, and a new fracture induced at a new position. Based on the fracturing pressure curve, fracturing pressure in the second fracturing is higher than that of the first fracturing, which indicates effective plugging and fracture diversion. A large horizontal stress difference has prevented fracture diversion, and led to a small diversion angle. However, it has improved the induced fracture propagation length. Moreover, the temporary plugging agent amount determines the plugging position and fracture diversion pattern. Fracture diversion inside existing fractures is a result of a small amount sealing at the fracture tip. The other two patterns are created by a large amount of plugging at the fracture heel. Therefore, in order to achieve successful plugging effectiveness, it is necessary to conduct more experiments to optimize operation parameters according to the specific horizontal in-stress state.

AB This study presents the application of XCS learning algorithm in simulating drivers' lane selection behaviour in microscopic simulation models of toll plazas. XCS is a special case of learning classifier systems, a machine learning technique that ties reinforcement learning (RL) and genetic algorithm. The proposed formulation translates an agent's lane selection decision into a learning problem, assuming that its ultimate objective is to reduce delay and crash risk. The agent is simulated without any notion of the outcome of its decisions. Through multiple learning episodes and the outcome of its actions, it learns the best policy to implement in a given network setting. A hypothetical toll plaza simulation network developed in Paramics simulation software is used to conduct experimental analyses. The results demonstrate that the agent's toll lane selection decision yields superior results in terms of delay and crash risk compared with those of minimum queue lane selection, minimum risk lane selection, random lane selection and multinomial probit model-based lane selection behaviours. Although both the delay and crash risk objectives are not used simultaneously during learning, this study is intended as a proof of concept to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing RL algorithms in microscopic traffic simulation models.

AB A Monte Carlo model is used to show that chain-length dependent termination plays an important role in free-radical polymerization systems containing reversible transfer agents (RTAs) such as RAFT agents and alkyl halides. As dormant chains are activated through the reversible transfer reaction, the chain-length of the active species changes. By changing the length of the propagating radical, the RTA changes the behavior of the entire system, through the chain-length dependent termination reaction. The amount of polymer that may be produced before two radicals terminate is studied as a function of system parameters such as the transfer constant of the RTA, the concentration of the RTA, and the length of the dormant chains by modeling RTA-mediated polymerization, with emphasis on emulsion polymerizations. High transfer constant RTAs and short dormant chains exhibit significantly shorter radical lifetimes and hence have a slower overall rate of polymerization (seen as a lower average number of radicals per particle) than systems without RTA. Conversely, long dormant chains may lead to an extension of radical lifetimes and an increase in the number of radicals per particle. These effects are due to the change in the chain length of the polymeric radical because of transfer to dormant species, such that significant amounts of short-short termination are seen at low conversions and long-long termination is required at high conversions. This work also suggests several experimental techniques, including the use of oligomeric adducts to the RTA, that may offer solutions to the known problems of RTA systems in bulk, solution, and particularly emulsion polymerization.

AB The aim was to study the impact of the defect size of endodontically treated incisors compared to dental implants as abutments on the survival of zirconia two-unit anterior cantilever-fixed partial dentures (2U-FPDs) during 10-year simulation.
   Human maxillary central incisors were endodontically treated and divided into three groups (n = 24): I, access cavities rebuilt with composite core; II, teeth decoronated and restored with composite; and III as II supported by fiber posts. In group IV, implants with individual zirconia abutments were used. Specimens were restored with zirconia 2U-FPDs and exposed to two sequences of thermal cycling and mechanical loading. Statistics: Kaplan-Meier; log-rank tests.
   During TCML in group I two tooth fractures and two debondings with chipping were found. Solely chippings occurred in groups II (2x), IV (2x), and III (1x). No significant different survival was found for the different abutments (p = 0.085) or FPDs (p = 0.526). Load capability differed significantly between groups I (176 N) and III (670 N), and III and IV (324 N) (p < 0.024).
   Within the limitations of an in vitro study, it can be concluded that zirconia-framework 2U-FPDs on decoronated teeth with/without post showed comparable in vitro reliability as restorations on implants. The results indicated that restorations on teeth with only access cavity perform worse in survival and linear loading.
   Even severe defects do not justify per se a replacement of this particular tooth by a dental implant from load capability point of view.

AB Ketamine (K) i.m. has been widely used for anesthetic induction in small children in the last decades, if mask induction has failed. In many instances, however, physical restraint was required. In order to eliminate the pain of i.m. injection and to prevent the psychological and physical trauma associated with restraint, we evaluated the utility of jet-injection (j.i.) of K for anesthetic induction in a dose-range finding study. Thirty children (age 1 - 6 years), whose parents gave a valid consent approved by the IRE and were scheduled for minor surgeries, were randomized into 3 equal groups: A/ketamine 6.0 mg/kg j.i., B/ketamine 3.5 mg/kg j.i., C/ketamine 2.5 mg/kg j.i. As a drying agent atropine 20 mu g/kg was also given i.v. The onset of full amnesic/sedative effect of K, the scoring of sedation and emotional state, the ease of placement of the i.v. catheter, the speed of recovery by Aldrete scores, and the time for safe discharge were evaluated. Although no demographic differences were observed among the groups the duration of surgery and anesthesia were longer in the B group (41 and 49 min) than in the A or C groups. The onset of sedation was significantly (p < 0.05) faster in group A (174 sec) than in group B (312 sec) or C (303 sec). However, no significant difference was observed in the onset of complete sedation among the groups. The sedation index was the lowest representing the best sedation in group A (4.2) while in group B and C were somewhat higher (4.6 and 4.4). There were no differences in the ease of i.v. cannulation among the groups. Recovery from anesthesia was the slowest in group A, although the differences among the 3 groups did not reach statistical significance. The mean discharge times ranged from 10 - 13 min with no differences among the groups. Laryngospasm occurred in 4 : 10 in group A and 1 : 10 in groups B and C. Evidently the high dose of K, 6.0 mg/kg caused a proneness to laryngospasm. Since no additional benefit was derived from this high dose, the lower doses (3.0 mg/kg) of K may be sufficient for routine use. None of the children experienced unpleasant recall or pain for the injection or the whole procedure. This new route of anesthetic induction with the jet-injector utilizing K may provide pain-free and stress-free induction as compared to its i.m. injection. This technique also prevents transmission of infection and cost effective since simultaneous and/or sequential injection can be given from a single vial of K.

AB Apart from the well-known sulfur mustard (SM), additional sulfur-containing blistering chemical warfare agents exist. Sesquimustard (Q) is one of them and five times more blistering than SM. It is a common impurity in mustard mixtures and regularly found in old munitions but can also be used in pure form. Compared to the extensive literature on SM, very little experimental data is available on Q and no protein biomarkers of exposure have been reported. We herein report for the first time the adduct of Q with the nucleophilic Cys(34)residue of human serum albumin (HSA) formed in vitro and introduce two novel bioanalytical procedures for detection. After proteolysis of this HSA adduct catalyzed either by pronase or by proteinase K, two biomarkers were identified by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/HR MS), namely a dipeptide and a tripeptide, both alkylated at their Cys residue, which we refer to as HETETE-CP and HETETE-CPF. HETETE represents the Q-derived thio-alkyl moiety bearing a terminal hydroxyl group: "hydroxyethylthioethylthioethyl." Targeting both peptide markers from plasma, a micro liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method working in the selected reaction monitoring mode (mu LC-ESI MS/MS SRM) was developed and validated as well suited for the verification of exposure to Q. Fulfilling the quality criteria defined by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the novel methods enable the detection of exposure to Q alone or in mixtures with SM. We further report on the relative reactivity of Q compared to SM. Based on experiments making use of partially deuterated Q as the alkylating agent, we rule out a major role for six-membered ring sulfonium ions as relevant reactive species in the alkylation of Cys(34). Furthermore, the results of molecular dynamics simulations are indicative that the protein environment around Cys(34) allows adduct formation with elongated but not bulky molecules such as Q, and identify important hydrogen bonding interactions and hydrophobic contacts.

AB In vivo imaging of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity revealed that infected cells have a higher observed probability of dying after multiple contacts with CTLs. We developed a three-dimensional agent-based model to discriminate different hypotheses about how infected cells get killed based on quantitative 2-photon in vivo observations. We compared a constant CTL killing probability with mechanisms of signal integration in CTL or infected cells. The most likely scenario implied increased susceptibility of infected cells with increasing number of CTL contacts where the total number of contacts was a critical factor. However, when allowing in silico T cells to initiate new interactions with apoptotic target cells (zombie contacts), a contact history independent killing mechanism was also in agreement with experimental datasets. The comparison of observed datasets to simulation results, revealed limitations in interpreting 2-photon data, and provided readouts to distinguish CTL killing models.
   Author summary
   Despite having a clear understanding of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) mediated cytotoxicity mechanisms, its quantitative dynamics remain unexplored at a cellular level. We developed an agent-based model to compare different hypotheses for mechanisms of CTL mediated cytotoxicity that could lead to an increased killing of infected cells at higher interactions with CTLs as seen in vivo. We showed that this behaviour can be explained by modulation of properties by infected cells or CTLs with increasing number of contacts. For the modulation, we compared two modes of signal integration and showed that the number of contacts is the main determinant of cell death. We also studied the impact of contacts between CTLs and apoptotic infected cells on observed killing properties.

ID TRANSPORT; CHOICE
AB The introduction of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), typically involving the use of exclusive bus lanes and related bus priority measures, is increasingly advocated as a flexible and cost-effective way of improving the attractiveness of public transit in congested urban areas by reducing travel times and variability. These schemes typically involve the reallocation of road space for exclusive use by buses, presenting commuters with potentially competing incentives: buses on BRT routes can run faster and more efficiently than buses running in general traffic, potentially attracting commuters to public transit and reducing congestion through modal shift from cars. However, a secondary impact may also exist; remaining car users may be presented with less congested road space, improving their journey times and simultaneously acting as an incentive for some bus-users to revert to the car. To investigate the potential for these primary and secondary impacts, we develop a prototype agent-based model to investigate the nature of these interactions and how they play out into system-wide patterns of modal share and travel times. The model allows us to test the effects of multiple assumptions about the behaviors of individual agents as they respond to different incentives introduced by BRT policy changes, such as the implementation of exclusive bus lanes, increased bus frequency, pre-boarding ticket machines and express stops, separately and together. We find that, under our assumptions, these policies can result in significant improvements in terms of individual journey times, modal shift, and length of rush hour. We see that the addition of an exclusive bus lane results in significant improvements for both car users and bus riders. Informed with appropriate empirical data relating to the behavior of individual agents, the geography and the specific policy interventions, the model has the potential to aid policymakers in examining the effectiveness of different BRT schemes, applied to broader environments.

AB Study Objective: To compare the efficacy of 2% lidocaine "timing" on alleviation of pain upon induction using propofol or etomidate.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.
   Setting: Academic teaching hospital.
   Patients: 80 adult, ASA physical status I, II, and III patients scheduled for elective outpatient or inpatient surgery with an intravenous induction agent.
   Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group A received preemptive saline 4 mL and lidocaine 4 mL mixed with either propofol 20 mL (n = 20) or etomidate 20 mL (n = 20). Group B received preemptive lidocaine 4 mL and saline 4 mL mixed with either propolol 20 mL (n = 20) or etomidate 20 mL (n = 20). The 4 mL dose of preemptive drug dwelled for three minutes.
   Measurements: The induction drug mixture was injected over 60 seconds while the patient was assessed for pain using a 4-point scale (0 = no pain,1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe).
   Main Results: Mean induction pain scores were 1.0 (SD = 0.89) for propofol and 0.9 (SD = 0.90) for etomidate, representing mild induction pain. Mean induction pain scores were 0.93 (SD = 0.92) for the simultaneous treatment groups and 0.98 (SD = 0.87) for the preemptive treatment groups. The observed differences in pain scores between the techniques were not statistically (P > 0.62) or clinically meaningful.
   Conclusions: Alleviation and intensity of post-injection pain were not significantly influenced by the "timing" of administration of lidocaine 80 mg or by the specific induction drug. Pre-lidocaine and "simultaneous" lidocaine with either propofol or etomidate prevented severe pain in 95% of patients. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Understanding the pressure dependence of the nonlinear behavior of ultrasonically excited phospholipid-stabilized nanobubbles (NBs) is important for optimizing ultrasound exposure parameters for implementations of contrast enhanced ultrasound, critical to molecular imaging. The viscoelastic properties of the shell can be controlled by the introduction of membrane additives, such as propylene glycol as a membrane softener or glycerol as a membrane stiffener. We report on the production of high-yield NBs with narrow dispersity and different shell properties. Through precise control over size and shell structure, we show how these shell components interact with the phospholipid membrane, change their structure, affect their viscoelastic properties, and consequently change their acoustic response. A two-photon microscopy technique through a polarity-sensitive fluorescent dye, C-laurdan, was utilized to gain insights on the effect of membrane additives to the membrane structure. We report how the shell stiffness of NBs affects the pressure threshold (P-t) for the sudden amplification in the scattered acoustic signal from NBs. For narrow size NBs with 200 nm mean size, we find P-t to be between 123 and 245 kPa for the NBs with the most flexible membrane as assessed using C-Laurdan, 465-588 kPa for the NBs with intermediate stiffness, and 588-710 kPa for the NBs with stiff membranes. Numerical simulations of the NB dynamics are in good agreement with the experimental observations, confirming the dependence of acoustic response to shell properties, thereby substantiating further the development in engineering the shell of ultrasound contrast agents. The viscoelastic-dependent threshold behavior can be utilized for significantly and selectively enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound applications of potent narrow size NBs.

AB Ammonium nitrate (AN) has been extensively used both in explosive and propellant formulations. Unlike AN, there is a lack of information about the thermal decomposition and related kinetic analysis of phase stabilized ammonium nitrate (PSAN), Simultaneous thermal analysis (DSC-TG) has been used in the thermal characterisation of a specific type of PSAN containing 1.0% of NiO (stabilizing agent) and 0.5% of Petro (anti-caking agent) as additives. Repeated runs covering the nominal heating rates range from 2.5 to 20 K min(-1) allowed to conclude on the good reproducibility of the main features of the thermal behavior of PSAN, i.e., two phase transitions, melting and decomposition. Non-isothermal kinetic analysis has been used to estimated the Arrhenius parameters of the decomposition process by applying both a single curve method and two isoconversion methods to the TG data. The results are discussed considering the range of applicability of the methods as well as the influence of the experimental conditions and/or techniques in the kinetic analysis results in a broader sense. A systematic approach based on the isoconversion methods results and statistical tools has been adopted to obtain reliable estimates of the Arrhenius parameters for the thermal decomposition of PSAN. Under the condition of study, the values of 81.4+/-3.5 kJ mol(-1) for the activation energy and (5.63+/-0.01)x10(5) s(-1) for the pre-exponential factor were found as describing the process over a wide range of the kinetic analysis.

AB We introduce an agent-based model of epithelial cell morphogenesis to explore the complex interplay between apoptosis, proliferation, and polarization. By varying the activity levels of these mechanisms we derived phenotypic transition maps of normal and aberrant morphogenesis. These maps identify homeostatic ranges and morphologic stability conditions. The agent-based model was parameterized and validated using novel high-content image analysis of mammary acini morphogenesis in vitro with focus on time-dependent cell densities, proliferation and death rates, as well as acini morphologies. Model simulations reveal apoptosis being necessary and sufficient for initiating lumen formation, but cell polarization being the pivotal mechanism for maintaining physiological epithelium morphology and acini sphericity. Furthermore, simulations highlight that acinus growth arrest in normal acini can be achieved by controlling the fraction of proliferating cells. Interestingly, our simulations reveal a synergism between polarization and apoptosis in enhancing growth arrest. After validating the model with experimental data from a normal human breast line (MCF10A), the system was challenged to predict the growth of MCF10A where AKT-1 was overexpressed, leading to reduced apoptosis. As previously reported, this led to non growth-arrested acini, with very large sizes and partially filled lumen. However, surprisingly, image analysis revealed a much lower nuclear density than observed for normal acini. The growth kinetics indicates that these acini grew faster than the cells comprising it. The in silico model could not replicate this behavior, contradicting the classic paradigm that ductal carcinoma in situ is only the result of high proliferation and low apoptosis. Our simulations suggest that overexpression of AKT-1 must also perturb cell-cell and cell-ECM communication, reminding us that extracellular context can dictate cellular behavior.

AB Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging and allow, for example, the detection of tumors or the tracking of stem cells in vivo. By producing magnetic inhomogeneities, they influence the nuclear magnetic relaxation times, which results in a darkening, on the image, of the region containing these particles. A great number of studies have been devoted to their magnetic properties, to their synthesis and to their influence on nuclear magnetic relaxation. The theoretical and fundamental understanding of the behavior of these particles is a necessary step in predicting their efficiency as contrast agents, or to be able to experimentally obtain some of their properties from a nuclear magnetic resonance measurement. Many relaxation models have been published, and choosing one of them is not always easy, many parameters and conditions have to be taken into account. Relaxation induced by superparamagnetic particles is generally attributed to an outersphere relaxation mechanism. Each model can only be used under specific conditions (motional averaging regime, static regime, high magnetic field, etc.) or for a particular sequence (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill, spin echo, free-induction decay, nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion profile, etc.). The parameters included in the equations must be carefully interpreted. In some more complex conditions, simulations are necessary to be able to predict the relaxation rates. A good agreement is usually observed between the theoretical predictions and the experimental results, although some data still cannot be fully understood, such as the dependence of the transverse relaxation on the magnetic field.

AB Drug resistance in tuberculosis is major threat to human population. In the present investigation, we aimed to identify novel and potent benzimidazole molecules to overcome the resistance management. A series of 20 benzimidazole derivatives were examined for its activity as selective antitubercular agents. Initially, AutodockVina algorithm was performed to assess the efficacy of the molecules. The results are further enriched by redocking by means of Glide algorithm. The binding free energies of the compounds were then calculated by MM-generalized-born surface area method. Molecular docking studies elucidated that benzimidazole derivatives has revealed formation of hydrogen bond and strong binding affinity in the active site of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein. Note that ARG308, GLY189, VAL312, LEU403, and LEU190 amino acid residues of Mycobacterium tuberculosis protein PrpR are involved in binding with ligands of benzimidazoles. Interestingly, the ligands exhibited same binding potential to the active site of protein complex PrpR in both the docking programs. In essence, the result portrays that benzimidazole derivatives such as 1p, 1q, and 1 t could be potent and selective antitubercular agents than the standard drug isoniazid. These compounds were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulation to validate the dynamics activity of the compounds against PrpR. Finally, the inhibitory behavior of compounds was predicted using a machine learning algorithm trained on a data collection of 15,000 compounds utilizing graph-based signatures. Overall, the study concludes that designed benzimidazoles can be employed as antitubercular agents. Indeed, the results are helpful for the experimental biologists to develop safe and non-toxic drugs against tuberculosis.

Specifically, it studies the effect of RAs/no RAs on decision quality, decision confidence and decision satisfaction taking into account subjective knowledge (SK) and involvement.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper employed two between-subjects factorial experimental designs with subjects searching for digital cameras in a simulated online digital camera store. The experiment was conducted with graduate students in Chennai, Bengaluru and Mysore in India.
   Findings - Results of two online experiments showed that when consumers used RAs, low search led to better decision quality, whereas when consumers did not use RAs, medium search led to optimum decision quality. When consumers use RAs, SK had a U-shaped influence on the decision quality indicating that decision quality was the lowest for those with medium SK. When consumers did not use RAs, the effect of SK on decision quality was an inverted U-shape, indicating optimum decision quality for medium SK consumers. When consumers did not use RAs, subjects with high involvement made better choices, whereas when consumers used RAs, low involvement subjects made better choices. However, subjects who searched more had higher decision confidence and decision satisfaction even if their choices were not better.
   Originality/value - The effect of RA vs no RA in conjunction with relevant consumer characteristics influencing decision quality of the consumer is demonstrated in this study. The findings have important managerial, consumer and theoretical contributions to make.

AB Improving the adaptive capacity of small-scale irrigation systems to the impacts of climate change is crucial for food security in Asia. This study analyzes the capacity of small-scale irrigation systems dependent on the Asian monsoon to adapt to variability in river discharge caused by climate change. Our study is motivated by the Pumpa irrigation system, a small-scale irrigation system located in Nepal that is a model for this type of system. We developed an agent-based model in which we simulated the decisions farmers make about the irrigation strategy to use according to available water flow. Given the uncertainty associated with how climate change may affect the Asian monsoon, we simulated the performance of the system under different projections of climate change in the region (increase and decrease in rainfall, reduction and expansion of the monsoon season, and changes in the timing of the onset of the monsoon). Accordingly to our simulations, farmers might need to adapt to rainfall intensification and a late onset in the monsoon season. The demands for collective action among farmers (e.g. infrastructure repair, meetings, decisions, etc.) might increase considerably due to climate change. Although our model suggests that investment in new infrastructure might increase the performance of the system under some climate change scenarios, the high inequality among farmers when water availability is reduced might hinder the efficiency of these measures due to a reduction of farmers' willingness to cooperate. Our modeling exercise helps to hypothesize about the most sensitive climate change scenarios for smallscale irrigation farming in Nepal and helps to frame a discussion of some possible solutions and fundamental trade-offs in the process of adaptation to improve for food and water security under climate change.

AB In the IT industry, de facto standards emerge from standards competition as firms offer incompatible technologies, and user choices determine the outcome of the competition. The standards literature suggests that strong network effects create a bias toward a standard with a large installed base, leading to a winner-take-all outcome. More recently, several researchers have revealed that the dynamics of standardization are much more complex than the explanation offered by the economic theory of networks. Markets do not always exhibit tipping behavior so there is not always a single winner in de facto standardization; and the size of an overall installed base does not always exert a strong influence on adoption decisions. In contrast, network effects drawn from local social influence may be more salient to user adoption decisions. We ask: (1) Do we always observe a winner-take-all outcome in de facto standards competition? (2) What are the different technology adoption patterns observed in de facto standards competition? (3) What are the implications of network effects, switching costs, pricing, and functionality enhancement strategies on the outcome of de facto standards competition in different user network structures? Drawing on the economic theory of networks, the complex network theory, and previous work in the standards literature, we examine the influence of network effects, switching costs, price, and technology functionality on user adoption decisions using agent-based simulation. We incorporate underlying user network structures frequently observed in the real world as an important determining factor of user adoption decisions. Our results suggest that de facto standardization process does not always follow a three-phased S-shaped pattern. Winner-take-all is not a necessary outcome of standards competition. User network structures have a significant impact on the dynamics and outcomes of standards competition.

AB The goal of this article is to review many of the animal models that have been used for epilepsy research. The intent is to present the behavioral and electrographic patterns observed in these models and to relate those patterns to human epilepsy. This review is organized into three sections. The first section deals with the methods used in the study of epilepsy. These methods range from in vivo preparations. through in vitro brain slice preparations and neural grafting methods. to computer simulation methods. The second section of the review deals with agents capable of inducing epilepsy. Some of the agents include chemical convulsants. ionic changes in the tissue. changes in osmolarity, and withdrawal from drugs. The effects of these agents are reviewed with their relation to the mechanisms of action. Finally, the methods used to control epilepsy are reviewed. These methods include the application of anticonvulsants. changes in the osmolarity. neuronal grafts and electrical currents. Examples of epilepti-form activity obtained from animal models published in the literature are shown in several figures for comparison to human patterns. It is clear from this review that animal models are capable of reproducing many of the seizure types found in clinical situations. Although we have some understanding of the mechanisms underlying the abnormal behavior in these animal models, we are unable to explain the mechanisms underlying human epilepsy. However. the combination of existing animal models. in vitro human tissue experiments. and computer stimulation should allow us to advance rapidly toward a solution.

AB The paper estimates an elementary agent-based financial market model recently put forward by the same authors. Invoking the two trader types of fundamentalists and chartists, it comprises four features: price determination by excess demand; a herding mechanism that gives rise to a macroscopic adjustment equation for the population shares of the two groups; a rush towards fundamentalism when the price misalignment becomes too large; and, finally, differently strong noise components in the demand per chartist and fundamentalist trader, which implies a structural stochastic volatility in the returns. The estimation is performed using the method of simulated moments. Combining it with bootstrap and Monte Carlo methods, it is found that the model cannot be rejected by the empirical daily returns from a stock market index and a foreign exchange rate. Measures of the matching of the single moments are satisfactory, too, while the behavioural parameters are well identified and are able to discriminate between the two markets.

AB Pervasive unsafe behaviors of construction workers are the primary cause of accidents on construction job sites. The workers' safety-related behaviors are subject to a variety of factors, such as interactions with coworkers and interventions by management teams. The impacts of these factors have attracted considerable attention in academia but are yet to be fully examined. To provide a quantitative assessment of these impacts and their managerial implications in practice, an agent-based modeling approach of construction safety-related behaviors, which adopts a bottom-up architecture, is proposed in this research. This approach regards safety performance as an emergent property of the behaviors and interactions of construction workers and management teams. The development of the agent-based model is based on a range of theoretical and empirical evidence, including a cognitive analysis model for modeling worker behaviors, and site observations and surveys for the design of simulated working environment and tasks, as well as the modeling of individual behaviors and interactions. Four managerial scenarios are simulated using the proposed approach. Based on the simulation results, the effects of a number of managerial factors on the safety performance of construction workers are examined. These factors include duties of supervisors, the competency and inspection strategy of safety officers, the frequency of safety training, senior managers' involvement in safety activities and emphasis on safety goals. The effects of these factors are examined in a quantitative manner, and relevant implications for construction safety management practice are discussed. The findings prove that agent-based modeling is an effective approach for analyzing the characteristics and patterns of construction safety-related behaviors and assessing possible safety management strategies.

AB In the presence of oxygen (O-2) the model bacterium Escherichia coli is able to conserve energy by aerobic respiration. Two major terminal oxidases are involved in this process - Cyo has a relatively low affinity for O-2 but is able to pump protons and hence is energetically efficient; Cyd has a high affinity for O-2 but does not pump protons. When E. coli encounters environments with different O-2 availabilities, the expression of the genes encoding the alternative terminal oxidases, the cydAB and cyoABCDE operons, are regulated by two O-2-responsive transcription factors, ArcA (an indirect O-2 sensor) and FNR (a direct O-2 sensor). It has been suggested that O-2-consumption by the terminal oxidases located at the cytoplasmic membrane significantly affects the activities of ArcA and FNR in the bacterial nucleoid. In this study, an agent-based modeling approach has been taken to spatially simulate the uptake and consumption of O-2 by E. coli and the consequent modulation of ArcA and FNR activities based on experimental data obtained from highly controlled chemostat cultures. The molecules of O-2, transcription factors and terminal oxidases are treated as individual agents and their behaviors and interactions are imitated in a simulated 3-D E. coli cell. The model implies that there are two barriers that dampen the response of FNR to O-2, i.e. consumption of O-2 at the membrane by the terminal oxidases and reaction of O-2 with cytoplasmic FNR. Analysis of FNR variants suggested that the monomer-dimer transition is the key step in FNR-mediated repression of gene expression.

AB The behavior of a heterogeneous population of individuals during an emergency, such as epidemics, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, is dynamic, emergent and complex. In this situation, reducing uncertainty about the event is crucial in order to identify and pursue the best possible course of action. People depend on experts, government sources, the media and fellow community members as potentially valid sources of information to reduce uncertainty, but their messages can be ambiguous, misleading or contradictory. Effective risk prevention depends on the way in which the population receives, elaborates and spread the message, and together these elements result in a collective perception of risk. The interaction between individuals' attitudes toward risk and institutions, the more or less alarmist way in which the information is reported and the role of the media can lead to risk perception that differs from the original message, as well as to contrasting opinions about risk within the same population. The aim of this study is to bridge a model of opinion dynamics with the issue of uncertainty and trust in the sources, in order to understand the determinants of collective risk assessment. Our results show that alarming information spreads more easily than reassuring one, and that the media plays a key role in this. Concerning the role of internal variables, our simulation results show that risk sensitiveness has more influence on the final opinion than trust towards the institutional message. Furthermore, the role of different network structures seems to be negligible, even on two empirically calibrated network topologies, thus suggesting that knowing beforehand how much the public trusts their institutional representatives and how reactive they are to a certain risk might provide useful indications to design more effective communication strategies during crises.

AB In view of the particularity and high risk of coal mining industry, the decision-making behavior of multiple agents inside the coal-mine enterprise plays a very important role in ensuring the safety and sustainable development of coal mining industry. The existing literature studies on coal-mine safety production focus mainly on statically analyzing the game among the external entities such as the government, the enterprises themselves, and the employees inside the enterprise from a macro perspective,are short of research on revealing the dynamic interactions among the actors directly involved in the coal-mine accidents and also on proposals for effective interactions that will lead to improved safety outcomes. Therefore, this paper explores the use of evolutionary game theory to describe the interactions among the stakeholders in China's coal-mine safety production system, which includes the organization, the first-line miners, and the first-line managers. Moreover, the paper also explores dynamic simulations of the evolutionary game model to analyze the stability of stakeholder interactions and to identify equilibrium solutions. The simulation results show that when certain conditions are met, the decision-making behavior of the organization, miners, and managers can evolve into the unique ideal steady state (1, 1, 1). In addition, the strategy portfolio with a relatively high initial proportion of three agents converges more quickly to an ideal state than a relatively low strategy portfolio. Moreover, the stable state and equilibrium values are not affected by the initial value changes. Finally, we find that the combination of positive incentive policies and strict penalties policies can make the evolutionary game system converge to desired stability faster. The application of the evolutionary game and numerical simulation when simulating the multiplayer game process of coal-mine safety production is an effective way, which provides a more effective solution to the safety and sustainable development of coal mining industry.

TI A Comparative Study on DMSO-Induced Modulation of the Structural and
   Dynamical Properties of Model Bilayer Membranes
SO LANGMUIR
LA English
DT Article
AB Modulating the structures and properties of biomembranes via permeation of small amphiphilic molecules is immensely important, having diverse applications in cell biology, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals, because their physiochemical and biological interactions lead to new pathways for transdermal drug delivery and administration. In this work, we have elucidated the role of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), broadly used as a penetration-enhancing agent and cryoprotective agent on model lipid membranes, using a combination of fluorescence microscopy and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Spatially resolved fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) has been employed to unravel how the fluidity of the DMSO-induced bilayer regulates the structural alteration of the vesicles. Moreover, we have also shown that the dehydration effect of DMSO leads to weakening of the hydrogen bond between lipid headgroups and water molecules and results in faster solvation dynamics as demonstrated by femtosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. It has been gleaned that the water dynamics becomes faster because bilayer rigidity decreases in the presence of DMSO, which is also supported by time-resolved rotational anisotropy measurements. The enhanced diffusivity and increased membrane fluidity in the presence of DMSO are further ratified at the single-molecule level through fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements. Our results indicate that while the presence of DMSO significantly affects the 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers, it has a weak effect on 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-glycerol (DMPG) vesicles, which might explain the preferential interaction of DMSO with the positively charged choline group present in DMPC and DPPC vesicles. The experimental findings have also been further verified with molecular dynamics simulation studies. Moreover, it has been observed that DMSO is likely to have a differential effect on heterogeneous bilayer membranes depending on the structure and composition of their headgroups. Our results illuminate the importance of probing the lipid structure and composition of cellular membranes in determining the effects of cryoprotective agents.

AB AimThe aim of the study was to evaluate the regional push-out bond strength of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) after exposure to sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA), and peracetic acid (PAA) irrigation solutions.
   Materials and Methods1-mm-thick longitudinal slabs of root dentin were obtained from freshly extracted human canine teeth (n=80). Simulated root perforation defects, 1mm in diameter, were prepared in the coronal, middle, and apical thirds of radicular dentin. Mineral trioxide aggregate was placed into the cavities, and the specimens were stored for 1week at 37 degrees C. Thereafter, the specimens were randomly divided into four groups (n=20) according to the irrigation solution applied over the repair sites: Group 1-10ml of 5.25% NaOCl for 10min; Group 2-10ml of 5.25% NaOCl for 10min, followed by 5ml 17% EDTA for 5min; Group 3-10ml of 5.25% NaOCl for 10min, followed by application of 5ml 1% PAA for 5min; and Group 4-no irrigation. Push-out test was performed at a crosshead speed of 1mm/min. Debonding values were compared statistically using two-way analysis of variance and Tukey tests (P<0.05).
   ResultsThe push-out bond strength of MTA was not affected by the type of irrigation solution or location of the perforation defects (both P<0.05). Stereomicroscopic inspection of the samples showed that the bond failure was predominantly adhesive.
   ConclusionExposure of repaired root perforations to 5.25% NaOCl, 17% EDTA, or 1% PAA does not alter the dislocation resistance of MTA at different locations of root dentin.

AB The ternary blends consisting of Chitosan (CS), Nylon 6 (Ny 6) and Montmorillonite clay (MM clay) were prepared by the solution blending method with glutaraldehyde. The prepared ternary blends were characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The FTIR results showed that the strong intermolecular hydrogen bondings were established between chitosan, nylon 6 and montmorillonite clay. TGA showed the thermal stability of the blend is enhanced by glutaraldehyde as Crosslink agent. Results of XRD indicated that the relative crystalline of the pure chitosan film was reduced when the polymeric network was reticulated by glutaraldehyde. Finally, the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) indicated that the morphology of the blend was rough and het erogenous. Further, it confirms the interaction between the functional groups of the blend components. The extent of removal of the trace metals was found to be almost the same. The removal of these metals at different pH was also done and the maximum removal of the metals was observed at pH 4.5 for both trace metals. Adsorption studies and kinetic analysis have also been made. Moreover, the protonation of amine groups is induced an electrostatic repulsion of cations. When the pH of the solution was more than 5.5, the sorption rate began to decrease. Besides, the quantity of adsorbate on absorbent was fitted as a function in Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. The sorption kinetics was tested for pseudo first order and pseudo second order reaction. The kinetic experimental data correlated with the second order kinetic model and rate constants of sorption for kinetic models were calculated and accordingly, the correlation coefficients were obtained.

AB The enhanced permeability and retention of liposomes in solid tumors makes liposomal formulations attractive for the targeting of various antitumor agents. This study explores the binding, orientation, and dynamic properties of a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor, 7-tert-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (DB-67), and its 20(S)-4-aminobutyrate ester prodrug (DB-67-AB) in DMPC liposomes by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and experimental studies. MD simulations of an all-atom and fully hydrated liquid-crystalline bilayer (2 x 36 DMPC lipids) containing single molecules of DB-67 and DB-67-AB were conducted for up to 50 ns. Membrane/water partition coefficients for DB-67 and DB-67-AB vs pH were determined by ultracentrifugation. Fluorescence spectra and/or steady-state anisotropies were measured in various solvents and in DMPC liposomes. Kinetics for the reversible DB-67 lactone ring-opening in the presence and absence of DMPC liposomes were determined by HPLC with fluorescence detection. During the entire simulation time both DB-67 and DB-67-AB were located on the bilayer membrane near the polar ester groups of DMPC. The average depth of penetration for DB-67 and DB-67-AB was similar (12.4-13.2 angstrom) with the prodrug's protonated amino group strongly solvated by surface water and lipid phosphate groups. Binding and fluorescence experiments revealed only a modest reduction in the binding affinity upon attachment of the ionized 4-aminobutyrate group onto DB-67. The binding microenvironment polarity resembles that of a polar solvent such as EtOH and DMSO. Kinetics experiments confirmed that DB-67 lactone hydrolysis is inhibited in the presence of DMPC liposomes, consistent with the reduced exposure of its lactone ring to water, as observed in the simulations. Both bound DB-67 and bound DB-67-AB have nonrandom orientations and reduced mobility in the membrane, especially for diffusion normal to the bilayer surface, and rotational relaxation, both of which are >= 2 orders of magnitude slower than in bulk water. MD simulations correctly predicted the high binding affinities for DB-67-AB to DMPC bilayers, protection of bound DB-67 toward lactone hydrolysis, and the lack of a substantial reduction in binding for the 20(S)-4-aminobutyrate prodrug of DB-67.

AB Econometrics is nowadays an established approach to the discrete choice problem relying on statistical methods. It is used in several fields, e.g. route choice modelling, telecommunication analysis, etc. Despite its advantages, there are also some drawbacks. Thus, alternatives for modelling human choice are sought, which can reproduce overall system behavior and be valid at microscopic level.
   In this paper, we propose an agent-based approach inspired in econometric techniques producing similar results on the macro level from microscopic behavior. This work aims to be a step forward on searching an alternative for econometrics.

AB Previously, we described the synthesis and biological activity of a new class of anticancer molecules that preferentially target malignant cells and may serve as potential antitumor agents. Among several synthesized agents, we selected 3-acetyl-1,3-bis(2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl)-1-triazene (8b) as a representative of the group of 4-nitro-substituted 1,3-diaryltriazenes. The aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanism of cell response to the 8b compound. The HeLa human cervical carcinoma cell line was used as an experimental model to further investigate the mechanism of cell response to the 8b compound. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay was used to address cell survival, and western blot (immunoblotting) was used for the expression of relevant proteins after 8b drug exposure. The pretreatment of HeLa cells with salubrinal, a specific inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, confirmed the importance of ER stress in apoptosis induced by 8b. We also demonstrate that 8b triggers the activation of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) in a time-dependent and dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the inhibition of SAPK/JNK activity by JNK II before 8b treatment increased the survival rate of HeLa cells relative to survival in the presence of 8b alone, indicating the importance of this kinase in cell death. The simultaneous inhibition of ER stress induction and SAPK/JNK activation increased the survival of HeLa cells upon 8b treatment more than inhibition of both pathways independently, suggesting the separate triggering of both signaling pathways. Our data indicate that cytotoxic activity of the novel compound 8b is based on its ability to induce ER stress and SAPK/JNK signaling pathways independently, driving cells to cell death.

AB Inhibition of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) mediated by breast-cancer-gene 1 C-terminal (BRCT) is an attractive strategy to sensitize breast and ovarian cancers to chemotherapeutic agents that induce DNA damage. Such inhibitors could also be used for studies to understand the role of this PPI in DNA damage response. However, design of BRCT inhibitors is challenging because of the inherent flexibility associated with this domain. Several studies identified short phosphopeptides as tight BRCT binders. Here we investigated the thermodynamic properties of 18 phosphopeptides or peptide with phosphate mimic and three compounds with phosphate groups binding to BRCT to understand promiscuous molecular recognition and guide inhibitor design. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the interactions between inhibitors and BRCT and their dynamic behavior in the free and bound states. MD simulations revealed the key role of loops in altering the shape and size of the binding site to fit various ligands. The mining minima (M2) method was used for calculating binding free energy to explore the driving forces and the fine balance between configuration entropy loss and enthalpy gain. We designed a rigidified ligand, which showed unfavorable experimental binding affinity due to weakened enthalpy. This was because it lacked the ability to rearrange itself upon binding. Investigation of another phosphate group containing compound, C1, suggested that the entropy loss can be reduced by preventing significant narrowing of the energy well and introducing multiple new compound conformations in the bound states. From our computations, we designed an analog of C1 that introduced new intermolecular interactions to strengthen attractions while maintaining small entropic penalty. This study shows that flexible compounds do not always encounter larger entropy penalty, compared with other more rigid binders, and highlights a new strategy for inhibitor design.

AB Surfactant losses by adsorption to rock surfaces make surfactant-based enhanced oil recovery economically less feasible. We investigated polyacrylate (PA) as a sacrificial agent in the reduction of anionic surfactant adsorption with focus on calcite surfaces by using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. It was found that the adsorption of the anionic surfactant alcohol alkoxy sulfate (AAS) followed a Langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adsorbed amount reached saturation above its critical micellar concentration. Adsorption of PA was a much slower process compared to AAS adsorption. Increasing the calcium ion concentration also increased the amount of AAS adsorbed as well as the mass increase rate of PA adsorption. Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations indicated that calcium cation bridging was important for anionic surfactant AAS and PA adsorption to calcite surfaces. To effectively reduce the amount of surfactant adsorption, it was needed to preflush with PA, rather than by a simultaneous injection. Preflushing with 30 ppm of PA gave a reduction of AAS adsorption of 30% under high salinity (HS, 31,800 ppm) conditions, compared to 8% reduction under low salinity (LS, 3180 ppm) conditions. In the absence of PA, the amount of adsorbed AAS was reduced by already 50% upon changing from HS to LS conditions. Lower calcium ion concentrations, as under LS conditions, contributed to this observation. On different mineral surfaces, PA reduced the AAS adsorption in the order of alumina > calcite > silica. These results offer important insights into mitigating surfactant adsorption using PA polyelectrolyte as sacrificial agent and contribute to improved flooding strategies with reduced surfactant loss.

AB Radon (Rn-222; a radioactive noble gas) is characterized by large temporal variations that differ significantly from variations of (i) other trace elements in geogas (noble gases); (ii) variation patterns of other dynamic geophysical systems (atmospheric, tidal). Consensus exists that there is no simple and straightforward understanding of the phenomena and its behaviour. This lacuna in the understanding of the underlying principles hampers the development of applications-such as radon as a proxy of processes in the seismogenic context. Using results from field investigations and simulation experiments the GSI suggested that an unidentified extraterrestrial component, probably in solar radiation, drives periodic radon signals in the diurnal and annual frequency bands. Recent findings from experimental investigations shed additional perspectives allowing a new evaluation of the issue. Particular transient signals, measured with alpha and gamma detectors, are interpreted to reflect the influence of artificial activity. Criteria are (i) signals lasting several hours that occur around midday on workdays (Sunday-Thursday); (ii) signals composed of a train of around 10 strong pulses, each lasting less than 15min, occurring within several hours once a week, from Wednesday afternoon/evening to Thursday morning. A first interpretation is that an unidentified artificial activity of some sort (industrial?) generates and emits an unidentified agent that reaches enhanced confined mode experiments at the GSI laboratory, which respond to the incoming agent in the form of radon signals. Developing the capability of identification of such an earth-bound source generating an influencing agent is a key step towards understanding of external influence on radioactivity of radon.

AB This research develops then merges two separate models to simulate electric vehicle diffusion through recreation of the Boston metropolitan statistical area vehicle market place. The first model is a mixed (random parameters) logistic regression applied to data from the US Department of Transportation's 2009 National Household Travel Survey. The second, agent-based model simulates social network interactions through which agents' vehicle choice sets are endogenously determined. Parameters from the first model are applied to the choice sets determined in the second. Results indicate that electric vehicles as a percentages of vehicle stock range from 1% to 22% in the Boston metropolitan statistical area in the year 2030, percentages being highly dependent on scenario specifications. A lower price is the main source of competitive advantage for vehicles but other characteristics, such as vehicle classification and range, are demonstrated to influence consumer choice. Government financial incentive availability leads to greater market shares in the beginning years and helps to spread diffusion in later years due to an increased base of initial adopters. Although seen as a potential hindrance to EV diffusion, battery cost scenarios have relatively small impacts on EV diffusion in comparison to policy, range, miles per gallon (MPG), and vehicle miles travelled (VMT) as a percentage of range assumptions. Pessimistic range assumptions decrease overall PHEV and BEV percentages of vehicle stock by 50% and 30%, respectively, relative to the EPA-estimated range scenarios. Fuel cost scenarios do not considerably alter estimated BEV and PHEV stock but increase the ratio of car stock to light truck stock in the internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle spectrum. Specifically, cars are estimated at 55% of ICE vehicle stock in the default fuel price scenario but increase to 62% of ICE vehicle stock in the high world oil price scenario, with LTs covering the appropriate differences.

AB Background Cytostatic agents such as anthracyclines may cause changes in the electrophysiologic properties of the heart. We hypothesized that anthracyclines facilitate life-threatening proarrhythmic side effects of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular repolarization prolonging drugs. Methods and results The electrophysiologic effects of chronic administration of doxorubicin (Dox) were studied in ten rabbits, which were treated with Dox twice a week (1.5 mg/kg i. v.). A control group (11 rabbits) was given NaCl solution. Two of ten Dox rabbits died suddenly, the remaining animals showed mild clinical signs of heart failure after a period of six weeks. Echocardiography demonstrated a decrease in ejection fraction (pre treatment: 74 +/- 23% to post treatment: 63 +/- 16% (p < 0.05)). In isolated hearts, action potential duration measured by eight simultaneously recorded monophasic action potentials (MAP) was similar in Dox and control hearts. However, in Dox rabbits, administration of the I-Kr-blocker erythromycin (150-300 mu M) led to a significant greater prolongation of the mean MAP duration (63 +/- 21ms vs 29 +/- 12 ms, p < 0.05) and the QT interval (100 +/- 32ms vs 58 +/- 17 ms, p < 0.05) as compared to control. Moreover, I-Kr-block led to a more marked increase of dispersion of MAP(90) in the Dox group as compared to control hearts (23 +/- 7ms vs. 9 +/- 4 ms). In the presence of hypokalemia more episodes of early afterdepolarizations and torsade de pointes occurred (p < 0.05). Conclusion Even during the early phase of chemotherapeutic treatment,before significant QT-prolongation is present,anthracyclines lead to an increased sensitivity to the proarrhythmic potency of I-Kr-blocking drugs. Thus, anthracycline therapy reduces repolarization reserve and thereby represents a novel contributing factor for the development of lifethreatening proarrhythmia.

AB Background-Platelet-derived growth factors help stimulate the neointimal proliferation of restenosis after coronary interventions. Reducing platelet accumulation at treated sites may attenuate restenosis. We tested this hypothesis by inducing repetitive platelet aggregation at coronary angioplasty sites in dogs and measuring subsequent neointima formation.
   Methods and Results-Cholesterol-sensitive dogs (n=74) received either 4% cholesterol-enriched diets for >8 months (n=29), creating visible atheromas, or normal canine diets (n=45). A coronary balloon angioplasty cyclic flow variation (CFV) model was used. One group of control dogs (group 1, n =8)had angioplasty with no arterial constriction applied and no drug treatment. Three other groups had arterial constrictors applied to provoke CFVs: group 2 (n=28) received no drug therapy, group 3 (n=18) received oral aspirin alone, and group 4 (n=20) received 3 oral antiplatelet agents: ridogrel, ketanserin, and clopidogrel (R+K+C) to simultaneously inhibit the thromboxane A(2), serotonin, and ADP treated group pathways of platelet aggregation respectively. Bleeding times were moderately prolonged in the aspirin (124 +/-9 seconds after 3 weeks versus 76 +/-6 seconds at baseline, P <0.01) and greatly prolonged on R+K+C (> 600 versus 104 +/-5 seconds, P <0.001). The frequency and severity of CFVs were inversely related to the degree of platelet inhibition and prolongation of bleeding times, as was sudden death due to acute thrombotic coronary occlusion. Quantitative histology at 8 weeks revealed increased intima-to-media ratio with CFVs: 0.89 +/-0.14 in the untreated group 2 versus 0.11 +/-0.04 in the control group (P <0.001). Intima-to-media ratio was significantly reduced with antiplatelet treatment (0.27 +/-0.05 with aspirin treatment and 0.20 +/-0.05 with R+K+C treatment, respectively, P <0.001). Cholesterol feeding did not appear to influence results.
   Conclusions-Repetitive platelet accumulation at coronary angioplasty sites caused enhanced neointimal proliferation by 8 weeks. Oral inhibitors of platelet aggregation attenuated platelet function, prolonged bleeding times, reduced or prevented cyclic flows and abrupt thrombotic occlusions, and thereby inhibited neointimal proliferation. Platelet inhibition should continue to receive attention in efforts to reduce restenosis after coronary interventions.

AB Response of fiberglass epoxy composite laminates under low velocity impact loading is investigated using LS-DYNA (R), and the results are compared with experimental analysis performed using an instrumented impact test setup (Instron dynatup 8250). The composite laminates are manufactured using H-VARTM (c) process with basket weave E-Glass fabrics. Epon 862 is used as a resin system and Epicure-W as a hardening agent. Composite laminates, with 10 layers of fiberglass fabrics, are modeled using 3D solid elements in a mosaic fashion to represent basket weave pattern. Mechanical properties are calculated by using classical micromechanical theory and assigned to the elements using ORTHOTROPIC ELASTIC material model. The damage occurred since increasing impact energy is incorporated using ADVANCED COMPOSITE DAMAGE material model in LS-DYNA (R). Good agreements are obtained with the failure damage results in LS-DYNA (R) and experimental results. Main considerations for comparison are given to the impact load carrying capacity and the amount of impact energy absorbed by the laminates.

AB Pressure fluctuations have been measured in a bubble column using a differential pressure transducer as a function of the superficial gas velocity, both in the air-water system and in water-alcohol solutions simulating the behavior of industrial non-coalescing water-organic mixtures or biological media. Experimental results show that differential pressure sensors can be used to determine regime transitions and to extract regime features using the treatments usually applied to a wall pressure transducer signal (statistical, spectral, fractal, deterministic chaos analyses), although major differences appear between wall pressure and differential pressure measurements in the spectral, fractal and chaos methods. Experimental results prove also the applicability of these methods for identifying the prevailing flow regime and determining the transition points in coalescence-inhibiting systems. If, as expected, the transition is delayed to higher superficial gas velocity in the presence of surface-active agents, this appears to be much more abrupt than in pure water. Thus, the transition region classically observed in water becomes narrower and nearly disappears in the presence of propanol. In this case, the homogeneous regime extends up to a transition velocity corresponding roughly to the starting point of the fully established heterogeneous regime in pure water.

AB High-density solids such as barite and hematite are generally added to drilling fluids to increase their density, allowing the control of subsurface pressures. However, a variety of problems in drilling wells has been related to the gravitational settling of particulate materials. In this work, the dynamic behavior of barite settling in a synthetic paraffin-based drilling fluid was evaluated experimentally by monitoring the solid concentration as a function of time and height. The tests were conducted in a gravitational settling bench-scale rig using a gamma-ray attenuation technique. Following the standard approach of continuum mechanics, a mathematical model was developed to yield a single set of partial differential equations capable of describing all settling zones inherent in a batch sedimentation process. Further, by means of the predicted solid concentration profiles, it was possible to obtain the height of bottom piled up solids. The mathematical model takes particles compressibility under their own weight and permeability of the sediment into consideration. The parameters of the proposed constitutive equations for the effective pressure on solids and porous matrix permeability were estimated and statistically analyzed from the experimental profiles of solid concentration. In particular, the results obtained in this work indicated a good agreement between the model predictions and the experimental data.

AB Nanocarbon materials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and their derivatives, are considered highly effective reinforcing agents in metals. Copious experimental and computational observations suggest that the nature of the interfaces may significantly affect the mechanical behavior of nanocarbon-metal composites, while the exact correlation between the interfacial structure and the deformation and failure mechanisms of the composite remains elusive. Using a nanolaminated graphene-aluminum (Al) composite as the model material, we designed and created composites with distinct interfacial structures and bonding states via graphene functionalization. The mechanical behavior of the composites was strongly affected by the structure of the functionalized graphene (FG)/Al interface, and the optimum strength-ductility synergy came from the composite with the intermediate extent of functionalization. Complementing experimental results with molecular dynamics and phase-field simulation efforts, we interpreted these results by the combined effects of the intrinsic strength of FG nanosheets and the FG/Al interfacial bonding state.

AB Recent development in diffusion spectrum brain imaging combined to functional simulation has the potential to further our understanding of how structure and dynamics are intertwined in the human brain. At the intra-individual scale, neurocomputational models have already started to uncover how the human connectome constrains the coordination of brain activity across distributed brain regions. In parallel, at the inter-individual scale, nascent social neuroscience provides a new dynamical vista of the coupling between two embodied cognitive agents. Using EEG hyperscanning to record simultaneously the brain activities of subjects during their ongoing interaction, we have previously demonstrated that behavioral synchrony correlates with the emergence of inter-brain synchronization. However, the functional meaning of such synchronization remains to be specified. Here, we use a biophysical model to quantify to what extent inter-brain synchronizations are related to the anatomical and functional similarity of the two brains in interaction. Pairs of interacting brains were numerically simulated and compared to real data. Results show a potential dynamical property of the human connectome to facilitate inter-individual synchronizations and thus may partly account for our propensity to generate dynamical couplings with others.

AB Sodium acetate trihydrate (SAT) is an excellent phase change material (PCM) with a high heat storage capacity. However, its application is limited by supercooling. Existing solidification models with supercooling track the crystallization front and thus determine each grid's solidification degree and temperature. Therefore, crystallization speed directly determines the discharge characteristics of the solidification process under supercooling. However, this parameter has not yet been determined for the SAT compound, which is more commonly used than pure SAT. In addition, the heat release rate after crystallization is triggered cannot be determined via only the crystallization front as this would yield erroneous results. To address this problem, solidification time is incorporated into the solidification model in this study. First, the relationship between SAT solidification and temperature change is investigated via experiments. Then, different proportions of composited PCMs comprising SAT and expanded graphite (EG) are configured, and their crystallization speeds and solidification times under different states are tested. The results show that these two properties are only correlated with temperature, and exhibit no evident relationship with the EG ratio or addition of a nucleating agent. The data are incorporated into empirical formulas and used in a one-dimensional model. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental data from a previous study, thus indirectly proving the accuracy of the experimental results.

AB Epifaunal communities associated with macroalgae were exposed to storm water pulses using a custom made irrigation system. Treatments included Millipore((R)) freshwater, freshwater spiked with trace metals and seawater controls to allow for the relative importance of freshwater inundation, trace metals and increased flow to be determined. Experimental pulses created conditions similar to those that occur following real storm water events. Brief storm water pulses reduced the abundance of amphipods and gastropods. Freshwater was the causative agent as there were no additional effects of trace metals on the assemblages. Laboratory assays indicated that neither direct nor latent mortality was likely following experimental pulses and that epifauna readily avoid storm water. Indirect effects upon epifauna through salinity-induced changes to algal habitats were not found in field recolonisation experiments. Results demonstrate the importance of examining the effects of pulsed contaminants under realistic exposure conditions and the need to consider ecologically relevant end-points.

AB There is a growing use of bottom-up simulation models to reconstruct past human-environment interactions. Such detailed representations pose difficult questions not only in their design (the generality-realism trade-off) but also about the inferences that are made from them. The historical sciences are faced with seeking to make robust inferences from limited, potentially biased and/or incomplete samples from uncontrolled systems, and as a result have sometimes employed narrative explanation. By contrast, simulation models can be used experimentally and can generate large amounts of data. Here, using an agent-based model of hunter-gatherer foraging in a previously unexplored ecosystem, we consider how narratives might be identified from the trajectories produced by simulations. We show how machine learning methods can isolate qualitatively similar types of model behaviour based on summaries of model outcomes and time series. We stand to learn from this approach because it enables us to answer two questions: (i) under what conditions (representations and/or parameterisations) do we observe in the model what is recorded in the archaeological and/or palaeoenvironmental record? and (ii) does the model yield unobserved dynamics? If so, are they plausible? Using models to develop narratives is a logical extension of the bottom-up approach inherent in agent-based modelling and has the potential, alongside conventional methods of model evaluation, to aid in learning from the rich dynamics of such simulations.

AB Organizational routines are generative, dynamic systems involving multiple actors, and are crucial to understanding how organizations typically accomplish their tasks. In this paper, by regarding the individual habits of multiple actors as fundamental building blocks, we investigate organizational routines through a 'bottom-up' approach. On the basis of an individual actor-based perspective, we provide a general framework for analysing the internal structures of organizational routines and carry out agent-based simulation analysis based on a special empirical background. The results of our research show that performance feedback loops underlying interactions between actants, including both human actors and non-human artefacts, are key factors underpinning the formation and dynamics of organizational routines, and that imitation by individual actors may accelerate the emerging processes of these routines. For routines deliberately designed by management, an extended model from the perspective of evolution games indicates that a better balance of payoffs between different individual actors is important, and that the initial strategic distributions of individual actors are sensitive to the formation of routines. Agent-based simulation and evolutionary game theory thus provide quantitative but effective approaches that allow us to open up the 'black box' of organizational routines in two completely distinct forms those that emerge from repeated interaction between individual actors and those deliberately designed by management and to explore their formation and micro-dynamics.

AB Does domestic contestation of European Union legitimacy affect the behaviour of the European Commission as an economic and fiscal supervisor? We draw on theories of bureaucratic responsiveness and employ multilevel and topic modelling to examine the extent to which the politicisation of European integration affects the outputs of the European Semester: the Country-Specific Recommendations. We develop two competing sets of hypotheses and test these on an original large-N data set on Commission behaviour with observations covering the period 2011-2017. We detect a twofold effect on the Commission's recommendations: member states that experience greater politicisation receive recommendations that are larger in scope but whose substance is less oriented towards social investment. We argue that this effect is best explained as an outcome of the Commission's institutional risk management strategy of regulatory entrenchment'. The supranational agent issues additional recommendations while simultaneously entrenching on a stronger mandate substantively, which allows it to maintain its regulatory reputation and signal regulatory resolve to observing audiences.

AB The reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in aqueous media is by far the most widely used reaction for testing the catalytic performance of a large variety of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) using UV/vis absorption spectroscopy. Huge differences in the kinetic rate constant of the catalytic 4-NP to 4-AP conversion as a function of material composition, size, and morphology have been reported by many different groups; so far, these have been exclusively attributed to the catalytic activity of the corresponding MNPs. In this study, we study the overlooked critical role of the pH value on the kinetics of this important reaction. We observe a strong pH dependence of both rate constant and reaction order, which we attribute to the pH-dependent hydrolysis of the reducing agent NaBH4 in water. In each hydrolysis step, molecular hydrogen as a second reducing agent is produced. Overall, two competing pathways result in: slow hydride versus fast hydrogen reduction. Kinetic simulations based on a model including all relevant species are capable of quantitatively describing all experimental results for three different noble-metal nanoparticle catalysts (Au, Pt, and Pd). Most importantly, for a fair interlaboratory comparison of the catalytic performances of MNPs, we recommend to report rate constants of the 4-NP to 4-AP conversion at pH 13 by strict pH control using a strong base such as NaOH since at pH 13 the hydrolysis of NaBH4 in aqueous solution is slowed down significantly.

AB Numbers of drugs are being synthesized every year to meet the target of safe and disease-free society. Presently molecular modeling technique is used to unfold the mechanism of action of drugs alone or in conjunction with experimental methodologies. There are a number of drugs which are successfully developed using this methodology. Mitoxantrone (MTX) - 1, 4-dihydroxy-5, 8-bis {[2-(2-hydroxyethyl) amino] amino}-9, 10-anthracenedione is marketed under the name Novantrone, an anticancer drug used in chemotherapy. Its important analog ametantrone and various other analogs differ from one another in the position of side chain or functionalities on the chromophore eventually exhibit varied biological activities. DNA binding is an important phenomenon for anticancer activity of these drugs. In order to understand the interactions of the drug molecules with its receptor site, at atomic level, we have carried out computer simulations of drug and DNA alone and also in complex mode in water as a medium. All the simulations are being carried out using molecular operating environment (MOE) and X3DNA software tools on SUN SOLARIS platform. Interaction energy of all the drug molecules with DNA is determined and compared. Also the structural changes in DNA and drug before and after complex formation are studied extensively.

AB This paper uses an ARGET ATRP mathematical modeling to study the solution polymerization of styrene. Differently from previous published works, a detailed parametric study was performed in order to verify how chemical species behave throughout the polymerization process and to provide a numerical tool for analysis, optimization and process scale-up. The key contribution of the present work is to give detailed information about some chemical species, difficult to measure experimentally, under different parametric conditions. Catalyst and reducing agent concentration influence in the polymerization was analyzed. In parallel, catalyst/initiator ratio and catalyst/reducing agent ratio were also studied in order to propose ideal operating conditions. The results showed that catalysts presenting high K-eq values caused the poly-dispersity index to depart from the unit value. Highly active reducing agents can result in its fast consumption limiting polymerization to very low conversions. Moderate quantities of moderately active catalyst and reducing agents show a positive effect in ARGET ATRP, as the final properties of the target polymer and the polymerization behavior remain well controlled throughout the reaction. High quantities of these species, however, proved to induce undesirable effects on the polymerization as the reaction is too fast in the beginning, compromising the reaction extent, polymerization control and the final properties of the polymer.

AB Grounded theories assume that there is no central module for cognition. According to this view, all cognitive phenomena, including those considered the province of amodal cognition such as reasoning, numeric, and language processing, are ultimately grounded in (and emerge from) a variety of bodily, affective, perceptual, and motor processes. The development and expression of cognition is constrained by the embodiment of cognitive agents and various contextual factors (physical and social) in which they are immersed. The grounded framework has received numerous empirical confirmations. Still, there are very few explicit computational models that implement grounding in sensory, motor and affective processes as intrinsic to cognition, and demonstrate that grounded theories can mechanistically implement higher cognitive abilities. We propose a new alliance between grounded cognition and computational modeling toward a novel multidisciplinary enterprise: Computational Grounded Cognition. We clarify the defining features of this novel approach and emphasize the importance of using the methodology of Cognitive Robotics, which permits simultaneous consideration of multiple aspects of grounding, embodiment, and situatedness, showing how they constrain the development and expression of cognition.

AB Background: The adhesive connection between titanium base and zirconia coping of two-part abutments may be responsible for the failure rate. A high mechanical stability between both components is essential for the long-term success.
   Purpose: The aim of the present in-vitro study was to evaluate the influence of different surface modification techniques and resin-based luting agents on the retention forces between titanium and zirconia components in two-part implant abutments.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 120 abutments with a titanium base bonded to a zirconia coping were investigated. Two different resin-based luting agents (Panavia F 2.0 and RelyX Unicem) and six different surface modifications were used to fix these components, resulting in 12 test groups (n = 10). The surface of the test specimens was mechanically pretreated with aluminium oxide blasting in combination with application of two surface activating primers (Alloy Primer, Clearfil Ceramic Primer) or a tribological conditioning (Rocatec), respectively. All specimens underwent 10,000 thermal cycles between 5 degrees C and 55 degrees C in a moist environment. A pull-off test was then conducted to determine retention forces between the titanium and zirconia components, and statistical analysis was performed (two-way ANOVA). Finally, fracture surfaces were analyzed by light and scanning electron microscopy.
   Results: No significant differences were found between Panavia F 2.0 and RelyX Unicem. However, the retention forces were significantly influenced by the surface modification technique used (p < 0.001). For both luting agents, the highest retention forces were found when adhesion surfaces of both the titanium bases and the zirconia copings were pretreated with aluminium oxide blasting, and with the application of Clearfil Ceramic Primer.
   Conclusion: Surface modification techniques crucially influence the retention forces between titanium and zirconia components in two-part implant abutments. All adhesion surfaces should be pretreated by sandblasting. Moreover, a phosphate-based primer serves to enhance long-term retention of the components.

AB The salt association of LiPF6 has been investigated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a variety of solvents: ethylene carbonate, propylene carbonate (PC), gamma-butyrolactone, dimethyl carbonate, ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC), diethyl carbonate, a 1: 1 mixture of PC and 1, 2-dimethoxyethane, a 1: 1 mixture of PC and methyl propionate, and a 1: 1 mixture of PC and EMC. The degree of salt association for each electrolyte system was estimated using the pair distribution function of Li+ and the anion calculated from MD simulation trajectories. The predicted values for the salt association factor of LiPF6 showed a comparable trend to the experimental association constants. The same approach was applied to examine the salt association in the presence of a series of crown ethers: 9-crown-3, 12-crown-4, 13-crown-4, and 15-crown-5 as the Li+ trapping agents. The results demonstrated that the crown ethers were effective in separating the Li+ ion from the PF6- anion, and the ability depended on the size of the crown ether; 15-crown-5 had the largest effect on destabilizing the ion association. The method presented here may be used to screen new solvents or new salts for Li rechargeable batteries. The strength of the current method is that it can be applied to any salt, any solvent, and any mix of solvents. (C) 2002 The Electrochemical Society.

AB Short waste fibers are used to suppress the expansion and improve the tensile strength of cement-stabilized marine clay (CMC). The fiber-reinforced mechanism and characteristics are revealed by experimental and numerical methods. First, the curing effect of the CMC when adding a composite curing agent is observed by scanning electronic microscopy, as is the contact surface between the fiber and the matrix. Then, the expansion rate and the tensile strength of fiber-reinforced cement-stabilized marine clay (FCMC) are illustrated by an expansion experiment and a direct tensile experiment, respectively. The results show that the sample with the cement content of 0.1% and the fiber length of 10?mm is the best in terms of strength enhancement and expansion inhibition. Finally, the mechanism of fiber reinforcement is discussed following a single fiber pullout experiment and some comprehensive explanations are proposed to verify the results of the tensile experiment. A numerical simulation of a single fiber pullout from a matrix is established by using a cohesive contact model. The comparison between the numerical results and the experimental results shows that the two models can be in good agreement, indicating that the calculation model of the interaction between the fiber and the matrix is realistic.

AB We use a GIS-based agent-based model (ABM), named dynamic ecological exurban development (DEED), with spatial data in hypothetical scenarios to evaluate the individual and interacting effects of lot-size zoning and municipal land-acquisition strategies on possible forest-cover outcomes in Scio Township, a municipality in Southeastern Michigan. Agent types, characteristics, behavioural methods, and landscape perceptions (i.e. landscape aesthetics) are empirically informed using survey data, spatial analyses, and a USDA methodology for mapping landscape aesthetic quality. Results from our scenario experiments computationally verified literature that show large lot-size zoning policies lead to greater sprawl, and large lot-size zoning policies can lead to increased forest cover, although we found this effect to be small relative to municipal land acquisition. The return on land acquisition for forest conservation was strongly affected by the location strategy used to select parcels for conservation. Furthermore, the location strategy for forest conservation land acquisition was more effective at increasing aggregate forest levels than the independent zoning policies, the quantity of area acquired for forest conservation, and any combination of the two. The results using an integrated GIS and ABM framework for evaluating land-use development policies on forest cover provide additional insight into how these types of policies may act out over time and what aspects of the policies were more influential towards the goal of maximising forest cover.

Colorism is the allocation of privilege and disadvantage based on skin color, with a prejudice for lighter skin. Colorism might help to explain some of the racial disparities in the US' criminal justice system. I use simulated scenarios to explore the plausibility of this notion in the form of two questions: (1) How might colorism function within an organization, and (2) What might occur when managers apply the typical dilemmatic responses to detected colorism? The simulated world consists of three citizen-groups (lights, mediums, and darks), five policy responses to detected colorism, and two policing behaviors (fair and biased). Using NetLogo, one hundred simulations were conducted for each policy response and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison of means. When the tenets of colorism were applied to a simulated organizational setting, only some of the tenets held true. For instance, those in the middle of the skin color spectrum experienced higher rates of incarceration when aggressive steps were taken to counter colorism, which ran counter to the expectations of the thought experiment. The study identified an opportunity to expand the description of colorism to help describe the plight of those in the middle of the skin color spectrum. The major contributions from this work include a conceptual model that describes the relationship between the distinct levels of colorism, and it progresses the notion of interactive colorism. The study also explored conditional statements that can be converted into hypotheses for future experiments.

TI Enhancement of Radiation Effectiveness in Proton Therapy: Comparison
   Between Fusion and Fission Methods and Further Approaches
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English

ID MONTE-CARLO; ENERGY DEPOSITION; NEUTRON-CAPTURE; GEANT4; HEAD
AB Proton therapy as a promising candidate in cancer treatment has attracted much attentions and many studies have been performed to investigate the new methods to enhance its radiation effectiveness. In this regard, two research groups have suggested that using boron isotopes will lead to a radiation effectiveness enhancement, using boron-11 agent to initiate the proton fusion reaction (P-BFT) and using boron-10 agent to capture the low energy secondary neutrons (NCEPT). Since, these two innovative methods have not been approved clinically, they have been recalculated in this report, discussed and compared between them and also with the traditional proton therapy to evaluate their impacts before the experimental investigations. The calculations in the present study were performed by Geant4 and MCNPX Monte Carlo Simulation Codes were utilized for obtaining more precision in our evaluations of these methods impacts. Despite small deviations in the results from the two MC tools for the NCEPT method, a good agreement was observed regarding the delivered dose rate to the tumor site at different depths while, for P-BFT related calculations, the GEANT4 was in agreement with the analytical calculations by means of the detailed cross-sections of proton-B-11 fusion. Accordingly, both the methods generate excess dose rate to the tumor several orders of magnitude lower than the proton dose rate. Also, it was found that, the P-BFT has more significant enhancement of effectiveness, when compared to the NCEPT, a method with impact strongly depended on the tumor's depth. On the other hand, the advantage of neutron risk reduction proposed by NCEPT was found to give no considerable changes in the neutron dose absorption by healthy tissues.

AB We experimentally study decentralized organizational learning. Our objective is to understand how learning members of an organization cope with the confounding effects of the simultaneous learning of others. We test the predictions of a stylized, rational agent model of organizational learning that provides sharp predictions as to how learning members of an organization might cope with the simultaneous learning of others as a function of fundamental variables, e.g., firm size and the discount factor. While the problem of learning while others are learning is quite difficult, we find support for the comparative static predictions of the model's unique symmetric equilibrium. (JEL C72, D23, D83)

AB Alkyl alcohols are widely used in academia, industry, and our everyday lives, e.g. as cleaning agents and solvents. Vibrational spectroscopy is commonly used to identify and quantify these compounds, but also to study their structure and behavior. However, a comprehensive investigation and comparison of all normal alkanols that are liquid at room temperature has not been performed, surprisingly. This study aims at bridging this gap with a combined experimental and computational effort. For this purpose, the alkyl alcohols from methanol to undecan-1-ol have been analyzed using infrared and Raman spectroscopy. A detailed assignment of the individual peaks is presented and the influence of the alkyl chain length on the hydrogen bonding network is discussed. A 2D vibrational mapping allows a straightforward visualization of the effects. The conclusions drawn from the experimental data are backed up with results from Monte Carlo simulations using the simulation package Cassandra. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The reinforcing effect of graphene oxide (GO) and its derivatives for polymer matrices highly depends on their dispersion therein. Thus, a facile method was developed to enhance the dispersibility of GO via compounding with -methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (GO-KH570). The interfacial interactions between GO and KH570, as well as the surface morphology, chemical composition and polarity, were investigated by molecular dynamics simulation combined with experimental methods. Findings indicate that KH570 can successfully graft onto the surface of GO nanosheets via the covalent bonding, and the polarity of the as-obtained GO-KH570 can be tuned by adjusting the dosage of KH570. Besides, the GO-KH570 was further used as the filler to improve performances of polyimide (PI) matrix. After using this GO-KH570 composite, the PI-based coating was endowed with excellent wear resistance and corrosion resistance properties. Particularly, PI/GO-KH570-2 coating with a GO-KH570-2 dosage of 0.5wt% exhibits much higher hardness, showing promising potential as the candidate high-performance coating in aerospace and marine industries.

AB BACKGROUND: This work evaluates pregnancy and infant loss in 1,069 vehicle-treated cynomolgus monkeys from 78 embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies and 14 pre-postnatal development (PPND) studies accrued during 1981-2007. METHODS: Losses were analysed by survival function and hazard ratio using logistic regression for influence of year, study type (e.g., dose duration), and test item route of administration (ig, im, iv, sc). RESULTS: Neither study type nor route of dosing affected pregnancy outcome. Losses were higher pre-1990 (104 losses/347 pregnancies) compared to 1990 onwards (94 losses/722 pregnancies). Losses were greatest before gestation day 50 and at parturition. Using post-1989 data, Monte-Carlo simulations of pregnancy outcomes were created. The power associated with the comparison of vehicle survival curves and simulated adverse survival curves was examined. This showed that EFD studies with initial vehicle group sizes of 16 and 20 have an 80% probability of having 13 and 16 ongoing pregnancies at gestational day 100, respectively. For PPND studies with initial vehicle group sizes of 16, 20, or 28, there is an 80% likelihood of having 9, 11, or 16 infants at day 7 post-partum, respectively. A PPND study initiated with group size 20 could detect a threefold increase of test item-related pregnancy or infant loss. CONCLUSIONS: For designing and managing primate developmental toxicity studies, this type of analysis provides an objective tool to facilitate decisions either by supplementing groups with additional pregnant animals or stopping a group because an adverse effect on offspring survival has already been adequately revealed.

AB Despite the success of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors remains a therapeutic challenge. One strategy used to overcome resistance is combination of existing BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors with agents that target alternative pathways. We report that inhibition of isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (Icmt), a key enzyme in the protein prenylation pathway, with the selective inhibitor cysmethynil enhances the effect of BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors in killing CML cells. Cysmethynil augments tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced apoptosis in both BCR-ABL1 wild type and BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutant-expressing cell lines. Importantly, the enhanced apoptosis observed with the combination of cysmethynil and imatinib is significant only in primary CML CD34+ progenitor cells, not normal cord blood progenitor cells. The combination was also selective in inhibiting colony formation in CML CD34+ cells. The enhanced apoptosis appears to be due to combination of immediate and persistent inhibition of MAPK signaling. Consistent with in vitro studies, cysmethynil and imatinib, in combination, enhance the in vivo effects of either drug used alone. We found that simultaneous inhibition of BCR-ABL1 and Icmt may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for CML. Copyright (C) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.

TI Dynamical Modeling of Collective Behavior from Pigeon Flight Data: Flock
   Cohesion and Dispersion
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID IDENTIFICATION; RULES
AB Several models of flocking have been promoted based on simulations with qualitatively naturalistic behavior. In this paper we provide the first direct application of computational modeling methods to infer flocking behavior from experimental field data. We show that this approach is able to infer general rules for interaction, or lack of interaction, among members of a flock or, more generally, any community. Using experimental field measurements of homing pigeons in flight we demonstrate the existence of a basic distance dependent attraction/repulsion relationship and show that this rule is sufficient to explain collective behavior observed in nature. Positional data of individuals over time are used as input data to a computational algorithm capable of building complex nonlinear functions that can represent the system behavior. Topological nearest neighbor interactions are considered to characterize the components within this model. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated with simulated noisy data generated from the classical (two dimensional) Vicsek model. When applied to experimental data from homing pigeon flights we show that the more complex three dimensional models are capable of simulating trajectories, as well as exhibiting realistic collective dynamics. The simulations of the reconstructed models are used to extract properties of the collective behavior in pigeons, and how it is affected by changing the initial conditions of the system. Our results demonstrate that this approach may be applied to construct models capable of simulating trajectories and collective dynamics using experimental field measurements of herd movement. From these models, the behavior of the individual agents (animals) may be inferred.

AB Follow-the-leader chain migration is a striking cell migratory behaviour observed during vertebrate development, adult neurogenesis and cancer metastasis. Although cell-cell contact and extracellular matrix (ECM) cues have been proposed to promote this phenomenon, mechanisms that underlie chain migration persistence remain unclear. Here, we developed a quantitative agent-based modelling framework to test mechanistic hypotheses of chain migration persistence. We defined chain migration and its persistence based on evidence from the highly migratory neural crest model system, where cells within a chain extend and retract filopodia in short-lived cell contacts and move together as a collective. In our agent-based simulations, we began with a set of agents arranged as a chain and systematically probed the influence of model parameters to identify factors critical to the maintenance of the chain migration pattern. We discovered that chain migration persistence requires a high degree of directional bias in both lead and follower cells towards the target. Chain migration persistence was also promoted when lead cells maintained cell contact with followers, but not vice-versa. Finally, providing a path of least resistance in the ECM was not sufficient alone to drive chain persistence. Our results indicate that chain migration persistence depends on the interplay of directional cell movement and biased cell-cell contact.

AB This study evaluates a modified 4-META/MMA-TBB resin (M4M) as a candidate material for filling screw-retained implant access hole. Its characteristics were compared with a conventional composite resin (CR) with or without a bonding agent (BA) or a ceramic primer (CP). Ceramic blocks were divided into five groups, including (A) CR, (B) CR with BA, (C) CR with CP and BA, (D) M4M, and (E) M4M with CP. Shear bond strengths were measured after 5000 times of thermocycling. Groups A, B, and D were excluded from further tests as they showed no adhesion. A cylindrical cavity (2.5 mm diameter, 3 mm depth) simulating access hole was prepared in a ceramic block and glazed to evaluate micro-leakage and wear test of groups C and E. The results were statistically analyzed with Mann-Whitney test (p<0.05). Shear bond strength of groups C (7.6 +/- 2.2 MPa) and E (8.6 +/- 1.0 MPa) was not significantly different. In micro-leakage analysis, average wear depth and wear volume, group E (7.5 +/- 3.3%, 59.3 +/- 12.9 m, 0.16 +/- 0.04 mm(3)) showed significantly lower values than those of group C (45.6 +/- 24.4%, 76.0 +/- 16.4 m, 0.28 +/- 0.03 mm(3)). It is suggested that the combination of CP and M4M can be one of feasible systems to fill the ceramic access holes of the implant upper structure. (c) 2014 The Authors.

AB The thermodynamics of Si(IV) complex equilibrium and effect of [NH3]/[NH3](T) molar ratio on the components in the Zn2SiO4-NH3-(NH4)(2)SO4-H2O system were studied. Mass conservation, simultaneous chemical equilibrium, and electronic charge neutrality principles were employed. By varying the concentration of the total ammonia (0-7 mol/L), the pH values were calculated and the Si(IV) complexes in the system identified. The obtained results were then employed to plot the thermodynamic diagrams. Experimental verification based on thermodynamic analysis was carried out simultaneously. The results revealed that the [NH3]/[NH3](T) molar ratio and the concentration of SiO2 in the leaching agent could be employed to predict the leaching behavior of Zn2SiO4 in the NH3-(NH4)(2)SO4-H2O system; The best leaching effect was observed at an (NH3)/[NH3](T) molar ratio of 0.5; this is consistent with the results obtained from thermodynamic analysis.

AB Suspensions of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae display free-running light scattering oscillations at the onset of development. We describe a device to monitor these oscillations in several samples in parallel. The apparatus consists of a thermostated cuvette holder where up to eight cuvettes containing cell suspension are inserted. Cells are aerated and kept in suspension via an airlift. Infrared light emitted from a five-diode array passes through the suspension and is detected by an array of five light detecting diodes. The resulting signal is digitized and recorded with a sampling rate of two measuring points/second. The parallel analysis approach allows determination of the effects of adding of agents or of variations in the external conditions in the same batch of amoebae at the same developmental time point. This represents an advantage over the conventional single cuvette approach, as oscillation characteristics themselves are developmentally regulated. Moreover, as the new experimental setup enables simultaneous analyses of tip to eight samples, the behavior of wild-type and several mutant strains can be compared under identical experimental conditions.

AB The stability (affinity, association, binding, complexation, formation) constant characterizes binding interaction between the analyte and the complexing agent. Knowledge of the stability constant makes possible the prediction and estimation of the binding behavior of constituents (amino acids, peptides, proteins, drugs, antibiotics, enzymes, enantiomers) to their partners, and the finding of a suitable partner for the given analyte to form a stable complex. The present paper summarizes the stability constant determination methods and the approaches used to evaluate the experimental data. Further, the paper recapitulates the published stability constant values determined, mainly, by capillary electrophoretic methods, taken from the Web of Science database covering the last decade. Details of the experimental conditions employed for the determination of the stability constants are also given. The review attempts to give a critical evaluation of the problems that accompany the determination of stability constant and discusses their solution.

DE Decision making; multirobot systems; Q-learning
ID COORDINATION; SYSTEMS; ROBOTS
AB This paper presents a modified, distributed Q-learning algorithm, termed as sequential Q-learning with Kalman filtering (SQKF), for decision making associated with multirobot cooperation. The SQKF algorithm developed here has the following characteristics. 1) The learning process is arranged in a sequential manner (i.e., the robots will not make decisions simultaneously, but in a predefined sequence) so as to promote cooperation among robots and reduce their Q-learning spaces. 2) A robot will not update its Q-values with observed global rewards. Instead, it will employ a specific Kalman filter to extract its real local reward from the global reward, thereby updating its Q-table with this local reward. The new SQKF algorithm is intended to solve two problems in multirobot Q-learning: credit assignment and behavior conflicts. The detailed procedure of the SQKF algorithm is presented, and its application is illustrated using a prototype multirobot experimental system. The experimental results show that the algorithm has better performance than the conventional single-agent Q-learning algorithm or the team Q-learning algorithm in the multirobot domain.

AB A key debate in the study on land, housing and natural resources revolves around the notion that general institutional forms (such as private, common, public, and likewise formal property rights) lead to a certain institutional performance (as may be expressed in terms of prices, transaction costs or sustainability). However, a modest, yet, growing stream in institutional analysis aims to move away from 'merely describing the characteristics' of institutions (i.e., form variables) to 'performance or quality measures' (i.e., function variables). Following this line of argument, the credibility thesis as put forward in this journal (Ho, 2014) postulates that the form of institutions is unrelated to their performance, and institutions are unintentional outcomes rather than designed artefacts. The primary goal of this research is to ascertain whether this dual prediction could be observed in a simulation model that is driven by agent behaviour and interaction, resulting in emerging institutions. We devise an empirically verified agent-based model within a classical thought experiment on a common property resource to validate the thesis' predictions. First, our model confirms that different forms of institutions can have a similar performance. Second, we ascertain that successful institutions in difficult management situations can emerge (rather than being designed) that are beneficial for the sustainability of the common resource and the appropriators of that resource.

AB The estimation of ocular pharmacokinetics (PK) in various eye tissues is limited because of sampling challenges. Computational modeling and simulation (M&S) tools underpinning the elucidation of drug access routes and prediction of ocular exposure are essential for the mechanistic assessment of biopharmaceutics in the eye. Therefore, theoretical and experimental evaluation of ocular absorption and transit models is necessary. Biopharmaceutical parameter sensitivity analysis based on permeability and drug dose illustrates utility in ocular drug delivery assessment, which could have innovative and cost-saving impacts on ophthalmic product development and therapeutic bioequivalence (BE) evaluations.

Based on our new car-following and lateral movement models, our method can reproduce lane-based and nonlane-based traffic behaviors that are commonly seen in urban scenes. Our dynamic routing and intersection procedures enable a user to interactively control the movement of a car, and our system generates the microscopic behaviors of the influenced vehicles accordingly. Experimental results show that our approach can animate appealing microscopic mixed traffic with various behaviors. Our approach will benefit applications in virtual cities, computer games, and driving simulators.

Here, the term 3D content delivery technique refers to an overlay-multicast-based distributed service platform that is comprised of a media relay agent and a management server. The service platform is designed to back up both live video and file-based video streaming. Using this platform, we can provide 3D remote education and 3D multiangle services via 3D-based video streaming between a service provider and service consumers dispersed at different locations. To evaluate our 3D content delivery technique, we run a series of trials of gigabit network-based 3D trial services to service subscribers. Then, we conduct a survey to measure user satisfaction with the 3D delivery service and simulated network and service quality. From experimental results, we confirm that this type of distributed service platform can be used as the delivery framework for applications such as realistic 3D-based seminars or 3D video conferences.

AB Background: Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric extracranial solid malignancy with limited effective treatment. We have shown that sustained-release, single drugs delivered locally through a silk-based biomaterial are effective in decreasing orthotopic neuroblastoma xenograft growth. We further optimized this approach and hypothesized that increasing doses of local chemotherapy or delivering 2 chemotherapeutic agents simultaneously inhibit additional tumor growth.
   Methods: MYCN-amplified and non-MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells were treated with combinations of cisplatin, vincristine, doxorubicin, and etoposide to determine cytotoxicity and synergy. Drugloaded silk material was created, and the amounts of drug released from the material over time were recorded. Murine orthotopic neuroblastoma xenografts were generated; tumors were implanted with single- or dual-agent chemotherapy-loaded silk. Ultrasound was used to monitor tumor growth, and tumor histology was evaluated.
   Results: In vitro, vincristine/cisplatin combination was synergistic and significantly decreased cell viability relative to other combinations. Both drugs loaded into silk could be released effectively for over 2 weeks. Locally implanted vincristine/cisplatin silk induced increased tumor growth suppression compared with either agent alone in MYCN-amplified tumors (P < .05). The dose-dependent effect seen in MYCN-amplified tumors treated with combination therapy diminished at higher doses in non-MYCN-amplified tumors, with little benefit with doses >50 mu g to 500 mu g for vincristine-cisplatin, respectively. Tumor histology demonstrated tumor cell necrosis adjacent to drug-loaded silk material and presence of large cell neuroblastoma.
   Conclusion: Local delivery of sustained release chemotherapy can suppress tumor growth especially at high doses or with 2 synergistic drugs. Locally delivered dual therapy is a promising approach for future clinical testing. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In this paper, a 10th order nonlinear pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) model was developed to evaluate the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) medications such as galantamine on beta-amyloid (beta A) aggregates and levels of acetylcholine (ACh) and choline in the presynaptic (compartment 1) and postsynaptic (compartment 2) neurons based on the choline leakage hypothesis. The development is performed by incorporating a one-compartment PD/PK model into the two-enzyme/two-compartment model built by Mustafa et al., (2012a,b). The interaction between medications and beta A aggregates is formulated based on a 6-h single oral dose of 2.5-10 mg of drugs which indicated PK/PD changes similar to the experimental findings obtained by Goh et al., (2011). Enhanced cholinergic behavior was observed in terms of a reduction in beta A aggregates' concentrations and increase in the levels of ACh and choline in the pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The results indicate that therapeutic and pharmacological agents inhibiting beta A aggregation represent a likely successful approach to develop future trials, new diagnostic techniques, and medications for AD. This study is helpful in developing experimental animal models to support the development of AD medications. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Rear end collisions are deadliest in nature and result in life losses and severe injuries. Many of the proposed rear-end collision avoidance schemes focus only on specific aspects without considering several non-direct factors, such as driver inattention or distraction, tailgating, panic stops, street surface circumstances, driver response time, person on foot stream and vehicle elements. Henceforth presenting greater challenges in proposing a precise numerical model of the vehicle control framework. Moreover, most collision avoidance schemes incorporate fuzzy logic for formulating human inspired collision avoidance controllers. But the problem with a fuzzy based controller is that their efficiency is greatly affected by the number of rules being deployed. Furthermore, no such agent-based modeling has been utilized, which can effectively model the human-inspired behavior. Literature is full of vehicle control frameworks that work in a connected and homogeneous environment, again critics have raised several questions for such frameworks working in a connected environment. This study aims not only to identify these key issues but also propose a human-inspired physics based Spiral Spring based Simple Reflex Agent for rear end collision avoidance. Our scheme will not only work in the non-connected and heterogeneous environment but will also consider the distraction causing road factors and effectively handle them. Extensive experimentations and presentation for the proof of concept have supported our claims and worthiness of proposed agent-based scheme.

AB This study aims at developing thermal analysis tools and explaining experimental observations made by means of polarized-light cryomacroscopy (Part I). Thermal modeling is based on finite elements analysis (FEA), where two model parameters are extracted from thermal measurements: (i) the overall heat transfer coefficient between the cuvette and the cooling chamber, and (ii) the effective thermal conductivity within the cryoprotective agent (CPA) at the upper part of the cryogenic temperature range. The effective thermal conductivity takes into account enhanced heat transfer due to convection currents within the CPA, creating the so-called Benard cells. Comparison of experimental results with simulation data indicates that the uncertainty in simulations due to the propagation of uncertainty in measured physical properties exceeds the uncertainty in experimental measurements, which validates the modeling approach. It is shown in this study that while a cavity may form in the upper-center portion of the vitrified CPA, it has very little effect on estimating the temperature distribution within the domain. This cavity is driven by thermal contraction of the CPA, with the upper-center of the domain transitioning to glass last. Finally, it is demonstrated in this study that additional stresses may develop within the glass transition temperature range due to nonlinear behavior of the thermal expansion coefficient. This effect is reported here for the first time in the context of cryobiology, using the capabilities of polarized-light cryomacroscopy. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

We investigate the stability of such micelles with respect to hydrophobicity, Coulomb interaction, and micellar size. We show that for the parameter range relevant for poly(p-phenylene sulfonate)s (PPP) one finds a stable finite micellar size close to the experimental parameter region. We also point out that our model has some similarities to DNA solutions with added condensing agents, hinting to the possibility that the size of DNA aggregates is under certain circumstances thermodynamically limited.

AB The revolutionary growth in the computation speed and memory storage capability has fueled a new era in the analysis of biological data. Hundreds of microbial genomes and many eukaryotic genomes including a cleaner draft of human genome have been sequenced raising the expectation of better control of microorganisms. The goals are as lofty as the development of rational drugs and antimicrobial agents, development of new enhanced bacterial strains for bioremediation and pollution control, development of better and easy to administer vaccines, the development of protein biomarkers for various bacterial diseases, and better understanding of host-bacteria interaction to prevent bacterial infections. In the last decade the development of many new bioinformatics techniques and integrated databases has facilitated the realization of these goals. Current research in bioinformatics can be classified into: ( i) genomics - sequencing and comparative study of genomes to identify gene and genome functionality, ( ii) proteomics - identification and characterization of protein related properties and reconstruction of metabolic and regulatory pathways, ( iii) cell visualization and simulation to study and model cell behavior, and ( iv) application to the development of drugs and anti-microbial agents. In this article, we will focus on the techniques and their limitations in genomics and proteomics. Bioinformatics research can be classified under three major approaches: ( 1) analysis based upon the available experimental wet-lab data, ( 2) the use of mathematical modeling to derive new information, and ( 3) an integrated approach that integrates search techniques with mathematical modeling. The major impact of bioinformatics research has been to automate the genome sequencing, automated development of integrated genomics and proteomics databases, automated genome comparisons to identify the genome function, automated derivation of metabolic pathways, gene expression analysis to derive regulatory pathways, the development of statistical techniques, clustering techniques and data mining techniques to derive protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and modeling of 3D structure of proteins and 3D docking between proteins and biochemicals for rational drug design, difference analysis between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains to identify candidate genes for vaccines and anti-microbial agents, and the whole genome comparison to understand the microbial evolution. The development of bioinformatics techniques has enhanced the pace of biological discovery by automated analysis of large number of microbial genomes. We are on the verge of using all this knowledge to understand cellular mechanisms at the systemic level. The developed bioinformatics techniques have potential to facilitate ( i) the discovery of causes of diseases, ( ii) vaccine and rational drug design, and ( iii) improved cost effective agents for bioremediation by pruning out the dead ends. Despite the fast paced global effort, the current analysis is limited by the lack of available gene-functionality from the wet-lab data, the lack of computer algorithms to explore vast amount of data with unknown functionality, limited availability of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, and the lack of knowledge of temporal and transient behavior of genes and pathways.

AB The paper studies bidder behavior in simultaneous, continuous, ascending price auctions. We design and implement a "collusion incubator" environment based on a type of public, symmetrically "folded" and "item-aligned" preferences. Tacit collusion develops quickly and reliably within the environment. Once tacit collusion developed, it proved remarkably robust to institutional changes that weakened it as an equilibrium of a game-theoretic model. The only successful remedy was a non-public change in the preference of participants that destroyed the symmetrically, "folded" and "item aligned" patterns of preferences, creating head-to-head competition between two agents reminiscent of the concept of a "maverick."

Math. 73 (2013) 1703-1720.) shows that the hotspot dynamics changes when movement patterns of the criminals involve long-tailed Levy distributions for the jump length as opposed to classical random walks. In reality, criminals move in confined areas with a maximum jump length. In this paper, we develop a mean-field continuum model with truncated Levy flights (TLFs) for residential burglary in one-space dimension. The continuum model yields local Laplace diffusion, rather than fractional diffusion. We present an asymptotic theory to derive the continuum equations and show excellent agreement between the continuum model and the agent-based simulations. This suggests that local diffusion models are universal for continuum limits of this problem, the important quantity being the diffusion coefficient. Law enforcement agents are also incorporated into the model, and the relative effectiveness of their deployment strategies are compared quantitatively.

AB Understanding the interactions and transmission of pathogens with/via inanimate surfaces common in the built environment and public transport vehicles is critical to promoting sustainable and resilient urban development. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to study the adhesion of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of COVID-19) to some of these surfaces at different temperatures (same for surfaces and ambiance) ranging from -23 to 60 degrees C. Surfaces simulated are aluminum, copper, copper oxide, polyethylene (PE), and silicon dioxide (SiO2). Steered MD (SMD) simulations are also used to investigate the transfer of the virus from PE and SiO2 when a contaminated surface is touched. The virus shows the lowest and highest adhesions to PE and SiO2, respectively (20 vs 534 eV). Influence of temperature is not found to be noticeable. Using simulated water molecules to represent moisture on the skin, SMD simulations show that water molecules can lift the virus from the PE surface but damage the virus when lifting it from the the SiO2 surface. The results suggest that the PE surface is a more favorable surface to transmit the virus than the other surfaces simulated in this study. The results are compared with those reported in a few experimental studies.

AB Background. Hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels are often obtained in potential pancreas graft donors to assess the overall longterm functional glycemic control or the possibility of unrecognized diabetes. Although routinely measured, the impact of donor HbA1c levels on pancreas graft outcomes has not been reported. Here, we researched the relationship between donor HbA1c levels and postoperative pancreas graft survival. Methods. Data from 266 pancreas transplant patients including 182 simultaneous kidney-pancreas and 84 pancreas alone transplants were reviewed for the study. The patients were separated into groups according to their HbA1c levels (5 groups: HbA1c <5.0, 5.0-5.4, 5.5-5.9, >= 6.0 % and not available, or 2 groups: HbA1c <5.7, >= 5.7%). Overall, death-censored and technically successful pancreas graft survival and rejection rates of each group were compared. In the case of technically successful graft survival, graft losses due to technical problems in the first 60 days were excluded. Results. All groups were similar with regard to donor variables including age, sex, ABO blood type, ethnicity, donor type and recipient variables including recipient age, sex, induction agents and maintenance treatment. Mean follow-up time was 4.2 +/- 1.97 years. The overall graft survivals and death censored graft survivals among groups were not statistically different from one other (P > 0.05). Additionally, excluding early technical losses in 18 patients did not reveal any differences in graft survivals. Patient survival and biopsy-proven acute rejections were statistically similar among HbA1c strata. Conclusions. This univariate retrospective analysis of a single center/organ procurement organization use of HbA1c shows that donor HbA1c levels between 3.5 and 6.2 in otherwise transplantable pancreata are not associated with different short-term outcomes.

AB Although several studies on tuberculous (TB) pleurisy suggest that the addition of corticosteroids to anti-TB therapy may have beneficial effects, these agents are not used routinely. To assess the effects of short-term oral prednisone therapy in TB pleurisy, 74 patients were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to treatment with either placebo or prednisone at a dose of 0.75 mg/kg/d for up to 4 weeks with gradual reduction over an additional 2 weeks, All subjects received a standard 3-drug anti-TB chemotherapy regimen for 6 months. TB pleurisy was diagnosed by histologic study and/or culture of pleural biopsy specimens obtained at thoracoscopy, Complete drainage of the effusion was performed simultaneously. Outcome measures were assessed periodically for 24 weeks, including indexes of morbidity and pleural thickening, After randomization, four patients were excluded fi om the final analysis, Of the 70 patients analyzed, 34 received prednisone and 36 received placebo, Demographic and clinical characteristics of the treatment groups were comparable at the time of hospital admission, Although a statistically significant improvement in symptoms occurred earlier in the prednisone group (8 weeks) than in the placebo group (12 weeks), between-group comparison showed no significant differences at any of the follow-up evaluations. The proportion of subjects in the prednisone group (53.1%) with residual pleural thickening at 6 months did not differ significantly from that of the placebo group (60%), Pleural effusions did not recur in any of the patients. Initial complete drainage of the effusion was associated with greater symptomatic improvement than any subsequent therapy, We conclude that standard anti-TB therapy and early complete drainage is adequate for the treatment of TB pleurisy. The addition of short-term oral prednisone therapy neither results in clinically relevant earlier symptom relief nor confers a beneficial effect on residual pleural thickening.

ID SOLID TUMORS
AB Objective: Tumor shrinkage has been adopted as an end point for evaluating the effectiveness of new anticancer agents. The WHO (World Health Organization) criterion suggested measuring the tumor shrinkage by the change in the product of maximal diameter (MD) and the corresponding largest perpendicular diameter (LPD). The RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumor) guideline proposed using the change in MD only, based on the observation that this measure is more linearly related to tumor cell kill than the cross product (MD*LPD). Both criteria classify patients into four categories of response: complete response (CR: total disappearance), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) but the criteria used in the definition of PD vary. It was anticipated that patients' actual response categorization would not be considerably affected by utilizing the RECIST criteria instead of WHO. Empirical evidence supporting this fact was provided by retrospective analysis of several large datasets.
   Study Design and Setting: A statistical simulation is performed to generate tumor measurements and patient response data under meaningful probability distributions with parameters based on data from 130 patients on clinical trials at a cancer center. Concordance measures between the two response criteria (Kappa coefficient and percentage disagreement per response category) are assessed systematically over various combinations of the percentage of elliptical tumors at baseline and the percentage of tumors changing shape from baseline to follow-up.
   Results: The overall percentage of disagreement between the two methods of response assessment is found to be in the range of 14-20%. The patients categorized by WHO in the PR, SD, and PD groups fall into a different category when assessed by RECIST between 8-16%, 3-12%, and 32-35% of the times, respectively. The kappa coefficient ranges between 0.68-0.77. The proportion of elliptical tumors at baseline does not greatly impact the concordance, but the magnitude of the change in the aspect ratio has a large impact.
   Conclusion: Response assessment as measured by RECIST, with both a change in the underlying metric and change in definition of progression, often results in different categorization of response compared to WHO. The difference in response categorization may be problematic when new experimental therapies are compared to conventional agents whose response rates have been established in historical trials. The apparent lower rate of disease progression with RECIST may mean that more patients remain on therapy. Higher percentages of patients with SD need to be interpreted cautiously by distinguishing those due to the change in the response criterion as opposed to those induced by drugs using pathways such as angiogenesis where disease stabilization is expected rather than shrinkage of tumor.

AB Motivation: Low back pain is responsible for more global disability than any other condition. Its incidence is closely related to intervertebral disc (IVD) failure, which is likely caused by an accumulation of microtrauma within the IVD. Crucial factors in microtrauma development are not entirely known yet, probably because their exploration in vivo or in vitro remains tremendously challenging. In silico modelling is, therefore, definitively appealing, and shall include approaches to integrate influences of multiple cell stimuli at the microscale. Accordingly, this study introduces a hybrid Agent-based (AB) model in IVD research and exploits network modelling solutions in systems biology to mimic the cellular behaviour of Nucleus Pulposus cells exposed to a 3D multifactorial biochemical environment, based on mathematical integrations of existing experimental knowledge. Cellular activity reflected by mRNA expression of Aggrecan, Collagen type I, Collagen type II, MMP-3 and ADAMTS were calculated for inflamed and noninflamed cells. mRNA expression over long periods of time is additionally determined including cell viability estimations. Model predictions were eventually validated with independent experimental data.
   Results: As it combines experimental data to simulate cell behaviour exposed to a multifactorial environment, the present methodology was able to reproduce cell death within 3 days under glucose deprivation and a 50% decrease in cell viability after 7 days in an acidic environment. Cellular mRNA expression under non-inflamed conditions simulated a quantifiable catabolic shift under an adverse cell environment, and model predictions of mRNA expression of inflamed cells provide new explanation possibilities for unexpected results achieved in experimental research.

AB To guide software development, the estimation of the impact of decision making on the development process can be helpful in planning. For this estimation, often prediction models are used which can be learned from project data. In this paper, an approach for the usage of agent-based simulation for the prediction of software evolution trends is presented. The specialty of the proposed approach lies in the automated parameter estimation for the instantiation of project-specific simulation models. We want to assess how well a baseline model using average (commit) behavior of the agents (i.e., the developers) performs compared to models where different amount of project-specific data is fed into the simulation model. The approach involves the interplay between the mining framework and simulation framework. Parameters to be estimated include, e.g., file change probabilities of developers and the team constellation reflecting different developer roles. The structural evolution of software projects is observed using change coupling graphs based on common file changes. For the validation of simulation results, we compare empirical with simulated results. Our results showed that an average simulation model can mimic general project growth trends like the number of commits and files well and thus, can help project managers in, e.g., controlling the onboarding of developers. Besides, the simulated co-change evolution could be improved significantly using project-specific data.

AB Carboxylesterase-1 (CE-1) is a crucial enzyme responsible for metabolism/activation/inactivation of xenobiotics (therapeutic agents, prodrugs, abused drugs, and organophosphorus nerve agents etc.) and also involved in many other biological processes. In this study, we performed extensive computational modeling and simulations to understand the fundamental reaction mechanism of cocaine hydrolysis catalyzed by CE-1, revealing that CE-1-catalyzed cocaine hydrolysis follows a novel reaction pathway with only two reaction steps: a single-step acylation process and a single-step deacylation process. In the transition states of both single-step processes, the cocaine NH group joins the oxyanion hole to form an additional hydrogen bond with the negatively charged carbonyl oxygen atom of the cocaine. Thus, the transition states are stabilized by both intermolecular and intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the methyl ester of cocaine, specifically the carbonyl oxygen atom. The rate-limiting transition state is associated with the acylation process, and the activation free energy barrier was predicted to be 20.1 kcal/mol. Further, in vitro experimental kinetic analysis was performed for human CE-1-catalyzed cocaine hydrolysis. For CE-1-catalyzed cocaine hydrolysis, the computationally predicted free energy barrier (20.1 kcal/mol) is reasonably close to the experimentally derived turnover number (k(cat) = 0.058 min(-1)), indicating the reasonability of the computational results. The obtained novel mechanistic insights are expected to benefit not only CE-1 related rational drug discovery but also future research on the catalytic mechanism of other esterases.

TI Inhibition of DAMP signaling as an effective adjunctive treatment

   RECEPTOR; THERAPY
AB Background: Pneumococcal meningitis remains a potentially lethal and debilitating disease, mainly due to brain damage from sustained inflammation. The release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), like myeloid-related protein 14 (MRP14) and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1), plays a major role in persistence of inflammation. In this study, we evaluated if paquinimod, an MRP14-inhibitor, and an anti-HMGB1 antibody can improve clinical outcome as adjunctive therapeutics in pneumococcal meningitis.
   Methods: We tested the adjuvant administration of paquinimod and the anti-HMGB1 antibody in our pneumococcal meningitis mouse model assessing clinical (clinical score, open-field-test, temperature) and pathophysiological parameters (intracranial pressure, white blood cell count in CSF, bleeding area) as well as bacterial titers in blood and brain 24 h after administration and 48 h after infection. Furthermore, we explored the interactions of these two agents with dexamethasone, the standard adjuvant treatment in pneumococcal meningitis (PM), and daptomycin, a nonbacteriolytic antibiotic preventing pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) release.
   Results: Adjunctive inhibition of MRP14 or HMGB1 reduced mortality in mice with PM. This effect was lost when the two anti-DAMP agents were given simultaneously, possibly due to excessive immunosuppression. Combining anti-PAMP (daptomycin) and anti-DAMP treatments did not produce synergistic results; instead, the anti-DAMP treatment alone was sufficient and superior. The combination of anti-HMGB1 with dexamethasone did not diminish the effect of the former.
   Conclusions: DAMP inhibition possesses good potential as an adjuvant treatment approach in PM, as it improves clinical outcome and can be given together with the standard adjuvant dexamethasone without drug effect loss in experimental PM.

AB Extractive distillation is more and more commonly applied in industry, and becomes an important separation method in chemical engineering. This paper provides an in-depth review for-extractive distillation. Separation sequence of the columns, combination with other separation processes, tray configuration and operation policy are included in process of I extractive distillation. Since the solvent plays an important role in the design of extractive distillation, such conventional and novel separating agents,as solid salt, liquid solvent, the combination,of liquid solvent and. solid salt, and ionic liquid are concerned. The prominent characteristics of extractive distillation is that. one new solvent with high boiling-point, i.e. separating agent, is added to the components-to be separated, so as to increase their relative volatility. Selection of a suitable solvent is fundamental to ensure an-effective and economical design. CAMD as A useful tool is applied for screening the solents and thus reducing the experimental work. Theories from molecular thermodynamics, which can interpret the microscale mechanism of selecting the solvents, are also collected. To accurately, describe the extractive distillation process, mathematical model is necessary. There are. two, types of mathematical models to simulate extractive distillation process, i.e: equilibrium (EQ) stage model and non-equilibrium (NEQ) stage model. The EQ stage model as an old method is widely used, but the NEQ stage model should be. pay more attention. In the end comparison of extractive distillation and adsorption distillation, both, of which belong to special distillation suitable for separating close boiling point or azeotropic components, is done, and it is shown that extractive distillation is more advantageous.

AB The molecular packing stability and the dynamic behaviour of three azonia-spiro-alkanes involved as structure determining agents in the zeolite synthesis has been examined in the frameworks of MOR and MTW. A detailed molecular model has been set up by computer graphics methods and used to perform Monte Carlo packing and molecular dynamics simulations. The energetic stabilisation and molecular mobility have been calculated and compared to previous experimental characterisation data. The results are found useful to discuss the packing preferences of this class of molecules in the zeolite pores under investigation, with the aim of rationalising their templating ability and selectivity.

AB We analyze learning in a two-person simultaneous choice repeated game. Agents form beliefs about their rival's strategies, which they revise as the game progresses. We test this model using data from a series of experiments. We obtain data on subjects' expectations by asking them to predict their rival's choice in each period of the game; subjects are paid for each correct prediction. We analyze the data using the Kalman filtering technique, and find that learning is broadly consistent with Bayesian updating. The predicted equilibrium based on this learning process is indistinguishable from observed behavior for most subjects in later periods. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V, All rights reserved.

AB Among all renewable energies, biomass has been receiving more attention because of its availability and economic advantages. In this study, a thermodynamic model was developed using a commercial simulator to analyze the gasification behavior of biomass (pine sawdust) particles in the presence of CaO as CO2 sorbent. The developed model was validated with the experimental results showed a good agreement. It was found that H-2 and CO2 increased, as the SBR increased, while an opposite trend is obtained for CO and CH4. The simulated results also showed that the CO2 conversion ratio (CCR) increased from 31.12% to 59.45% increased as the SBR increased from 0.25 to 1.0.

AB N-(1-Deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-amino acids isolated from hog liver are endogenous lead decorporation substances with low toxicity and cell membrane crossing ability. To simulate the effect of the natural N-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-amino acids on lead decorporation, a series of the epimerically pure N-(1-deoxy-D-fructos-1-yl)-L-amino acids (6a-ebeta) were synthesized, and their usefulness as antagonists of lead intoxication was investigated. The results suggest that after treatment with 6a-ebeta the liver, kidney, bone, and brain, lead levels of mice were significantly reduced in comparison with the control group. Except for bone and brain lead levels of the mice after chelating treatment with 6dbeta, all of the other tissue lead levels of mice after chelating treatment with 6a-ebeta are significantly lower than those of mice after treatment with DL-penicillamine (p < 0.05). All fecal lead levels of mice after treatment with 6a-ebeta are significantly higher than those of mice after treatment with 0.9% saline (controls) and DL-penicillamine (p < 0.05-0.01). The effects of all chelating agents on urinary excretion of lead in mice are clearly superior to the control (p < 0.05-0.01). The results of the present studies on repeated lead exposure indicated that at tested levels of i.p. injections, the fructose-amino acids were effective antagonists of lead poisoning under the experimental conditions. After treatment with the chelators, the concentration of essential metals in mice did not exhibit change as compared to the control. The effects of the compounds on cadmium decorporation were also investigated, and similar results were observed.

AB The brain anaesthesia response (BAR) monitor uses a method of EEG analysis, based on a model of brain electrical activity, to monitor the cerebral response to anaesthetic and sedative agents via two indices, composite cortical state (CCS) and cortical input (CI). It was hypothesised that CCS would respond to the hypnotic component of anaesthesia and CI would differentiate between two groups of patients receiving different doses of fentanyl. Twenty-five patients scheduled to undergo elective first-time coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomised to receive a total fentanyl dose of either 12 mu g/kg (fentanyl low dose, FLD) or 24 mu g/kg (fentanyl moderate dose, FMD), both administered in two divided doses. Propofol was used for anaesthesia induction and pancuronium for intraoperative paralysis. Hemodynamic management was protocolised using vasoactive drugs. BIS, CCS and CI were simultaneously recorded. Response of the indices (CI, CCS and BIS) to propofol and their differences between the two groups at specific points from anaesthesia induction through to aortic cannulation were investigated. Following propofol induction, CCS and BIS but not CI showed a significant reduction. Following the first dose of fentanyl, CI, CCS and BIS decreased in both groups. Following the second dose of fentanyl, there was a significant reduction in CI in the FLD group but not the FMD group, with no significant change found for BIS or CCS in either group. The BAR monitor demonstrates the potential to monitor the level of hypnosis following anaesthesia induction with propofol via the CCS index and to facilitate the titration of fentanyl as a component of balanced anaesthesia via the CI index.

AB MOMA (Model Of Mosquito Aedes) is a spatially explicit agent-based simulation model of Aedes aegypti female mosquito, the dengue vector. The model aims to produce statistical data on mosquito behaviours and population dynamics that are difficult to obtain through field surveys such as population densities in various geographical and climatic conditions. It can also be used to explore effects of vector control strategies on population dynamics. The model simulates adult mosquitoes as 'agents' which interact with their local environment. The latter provides resources for their biological development and can also constrain their flight or egg-laying behaviours. Variations in environmental configurations such as land-use and climate make it possible to explore the dependence of mosquito population dynamics on the context.
   This paper gives a detailed description of the model's various components and the overall approach used to calibrate and validate it. Study of simulated mosquito behaviours reveals the model's ability to produce the mosquito's realistic life cycle. The mosquito cohort's flight distance in various urban landscapes is also explored. The latter represent a developing neighbourhood in Delhi (India) processed using a Geographical Information System (GIS). The initial results reveal a significant relation between urban topology, human densities and adult mosquito flight. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The inclusion complex of N-nitroso, N-(2-chloroethyl), N', N'-dibenzylsulfamid with beta-Cyclodextrin have been investigated using the spectrofluorescence technique H-1 NMR spectroscopy. The stoichiometric ratio of the complex was found to be 1:1 and the stability constant was evaluated using the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. In order to find the most favorable structure, molecular mechanics calculations were employed to study the inclusion of CENS-Dibenz in beta-CD in vacuum and in the presence of water as a solvent. The driving forces for complexation are dominated by non-bonded van der Waals host-guest interactions with very little electrostatic contribution in both environments. After this stage of calculation, both the most stable complexes obtained by MM+ were re-optimized using semi-empirical and quantum mechanical calculations. It was found that the PM3 and the hybrid method ONIOM2 calculations predict the same mode of inclusion of the drug molecule in the host cavity. In the most stable conformation (i.e. Complex A), one of the two aromatic cycles is dipped within the relatively less polar cavity of beta-cyclodextrin, while the other aromatic cycle as well as the active groupings (alkylating agent and nitroso group) are directed towards the exterior through the narrow rim of beta-CD. This orientation is preferred because it is the most energetically favorable structure. Moreover, statistical thermodynamic calculations demonstrate that the formation of the inclusion complex is an enthalpy-driven process. A comparison between the experimental and theoretical values of Delta G(0) proves that simulation of the complexes without an explicit treatment of the solvent leads to dubious results.

AB This study deals with the problem of supporting negotiation on prices and due dates of multiple orders between a manufacturer and its suppliers in a make-to-order supply chain. A new negotiation agenda with two phases is proposed based on the fact that relationship between the partners is both cooperative and competitive. In the cooperative phase a mediator implementing Simulated Annealing is incorporated to help the manufacturer and the supplier search tentative agreement of due dates which minimizes the total supply chain cost. Then, they adjust the reservation value and aspiration value of price accordingly based on the idea of integrated-utility. They bargain on the price issue using concession based methods in the competitive phase. The proposed negotiation agenda and approach can achieves near-optimal social welfare and reach win-win solution for negotiation agents. Result of a numerical example is reported.

AB Often experimental scientists employ a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) to study the effect of treatments on different subjects. Under a 'complete randomization', the order of the apparatus setups within each block, including all replications of each treatment across all subjects, is completely randomized. However, in many experimental settings complete randomization is impractical due to the cost involved in re-adjusting the device to administer a new treatment. One typically resorts to a type of 'restricted randomization', in which multiple subjects are tested under each treatment before the apparatus is re-adjusted. The order of the treatments as well as the assignment of subjects to each block are random. If the data obtained under any type of restricted randomization are treated as if the data were collected under an RCBD with complete randomization within each block, then there is potential to increase the risk of false positives (Type I error). This is of concern to animal orientation studies and other areas such as chemical ecology where it is impractical to reset the experimental device for each subject tested. The goal of the research presented in this article is twofold: (1) to demonstrate the consequences of constructing an F-statistic based on a mean square error for testing the significance of treatment effects under the restricted randomization; (2) to describe an alternative method, based on split-plot analysis of variance, to analyze designed experiments that yield better power under the restricted randomization. The statistical analyses of simulated experiments and data involving virgin male Periplaneta americana substantiate the benefits of the alternative approach under the restricted randomization. The methodology and analysis employed for the simulated experiment is equally applicable to any organism or artificial agent tested under a restricted randomization protocol.

AB The experimental conditions for the thionine potentiodynamic electropolymerisation in acidic media are optimised in order to achieve polythionine (PTN) modified electrodes with high stability and reproducible redox behaviour in acidic and biological compatible media. The data obtained by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) show that under the selected conditions, polythionine films growth, presents a non-linear relation between mass and electroactivity which suggests structural changes during electropolymerisation, that are corroborated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The pH effect in the redox switching of PTN films is studied in solutions with pH from 1.3 to 12 where two processes with different dependence on protons occurs in the interval from 5.5 to 9, indicating a complex behaviour. PTN redox conversion in acidic media is film thickness sensitive and a non-permselective behaviour is found in acidic and neutral media, being the mass change dependent on the electrolyte nature. The presence of free amino functions in the polymer structure enable the nucleotide immobilisation by adsorption and covalent attachment, which was simultaneously monitored by EQCM and open circuit potential. The nucleotidic phosphate groups reactivity is enhanced by adding coupling agents leading to an higher amount of mass immobilisation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID WORD-OF-MOUTH; PERCOLATION; DIFFUSION; MODEL
AB Empirical studies suggest that word-of-mouth strongly influences the innovation diffusion process and is responsible for the "S" shape of the adoption curve. However, it is not clear how word-of-mouth affects demand curves for innovative products and strategic decisions of producers. Using an agent-based model of innovation diffusion, which links consumer opinions with reservation prices, we show that a relatively strong word-of-mouth effect can lead to the creation of two separated price-quantity regimes, with a nonlinear transition between them. A small shift of the product's market price can result in a drastic change of the demanded quantity and, hence, the revenues of a firm. Using Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field treatment we demonstrate that word-of-mouth may have ambiguous consequences and should be taken into account when designing marketing strategies.

SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFICULT TRACHEAL INTUBATION; GASMAN(R) SIMULATION; SEVOFLURANE;
   HALOTHANE; PROPOFOL; MODEL
AB BACKGROUND:
   Inhaled induction with spontaneous respiration is a technique used for difficult airways. One of the proposed advantages is if airway patency is lost, the anesthetic agent will spontaneously redistribute until anesthetic depth is reduced and airway patency can be recovered. There are little and conflicting clinical or experimental data regarding the kinetics of this anesthetic technique. We used computer simulation to investigate this situation.
   METHODS:
   We used GasMan (R), a computer simulation of inhaled anesthetic kinetics. For each simulation, alveolar ventilation was initiated with a set anesthetic induction concentration. When the vessel-rich group level reached the simulation specified airway obstruction threshold, alveolar ventilation was set at 0 to simulate complete airway obstruction. The time until the vessel-rich group anesthetic level decreased below the airway obstruction threshold was designated time to spontaneous recovery. We varied the parameters for each simulation, exploring the use of sevoflurane and halothane, airway obstruction threshold from 0.5 to 2 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), anesthetic induction concentration 2 to 4 MAC sevoflurane and 4 to 6 MAC halothane, cardiac output 2.5 to 10 L/min, functional residual capacity 1.5 to 3.5 L, and relative vessel-rich group perfusion 67% to 85%.
   RESULTS:
   In each simulation, there were 3 general phases: anesthetic wash-in, obstruction and overshoot, and then slow redistribution. During the first 2 phases, there was a large gradient between the alveolar and vessel-rich group. Alveolar do not reflect vessel-rich group anesthetic levels until the late third phase. Time to spontaneous recovery varied between 35 and 749 seconds for sevoflurane and 13 and 222 seconds for halothane depending on the simulation parameters. Halothane had a faster time to spontaneous recovery because of the lower alveolar gradient and less overshoot of the vessel-rich group, not faster redistribution. Higher airway obstruction thresholds, decreased anesthetic induction, and higher cardiac output reduced time to spontaneous recovery. To a lesser effect, decreased functional residual capacity and the decreased relative vessel-rich groups' perfusion also reduced the time to spontaneous recovery.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Spontaneous recovery after complete airway obstruction during inhaled induction is plausible, but the recovery time is highly variable and depends on the clinical and physiologic situation. These results emphasize that induction is a non-steady-state situation, thus effect-site anesthetic levels should be modeled in future research, not alveolar concentration. Finally, this study provides an example of using computer simulation to explore situations that are difficult to investigate clinically.

AB An interacting-agent model of speculative activity explaining price formation in financial markets is considered in the present paper, which based on the stochastic Ising model and the mean field theory. The model describes the interaction strength among the agents as well as an external field, and the corresponding random logarithmic price return process is investigated. According to the empirical research of the model, the time series formed by this Ising model exhibits the bursting typical of volatility clustering, the fat-tail phenomenon, the power-law distribution tails and the long-time memory. The statistical properties of the returns of Hushen 300 Index, Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) Composite Index and Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) Component Index are also studied for comparison between the real time series and the simulated ones. Further, the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis is applied to investigate the time series returns simulated by Ising model have the distribution multifractality as well as the correlation multifractality.

AB Research has shown that observed actions are represented in the motor system, leading to automatic imitative responses. However, in social life, we often see multiple persons acting together. Here, we use an automatic imitation paradigm with four stimulus hands to investigate the hypothesis that multiple observed actions can be represented at the same time in the motor system. Experiments 1 and 2 revealed weaker automatic imitation when one hand performed a different action than the other three hands, compared with when three or four hands all performed the same action. Experiment 3 replicated this effect with mutually exclusive actions. These results show that multiple observed actions can be represented simultaneously in the motor system, even when they cannot be executed together. This has important implications for theories of interaction representation.

AB Trial-and-error approaches for experimentally designing and optimizing the polymer matrix for advanced composites are time-consuming and expensive. The simulation for curing behavior and structure property relationships of epoxy resins can provide a guideline for designing resin matrix which will possess desirable properties. So far there are few reports in which the accuracy of the molecular simulation for the different amine-epoxy systems are addressed. In this paper, an atomistic modeling technique was used to theoretically investigate the curing and thermal transition behavior of two epoxy resin matrices containing amine curing agent with different chemical structures i.e. diaminodiphenyl methane (DDM)/diglycidyl-4,5-epoxycyclohexane-1,2-dicarboxylate (TDE85) and diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS)/TDE85 to give help for designing high heat-resistant epoxy matrix. The simulated results successfully predicted that the reaction process was catalyzed in the early stage of the curing and the slight modification in the diamine structure resulted in significant change in the curing and glass transition behavior of epoxy resin. As the bridging group of diamine changed from methylene to sulphone, the reactivity of diamine toward epoxy declined and the glass transition temperature increased from about 190 C to about 230 C. This simulated method presented a good agreement with experimental data, and can be used to design and predict high performance resin matrix for advanced composites. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

A circular pool and commercial RC boats were the basis of our first setup, where we demonstrated that jamming, clustering, disordered and ordered motion are all present in such a simple experiment and showed that the noise level has a fundamental role in the generation of collective dynamics. Critical noise ranges and the transition characteristics between the different collective patterns were also examined. In our second experiment we used a real-time tracking system and a few steerable model boats to introduce intelligent leaders into the flock. We demonstrated that even a very small portion of guiding members can determine group direction and enhance ordering through inelastic collisions. We also showed that noise can facilitate and speed up ordering with leaders. Our work was extended with an agent-based simulation model, too, and close similarity between real and simulation results was observed. The simulation results show clear statistical evidence of three states and negative correlation between density and ordered motion due to the onset of jamming. Our experiments confirm the different theoretical studies and simulation results in the literature on the subject of collision-based, noise-dependent and leader-driven self-propelled particle systems.

AB Diffusion is the process by which new products and practices are invented and successfully introduced into a society. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon in terms of a network of interacting agents whose decisions are determined by the action of their neighbours according to a probabilistic model. It is known that the maximum eigenvalue of the network decides a tipping point of a diffusion process by probabilistic model. The network with large maximum eigenvalue is susceptible to a diffusion process. Evolutionary optimisation is used to make the network in which the diffusion process will start more early than in other networks. Two properties are identified in which the network is suitable for fast diffusion. These arc a power law of degree distribution and the phenomena in which hub nodes are connected very densely, it is called a rich-club phenomena. Finally, the results of numerical diffusion simulation are compared with other network topology to verify the performance of evolutionary optimised networks.

AB To model complex systems for agent behaviors, genetic algorithms have been used to evolve neural networks which are based on cellular automata. These neural networks are popular tools in the artificial life community. This hybrid architecture aims at achieving synergy between the cellular automata and the powerful generalization capabilities of the neural networks. Evolutionary algorithms provide useful ways to learn about the structure of these neural networks, but the use of direct evolution in more difficult and complicated problems often fails to achieve satisfactory solutions. A more promising solution is to employ incremental evolution that reuses the solutions of easy tasks and applies these solutions to more difficult ones. Moreover, because the human brain can be divided into many behaviors with specific functionalities and because human beings can integrate these behaviors for high-level tasks, a biologically-inspired behavior selection mechanism is useful when combining these incrementally evolving basic behaviors. In this paper, an architecture based on cellular automata, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, incremental evolution and a behavior selection mechanism is proposed to generate high-level behaviors for mobile robots. Experimental results with several simulations show the possibilities of the proposed architecture.

AB N1-(alpha,beta-Alkene)-substituted phenylpyrazolopyrimidine derivatives with acetyl and functionalized phenyl groups at alpha- and beta-positions, respectively, were synthesized by the reaction of 3-phenylpyrazolopyrimidine (PhPP) with bromoacetone, followed by a chalcone reaction with differently substituted aromatic aldehydes. The Src kinase enzyme assay revealed modest inhibitory activity (half maximal inhibitory concentration, IC50 = 21.7-192.1 mu M) by a number of PhPP derivatives. Antiproliferative activity of the compounds was evaluated on human leukemia (CCRF-CEM), human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SK-OV-3), breast carcinoma (MDA-MB-231), and colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cells in vitro. 4-Chlorophenyl carbo-enyl substituted 3-phenylpyrazolopyrimidine (10) inhibited the cell proliferation of HT-29 and SK-OV-3 by 90% and 79%, respectively, at a concentration of 50 mu M after 96 h incubation. The compound showed modest inhibitory activity against c-Src (IC50 = 60.4 mu M), Btk (IC50 = 90.5 mu M), and Lck (IC50 = 110 mu M), while it showed no activity against Abl1, Akt1, Alk, Braf, Cdk2, and PKCa. In combination with target selection and kinase profiling assay, extensive theoretical studies were carried out to explore the selectivity behavior of compound 10. Specific interactions were also explored by examining the changing trends of interactions of tyrosine kinases with the phenylpyrazolopyrimidine derivative. The results showed good agreement with the experimental selectivity pattern among c-Src, Btk, and Lck.

AB A capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for the simultaneous speciation of three elements in organic and inorganic species was developed. Nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) was used as the off-column derivatization agent to form UV-absorbing complexes with the analytes. It was also added to the running electrolyte for the separation and detection. Besides, micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) was performed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for the adjustment of electrophoretic mobility. A theoretical model, with the consideration of pH, SDS and NTA in the electrolyte buffer, was designed to describe the migration behavior of the analytes. Good agreement was obtained when the model was used to explain the experimental results. The aspect of improvement in detection was also evaluated, and SDS was found capable of enhancing the detection sensitivity for the or organometallic compounds. Further improvement of determination was achieved by amplified field sample injection. It permitted a 40 to 600 fold on-line enrichment for five analytes. Detection limits down to 0.2 ng/ml were obtained. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB The microbubble ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) has been widely recognized as a potential noninvasive tool for blood pressure measurement. However, UCA indices such as the shift in the resonance frequency and echo amplitude have problems of low resolution, nonlinear relationship with blood pressure, etc. In this paper, a novel UCA index, the shift in the subharmonic optimal driving frequency (SSODF) of microbubbles, is proposed. The effectiveness of the index for estimating blood pressure was evaluated by performing a microbubble acoustic response simulation. The behavior of commercial UCA microbubbles was investigated as a function of the driving acoustic pressure (in kilopascals) and ambient overpressure (in millimeters of mercury). Simulation results showed that for a 1.6-mu m-diameter microbubble, SSODF increased linearly with the overpressure in a range of 0 to 200 mmHg and was maximum (2.07 MHz) at 380 kPa. Changes of the overpressure as small as 5 mmHg can be detected using SSODF. For a population of microbubbles with a Gaussian size distribution (mean diameter: 1.6 mu m, standard deviation: 0.2 mu m), SSODF was 1.7 MHz at 280 kPa. With further experimental validation, the proposed method may be developed as a novel noninvasive technique for accurate blood pressure measurement.

AB The conformational behaviour in aqueous solution of the EgadMe complex, a conditional gadolinium-based contrast agent sensitive to beta-galactosidase enzymatic activity, is investigated by means of ab initio calculations and classical molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, force field parameterization of gadolinium-ligand interactions is performed, and its reliability is tested on the bench mark [Gd(DOTA)](-) system by MD simulations. Both computational methods highlight the presence in EgadMe of two main conformational isomers. The lowest energy conformation is a "close'' form, corresponding to a state of low-relaxivity (MRI "inactive''), in which the ninth coordination site of the gadolinium ion is occupied by one oxygen atom of the galactopyranose residue. The second isomer, which is 2.9 (at ab initio level) and 4.2 (at MD level) kcal mol(-1) above the global minimum, presents an "open'' form, corresponding to a state of high-relaxivity (MRI "active'') in which one water molecule coordinates the ion. These results are consistent with experimental findings reported for EgadMe, and show that competition at the ninth coordination site of gadolinium ion, between the intra (the galactopyranose residue) and inter (water molecules) molecular interactions, affects the relaxivity of this system.

ID CHINA; WARS
AB We use agent-based computer simulation to test the effect of environmental conditions (available biomass/carrying capacity and environmental risk) on the development of wealth inequality and patron-client herding networks in nomadic pastoral economies. Our results show that 1) wealth inequality reaches very high levels when carrying capacity is high and risk is low, and 2) patron-client contract herding networks increase in size and duration when carrying capacity is high and risk is low. We compare empirical data from the Mongol (1206-1368 CE) and Xiongnu (209 BCE- 48 CE) empires with simulation results to develop an explanatory mechanism for the apparent correlation between nomadic empire creation and positive environmental conditions. We argue that the internal dynamics of nomadic pastoral societies are sufficient to produce high degrees of inequality and hierarchical herding networks. Nomadic empires are more likely to form during key periods of increased biomass and decreased environmental risk.

AB Dynamic fluorescence molecular tomography (DFMT) is a valuable method to evaluate the metabolic process of contrast agents in different organs in vivo, and direct reconstruction methods can improve the temporal resolution of DFMT. However, challenges still remain due to the large time consumption of the direct reconstruction methods. An acceleration strategy using graphics processing units (GPU) is presented. The procedure of conjugate gradient optimization in the direct reconstruction method is programmed using the compute unified device architecture and then accelerated on GPU. Numerical simulations and in vivo experiments are performed to validate the feasibility of the strategy. The results demonstrate that, compared with the traditional method, the proposed strategy can reduce the time consumption by similar to 90% without a degradation of quality.

   interactive learning environments
AB In exploratory domains, agents' behaviors include switching between activities, extraneous actions, and mistakes. Such settings are prevalent in real world applications such as interaction with open-ended software, collaborative office assistants, and integrated development environments. Despite the prevalence of such settings in the real world, there is scarce work in formalizing the connection between high-level goals and low-level behavior and inferring the former from the latter in these settings. We present a formal grammar for describing users' activities in such domains. We describe a new top-down plan recognition algorithm called CRADLE (Cumulative Recognition of Activities and Decreasing Load of Explanations) that uses this grammar to recognize agents' interactions in exploratory domains. We compare the performance of CRADLE with state-of-the-art plan recognition algorithms in several experimental settings consisting of real and simulated data. Our results show that CRADLE was able to output plans exponentially more quickly than the state-of-the-art without compromising its correctness, as determined by domain experts. Our approach can form the basis of future systems that use plan recognition to provide real-time support to users in a growing class of interesting and challenging domains.

AB Animal responses occur according to a specific temporal structure composed of two states, where a bout is followed by a long pause until the next bout. Such a bout-and-pause pattern has three components: the bout length, the within-bout response rate, and the bout initiation rate. Previous studies have investigated how these three components are affected by experimental manipulations. However, it remains unknown what underlying mechanisms cause bout-and-pause patterns. In this article, we propose two mechanisms and examine computational models developed based on reinforcement learning. The model is characterized by two mechanisms. The first mechanism is choice-an agent makes a choice between operant and other behaviors. The second mechanism is cost-a cost is associated with the changeover of behaviors. These two mechanisms are extracted from past experimental findings. Simulation results suggested that both the choice and cost mechanisms are required to generate bout-and-pause patterns and if either of them is knocked out, the model does not generate bout-and-pause patterns. We further analyzed the proposed model and found that it reproduced the relationships between experimental manipulations and the three components that have been reported by previous studies. In addition, we showed alternative models can generate bout-and-pause patterns as long as they implement the two mechanisms.

AB Experimental observations of cell migration often describe the presence of mesoscale patterns within motile cell Populations. These patterns can take the form of cells moving as aggregates or in chain-like formation. Here we present a discrete model capable of producing mesoscale patterns. These patterns are formed by biasing movements to favor a particular Configuration of agent-agent attachments using a binding function f(K), where K is the scaled local coordination number. This discrete model is related to a nonlinear diffusion equation, where we relate the nonlinear diffusivity(C) to the binding function f. The nonlinear diffusion equation supports a range of solutions which can be either smooth or discontinuous. Aggregation patterns can be produced with the discrete model, and we show that there is a transition between the presence and absence of aggregation depending oil the sign of D(C). A combination of simulation and analysis shows that both the existence of mesoscale patterns and the validity of the continuum model depend on the form off. Our results Suggest that there may he no formal Continuum description of a motile system with strong mesoscale patterns. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In this article an anisotropic interaction model avoiding collisions is proposed. Starting point is a general isotropic interacting particle system, as used for swarming or follower-leader dynamics. An anisotropy is induced by rotation of the force vector resulting from the interaction of two agents. In this way the anisotropy is leading to a smooth evasion behaviour. In fact, the proposed model generalizes the standard models, and compensates their drawback of not being able to avoid collisions. Moreover, the model allows for formal passage to the limit 'number of particles to infinity', leading to a mesoscopic description in the mean-field sense. Possible applications are autonomous traffic, swarming or pedestrian motion. Here, we focus on the latter, as the model is validated numerically using two scenarios in pedestrian dynamics. The first one investigates the pattern formation in a channel, where two groups of pedestrians are walking in opposite directions. The second experiment considers a crossing with one group walking from left to right and the other one from bottom to top. The well-known pattern of lanes in the channel and travelling waves at the crossing can be reproduced with the help of this anisotropic model at both, the microscopic and the mesoscopic level. In addition, the 'right-before-left' and 'left-before-right' rule appear intrinsically for different anisotropy parameters.

AB In TDOA passive location tasks, the geometric configuration can greatly affect the positioning precision due to the complicated characteristics of electromagnetic environment. How to find an appropriate path to a good geometry to locate the transmitter accurately is vital in practical location tasks. This paper proposes a novel geometry optimization method based on deep reinforcement learning. In the proposed method, stations are regarded as mobile agents that can receive wireless signals decide where to go. All agents are controlled by an actor-critic learner, which is trained on the experiences collected from executing the TDOA location task repeatedly. To evaluate the trained agents, a TDOA location simulator environment with complex electromagnetic characteristics is developed. The empirical results show that, the learner mastered useful strategies and navigated to optimal geometric configurations efficiently. A visual depiction of highlights of the learner's behavior in TDOA passive location tasks can be viewed in the video provided in the supplementary material.

ID CONCURRENCY PROBABILISTIC MODELS; EVENT STRUCTURES; PETRI NETS
AB We present the theory of distributed Markov chains (DMCs). A DMC consists of a collection of communicating probabilistic agents in which the synchronizations determine the probability distribution for the next moves of the participating agents. The key feature of a DMC is that the synchronizations are deterministic, in the sense that any two simultaneously enabled synchronizations involve disjoint sets of agents. Using our theory of DMCs we show how one can analyze the behavior using the interleaved semantics of the model. A key point is, the transition system which defines the interleaved semantics is-except in degenerate cases-not a Markov chain. Hence one must develop new techniques to analyze these behaviors exhibiting both concurrency and stochasticity.
   After establishing the core theory we develop a statistical model checking procedure which verifies the dynamical properties of the trajectories generated by the the model. The specifications consist of Boolean combinations of component-wise bounded linear time temporal logic formulas. We also provide a probabilistic Petri net representation of DMCs and use it to derive a probabilistic event structure semantics.

ID ELASTICITY
AB Small-size topological inhomogeneities in polymer networks characterized by differences in composition are formed as a consequence of history-determined covalent linking of units differing in some property into chemical clusters (topological inhomogeneities). This process is possibly assisted by physical association (segregation) of units of different types. Evolution of hard clusters in mixtures of long and short chains crosslinked with a common crosslinking agent and multicomponent polyurethane networks have been treated as examples of evolution of topological inhomogeneities. Simple mean-field models based on the statistical theory of branching processes (TBP) have been developed for modelling of the topological inhomogeneities (molecular weight averages, functionality averages, percolation threshold, etc.) in dependence on initial composition, reactivities of the functional groups, or history of network formation. Such characterization was possible by distinguishing bonds between e.g. soft-soft, soft-hard, and hard-hard units. More sophisticated models view inhomogeneities formation as a kinetic process where effective reactivity of functional groups in reactions, by which inhomogeneities are formed, depends on the size and composition of a given chemical cluster. This model is based on Monte-Carlo simulations of the generalized Smoluchowski coagulation process.

AB LTX-401 is a novel oncolytic compound designed for the local treatment of solid tumors. In the present study, we have examined the applicability and efficacy of LTX-401 in a rat model JM1 hepatocellular carcinoma, with particular interest in its ability to induce antitumor immunity. LTX-401 induces necrotic cell death followed by the release of immunogenic cell death mediators such as high-mobility group box 1 protein, ATP, and cytochrome c. When injected into subcutaneous and orthotopic JM1 tumors, LTX-401 treatment resulted in a strong antitumoral effect followed by complete tumor regression in the majority of animals. Additionally, LTX-401 could affect the growth of distal tumor deposits simulating metastases, hence indicating immune-mediated abscopal responses. Furthermore, LTX-401 treatment induced tumor-specific immune responses as seen by protection against tumor rechallenge and increased production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) by splenic cells in response to stimulation with tumor cells. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the oncolytic compound LTX-401 provides local tumor control followed by protective immune responses and may be exploited as a novel immunotherapeutic agent in hepatocellular carcinoma.

AB Aiming at studying the evolution pattern of cultivating the ability of university students' entrepreneurship, this paper established the payoff matrix between the university and students agent with the evolutionary economics method. The analysis of the evolution of the communication process model reveals how the choice strategy of individuals influences that of groups. Numerical simulation also demonstrates the influences of different values of decision-making parameters and the change of initial conditions on the result of evolution. It is found that the evolution path system of university students' entrepreneurial ability has two kinds of modes: one is the ideal state; and the other one is the bad "lock" state. By adjusting parameters, we can jump out of the bad "lock" state, thus optimizing cultivation path.

AB Hydrothermal oxidation, a promising method for removal of cobalt radionuclides from EDTA-containing liquid radioactive waste streams, is in the focus of the present study. It has been demonstrated that Co(III)-EDTA complexes, which are very stable under normal conditions, undergo oxidation as a result of the electron transfer from the EDTA carboxyl group to Co(III) ions under elevated temperature. The electron transfer reaction follows the first-order rate law with an activation energy of 91.8 kJ/mol at pH 12 and time of Coale ions half-conversion of 0.2 s at 200 degrees C. The rate of EDTA oxidation is proportional to the concentration of Co(III) ions and solution pH. Based on quantum chemistry simulations, possible intermediate structures formed upon the electron transfer from EDTA to Co(III) ions have been suggested. It has been shown that the introduction of hydrogen peroxide provides a continuous generation of Co(III) ions and a sequential decarboxylation of the EDTA until complete degradation of the chelate structure. The pathways of cobalt immobilization have been clarified.

AB The interactions of the cryoprotective agent trehalose with a lipid membrane made of 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine at 323 K were studied by means of molecular dynamics simulations. It was observed that trehalose binds to the phospholipid headgroups with its main axis parallel to the membrane normal. Trehalose establishes hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl and phosphate groups and replaces water molecules from the lipid headgroup. Notably, the number of hydrogen bonds (HBs) that the membrane made with its environment was conserved after trehalose binding. The HBs between lipid and trehalose have a longer lifetime than those established between lipid and water. The binding of the sugar does not produce changes either in the lipid area or in the lipid order parameter. The effect of trehalose on the dipole potential is in agreement with experimental results. The contribution of the different components to the membrane dipole potential was analyzed. It was observed that the binding of trehalose produces changes in the different components and the sugar itself contributes to the surface potential due to the polarization of its hydroxyl in the interface.

AB The simultaneous in situ synthesis of silver nanoparticles and slenderizing of wool fibers was carried out in one single step process without using external reducing agent. The functional groups of wool fibers were responsible for the reduction of silver ions into silver nanoparticles, and the possible interactions between the synthesized nanoparticles and the protein chains of wool fibers have been thoroughly discussed. According to the hypothesized mechanism, which was further proved by UV-vis absorption spectra, there is also a possibility of cross-linking formation within wool protein chains through diazotion reaction with amine groups of wool fibers. Duration of the process at the applied temperature allowed enough time for complete growth of the silver nucleus inside the protein chains, creating more cross-linking within the protein chains of wool fibers. Findings suggest the potential of the proposed method in producing fine wool fibers with enhanced tensile strength and slight color change.

AB Herein, we report a facile and rapid route for the preparation of hyperbranched polyethylenimine (HPEI) modified cellulose fiber (CellMW-HPEI) as an effective biosorbent for the removal of inorganic arsenic. Benefiting from microwave irradiation (MW), the grafting of this coating agent with a large molecular size was achieved efficiently according to FTIR, SEM and elemental analysis. The adsorption properties of the modified biosorbent including equilibrium isotherms, kinetics and the effects of pH and temperature were explored. The results revealed that the experimental data well fitted Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models. The high density of amine groups on the modified fiber surface is believed to enhance the adsorption of arsenic ions due to electrostatic attraction and surface complexation in the binding process. Compared with other biosorbents reported previously, CellMW-HPEI fibers could be promptly prepared and the uptake amounts for arsenic ions were enhanced, simultaneously. Thus, this work will help facilitate the research on novel biosorbents for the removal of arsenic from water.

AB Novel calix[4] pyrrole encapsulated platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) have been prepared in the aqueous medium using meso-tetra(methoxy) meso-tetra (4-phenoxy acetohydrazide) calix[4] pyrrole (MCPTH) as both reducing as well as the capping agent. The developed MCPTH-PtNPs nano-assembly has been characterized by HRTEM, XRD, XPS, TGA and FTIR methods. Grafting capability of MCPTH on PtNPs was envisaged by molecular dynamics simulations that renders towards the complemented role of ligand in capping the surface via metal-acceptor interactions. These nanoparticles have been exploited for chemoselective hydrogenation of nitroarenes using molecular hydrogen at room temperature. Supplemented computational and experimental apprehension clearly corroborates that hydrazide group remains in close contact with the surface and provides adequate coordination sites for the adsorption of nitrenes; required for hydrogenation. This catalytic approach can be conceived as an important tool for determining the electronic and structural influence on the catalytic activity which may open new vistas pertaining to the use of calix functionalized nanocatalyst.

AB A novel, sensitive, and selective electrochemical sensor has been fabricated for the determination of 1-naphthyl methylcarbamate (carbaryl) as an important pesticide. Three-dimensional graphene (3DG) was synthesized by using thiourea as the crosslinking agent that simultaneously caused impregnation of sulfur and nitrogen functional groups onto the graphene. Graphene doped with S and N atoms was modified by gold nanoparticles. The obtained 3DG-Au nanocomposite was used for the determination of carbaryl by differential pulse voltammetry. Different experimental parameters such as pH, type of electrolyte, accumulation time, and accumulation potential were optimized. Under optimal conditions, a linear response was achieved in the range of 0.004-0.3M of carbaryl with a detection limit of 0.0012M (S/N=3). The sensor demonstrated suitable selectivity, stability, and reproducibility through its successful application for the determination of carbaryl in fruit, vegetable, and water samples with good recoveries.

AB ObjectiveA comprehensive methodology for the simultaneous determination of 15 multiclass organic UV filters in sunscreen cosmetics was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS).
   MethodsSunscreen cosmetics of various matrices, such as toning lotion, emulsion, cream and lipstick, were analysed. Ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was utilized as the extraction technique for sample preparation. The 15 UV filters were chromatographically separated by two groups of mobile phase system on an XBridge C-18 analytical column (150 x 2.1 mm I.D., 3.5 m particle size) and quantified using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. The quantitation was performed using the external calibration method.
   ResultsThe established method was validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, stability, intraday and interday precisions, recovery and matrix effect. The method was also applied for the determination of UV filters in commercial sunscreen cosmetics.
   ConclusionThe experimental results demonstrated that the developed method was accurate, rapid and sensitive and can be used for the analytical control of sunscreen cosmetics.

AB Tyrosinase inhibitors are of great clinical interest as agents for the treatment of hyperpigmentary disorders; however, most compounds described in the literature lack clinical efficiency due to insufficient inhibitory activity against human tyrosinase (hTyr). Recently, we reported that thiazolyl resorcinols (4-resorcinylthiazol-2-amines and -amides) are both selective and efficacious inhibitors of hTyr in vitro and in vivo. Here, we measured dose-activity profiles of a large number of thiazolyl resorcinols and analogous compounds to better understand the molecular basis of their interaction with hTyr. We show that both the resorcinyl moiety and the thiazole ring must be intact to allow efficient inhibition of hTyr, while the substituents at the thiazole 2-amino group confer additional inhibitory activity, depending on their size and polarity. The results of molecular docking simulations were in excellent agreement with the experimental data, affording a rationale for the structural importance of either ring. We further propose that a special type of interaction between the thiazole sulfur and a conserved asparagine residue is partially responsible for the superior inhibitory activity of thiazolyl resorcinols against hTyr.

TI The effect of postoperative aspirin on random pattern flaps in rats
SO AMERICAN SURGEON

DT Article
ID EXPERIMENTAL SKIN FLAPS; VIABILITY; SURVIVAL
AB Our laboratory has been studying the effect of aspirin, given alone or in combination with other medications, on random pattern skin flaps. We have consistently found that preoperative aspirin in high doses (200 mg/kg) increases flap survival, apparently as a result of its ability to modify the inflammatory reaction and/or direct vasodilatation, and not as a consequence of antiaggregation of platelets. In an effort to further elucidate how this effect is modulated, we designed this experiment in which we gave aspirin after the operative procedure to simulate an acute clinical surgical problem such as a failing or ischemic flap. Our results failed to show any difference between the rats that received postoperative aspirin and the untreated control group. It would appear that aspirin given postoperatively is not able to counteract the noxious elements that affect flap survival. This work indicates an important relationship between the timing of administration and the beneficial effects of aspirin. By investigating fully the mechanism whereby aspirin is able to improve flap survival, we hope to isolate this mechanism so an alternative pharmacological agent, safer than aspirin, can be found for clinical use.

DE Behavioral finance; Agent-based models; Financial crises
ID MARKETS; EXPECTATIONS; DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB I develop a two market agent-based model to study how global portfolio managers affect global financial crises and stability. First, I create an agent-based model where fund managers make their allocation decisions between two markets and a risk-free asset based on the mean variance framework. Simulation results reveal that global managers do not create global financial crises. Second, I extend the base model by incorporating insights from behavioral finance where risk is instead determined by fund manager losses. Simulation results reveal that slight global manager losses can trigger a widening of both markets' risk premium, accelerating the decline in asset prices worldwide. Statistical analysis reveals that global managers are a stabilizing force in smaller numbers; however, they become destabilizing in larger numbers. The ability to reduce risk by diversifying across markets results in excessive risk taking. If global managers exist in larger numbers, systematic over leverage may result such that a deleveraging process can lead to the spreading of financial crises. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB Ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) are widely used in Doppler studies, either for simple echo enhancement purposes, or to increase the low signal-to-clutter ratio typical of microcirculation investigations. Common to all Doppler techniques, which are briefly reviewed in this paper, is the basic assumption that possible phase and amplitude changes in received echoes are only associated with UCA microbubble movements due to the drag force of blood. Actually, when UCAs are insonified, phenomena such as rupture, displacement due to radiation force, and acoustically driven deflation might influence the results of Doppler investigations. In this paper, we investigate the possible Doppler effects of such phenomena by means of a numerical simulation model and a special acousto-optical set-up which allows analysis of the behavior of individual microbubbles over relatively long time intervals. It is thus found that all phenomena produce evident Doppler effects in vitro, but that bubble displacement and deflation in particular, are not expected to significantly interfere with clinical measurements in standard conditions.

AB This paper is concerned with the synchronization analysis and control problems for a class of nonlinear discrete-time stochastic complex dynamical networks (CDNs) consisting of identical nodes. The discrete-time stochastic dynamical networks under consideration are quite general that account for asymmetric coupling configuration, nonlinear inner coupling structures as well as nonidentical exogenous disturbances. By resorting to both the error bound and the synchronization probability, a notion of quasi-synchronization in probability is first introduced to assess the synchronization performance of the addressed CDNs. An event-triggered pinning feedback control strategy is adopted to control a small fraction of the network nodes with hope to reduce the frequency of updating and communication in the control process while preserving the desired dynamical behaviors of the controlled networks. By using the Lyapunov function method and the stochastic analysis techniques, a general framework is established within which the problems of dynamics analysis and controller synthesis are solved for the closed-loop stochastic dynamical networks. Two numerical examples and their simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the usefulness of our theoretical results.

AB This paper presents an agent-based model of the financial order book, and investigates whether the volatility of market prices can be reduced by means of specific policy interventions. The model is able to replicate the salient stylized facts of empirical data. Simulations show how market volatility is affected by two types of factors: individual characteristics of traders (i.e., behavioral heterogeneity, willingness to pay, and reaction to informative signals), and micro-structural features of the order book (i.e., the duration of limit orders and the number of allowed counterparts for market orders).

AB Recent empirical research has documented asymmetric volatility and volatility clustering in stock markets. We conjecture that a limit of arbitrage due to a borrowing constraint and herding behavior by investors are related to these phenomena. This study conducts simulation analyses on a spin model where borrowing constrained agents imitate their nearest neighbors but switch their strategies to a different one intermittently. We show that herding matters for volatility clustering while a borrowing constraint intensifies the asymmetry of volatility through the herding effect. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The paper proposes an elementary agent-based asset pricing model that, invoking the two trader types of fundamentalists and chartists, comprises four features: (i) price determination by excess demand; (ii) a herding mechanism that gives rise to a macroscopic adjustment equation for the market fractions of the two groups; (iii) a rush towards fundamentalism when the price misalignment becomes too large; and (iv) a stronger noise component in the demand per chartist trader than in the demand per fundamentalist trader, which implies a structural stochastic volatility in the returns. Combining analytical and numerical methods, the interaction between these elements is studied in the phase plane of the price and a majority index. In addition, the model is estimated by the method of simulated moments, where the choice of the moments reflects the basic stylized facts of the daily returns of a stock market index. A (parametric) bootstrap procedure serves to set up an econometric test to evaluate the model's goodness-of-fit, which proves to be highly satisfactory. The bootstrap also makes sure that the estimated structural parameters are well identified.

AB A catalytic hydrolysis rate of nerve agents can be a significant issue because of their severe toxicity which can lead to severe damage to human life. Regarding the issue, much effort has been given rise to the development of the various design of Zr(IV)-based MOF catalysts so that high catalytic performance. However, we still have feasibility issues. To this end, we turned our attention to develop the method for facile, scalable, and efficient synthesis of Zr(IV)-based MOFs (UiO-66) with high-performance hydrolysis by imparting enriched active sites to the catalysts, as well as to examine its feasibility using the combination of Ui0-66 with the organic bases including 4-ethylmorpholine (4-EM) and linear-/ branch-type polyethyleneimine (PEI). The modulated UiO-66 catalysts were synthesized by varying the total reaction concentration. The synthesized three different UiO-66 catalysts were characterized and then applied for hydrolysis rates of the methylparaoxon (MPO) nerve agent simulant. From these investigations, we found that the highest concentration led to the smallest particle size (ca. 100 nm) and highest defect density (1.8 per cluster), resulting in 3-times higher catalytic activity (0.548 s(-1)) in turnover frequency (TOF) relative to that of the uncontrolled UiO-66 (ca. 580 nm and 1.6 per cluster) (0.188 (-1)) which is prepared by the reported procedure. In addition, the reaction process significantly influenced on the catalytic activity of UiO-66, in which the simple change of the reagent mixing method led to a ca. 182-times difference in the catalytic activity for MPO hydrolysis despite using the same reagents including catalysts and bases. Importantly, we found that the reaction process-dependent catalytic activity of UiO-66 can be significantly associated with the chelation of Zr(IV) Lewis acidic active sites by base materials of 4-EM and PEI (Lewis base). Furthermore, the solid-state catalytic system based on the polymer composite of Ui0-66S/LPEI Ok on the cotton fabric was also examined for MPO hydrolysis at various relative humidity and temperature conditions to create actual atmosphere conditions, which gave the possibility for actual military applications such as protective suits and equipment. In addition, we schematically demonstrated the loss of active sites on Ui0-66 by chelation effects based on experimental and density functional theory (DFT)-derived computational simulation because it is highly correlated to the feasibility of Zr(IV)-based MOF catalysts for detoxification of nerve agents. In addition, we carefully propose a plausible reaction mechanism step on the nucleophilic attack by hydroxide group on the basis of the computational simulation.

AB Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate self-healing in cementitious materials with saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution as a healing agent, supplied by using capsules and a vascular system. Materials and methods: Numerical simulation was performed to determine the efficiency of the supply of saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution by using capsules and consequently the efficiency of self-healing. The influence of capsule dosage and size was taken into account. Ultrasonic pulse velocity tests were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of self-healing of cracks with saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution supplied via a vascular system. Results: The simulation results show that the efficiency of self-healing of cracks with saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution supplied by using capsules is very low. This is due to the fast absorption of healing agent by the bulk matrix and the low efficiency of the supply of healing agent by using capsules. Increase of capsule dosage and size can improve the healing efficiency as the amount of healing agent supplied to crack linearly increases with the capsule dosage and diameter. In comparison, the efficiency of self-healing of cracks with saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution supplied via a vascular system is much higher. This is because sufficient saturated Ca(OH)(2) solution is supplied to cracks for healing via a vascular system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Altruism is typically associated with traits or behaviors that benefit the population as a whole, but are costly to the individual. We propose that, when the environment is rapidly changing, senescence (age-related deterioration) can be altruistic. According to numerical simulations of an agent-based model, while long-lived individuals can outcompete their short lived peers, populations composed of long-lived individuals are more likely to go extinct during periods of rapid environmental change. Moreover, as in many situations where other cooperative behavior arises, senescence can be stabilized in a structured population.

AB Background: Connected individuals (or nodes) in a network are more likely to be similar than two randomly selected nodes due to homophily and/or network influence. Distinguishing between these two influences is an important goal in network analysis, and generalized estimating equation (GEE) analyses of longitudinal dyadic network data are an attractive approach. It is not known to what extent such regressions can accurately extract underlying data generating processes. Therefore our primary objective is to determine to what extent, and under what conditions, does the GEE-approach recreate the actual dynamics in an agent-based model.
   Methods: We generated simulated cohorts with pre-specified network characteristics and attachments in both static and dynamic networks, and we varied the presence of homophily and network influence. We then used statistical regression and examined the GEE model performance in each cohort to determine whether the model was able to detect the presence of homophily and network influence.
   Results: In cohorts with both static and dynamic networks, we find that the GEE models have excellent sensitivity and reasonable specificity for determining the presence or absence of network influence, but little ability to distinguish whether or not homophily is present.
   Conclusions: The GEE models are a valuable tool to examine for the presence of network influence in longitudinal data, but are quite limited with respect to homophily.

AB Paleogenomic research has shown that modern humans, Neanderthals, and their most recent common ancestor have displayed less genetic diversity than living great apes. The traditional interpretation that low levels of genetic diversity in modern humans resulted from a relatively recent demographic bottleneck cannot account for similarly low levels of genetic diversity in Middle Pleistocene hominins. A more parsimonious hypothesis proposes that the effective population size of the human lineage has been low for more than 500,000 years, but the mechanism responsible for suppressing genetic diversity in Pleistocene hominin populations without similarly affecting that of their hominoid contemporaries remains unknown. Here we use agent-based simulation to study the effect of culturally mediated migration on neutral genetic diversity in structured populations. We show that, in populations structured by culturally mediated migration, selection can suppress neutral genetic diversity over thousands of generations, even in the absence of bottlenecks or expansions in census population size. In other words, selection could have suppressed the effective population size of Pleistocene hominins for as long as the degree of cultural similarity between regionally differentiated groups played an important role in mediating intraspecific gene flow.

AB Event simulation (ES) is the situational inference process in which perceived event features such as objects, agents, and actions are associated in the brain to represent the whole situation. ES provides a common basis for various cognitive processes, such as perceptual prediction, situational understanding/prediction, and social cognition (such as mentalizing/trait inference). Here, functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to elucidate the neural substrates underlying important subdivisions within ES. First, the study investigated whether ES depends on different neural substrates when it is conducted explicitly and implicitly. Second, the existence of neural substrates specific to the future-prediction component of ES was assessed. Subjects were shown contextually related object pictures implying a situation and performed several picture-word-matching tasks. By varying task goals, subjects were made to infer the implied situation implicitly/explicitly or predict the future consequence of that situation. The results indicate that, whereas implicit ES activated the lateral prefrontal cortex and medial/lateral parietal cortex, explicit ES activated the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and medial/lateral temporal cortex. Additionally, the left temporoparietal junction plays an important role in the future-prediction component of ES. These findings enrich our understanding of the neural substrates of the implicit/explicit/predictive aspects of ES-related cognitive processes.

AB To improve the concurrency of leaders' formation and followers' containment, a difficult problem of designing the formation controller and the containment controller simultaneously should be addressed for networked systems. Motivated by this, this paper presents an even-triggered control framework for networked Euler-Lagrange systems to achieve formation-containment control even in the presence of uncertain parameters. An event-triggered formation controller is firstly designed for leaders to achieve the desired configuration. An event-triggered containment control law is then developed to guarantee that all the followers can converge to the convex hull formed by leaders. The key feature of the containment control law is that it does not necessitate any relative velocity information with respect to neighbor followers. Each controller's gains are adaptively tuned using only local information. The parametric uncertainties are accommodated by using the adaptive updating law. Zeno behaviors of the triggering time sequences are also excluded. As a result, the communication burden of formation-containment system can be reduced. Numerical simulation is finally presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered formation-containment control framework. (C) 2018 ISA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB While understanding individual stakeholders' perspectives on the adoption and conversion to a biofuel-based landscape has been a subject of many previous studies on biofuels, there has been relatively little attention given to understanding how the interaction between multiple stakeholders involved in biofuel development could influence the widespread adoption of biofuel production. This paper analyzes the key stakeholder interactions utilizing various data sources including survey results, social media posts, and empirical and theoretical analyses. An intensive review is conducted for a number of surveys and research papers on different aspects of biofuel development such as land use choices, biorefinery and transportation, infrastructure development, consumer priorities, environmental impacts, etc. Following that, a stakeholder synergy approach is applied to synthesizing typical responses of stakeholders, such as producers, consumers, biorefineries, rural communities, and the government, and discussing how their responses influence each other's decisions and the overall system performance. Based on the findings of inadequate stakeholder synergy, it is recommended that new surveys and further research should be conducted to understand why synergy between stakeholders in biofuel development is absent. Additionally, this paper provides research perspectives, including (1) applying cutting-edge text-mining techniques to conduct sentiment analysis, and research and public attention analysis; (2) using an agent-based model to simulate stakeholder interactions and understand the factors that influence stakeholder synergy and the emergence of a bioeconomy.

AB The purpose of the present simulation study is to reveal how confining surfaces with different mechanical properties affect the acoustic response of a contrast agent microbubble. To this end, numerical simulations are carried out for three types of walls: a plastic (OptiCell) wall, an aluminium wall, and a biological tissue. For each wall, the behaviour of contrast microbubbles of three sizes is investigated. The spectral characteristics of the scattered pressure produced by the microbubbles are compared for two cases: the bubble oscillates far away from the wall and the same bubble oscillates in the immediate vicinity of the wall. The results of the simulations allow one to make the following main conclusions. The effect of the OptiCell wall on the acoustic bubble response is stronger than that of the aluminium and tissue walls. Changes in the bubble response near the wall are stronger when bubbles are excited above their resonance frequency. Considering changes in the fundamental and the 2nd harmonic with respect to the peak values of these components at different bubble radii, it is found that the changes are stronger for smaller bubbles and that the changes in the 2nd harmonic are stronger than those in the fundamental. These results allow one to gain an insight into conditions under which the effect of an elastic wall on the acoustic response of a contrast agent microbubble is easier to be detected.

AB Conservation planning of critical habitats for wildlife species at risk is a priority topic that requires the knowledge of how animals select and use their habitat, and how they respond to future developmental changes in their environment. This paper explores the role of a habitat-modeling methodological approach, agent-based modeling, which we advocate as a promising approach for ecological research. Agent-based models (ABMs) are capable of simultaneously distinguishing animal densities from habitat quality, can explicitly represent the environment and its dynamism, can accommodate spatial patterns of inter- and intra-species mechanisms, and can explore feedbacks and adaptations inherent in these systems. ABMs comprise autonomous, individual entities; each with dynamic, adaptive behaviors and heterogeneous characteristics that interact with each other and with their environment. These interactions result in emergent outcomes that can be used to quantitatively examine critical habitats from the individual- to population-level. ABMs can also explore how wildlife will respond to potential changes in environmental conditions, since they can readily incorporate adaptive animal-movement ecology in a changing landscape. This paper describes the necessary elements of an ABM developed specifically for understanding wildlife habitat selection, reviews the current empirical literature on ABMs in wildlife ecology and management, and evaluates the current and future roles these ABMs can play, specifically with regards to scenario planning of designated critical habitats.

AB In a world where ideas flow freely across multiple platforms, people must often rely on others' advice and opinions without an objective standard to judge whether this information is accurate. The present study explores the hypothesis that an individual's internal decision confidence can be used as a signal to learn the accuracy of others' advice, even in the absence of feedback. According to this "agreement-inconfidence" hypothesis, people can learn about an advisor's accuracy across multiple interactions according to whether the advice offered agrees with their own initial opinions, weighted by the confidence with which these initial opinions are held. We test this hypothesis using a judge-advisor system paradigm to precisely manipulate the profiles of virtual advisors in a perceptual decision-making task. We find that when advisors' and participants' judgments are independent, people can correctly learn advisors' features, like their accuracy and calibration, whether or not objective feedback is available. However, when their judgments (and thus errors) are correlated-as is the case in many real social contexts-predictable distortions in trust can be observed between feedback and feedback-free scenarios. Using agent-based simulations, we explore implications of these individual-level heuristics for networklevel patterns of trust and belief formation.

AB Medical innovations, in the form of new medication or other clinical practices, evolve and spread through health care systems, impacting on the quality and standards of health care provision, which is demonstrably heterogeneous by geography. Our aim is to investigate the potential for the diffusion of innovation to influence health inequality and overall levels of recommended care. We extend existing diffusion of innovation models to produce agent-based simulations that mimic populationwide adoption of new practices by doctors within a network of influence. Using a computational model of network construction in lieu of empirical data about a network, we simulate the diffusion of competing innovations as they enter and proliferate through a state system comprising 24 geopolitical regions, 216 facilities and over 77,000 individuals. Results show that stronger clustering within hospitals or geo-political regions is associated with slower adoption amongst smaller and rural facilities. Results of repeated simulation show how the nature of uptake and competition can contribute to low average levels of recommended care within a system that relies on diffusive adoption. We conclude that an increased disparity in adoption rates is associated with high levels of clustering in the network, and the social phenomena of competitive diffusion of innovation potentially contributes to low levels of recommended care.

AB The objective of this paper is to advance the study of disaster response and recovery (generally, disaster relief) by providing tools and insights to agencies that work in disaster relief. This paper is built on extensive research of disaster relief literature and practice, and provides a comprehensive analysis of agency posturing following an extreme event. We present the Disaster Response Agent-based network Management and Adaptation System (DRAMAS) model, which uses stochastic processes to model the complex interactions between relief agencies of different sizes and capabilities. The DRAMAS simulation environment provide an excellent testing ground for hypotheses regarding relief agency partnerships, goals, roles, and prior involvement, by providing a depiction of the change in agency partnerships and resource investments following a disaster. The goal of this research is to expand the current body of knowledge and examine the fundamental principles of agency success during relief operations. We find that (a) larger relief networks tended to be less efficient at meeting the typical needs of the community, (b) having a relief network with more agents appeared to increase the time it took for a typical need, (c) having a high percentage of local agents resulted in an increased time for typical services, (d) a more dense network resulted in more effective identification of long-term needs and also improved services time, etc. Results from this work provide a path for improving our understanding of interagency partnerships and interaction, and could provide new insights into the behavior of agency networks in response to a disaster.

TI STOCHASTIC COALESCENCE IN LOGARITHMIC TIME
SO ANNALS OF APPLIED PROBABILITY
LA English
DT Article
DE Stochastic coalescence processes; randomized distributed algorithms
ID INFORMATION LEADER-ELECTION
AB The following distributed coalescence protocol was introduced by Dahlia Malkhi in 2006 motivated by applications in social networking. Initially there are n agents wishing to coalesce into one cluster via a decentralized stochastic process, where each round is as follows: every cluster flips a fair coin to dictate whether it is to issue or accept requests in this round. Issuing a request amounts to contacting a cluster randomly chosen proportionally to its size. A cluster accepting requests is to select an incoming one uniformly (if there are such) and merge with that cluster. Empirical results by Fernandess and Malkhi suggested the protocol concludes in O (log n) rounds with high probability, whereas numerical estimates by Oded Schramm, based on an ingenious analytic approximation, suggested that the coalescence time should be super-logarithmic.
   Our contribution is a rigorous study of the stochastic coalescence process with two consequences. First, we confirm that the above process indeed requires super-logarithmic time w.h.p., where the inefficient rounds are due to oversized clusters that occasionally develop. Second, we remedy this by showing that a simple modification produces an essentially optimal distributed protocol; if clusters favor their smallest incoming merge request then the process does terminate in O (log n) rounds w.h.p., and simulations show that the new protocol readily outperforms the original one. Our upper bound hinges on a potential function involving the logarithm of the number of clusters and the cluster-susceptibility, carefully chosen to form a supermartingale. The analysis of the lower bound builds upon the novel approach of Schramm which may find additional applications: rather than seeking a single parameter that controls the system behavior, instead one approximates the system by the Laplace transform of the entire cluster-size distribution.

AB BackgroundThe combination of propofol and ketamine is commonly used for total intravenous anesthesia. These drugs can be delivered in different syringes or in the same syringe. We hypothesized that the drugs might separate and different concentrations of each drug could be found in different parts of the syringe during the procedure period when they were mixed in 1 syringe.
   MethodsTwelve 60-mL polypropylene syringes were prepared by mixing propofol and ketamine as 4 groups on the basis of propofol/ketamine mixture ratios (5:1 and 6.7:1) and propofol solution concentrations. Syringes were placed upright in the vertical position into a rack and kept at room temperature (21.5-22.5 degrees C), in daylight conditions and were not moved for 360 minutes. Samples of the mixture were taken from both the top and the bottom of the syringe. The first 1 mL of the samples was discarded, the following second 1 mL of the samples was filtered using 0.2-m polytetrafluoroethylene filters and measured twice (n = 6). Samples were taken at the following time intervals: T0, T10, T30, T60, T90, T120, T180, T240, T300, and T360 min. Syringes were checked visually for any color change and separation lines between the drugs.
   ResultsThere were no significant differences between the propofol and ketamine concentrations of the top and bottom samples in all 4 groups. In addition, there were no statistically significant changes of propofol and ketamine concentrations of samples over 360 minutes in any of the 4 groups. No visual changes were observed during 6 hours' observation.
   ConclusionThe results of our measurements demonstrated that mixtures of propofol (1% and 2%) and ketamine at 5:1 and 6.7:1 ratios could be used in terms of mixture homogeneity and stability in a polypropylene syringe during a 6-hour period at room temperature.

AB Purpose. The selection of cosalane (NSC 658586) by the National Cancer Institute for further development as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of AIDS led to the exploration of the solubility behavior of this extremely hydrophobic drug, which has an intrinsic solubility (S-0) approaching 1 ng/ml. This study describes attempts to reliably measure the intrinsic solubility of cosalane and examine its pH-solubility behavior.
   Methods. S-0 was estimated by 5 different strategies: (a) direct determination in an aqueous suspension; (b) facilitated dissolution; (c) estimation from the octanol/water partition coefficient and octanol solubility; (d) application of an empirical equation based on melting point and partition coefficient; and (e) estimation from the hydrocarbon solubility and functional group contributions for transfer from hydrocarbon to water.
   Results. S-0 estimates using these five methods varied over a 5 x 10(9)-fold range. Method (a) yielded the highest values, two-orders of magnitude greater than those obtained by method (b) (facilitated dissolution, 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). Method (c) gave a value 20-fold higher while that from method (d) was in fair agreement with that from facilitated dissolution. Method (e) yielded a value several orders-of-magnitude lower than other methods. A molecular dynamics simulation suggests that folded conformations not accounted for by group contributions may reduce cosalane's effective hydrophobicity. Ionic equilibria calculations for this weak diprotic acid suggested a 100-fold increase in solubility per pH unit increase. The pH-solubility profile of cosalane at 25 degrees C agreed closely with theory.
   Conclusions. These studies highlight the difficulty in determining solubility of very poorly soluble compounds and the possible advantage of the facilitated dissolution method. The diprotic nature of cosalane enabled a solubility enhancement of > 10(7)-fold by simple pH adjustment.

AB Edaravone is a lipophilic drug with multiple mechanisms of action. Because edaravone is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of stroke, we tested the hypothesis that edaravone would be neuroprotective following cerebral ischemia using a rabbit embolic stroke model with a well-defined behavioral endpoint. Using the rabbit small clot embolic stroke model (RSCEM), a drug or drug combination is considered beneficial if it significantly increases the amount of microclots (mg) Measured in brain that produce neurologic dysfunction in 50% of a group of animals (P-50) compared to the control group. Edaravone (100 mg/kg, SC), increased the P-50 value to 1.80 +/- 0.24 mg (p<0.05) when administered 5 min following embolization and increased P-50 values by 195% and 161% (compared to control) when administered 1 and 3 h following embolization, respectively, but was inactive when applied 6 h following embolization, compared to the cumulative Control group (P-50=0.93 +/- 0.16 mg). To simulate the design of current clinical trials, edaravone was also given following a standard tPA regimen, which by itself increased the P-50 value to 2.72 +/- 0.28 mg. When tPA was infused 1 h following embolization and edaravone was given 3 h following embolization, the P-50 was 2.68 +/- 0.56 mg. This study indicates that edaravone may have substantial therapeutic benefit for the treatment of AIS since it had a therapeutic widow of at least 3 h in rabbits. Edaravone can also be administered with a thrombolytic to improve behavior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Method: A total of 109 children, adolescents, and adults (mean age = 13.9 years, SD = 6.9) consecutively seeking enrollment into the Yale Child Study Center's Project on Social Learning Disabilities were included in the study. Individuals in whom Asperger's disorder, autism, or pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified had been previously diagnosed and who had a documented Full Scale IQ greater than or equal to 70 completed surveys on demographic, clinical, and medication history information. To naturalistically evaluate medication use patterns in this population, each drug class was analyzed with respect to demographic and clinical variables. Results: In all, 55% of subjects were taking psychotropics, with 29.3% taking 2 or more medications simultaneously. Antidepressants were the most commonly used agents (32.1%), followed by stimulants (20.2%) and neuroleptics (16.5%). The clinical presentation of subjects taking psychotropic agents was heterogeneous, and most consistently included anxiety-related target symptoms (in 65% of medicated individuals). Conclusions: Psychotropic medication use appears to be common among subjects with HFPDDs, yet not generally based on the results of empirical research. Clinical heterogeneity among treated subjects suggests that psychiatric comorbidity may be overlooked in this population.

AB Roadside collisions are a significant problem faced by all countries. Urbanisation has led to an increase in traffic congestion and roadside vehicle collisions. According to the UK Government's Department for Transport, most vehicle collisions occur on urban roads, with empirical evidence showing drivers are more likely to break local and fixed speed limits in urban environments. Analysis conducted by the Department for Transport found that the UK's accident prevention measure's cost is estimated to be 33bn pound per year. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to investigate the causes of roadside collisions in urban environments to better prepare traffic management, support local council policies, and ultimately reduce collision rates. This study utilises agent-based modelling as a tool to plan, experiment and investigate the relationship between speeding and vehicle density with collisions. The study found that higher traffic density results in more vehicles travelling at a slower speed, regardless of the degree to which drivers comply with speed restrictions. Secondly, collisions increase linearly as speed compliance is reduced for all densities. Collisions are lowest when all vehicles comply with speed limits for all densities. Lastly, higher global traffic densities result in higher local traffic densities near-collision sites across all adherence levels, increasing the likelihood of congestion around these sites. This work, when extended to real-world applications using empirical data, can support effective road safety policies.

TI Bodily motion fluctuation improves reaching success rate in a
   neurophysical agent via geometric-stochastic resonance
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID NOISE; SYSTEMS
AB Organisms generate a variety of noise types, including neural noise, sensory noise, and noise resulting from fluctuations associated with movement. Sensory and neural noises are known to induce stochastic resonance (SR), which improves information transfer to the subjects control systems, including the brain. As a consequence, sensory and neural noise provide behavioral benefits, such as stabilization of posture and enhancement of feeding efficiency. In contrast, the benefits of fluctuations in the movements of a biological system remain largely unclear. Here, we describe a novel type of noise-induced order (NIO) that is realized by actively exploiting the motion fluctuations of an embodied system. In particular, we describe the theoretical analysis of a feedback-controlled embodied agent system that has a geometric end-effector. Furthermore, through several numerical simulations we demonstrate that the ratio of successful reaches to goal positions and capture of moving targets are improved by the exploitation of motion fluctuations. We report that reaching success rate improvement (RSRI) is based on the interaction of the geometric size of an end-effector, the agents motion fluctuations, and the desired motion frequency. Therefore, RSRI is a geometrically induced SR-like phenomenon. We also report an interesting result obtained through numerical simulations indicating that the agents neural and motion noise must be optimized to match the prey's motion noise in order to maximize the capture rate. Our study provides a new understanding of body motion fluctuations, as they were found to be the active noise sources for a behavioral NIO.

   Opinion Guidance
AB Studies on the fundamental role of diverse media in the evolution of public opinion can protect us from the spreading of brainwashing, extremism, and terrorism. Many fear the information cocoon may result in polarization of the public opinion. Hence, in this work, we investigate how audiences' choices among diverse media might influence public opinion. Specifically, we aim to figure out how peoples' horizons (i.e., range of available media) and quantity, as well as the distribution of media, may shape the space of public opinion. We propose a novel model of opinion dynamics that considers different influences and horizons for every individual, and we carry out simulations using a real-world social network. Numerical simulations show that diversity in media can provide more choices to the people, although individuals only choose media within the bounds of their horizons, extreme opinions are more diluted, and no opinion polarizations emerge. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of media's opinions can effectively influence the space for public opinion, but when the number of media grows to a certain level, its effect will reach a limitation. Finally, we showthat the effect of campaigns for consciousness or education can be improved by constructing the opinion of media, which can provide a basis for the policy maker in the new media age.

AB In recent years, several efforts have been made for developing simple and cost-effective strategies for eliminating multiple organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater. Pharmaceuticals, dyes and heavy metals expelled from pharmaceutical and textile industries, frequently coexist in wastewater and exhibit different complex properties, which makes the respective individual or simultaneous removal processes a continuous challenge of high, undisputed social and technological interest. The unique properties of cyclodextrins combined with its biocompatible and bioabsorbant character allow for simultaneously removing different pollutants from water by means of sorption/inclusion. Although there is a general consensus that the mechanism of sorption is based on the formation of host-guest supramolecular complexes and that cyclodextrin-based materials are effective complexation agents for targeting environmental pollutants, outperforming the conventional systems, the role of other phenomena, external to the binding sites and involving the polymer network, are still under intense scrutiny and discussion. These are related to contributions from polymer-polymer interaction, including association, surface sorption, hydrophobic interactions, electrostatics, hydrogen bonding, and also ion exchange, chelation and microprecipitation. They are governed by the type of material (e. g. native or modified polymer) and by the experimental conditions (e. g. pH, temperature, molar ratios). This review provides an upto- date discussion on the key advances in developing cyclodextrin-based materials (polymers, hydrogels and nanocomposites) used as sorbents for removing toxic compounds from wastewater. Relevant aspects regarding the benefits, structural variations and preparation procedures of these macromolecular systems, and corresponding supramolecular properties, complexation behavior, adsorption mechanisms and removal performances for different pollutants are also outlined.

TI PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION OF LEPROSY IN CHILDREN
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL PEDIATRICS
LA English
DT Article
AB India with its 4 million cases of leprosy, accounts for one-third of the world's population of leprosy patients. One-fourth of them are below 15 years of age.
   We report a 5-year follow-up study of healthy children who were close contacts of leprosy patients, in order to:
   1. detect subclinical infection and observe the development of overt disease by using the Fluorescent Leprosy Antibody Absorption Technique (FLA-ABS) and the lepromin test which assess the humoral and cell-mediated immunity (CMI), respectively;
   2. evaluate the efficacy of dapsone as a chemoprophylactic agent in the 'at risk' contacts.
   Four-hundred-and-fifty-five healthy contacts were studied. Majority of the contacts of multibacillary patients (303) were FLA-ABS positive (75 per cent) and lepromin negative (55 per cent) showing that although most of them had been infected, the lepromin status was negative (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the majority of the contacts of paucibacillary patients (152) were lepromin positive (57 per cent) (P< 0.05). Furthermore, only 61 per cent of contacts of paucibacillary patients were FLA-ABS positive as compared to 75 per cent of contacts of multibacillary patients demonstrating that the former had been exposed to a lesser quantum of infection (P < 0.05).
   On the basis of results of FLA-ABS and lepromin tests, these 455 contacts were classified into four groups, viz. Group I comprising children who were FLA-ABS positive and lepromin positive; Group II, who were FLA-ABS positive and lepromin negative; Group III, who were FLA-ABS negative and lepromin positive; and Group IV who were FLA-ABS negative and lepromin negative. During the followup period of 5 years, only two out of 155 children in Group I developed the disease showing that their good CMI had been able to contain the disease.
   Out of 166 contacts in Group II, 18 developed the disease mainly of the tuberculoid type. Most of these children were contacts of multibacillary patients. None of the children in Groups III and TV developed the disease. These findings were statistically significant (P<0.01). Out of the 166 children in Group II (the 'at risk' group), 70 were treated as controls while 96 were put on prophylaxis with dapsone which was continued ford years after the contact with the source patient had ceased, or for 3 years after the source patient became non-infective. The incidence of disease was significantly lower among children who received chemoprophylaxis (P<0.05). Among controls the incidence rate of the disease was higher in (i) contacts below 5 years of age, (ii) males, and (iii) contacts of bacteriologically positive patients (P<0.05). These contacts were labelled as the 'high risk' group.
   The efficacy rate of Dapsone prophylaxis was significantly better in:
   1. contacts below 5 years of age as compared to older contacts (P < 0.01) mainly because the latter were in late stages of incubation and also because there exists a lag period after which dapsone becomes effective as a prophylactic agent;
   2. males as compared to females, possibly because of better drug compliance by the former (P<0.05);
   3. contacts of bacteriologically positive patients (P<0.05) indicating that contacts of bacteriologically negative patients had been infected earlier when their source patients were bacteriologically positive and were, therefore now in an advanced stage of incubation where prophylaxis was less effective;
   4. contacts whose source patients were under treatment as compared to those contacts whose source patients were not receiving treatment, stressing the need for simultaneous treatment of active source patients.
   Our study demonstrates the value of the FLA-ABS and lepromin tests in detecting sub-clinical infection and for identifying the 'at risk' contacts of leprosy patients. It clearly establishes the chemoprophylactic value of Dapsone for the 'at risk' contacts, particularly for those in the 'high risk' category. In pursuance of our Government's policies under the National Leprosy Eradication programme, this study suggests the need to carry out surveillance surveys in the endemic population to identify, follow, and offer chemoprophylaxis to those at risk.

AB Postural interaction is of major importance during job interviews. While several prototypes enable users to rehearse for public speaking tasks and job interviews, few of these prototypes support subtle bodily interactions between the user and a virtual agent playing the role of an interviewer. The design of our system is informed by a multimodal corpus that was previously collected. In this paper, we explain how we were inspired by these video recordings of human interviewers to build a library of motion-captured movements that interviewers are most likely to display. We designed a fully automatic interactive virtual agent able to display these movements in response to the bodily movements of the user. Thirty-two participants presented themselves to this virtual agent during a simulated job interview. We focused on the self-presentation task of the job interview, the virtual agent being listening. Participants stood on a force platform that recorded the displacements of their center of pressure to assess the postural impact of our design. We also collected video recordings of their movements and computed the contraction index and the quantity of motion of their bodies. We explain the different hypotheses that we made concerning (1) the comparison between the performance of participants with human interviewers and the performance of participants with virtual interviewers, (2) the comparison between mirror and random postural behaviors displayed by a female versus a male virtual interviewer, and (3) the correlation between the participants' performance and their personality traits. Our results suggest that users perceive the simulated self-presentation task with the virtual interviewer as threatening and as difficult as the presentation task with the human interviewers. Furthermore, when users interact with a virtual interviewer that mirrors their postures, these users perceive the interviewer as being affiliative. Finally, a correlation analysis showed that personality traits had a significant relation to the postural behaviors and performance of the users during their presentation.

AB Recent measurements of local and wide-area network traffic have proven that the widely used Markovian process models cannot be applied for today's network traffic. If the traffic were Markovian process, the traffic's burst length would be smoothed by averaging over a long time scale contradicting with the observations of today's traffic characteristics. Measurements of real traffic also prove that traffic burstiness is present on a wide range of time scales. Traffic that is bursty on many or all time scales can be characterized statistically using the concept of long-range dependency. Long-range dependent traffic has noticeable bursts, long periods with extremely high values on all time creating traffic congestions. Several conventional methods have been implemented to avoid congestion, but they are not responsive enough to the varying transmission capacity and network delay in high-speed networks.
   A new research direction, programmable networking, offers a more promising solution for congestion control. Traditional packet networks perform only the processing necessary to forward packets toward their destination. As computing power becomes cheaper, more and more functionality can be deployed inside the network. Programmable networks support dynamic modification of the network software and hardware to manipulate the network's behavior. A special way of network programmability is when special programs called mobile or software agents are carried in the packets to the routers. Software agents are loaded, executed, migrated, and suspended in order to implement some network functions. Software agents provide the highest possible degree of flexibility in congestion control. They can carry congestion-specific knowledge into the network at locations where it is needed, rather than transferring information to the sending hosts as it happens in traditional flow control solutions.

AB Essential oils are an important source of compounds with different degree of biocidal activity against microorganisms, insects, weeds and other pathogens. They have potential application in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and food industry, as well as for agriculture and crop protection. Supercritical fluid fractionation is an interesting technology for the selective removal of monoterpenes (MT) and the purification or enrichment of the more bioactive oxygenated terpenes (OT), resulting in more effective, stable and water soluble products. In this work, the fractionation of Tagetes minuta and Salvia officinalis essential oils with carbon dioxide is experimentally studied in a semicontinuous apparatus at 313 K and 80 bar. Successive extracts are collected and the composition determined by gas chromatography. Process behavior is modeled with the group contribution equation of state (GC-EOS), showing a good agreement between model predictions and experimental results. The GC-EOS model is applied to the simulation and analysis of two continuous fractionation schemes: a simple countercurrent column and a countercurrent column with external reflux. The influence of operation variables (temperature, pressure, solvent-to-feed ratio, thermal gradient, reflux ratio) is studied in order to maximize OT concentration and recovery in the raffinate and to minimize carbon dioxide consumption. Experimental and simulation results are discussed in terms of the relative volatilities between MT and OT fractions. Particularly in the case of S. officinalis, the presence of several OT of intermediate volatility and a significant amount of higher molecular weight sesquiterpenes (ST) limits the separation performance, even when external reflux is applied.

AB Purpose: To evaluate the inhibitory effects of different toothpastes on demineralisation of incipient enamel lesions using a toothbrush simulator.
   Materials and Methods: Fifty enamel specimens were prepared from extracted human molars. The specimens were randomly assigned to the following groups (n = 10/group): 1. no treatment (control); 2. toothpaste containing arginine (ProRelief, Colgate;); 3. fluoride toothpaste (Pronamel, Sensodyne GlaxoSmithKlein); 4. tooth mousse containing casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACP) (Recaldent, GC); 5. toothpaste (Restore, Dr. Collins) containing bioactive glass (NovaMin, GlaxoSmithKlein). All specimens were exposed to pH cycling. The remineralising agents were applied to the samples with a toothbrush simulator for 2 min twice a day for five days. The weight percentage of mineral changes for the elements calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), sodium (Na) and silica (Si) were measured by SEM energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDX). SEM revealed properties of treated enamel surfaces. The data were analysed using one-way ANOVA.
   Results: Statistically significantly higher levels of Ca and P were found in all groups compared to the control (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: The toothpastes' efficacy of inhibiting demineralisation depended on the active ingredients in the respective toothpaste. The demineralisation inhibition efficacy of the tested toothpastes depended on the active ingredients in the toothpaste.

TI Deeply Felt Affect: The Emergence of Valence in Deep Active Inference
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The positive-negative axis of emotional valence has long been recognized as fundamental to adaptive behavior, but its origin and underlying function have largely eluded formal theorizing and computational modeling. Using deep active inference, a hierarchical inference scheme that rests on inverting a model of how sensory data are generated, we develop a principled Bayesian model of emotional valence. This formulation asserts that agents infer their valence state based on the expected precision of their action model-an internal estimate of overall model fitness ("subjective fitness"). This index of subjective fitness can be estimated within any environment and exploits the domain generality of second-order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs). We show how maintaining internal valence representations allows the ensuing affective agent to optimize confidence in action selection preemptively. Valence representations can in turn be optimized by leveraging the (Bayes-optimal) updating term for subjective fitness, which we label affective charge (AC). AC tracks changes in fitness estimates and lends a sign to otherwise unsigned divergences between predictions and outcomes. We simulate the resulting affective inference by subjecting an in silico affective agent to a T-maze paradigm requiring context learning, followed by context reversal. This formulation of affective inference offers a principled account of the link between affect, (mental) action, and implicit metacognition. It characterizes how a deep biological system can infer its affective state and reduce uncertainty about such inferences through internal action (i.e., top-down modulation of priors that underwrite confidence). Thus, we demonstrate the potential of active inference to provide a formal and computationally tractable account of affect. Our demonstration of the face validity and potential utility of this formulation represents the first step within a larger research program. Next, this model can be leveraged to test the hypothesized role of valence by fitting the model to behavioral and neuronal responses.

AB The current paper examines how compositional structures can self-organize in given neuro-dynamical systems when robot agents are forced to learn multiple goal-directed behaviors simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a basic model accounting for the roles of parietal-premotor interactions for representing skills for goal-directed behaviors. The basic model had been implemented in a set of robotics experiments employing different neural network architectures. The comparative reviews among those experimental results address the issues of local vs distributed representations in representing behavior and the effectiveness of level structures associated with different sensory-motor articulation mechanisms. It is concluded that the compositional structures can be acquired "organically" by achieving generalization in learning and by capturing the contextual nature of skilled behaviors under specific conditions. Furthermore, the paper discusses possible feedback for empirical neuroscience studies in the future. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Tailored cementitious materials, such as Ultra-High-Performance Concrete (UHPC), may significantly improve the blast resistance of structural panels. To understand and quantify the performance of UHPC panels subject to blast loading, four 1626- by 864- by 51-mm UHPC panels without steel rebar reinforcement were subjected to reflected impulse loads between 0.77 and 2.05 MPa-ms. The UHPC material was composed of a commercially available UHPC premix, high-range water reducing agent, 2% volume fraction of straight, smooth 14-mm-long by 0.185-mm-diameter fibers, and water. Experimental results determined that the UHPC panel fractured at a reflected impulse between 0.97 and 1.47 MPa-ms. These results were used to validate a multiscale model which accounts for structure and phenomena at two length scales: a multiple fiber length scale and a structural length scale. Within the multiscale model, a hand-shaking scheme conveys the energy barrier threshold and dissipated energy density from the model at the multiple fiber length scale to the model at the structural length scale. Together, the models at the two length scales account for energy dissipation through granular flow of the matrix, frictional pullout of the fibers, and friction between the interfaces. The simulated displacement and fracture patterns generated by the multiscale model are compared to experimental observations. This work is significant for three reasons: (1) new experimental data provide an upper and lower bound to the blast resistance of UHPC panels, (2) the multiscale model simulates the experimental results using readily available material properties and information regarding mesostructure attributes at two different length scales, and (3) by incorporating information from multiple length scales, the multiscale model can facilitate the design of UHPC materials to resist blast loading in ways not accessible using single length scale models.

AB To predict particle morphology, a theoretical description of drying of a single droplet containing insoluble nanoscale has been developed. Various possible morphological structures of the droplet/particle, depending on temperature, velocity, moisture content, porosity, and other droplet and drying agent properties, have been examined. Furthermore, the present contribution contains a qualitative description of the overall drying process and a mathematical model for the first stage of drying, including the transition period, which has been validated with good agreement to experimental data. The implementation and compatibility of the numerical solution using different solid diffusion coefficients is explained and compared. Moreover, the importance of choosing an appropriate solid diffusion coefficient is indicated. Finally, because the behavior of drying material and the characteristics of dry product are affected by the specifics of the drying process, an extensive parametric study has been conducted to determine the influence of different parameters on the drying kinetics and morphology of obtained dry particle.

AB Purpose: Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) enhances X-ray killing of human tumor cells in vitro and enhances tumor control when combined with radiotherapy (RT) in animal tumor models. In multiple Phase I studies, intravenous injection of TNF-alpha appeared to have severe systemic side effects. To overcome these limitations, we used a bispecific antibody (BAb) directed against carcinoembryonic antigen and human TNF-a to target this cytokine in human digestive carcinoma treated with simultaneous RT.
   Methods and Materials: We used human digestive carcinoma cell lines (colon cancer, LS174T, and pancreatic cancer, BxPC-3) to determine the interaction of TNF-alpha and RT on clonogenic cytotoxicity. Isobolograms were established to confirm additive or supra-additive effects between both treatments. LS174T and BxPC-3 cells were grafted subcutaneously at Day 0 into female nude mice (7-8 weeks old). When the tumors reached a volume of about 80 min(3), the mice were randomly assigned to treatment: Group 1, normal saline i.v. injection (control group); Group 2, TNF-alpha at 1 mug/i.v. injection; Group 3, BAb at 25 mug/i.v. injection; Group 4, BAb plus TNF-alpha (ratio 25 mug to 1 mug) i.v. injection; Group 5, local RT plus normal saline (0.5 Gy - min(-1)) at a total dose of 30 Gy delivered in five fractions; Group 6, local RT plus TNF-alpha injections 3 h before RT; Group 7, local RT plus BAb plus TNF-alpha co-injected 24 h before RT. Tumor growth delay was used as the end point for all groups.
   Results: In the LS174T experiments, TNF-alpha added 12 h before RT showed a statistically significant decrease in the survival fraction at 2 Gy compared with RT alone (0.23 vs. 0.42 Gy, p = 0.0017). These results were largely confirmed with the BxPC-3 cell lines (0.29 vs. 0.72, p < 0.00001). Isobolograms confirmed the additivity between TNF-alpha and RT in both cell lines. At 50% survival, the data points were within the envelope of additivity. In the LS174T and BxPC-3 xenografts, RT as a single agent (Group 5) slowed tumor progression compared with Group 1 (p < 0.027 and p = 0.00001, respectively). TNF-alpha alone, BAb alone, or BAb plus TNF-alpha (Groups 2, 3, and 4) had no effect. In the LS174T model, TNF-alpha plus RT enhanced the delay to reach 2000 mm(3) compared with RT alone but without statistical significance. This delay was significantly longer when BAb was added (p = 0.0033, for Group 6 vs. Group 7). In the BxPC-3 experiments, the median delay to reach 2000 mm(3) was similar between the RT and TNF-alpha plus RT groups (93 days). The use of our BAb in combination with TNF-alpha and RT dramatically enhanced this median delay (177 days,p = 0.0013). No body weight loss was observed in any group.
   Conclusion: Our data could be used as a solid preclinical rationale on which to base a clinical study of locally advanced pancreatic or rectal cancers in the near future. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB A hybrid polymer matrix composite coating, resistant to solid particle erosion inside sharp elbows, consisting interlocking chains of molecules with the ability to deflect the surface impact stress and to uniformly distribute stresses along the hard-ceramic reinforcement mixture surface was developed. Formulated mixture of ceramic reinforcement particles mixtures (alumina, tungsten carbide, and silicon carbide) with polymer coupling agents; to increase adhesion to the metal surface, led to 600-700 HVN in ternary and 500-550 HVN in binary mixtures. This behavior coincides with high shear strength of 70-76 MPa, Young's and shear modulus of 8.86 and 13.4 GPa in ternary 15%Al2O3-5%WC-10%SiC, respectively. The low erosion weight loss of 0.1% and small coefficient of friction near 0.18 indicates the significant wear resistance of the ternary sample. The electron microscopic micrographs determined the dense smooth coating surfaces with adhesive interfaces with the substrate.

AB A control strategy is employed that modifies the stochastic escape times from one basin of attraction to another in a model of a double-gyre flow. The system studied captures the behavior of a large class of fluid flows that circulate and have multiple almost invariant sets. In the presence of noise, a particle in one gyre may randomly switch to an adjacent gyre due to a rare large fluctuation. We show that large fluctuation theory may be applied for controlling autonomous agents in a stochastic environment, in fact leveraging the stochasticity to the advantage of switching between regions of interest and concluding that patterns may be broken or held over time as the result of noise. We demonstrate that a controller can effectively manipulate the probability of a large fluctuation; this demonstrates the potential of optimal control strategies that work in combination with the endemic stochastic environment. To demonstrate this, stochastic simulations and numerical continuation are employed to tie together experimental findings with predictions.

AB Understanding the aging mechanism of polypropylene (PP) is fundamental for the fabrication and application of PP-based materials. In this paper, we present our study in which we first used reactive molecular dynamics (RMD) simulations to explore the thermo-oxidative aging of PP in the presence of acetic acid or acetone. We studied the effects of temperature and oxygen on the aging process and discussed the formation pathways of typical small molecule products (H-2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6). The effect of two infection agents, acetic acid and acetone, on the aging reaction was analyzed emphatically. The simulation results showed that acetone has a weak impact on accelerating the aging process, while acetic acid has a significant effect, consistent with previous experimental studies. By tracking the simulation trajectories, both acetic acid and acetone produced small active free radicals to further react with other fragment products, thus accelerating the aging process. The first reaction step of acetic acid is often the shedding of the H atom on the hydroxyl group, while the reaction of acetone is often the shedding of the H atom or the methyl. The latter requires higher energy at lower temperatures. This is why the acceleration effect of acetone for the thermo-oxidative aging of PP was not so significant compared to acetic acid in the experimental temperature (383.15 K).

AB Fifty years after the advent of antibiotics for clinical use, the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial meningitis remain high, The unfavourable clinical outcome is often due to intracranial complications including cerebrovascular insults, raised intracranial pressure, hydrocephalus, and brain edema, Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known effector molecules in the antimicrobial armature of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear phagocytes. However, over the last decade, there has been a substantial body of work implicating a central role of ROS in the development of intracranial complications and brain damage in bacterial meningitis, Recently, it also became evident that reactive nitrogen species (RNS), especially nitric oxide, are important mediators of meningitis-associated pathophysiological changes, at least during the early phase of the disease, There is now substantial evidence that much of the oxidative injury associated by simultaneous production of superoxide and nitric oxide is mediated by the strong oxidant peroxynitrite, ROS and peroxynitrite can be cytotoxic via a number of independent mechanisms, Their cytotoxic effects include initiation of lipid peroxidation and induction of DNA single strand breakage. Damaged DNA activates poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Recent experimental data propose a role of lipid peroxidation and PARP activation in the development of meningitis-associated intracranial complications and brain injury. Agents which interfere with the production of ROS and peroxynitrite, as well as with PARR activation and lipid peroxidation may represent novel, therapeutic strategies to limit meningitis-associated brain damage, and, thus, to improve the outcome of this serious disease.

AB Polyneuropathy is defined as a simultaneous malfunction of several peripheral nerves, which could be a side effect of a cancer therapy (using cyclophosphamide) as well. In the daily use, it is very important to know the kinetics and metabolism of anticancer drugs because this way we can estimate their undesirable consequences to avoid the unwanted complications. Nowadays, the application of DSC in diagnosis of different diseases using blood compounds is increasing; therefore, the purpose of recent study was to introduce at the first time the DSC in the detection of cyclophosphamide-induced changes in plasma and red blood cells in case of an experimental animal model. Guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus, n = 60, in 12 different groups) underwent to cyclophosphamide treatment administrated intraperitoneally with the dose comparable to the human dosage. At the end of treatments, the animals were euthanized, and the experimental samples (plasma end red blood cells) were analyzed by a SETARAM Micro DSC-II calorimeter. The denaturation temperatures and the calorimetric enthalpies were calculated from the heat flow curves. Our results exhibited a dose-dependent difference between thermal parameters of untreated and treated samples, demonstrating that DSC is applicable in this field too. After deconvolution of DSC scans, the changes could be assigned to the attacked compounds. Recently published papers call the attention for this technique more frequently in the medical diagnosis because this way from small amount of sample very quickly and economically possible to detect and predict the expected and unwanted side effects of chemotherapeutic agents.

AB Hydrogels are mechanically stabilized through the action of external agents which induce the formation of crosslinks in the polymer network as a consequence of transport and reactive mechanisms. Crosslinking increases the stiffness of the construct, produces inelastic deforma-tions in the polymer network and interacts with the swelling capacity of hydrogels. The control of this process is hence crucial for fulfilling functional criteria in several technological fields, like drug-delivery or bioprinting. Nevertheless, experimental approaches for monitoring the crosslinking kinetics with the required resolution are currently missing. The development of new computational models in the field might open the way to novel investigation tools. This paper presents a thermodynamically consistent chemo-mechanical model in large deformation for reactive-diffusive mechanisms occurring during crosslinking in alginate hydrogels. The system accounts for shrinking and swelling effects, fluid movements, as well as the reaction kinetics of calcium-induced crosslinking. Crosslinks alter mechanical and diffusive properties in the hydrogel. Moreover, on the basis of thermodynamic arguments, internal stresses directly affect the crosslinking kinetics, revealing a two-way coupling between mechanics and chemistry. The model is implemented in a finite element framework, considering a monolithic coupling between chemical transport and mechanics. The computational framework allows characterizing the (experimentally inaccessible) heterogeneous distribution of mechano-chemical quantities and properties in the hydrogel. Parametric campaigns of simulations are presented to investigate hydrogels' behaviour and compare numerical outcomes with available experimental evidence.

AB We propose an integrated learning by experience and demonstration algorithm that operates on the basis of both an objective scalar measure of performance and a demonstrated behaviour. The application of the method to two qualitatively different experimental scenarios involving simulated mobile robots demonstrates its efficacy. Indeed, the analysis of the obtained results shows that the robots trained through this integrated algorithm develop solutions that are functionally better than those obtained by using either a pure learning by demonstration, or a pure learning by experience algorithm. This is because the algorithm drives the learning process toward solutions that are qualitatively similar to the demonstration, but leaves the learning agent free to differentiate from the demonstration when this turns out to be necessary to maximize performance.

AB We apply a low-order dynamical model for simulating the conversion of bubbling bed reactors. The model includes mass-transfer and first-order reactions between the gas and solids and accounts for upward motion and interactions between bubbles. On a time-average basis, we get reasonably good agreement between the model and experimental measurements from an ozone decomposition reactor. The collective result of the bubble dynamics is a type of global emergent behavior characterized by the formation of a pulsing central channel of high void fraction and high gas flow. These pulsations appear to be similar in character to those typically seen in dynamic pressure measurements of bubbling beds. We use our model to explore the impact of these pulsations on reactor conversion.

AB Alkali activated lightweight mortars, obtained by room temperature activation of coal fly ash, were studied as passive fire protection systems for steel elements. Physical, mechanical and thermal properties were investigated as a function of the compositional Si/Al molar ratio and of the amount of lightweight aggregate and foaming agent. Experimental findings were used as input data to assess their fire resistance by finite volume simulations. Results pointed out that the optimized alkali activated lightweight mortars are able to outperform alternative commercial cement-based mortars, thus representing a promising technology.

AB Studies on the kinetics of neodymium transport through a bulk liquid membrane, in apparatus consisting of a source, membrane and receiving phases, have been carried out. Different experimental variables, such as the pH, carrier, metal ion and stripping agent concentrations, have been explored. However, the kinetic and solvent extraction methods were compared to determine the equilibrium extraction constant. Complexation mechanism models have been developed. The kinetic behaviour of the ion transport based on forward and backward extraction processes with the consideration of controlled parameters was predicted. The ion transport of neodymium in the receiving or membrane phase envisages the determination of forward and backward extraction rate constants.

AB Adhesion is attracting increasing interest in the aerospace field since composite materials have become, together with aluminium alloys, the main structural materials for aircraft primary structures. Nano-graphite was demonstrated to improve the mechanical performance of several polymers used as composite matrices. In this work Single Lap Joints (SLJs) of unidirectional composite laminates were manufactured, tested and simulated: two families of specimens were investigated and compared, one joined using conventional epoxy resin, the other joined with an adhesive obtained mixing the same epoxy resin with nano-graphite particles. The dispersion of expanded and sonicated graphene stacks (EGS, 3% wt) in the epoxy matrix was obtained by the swelling method, dispersing first the filler in acetone and then mixing it with the epoxy oligomers. Finally the solvent was evaporated and the filler-epoxy mixture was degassed under vacuum before adding an amine curing agent in a stoichiometric quantity. The research demonstrates the superior mechanical properties of the adhesive with the addition of nano-graphite through experimental characterization of its behaviour in terms of strength and energy absorption. Finite element numerical simulations have been carried out using the Cohesive Zone Model (CZM) element, obtaining as parameters the maximum shear stress and the critical fracture energy for the two adhesives. A good correlation between numerical and experimental results has been achieved and the criteria for developing reliable and accurate non-linear models of the adhesive failure have been established.

AB This article puts party strategies at the centre of the analysis of radical right-wing challengers' fortunes. It extends most previous studies because the shifts of both established and populist parties are envisioned as a complex dynamic system, in which party leaders adaptively learn from feedback and voters continually update their party choices. We argue that agent-based modelling is a fruitful tool to systematically map out the implications of hypotheses on the behaviour of parties, voters and their interactions. Our argument is empirically illustrated by using computer simulations to examine the remarkable rise of the Dutch anti-immigration party PVV. Outcomes reveal that an adaptive strategy leads to large shifts towards the socio-economic left and considerably boost its electoral strength. The more general contribution of this article is that we show how to unravel the mechanisms by which flexible populist parties can find winning positions.

TI RECTAL THIOPENTAL COMPARED WITH INTRAMUSCULAR MEPERIDINE, PROMETHAZINE,
   AND CHLORPROMAZINE FOR PEDIATRIC SEDATION
SO ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Study objectives:  We studied the hypothesis that rectal thiopental is an effective agent for emergency department pediatric sedation and may have advantages over a more traditional regimen.
   Design:  Rectal thiopental 25 mg/kg was compared with the combination of meperidine 2 mg/kg, promethazine 1 mg/kg, and chlorpromazine 1 mg/kg in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study.
   Type of participants:  Children between 18 months and 6 years of age presenting to our teaching hospital ED for laceration repair were entered after the clinical decision was made to sedate.  Patients with altered sensorium, medical contraindications to sedation, or medication allergy were excluded.
   Interventions:  After informed consent, each patient received IM injection (drug combination or placebo) and rectal suspension (rectal thiopental or placebo) simultaneously.
   Measurements and main results:  Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and pediatric Glasgow Coma Scores were recorded before and every 15 minutes after sedation until discharge.  Intradermal lidocaine and suturing began when the patient appeared adequately sedated, and response was numberically scored.  Patients were discharged when able to stand.  Twenty-nine patients 34 +/- 13 months old were studied.  Fifteen patients received rectal thiopental, and 14 received the drug combination.  Analysis using the Wilcoxon two-sample test revealed no differences in age, sex, weight, or wound location between groups.  The time course of sedation was different for the two treatment regimens.  At 15 and 30 minutes after administration, patients who received rectal thiopental were more deeply sedated than those who received the drug combination, as evidenced by significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scores (P < .05).  Accordingly, time from medication administration to suturing was 29 +/- 12 minutes in the thiopental group and 54 +/- 33 minutes (P < .01) in the drug combination group.  Patients in the thiopental group also recovered more quickly and were discharged approximately one-half hour earlier than those in the drug combination group (89 +/- 25 vs 120 +/- 44 minutes, P < .05).  No difference in response to lidocaine injection or suturing was demonstrated between the groups.  Laceration repair time was comparable between the groups.  There were eight sedation failures (three of 15 in thiopental group and five of 14 in drug combination group, P = NS).  Vital signs remained stable, no adverse reactions occurred, and no patient had decreased oxygen saturation to less than 95%.
   Conclusion:  Rectal thiopental is superior to this drug combination for pediatric sedation because it can be administered painlessly, has a more rapid onset and offset of action, and is of equal safety and efficacy at the dosage studied.

ID STRENGTH
AB In this study, the bond behavior of corroded reinforced concrete (RC) was investigated by conducting pull-out tests on RC specimens with different corrosion crack widths. The confinement stress of concrete was evaluated by an expansion simulation using a non-explosive demolition agent, from which a confinement stress equation for RC with corrosion cracking was proposed. Bond strength linearly decreased with decreasing confinement stress in the concrete. The rate of decrease was independent of longitudinal corrosion crack width at the concrete surface, cover thickness, and reinforcement diameter. Furthermore, from the relationship between bond strength and confinement stress in concrete, equations for predicting bond stress and slip curve were proposed. Overall, the predicted values agreed well with the experimental results of other studies.

AB Cemented paste backfill (CPB) has been extensively used as a popular mine fill system for underground mining operations. Understanding the CPB's in situ properties as an element of ground support is indeed really important for developing a well-organised mine design in terms of costs and security. In this paper, a comprehensive experimental work was conducted to better understand the effect of stope depth on in situ behaviour and performance of CPB having three different binding agents (ordinary Portland cement alone, slag-based cement and fly ash-based cement) over different curing times. A stope depth of 0 (it replicates the stope's top), 5, 10, 15 and 20m (it replicates the stope's bottom) were virtually simulated by using an improved laboratory set-up, escorting with conventional plastic moulds. Results show that the highest compressive strength is obtained from CPB having slag-based cement. The strength of CPB increases with increasing stope depth mainly due to resulting improved geotechnical properties, such as reduced water content, degree of saturation and porosity as well as increased specific surface area retained at the bottom of a simulated stope. Geochemical testing shows that sulphate SO4-2 and calcium Ca contents increase with increasing curing time and reduce with increasing stope depth. As a critical point, a number of experimental relationships considered typically for different curing times, overburden pressure, arching stress and binder contents within CPB material were expressed and discussed.

TI Single-Stage Stimulation of Anhydrite-Rich Carbonate Rocks Using
   Chelating Agent: An Experimental and Modeling Investigation
SO SPE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID KINETICS
AB Calcium sulfate (anhydrite) exists in most of the carbonate reservoirs, and its content can reach more than 20%. The high content of anhydrite affects the efficiency of the acidizing process because of the low solubility of calcium sulfate in different acids. Carbonate stimulation, matrix acidizing, or acid fracturing is carried out mostly using hydrochloric acid (HCl)-based fluids. The solubility of calcium sulfate in HCl or HCl-based fluids and organic acids is very low.
   In this study, a new formulation was developed to stimulate carbonate rocks with high anhydrite content. A formulation was developed to dissolve both anhydrite and carbonate at the same time. Anhydrite dissolution was achieved by converting anhydrite to calcite using the newly developed formulation. This treatment can be conducted in a single stage, and the formulation consists of a high pll chelating agent such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in addition to potassium carbonate as a converter. Coreflooding experiments were conducted for carbonate rocks with varying anhydrite content. The effluent samples of the coreflooding experiments were analyzed for cations and anions concentration using inductively coupled (IC) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) measurements. Computed tomography scans were conducted to show the wormholes generated in the samples. Rock mineralogical analysis using X-ray diffraction, thin section, and the QEMSCAN (R) automated mineralogy solution (FEI Company, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) was conducted as well. The reaction kinetics were investigated using a rotating disk apparatus (RDA) using a disk that consists of almost 24% anhydrite and 71% dolomite. Also, a two-scale continuum model was built to simulate the reaction between the new formulation and carbonate rocks. The model could capture the experimental outcomes such as the number of pore volumes (PV) to break through and the shape of the wormholes. This provided confidence in the reaction parameters obtained because the model could reproduce the experimental outcomes.
   Coreflooding experiments showed that the new formulations were very effective in stimulating carbonate rocks with high anhydrite content in a single stage. The effluent analysis showed high sulfate concentration that indicates the dissolution of anhydrite compared to conventional acid treatments. Reaction kinetics results showed that the new formulation increased the reaction rate with anhydrite through a mass transfer reaction regime. The model reproduced the wormholing behavior obtained from the experiments, indicating that the branched wormhole was due to the anhydrite conversion.

AB Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease. They propagate in the Yangtze River valley of China. The spread of the disease is solely through a middle-agent named oncomelania, so the spread of schistosomiasis by oncomelania can be controlled by properly designing water intakes which prevent oncomelania from entering the farming land or residential areas. In this paper, a successful design process is reported and a new oncomelania-free intake device is demonstrated in the laboratory. The design of the new intake is based on a sound research program in which an extensive experimental studies have been carded out to gain knowledge of oncomelania eco-hydraulic behaviors and a detailed flow field information is obtained through CFD simulation.

AB Wild-type phosphotriesterase (PTE) preferentially hydrolyzes the R-P enantiomers of the nerve agents sarin (GB) and cyclosarin (GF) and their chromophoric analogues. The active site of PTE can be subdivided into three binding pockets that have been denoted as the small, large, and leaving group pockets based on high-resolution crystal structures. The sizes and shapes of these pockets dictate the substrate specificity and stereoselectivity for catalysis. Mutants of PTE that exhibit substantial changes in substrate specificity and the ability to differentiate between chiral substrates have been prepared. For example, the G60A mutant is stereoselective for the hydrolysis of the R-P enantiomer of the chromophoric analogues of sarin and cyclosarin, whereas the H254G/H257W/L303T (GWT) mutant reverses the stereoselectivity for the enantiomers of these two compounds. Molecular dynamics simulations and high-resolution X-ray structures identified the correlations between structural changes in the active site and the experimentally determined kinetic parameters for substrate hydrolysis. New high-resolution structures were determined for the H257Y/L303T (YT), I106G/F132G/H257Y (GGY), and H254Q/H257F (QF) mutants of PTE. Molecular dynamics calculations were conducted using the S-P and R-P enantiomers of the analogues for sarin and cyclosarin for the wild-type PTE and the G60A, YT, GGY, QF, and GWT mutants. The experimental stereoselectivity correlated nicely with the difference in the computed angle of attack for the nucleophilic hydroxide relative to the phenolic leaving group of the substrate.

AB The core of this work is the definition of an agent-based model for a simple Luhmann economy based on publications of Niklas Luhmann. Using an implementation on a default personal computer the behaviour of the model is studied when assumptions regarding initial conditions are made. Fuzzy-c-means clustering is used as visualisation aid. The impact of the observation horizon (a model parameter determining how far agents can see) is studied interactively. Solution paths of the Luhmann economy originating from an initial endowment to equilibrium (when the economy settles down) are studied. The impact of model parameters determining the unevenness regarding the initial distribution of wealth is studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Niklas Luhmann's hypothesis, that the economy starts from and produces further inequality in order to continue (see Luhmann 1988., p. 112) could be reproduced by computer simulation. The main characteristic of the approach is the consideration of the cohesive structure of communication (i.e. one communicative act - many understanding observers) also prominent in Dunbar (1996, pp. 192-207). The model gives directions how to model further aspects of Niklas Luhmann's theory.

TI Sophisticated Inference
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Active inference offers a first principle account of sentient behavior, from which special and important cases-for example, reinforcement learning, active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design-can be derived. Active inference finesses the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior preferences by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of (Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In this letter, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference using a recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering beliefs about "what would happen if I did that" to "what I would believe about what would happen if I did that." The recursive form of the free energy functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states as opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme using numerical simulations of deep decision problems.

AB By using a novel molecular surface-imprinting technique, "synchronously graft-polymerizing and imprinting" method established by our group, a pesticide molecule surface-imprinted material was prepared successfully for the removal of pesticide residues from water. The micron-sized silica gel particles were first surface-modified with coupling agent gamma-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (AMPS), obtaining the modified particles AMPS-SiO2, onto whose surfaces primary amino groups were introduced. The anionic monomer sodium p-styrenesulfonate (SSS) was used as functional monomer and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) was used as crosslinker. In aqueous solution, the monomer molecules were arranged around the template molecule, atrazine molecule that is an extensively used herbicide, through electrostatic interaction. By initiating of the redox surface-initiating system of -NH2/S2O (8) (2-) , the graft/cross-linking polymerization of SSS on SiO2 particles and the surface imprinting of atrazine molecule were simultaneously carried out, forming atrazine molecule surface-imprinted material MIP-PSSS/SiO2. With propoxur and pirimicarb, which are also two pesticides as two contrast substances, the recognition performance of the atrazine molecule surface-imprinted material MIP-PSSS/SiO2 was investigated in depth. The experimental results show that MIP-PSSS/SiO2 particles possess special recognition selectivity and excellent binding affinity for atrazine. The binding capacity of atrazine on MIPPSSS/ SiO2 particles can get up to 61mg/g, and relative to propoxur and pirimicarb, the selectivity coefficients of MIPPSSS/ SiO2 for atrazine are 9.69 and 8.79, respectively.

TI Binding of Two Tetrasulfophthalocyanines (Fe(III) and Metal-Free) to

DE Tetrasulfophthalocyanines; Lysozyme; Binding process; Fluorescence;
   Computational studies
AB The interactions between tetrasulfophthalocyanines and lysozyme were studied using fluorescence spectroscopic and computational analyses. Lysozyme has been found to be widely studied as an anticancer agent, however, there are few reports of its interaction with phthalocyanines. Fe(III) tetrasulfophthalocyanine (FeTSPc) and free base tetrasulfophthalocyanine (TSPc) used in this study, were synthesized by our research group. Experimental results suggested that the metalled complex FeTSPc has a much higher affinity than TSPc. The binding stoichiometry between each tetrasulfophthalocyanine and lysozyme was 1:1. Stern-Volmer analysis suggested that the fluorescence quenching proceedes through a static process. Binding thermodynamics (Delta G, Delta H and Delta S) confirmed that mainly hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and electrostatic forces are responsible for the binding process. We carried out molecular dynamics simulations, molecular docking, and binding energy calculations. Molecular dynamics simulations yielded the most populated cluster of lysozyme structures, and a representative structure from this cluster was used for the docking studies with these phthalocyanines. 1000 poses were generated for each ligand. The strudtures of the resulting complexes revealed that Arg 73 and Arg 112 are important for the binding affinity of the tetrasulfophthalocyanines, generating mainly an electrostatic favorable environment for the SO3- groups. In addition, hydrophobic contacts were involved with Trp 62, Trp 63 and Trp 108, explaining the fluorescence quenching observed experimentally. Binding energies were determined for these models, confirming that the interactions with lysozyme were more favorable for FeTSPc compared to TSPc. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms is relevant to characterize the nature of tetrasulfophthalocyanines in photodynamic therapy.

AB The new layered silicate ERS-12 was synthesized using tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) as source of silica and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMA-OH) as a structure directing agent. ERS-12 crystallizes also as germanosilicate, but not as alumino- and titanosilicate. Structure determination of as-synthesized ERS-12 was performed using alpha combined approach of experimental and molecular modeling techniques. It is composed by a regular stacking of ferrierite layers, with the TMA cations located in the interlayer region. Rietveld refinement of the high resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXPD) pattern of as-synthesized ERS-12 structure was firstly carried out in the monoclinic P2(1)/m space group; however, to avoid the presence of linear Si-O-Si angles, final refinement was. performed in the acentric P2(1) space group, which gave unit cell parameters a = 10.5606 (2), b = 13.9692 (1), c = 7.4148(1) Angstrom, beta = 97.981(2)degrees and agreement factors of R-p = 8.9%, R-wp = 12.4% and R-F(2) = 12.2%. Upon calcination, a remarkable change of the SXPD pattern occurred with the contemporarily presence of sharp and asymmetrically broadened reflections, indicative of the formation of a disordered structure; this was confirmed by the DIFFaX study carried out in order to evaluate the stacking sequences of ferrierite layers. The simulation suggested that the layers do not fully condense upon calcinations to form a completely connected framework. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The synthesis of well-defined functional nanoparticles for the encapsulation of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs is described. Nanopartides were built from amphiphilic copolymers consisting of P(OEG-A) homopolymers chain extended with vinyl benzyl chloride (VBC) and pentafluorophenyl acrylate (PFP-A) comonomers. Subsequently, the pendant chlorine atoms, introduced into the chains by VBC units, were substituted using sodium methanethiosulfonate, yielding copolymer chains with methanethiosulfonate (MTS) pendant functionality. The thiol/MTS exchange chemistry afforded by the MTS groups was then used to introduce different functional groups by reacting with a range of thiols. These copolymers were self-assembled in water yielding nanopartides with sizes of similar to 20 nm. The activated esters in the copolymer were used to cross-link the nanoparticles with difunctional amino compounds (cross-linkers). A cross-linker bearing an acid cleavable bond (ketal) was used to generate pH-sensitive core shell nanoparticles. Drug encapsulation and release was modeled using hydrophobic (Nile Red) and hydrophilic (thiol-modified fluorescein isothiocyanate, FITC) dye molecules. The release of each dye was monitored using UV-vis spectroscopy, demonstrating the possibility of selective release of single dye or the simultaneous release of both dyes depending on the experimental stimuli. An in vitro study confirmed that the nanoparticles were nontoxic to the NIH-3T3 cell line. Cell uptake analysis by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy indicated a higher uptake for cross-linked nanopartides than for non-cross-linked nanoparticles.

AB In situ mobility reduction resulting from the addition of water-soluble polymers to subsurface remedial fluid formulations has the potential to significantly improve the delivery and subsurface distribution of remediation agents within heterogeneous contaminated aquifer systems. However, the increased viscosity, non-Newtonian rheology, competing retention and acceleration mechanisms, and the potential for these fluids to reduce media permeability because of mechanical filtration of these large polymer molecules complicate treatment design calculations and often necessitate numerical simulation for purposeful evaluation and application of this technology. In this paper, laboratory and computational methods are presented that were used to characterize bulk fluid and porous media transport properties of xanthan gum biopolymer-amended fluids for the purpose of facilitating numerical simulation. A detailed discussion of polymerized fluid transport mechanisms and input parameters for simulating polymer transport using the University of Texas Chemical Composition (UTCHEM) simulator is provided. The simulator was used to validate the independently derived input parameters against the results of a five-layer, two-dimensional (2D) sand tank experiment. An overall 74% improvement in sweep efficiency was observed for the polymer-amended fluid within this sand pack, relative to the nonamended case. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000616.

AB Background: Endangered plant species are a vital resource for exploring novel drug prototypes. A Korean endangered plant Rhododendron brachycarpum G. Don is a broad-leaved shrub native to northern Korea and central Japan. The high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) could be a specific target for the discovery of novel antiseptic agents.
   Methods: Gauge-invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) NMR chemical shift calculations were applied for investigation of stereochemical details with accuracy improved by application of DP4 analysis. In vitro antiseptic mechanisms were investigated utilizing immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and cell-cell adhesion assay. Cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) operation was employed to evaluate in vivo potential alleviating severe sepsis and septic shock.
   Results: The first bicyclic megastigmane glucoside rhododendroside A (1) along with known megastigmane glucosides (2-5) were isolated from the leaves of R. brachycarpum. The structure of 1 was established by NMR analysis as well as comparison of the experimental chemical shifts with those of computed values employing DP4 application. In the CLP operation model that simulates severe sepsis, rhododendroside A (1) improved the survival rate up to 60%.
   Conclusions: Our results exhibit that R. brachycarpum may produce a unique scaffold that is developed into a drug lead mitigating HMGB1-induced vascular pro-inflammatory stimuli and thus alleviating severe sepsis and related manifestations.
   General significance: Discovery of new drug leads would warrant conservation efforts of endangered species. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To determine the decrease of drug absorption when syrup of ipecac is administered at various times within one hour of drug ingestion. Methods: Ten healthy human volunteers were recruited for a four-limbed randomized crossover study. The three experimental limbs consisted of administration of 30 mt syrup of ipecac, at 5, 30, or 60 minutes after ingestion of 3900 mg acetaminophen as 12 x 325 mg tablets with 250 mt room temperature water. The fourth limb served as control. Blood samples were drawn at 0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0 hours after analgesic ingestion for serum acetaminophen concentration determination by high-performance liquid chromatography. Repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests were used for group comparisons. Results: The area under the serum concentration vs time curve was (mean +/- SD) 206 +/- 48, 67 +/- 37, 183 +/- 78, and 162 +/- 47 mg/L for control, 5, 30, and 60 minutes, respectively. This corresponds to decreases in bioavailability of 67, 11, and 21%. Only the 5-minunte group differed significantly from control (p < 0.05). Sedation was observed as a significant adverse effect of ipecac administration. Conclusions: Our data do not support benefit from ipecac administration at 30 minutes and beyond. Our data suggest that benefit is lost at some point between 5 and 30 minutes. The sedative effect of ipecac may confound the observation of patients who have ingested sedative hypnotic agents.

AB During last decades, studies on asset pricing models witnessed a paradigm shift from rational expectation and representative agent to an alternative, behavioral view, where agents are heterogeneous and boundedly rational. In this paper, we model the financial market as an interaction of two types of boundedly rational investors - fundamentalists and chartists. We examine the dynamics of the market price and market behavior, which depend on investors' behavior and the interaction of the two types of investors. Numerical simulations of the corresponding stochastic model demonstrate that the model is able to replicate the stylized facts of financial time series, in particular the long-term dependence (long memory) of asset return volatilities. We further investigate the source of the long memory according to asset pricing mechanism of our model, and provide evidences of long memory by applying the modified R/S analysis. Our results demonstrate that the key parameter that has impact on the long memory is the speed of the price adjustment of the market maker at the equilibrium of demand and supply.

AB This paper aims to analyze the GPS traces of 258 volunteers in order to obtain a better understanding of both the human mobility patterns and the mechanism. We report the regular and scaling properties of human mobility for several aspects, and importantly we identify its Levy flight characteristic, which is consistent with those from previous studies. We further assume two factors that may govern the Levy flight property: (1) the scaling and hierarchical properties of the purpose clusters which serve as the underlying spatial structure, and (2) the individual preferential behaviors. To verify the assumptions, we implement an agent-based model with the two factors, and the simulated results do indeed capture the same Levy flight pattern as is observed. In order to enable the model to reproduce more mobility patterns, we add to the model a third factor: the jumping factor, which is the probability that one person may cancel their regular mobility schedule and explore a random place. With this factor, our model can cover a relatively wide range of human mobility patterns with scaling exponent values from 1.55 to 2.05.

AB Brain dopaminergic system has a crucial role in the etiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Parkinson's disease, depression, and schizophrenia. Several dopaminergic drugs are used to treat these pathologies, but many problems are attributed to these therapies. Within this context, the search for new more efficient dopaminergic agents with less adverse effects represents a vast research field. The aim of the present study was to synthesize N-[2-(4,5-dihydroxyphenyl)-methyl-ethyl]-4,5-dihydroxy-2-aminoindan hydrobromide (3), planned to be a dopamine ligand, and to evaluate its dopaminergic action profile. This compound was assayed as a diastereoisomeric mixture in two experimental models: stereotyped behavior (gnaw) and renal urinary response, after central administration. The pharmacological results showed that compound 3 significantly blocked the apomorphine-induced stereotypy and dopamine-induced diuresis and natriuresis in rats. Thus, compound 3 demonstrated an inhibitory effect on dopaminergic-induced behavior and renal action. N-[2-(-Methyl-ethyl)]-4,5-dihydroxy-2-aminoindan hydrobromide (4) was previously reported as an inotropic agent, and in the present work it was also re-evaluated as a diastereoisomeric mixture for its possible central action on the behavior parameters such as stereotypy and dopamine-induced diuresis and natriuresis in rats. Our results indicate that compound 4 produces an agonistic response, possibly through dopaminergic mechanisms. To better understand the experimental results we performed molecular dynamics simulations of two complexes: compound 3/D(2)DAR (dopamine receptor) and compound 4/D(2)DAR. The differential binding mode obtained for these complexes could explain the antagonist and agonist activity obtained for compounds 3 and 4, respectively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The characterization results of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of Au nanorings (NRs) with optical coherence tomography (OCT) are first demonstrated. Then, the diffusion behaviors of Au NRs in mouse liver samples tracked with OCT are shown. For such research, aqueous solutions of Au NRs with two different localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) wavelengths are prepared and characterized. Their LSPR-induced extinction cross sections at 1310 nm are estimated with OCT scanning of solution droplets on coverslip to show reasonably consistent results with the data at individual LSPR wavelengths and at 1310 nm obtained from transmission measurements of Au NR solutions and numerical simulations. The resonant and non-resonant Au NRs are delivered into mouse liver samples for tracking Au NR diffusion in the samples through continuous OCT scanning for one hour. With resonant Au NRs, the average A-mode scan profiles of OCT scanning at different delay times clearly demonstrate the extension of strong backscattering depth with time. The calculation of speckle variance among successive OCT scanning images, which is related to the local transport speed of Au NRs, leads to the illustrations of downward propagation and spreading of major Au NR motion spot with time.

The CATS model is then simulated over the period 1996-2001. Using alternative validation techniques, the simulations' results are ex post validated respect to the actual data. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

ID DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; MOTION
AB This paper describes an individual-based model for simulating the swarming behavior of prey in the presence of predators. Predators and prey are represented as agents that interact through radial force laws. The prey form swarms through attractive and repulsive forces. The predators interact with the prey through an anti-Newtonian force, which is a nonconservative force that acts in the same direction for both agents. Several options for forces between predators are explored. The resulting equations are solved numerically and the dynamics are described in the context of the swarm's ability to realistically avoid the predators. The goal is to reproduce swarm behavior that has been observed in nature with the simplest possible model.

AB Most health studies focus on one health outcome and examine the influence of one or multiple risk factors. However, in reality, various pathways, interactions, and associations exist not only between risk factors and health outcomes but also among the risk factors and among health outcomes. The advance of system science methods, Big Data, and accumulated knowledge allows us to examine how multiple risk factors influence multiple health outcomes at multiple levels (termed a 3M study). Using the study of neighborhood environment and health as an example, I elaborate on the significance of 3M studies. 3M studies may lead to a significantly deeper understanding of the dynamic interactions among risk factors and outcomes and could help us design better interventions that may be of particular relevance for upstream interventions. Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a promising method in the 3M study, although its potentials are far from being fully explored. Future challenges include the gap of epidemiologic knowledge and evidence, lack of empirical data sources, and the technical challenges of ABM.

AB Two-part models are quite well established in the economic literature, since they resemble accurately a principal-agent type model, where homogeneous, observable, counted outcomes are subject to a (prior, exogenous) selection choice. The first decision can be represented by a binary choice model, modeled using a probit or a logit link; the second can be analyzed through a truncated discrete distribution such as a truncated Poisson, negative binomial, and so on. Only recently, a particular attention has been devoted to the extension of two-part models to handle longitudinal data. The authors discuss a semi-parametric estimation method for dynamic two-part models and propose a comparison with other, well-established alternatives. Heterogeneity sources that influence the first level decision process, that is, the decision to use a certain service, are assumed to influence also the (truncated) distribution of the positive outcomes. Estimation is carried out through an EM algorithm without parametric assumptions on the random effects distribution. Furthermore, the authors investigate the extension of the finite mixture representation to allow for unobservable transition between components in each of these parts. The proposed models are discussed using empirical as well as simulated data. The Canadian Journal of Statistics 38: 197-216; 2010 (C) 2010 Statistical Society of Canada

ID ADAPTIVE EXPECTATIONS; EQUILIBRIA; DYNAMICS; DEMAND; COBWEB
AB In this paper, we investigate the dynamic properties of an overlapping generations' model with capital accumulation, in which agents work in both periods of life. We compare three different expectation mechanisms: perfect foresight, myopic foresight, and adaptive expectations, focusing, in particular, on this last one. We show that the steady state is the same under each mechanism, and we prove its global stability for perfectly foresighted agents. After investigating local stability conditions under myopic expectations, we study in detail the case of adaptive expectations. We show that, under both reduced rationality mechanisms, if the share of time devoted to labor in the second period of life is large enough, periodic and complex dynamics can occur. Moreover, deepening the investigation through numerical simulations, we study the global stability behavior under adaptive expectations. Such complex scenarios also include the coexistence between the stable steady state and a periodic or chaotic attractor, giving rise to multistability, which does not arise under myopic expectations. Finally, we provide some considerations about the possibility for the agents to improve their forecasts by observing the forecasting error time series. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

AB Computer models of disease take a systems biology approach toward understanding host-pathogen interactions. In particular, data driven computer model calibration is the basis for inference of immunological and pathogen parameters, assessment of model validity, and comparison between alternative models of immune or pathogen behavior. In this paper we describe the calibration and analysis of an agent-based model of Leishmania major infection. A model of macrophage loss following uptake of necrotic tissue is proposed to explain macrophage depletion following peak infection. Using Gaussian processes to approximate the computer code, we perform a sensitivity analysis to identify important parameters and to characterize their influence on the simulated infection. The analysis indicates that increasing growth rate can favor or suppress pathogen loads, depending on the infection stage and the pathogen's ability to avoid detection. Subsequent calibration of the model against previously published biological observations suggests that L major has a relatively slow growth rate and can replicate for an extended period of time before damaging the host cell.

AB This paper describes the application of a large-scale active learning method to characterize the parameter space of a computational agent-based model developed to investigate the impact of CommunityRx, a clinical information-based health intervention that provides patients with personalized information about local community resources to meet basic and self-care needs. The diffusion of information about community resources and their use is modeled via networked interactions and their subsequent effect on agents' use of community resources across an urban population. A random forest model is iteratively fitted to model evaluations to characterize the model parameter space with respect to observed empirical data. We demonstrate the feasibility of using high-performance computing and active learning model exploration techniques to characterize large parameter spaces; by partitioning the parameter space into potentially viable and non-viable regions, we rule out regions of space where simulation output is implausible to observed empirical data. We argue that such methods are necessary to enable model exploration in complex computational models that incorporate increasingly available micro-level behavior data. We provide public access to the model and high-performance computing experimentation code.

AB The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition was a process of cultural and biological replacement, considered a turning point in human evolutionary history. Various hypotheses have been used to explain the disappearance of Neanderthals from Eurasia. However, very few studies have explicitly examined the causative role of demography on Neanderthal and anatomically modern humans (AMH) interaction. Here we use an integrative method based on computational modelling and the analysis of archaeological data to construct an agent based model that explores the influence of demographic variables (birth and death rates) and mobility (home range size) on the bio-cultural interaction between AMH and Neanderthals during the transition from the Middle to Upper Palaeolithic on the Iberian Peninsula (50 ka to 30 ka BP). Our simulation results are consistent with the current radiocarbon framework for the disappearance of Neanderthals in this region. This suggest that the extinction of Neanderthals could be explained by inter specific differences in demographic behaviour and mobility patterns compared with AMH. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Rayleigh-Plesset analysis, ultra-high speed photography, and single bubble acoustical recordings previously were applied independently to characterize the radial oscillation and resulting echoes from a microbubble in response to an ultrasonic pulse. In addition, high-speed photography has shown that microbubbles are destroyed over a single pulse or pulse train by diffusion and fragmentation. In order to develop a single model to characterize microbubble echoes based on oscillatory and destructive characteristics, an optical-acoustical system was developed to simultaneously record the optical image and backscattered echo from each microbubble. Combined observation provides the opportunity to compare predictions for oscillation and echoes with experimental results and identify discrepancies due to diffusion or fragmentation. Optimization of agents and insonating pulse parameters may be facilitated with this system. The mean correlation of the predicted and experimental radius-time curves and echoes exceeds 0.7 for the parameters studied here. An important application of this new system is to record and analyze microbubble response to a long pulse in which diffusion is shown to occur over the pulse duration. The microbubble response to an increasing or decreasing chirp is evaluated using this new tool. For chirp insonation beginning with the lower center frequency, low-frequency modulation of the oscillation envelope was obvious. However, low-frequency modulation was not observed in the radial oscillation produced by decreasing chirp insonation. Comparison of the echoes from similar sized microbubbles following increasing and decreasing chirp insonation demonstrated that the echoes were not time-reversed replicas. Using a transmission pressure of 620 kPa, the -6 dB echo length was 0.9 and 1.1 mu s for increasing and decreasing chirp insonation, respectively (P = 0.02). The mean power in the low-frequency portion of the echoes was 8 (mV)(2) and 13 (mV)(2) for increasing and decreasing chirp insonation, respectively (P = 0.01).

AB We introduce methodology to construct an emulator for environmental and ecological Spatiotemporal processes that uses the higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) as an extension of singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches to emulation. Some important advantages of the method are that it allows for the use of a combination of supervised learning methods (e.g., random forests and Gaussian process regression) and also allows for the prediction of process values at spatial locations and time points that were not used in the training sample. The method is demonstrated with two applications: The first is a periodic solution to a shallow ice approximation partial differential equation from glaciology, and second is an agent-based model of collective animal movement. In both cases, we demonstrate the value of combining different machine learning models for accurate emulation. In addition, in the agent-based model case we demonstrate the ability of the tensor emulator to successfully capture individual behavior in space and time. We demonstrate via a real data example the ability to perform Bayesian inference in order to learn parameters governing collective animal behavior.

AB Urban sprawl and income segregation are two undesired urban patterns that occur during urban development. Empirical studies show that income level and inequality are positively correlated with urban sprawl and income segregation, respectively. However, the relationship between urban sprawl and income segregation is not only rarely investigated but also shows ambiguous empirical results when it is. Therefore, in this study, we built a stylized agent-based model with individual behaviours based on Alonso's bid rent theory and ran simulations with different combinations of income level and income inequality. We measured the overall emergent patterns with indicators for urban sprawl and income segregation. The model confirms the established positive correlations between income level and urban sprawl and between income inequality and segregation. Furthermore, the model shows a negative correlation between urban sprawl and income segregation under free market conditions. The model indicates that without any policy implementation, a city will either suffer from urban sprawl or income segregation. Thus, this study serves as a starting point to study the effects of different urban planning policies on these two urban problems.

AB The aim of this article is to present a method, which is called the 'iterative collusive strategy (CS) search method', to detect the CS in prisoner's dilemma game in which there is collusive equilibrium. We apply this method to an example of two-player prisoner's dilemma game and a numerical duopoly example to show its effectiveness. To simulate the electricity market models, we use this method with a local optimization algorithm. Then, we employ a hybrid technique by applying an agent-based model to the iterative CS search method for improving the results and speeding up their convergence. We simulate an electricity market example with transmission constraint to test the effectiveness of local and hybrid iterative CS search methods. Simulation results show that both local and hybrid iterative CS search methods could successfully identify the CS; however, the hybrid iterative CS search method converges to the final results with less iteration numbers.

AB Gold nanorods (GNRs) have aroused the extensive interest of many researchers in recent years due to their unique physicochemical properties. However, the toxic cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) is often introduced into the process of synthesizing GNRs, which hinders the wide-range applications of GNRs in clinical practice. To reduce the toxicity, the CTAB molecules coated on the surface of GNRs should be replaced by nontoxic and biocompatible agents such as phospholipid. Thus the component and morphology of the mixed coating agents on the surface of GNRs affect the physicochemical properties of GNRs. To study the morphology and properties of the coated GNRs at a molecular level, we investigate the self-assembly of GNRs, CTAB, and dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) by using solvent-free dissipative particle dynamics simulations. Our results show that the morphology of the assembled complex mainly depends on the CTAB/DMPC molar ratio, while neither of the interaction strength between GNRs and the coating agents nor the diameter of GNRs has significant effect on the morphology. At a certain combination of GNRs-coating agent interaction strength with GNRs diameter, the mixture of CTAB and DMPC on the surface of GNRs undergoes a gradual change in morphology as the CTAB/DMPC molar ratio increases, including the forming of intact bilayer membrane, cracked bilayer membrane, long patches of micelles, and short wormlike micelles winding GNRs in spiral shape. The morphology of intact bilayer membrane verifies the experimental guess, while the other three morphologies are brand-new discoveries. We also find that when the GNR's diameter becomes smaller, or the CTAB/DMPC molar ratio is larger, or the interaction strength is greater, the agents cap the ends of GNRs, meanwhile the membrane thickness becomes thinner. The multiple morphologies of the assembled complexes can be qualitatively explained by the shape energy of a membrane adsorbed on a solid surface. When the surface tension of the membrane (which is proportional to the spontaneous curvature of the membrane) exceeds a critical value (which is equal to the adhesion energy density of the membrane), the membrane dissociates from the solid surface and its shape changes. The change trend is related to the spontaneous curvature of the free membrane. As a result of the synergy and competition among the inherent curvatures of GNRs, the spontaneous curvature of CTAB/DMPC membrane or micelle, as well as the adhesion energy, various interesting morphologies are produced. Our simulations and analyses directly characterize the morphological structures of CTAB and lipid coated GNRs, which allow us to in depth understand the self-assembling behaviors of GNRs at a molecular level. This is also conductive to achieving the controlled assemblies of GNRs.

AB The compositions of 10 different VCI compounds were optimized. Low density polyethylene (LDPE), ECA-5 copolymer (poly(ethylene-co-methyl acrylate) as an ethylene based coupling agent) and the prepared VCI compound, so called BFA-200, were processed in a twin screw extruder followed by a film casting method to make films. The 80/20 LDPE/ECA-5 composition was determined as the optimized VCI unfilled blend having the maximum mechanical properties for the film processing; the BFA-200 VCI nanoparticles (5, 10 and 15%) were added to this composition. Measurement of the controlled release of the VCI within the LDPE/ECA-5/BFA-200 80/20/15 sample was carried out using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA method was also used for determination of the VCI content after periods of 3, 6 and 12 months in polyethylene bags stored at ambient conditions. There was a significant difference in the release of VCI agent for the blends as compared to that of VCI incorporated in only LDPE. The preservative quality of the blend films was tested on steel plates using the TL8135-002 standard. There were acceptable degrees of corrosion with all of the virgin blends containing BFA-200, especially 10% upward. However, there was a different behavior after each time period, in good accordance with the release tests. Moreover, a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to determine the diffusion of the VCI molecules within pure LDPE and the LDPE/ECA-5 blends. There was a decrease in the simulated diffusion of the VCI material through the blends with addition of the ECA-5 content which fitted well to the experimental data.

AB This article presents an empirical analysis of credit-constrained households in which models of both demand and supply sides of the market for loans are simultaneously estimated.  We develop a discrete-choice logit model of the consumers' decision on whether or not to apply for credit.  Combining this with a reduced-form logistic model for the banks' credit-granting decision, we then estimate the model with cross-sectional data, as a nonlinear, ordered, sequential logit.  Our findings shed light on the criteria used by banks in assessing credit applications and reveal the strong dependence of preferences on demographic characteristics.  The results also suggest that agents face significant fixed costs in applying for loans.  The fact that we jointly estimate models of both supply and demand sides of the credit market enables us to examine whether particular groups in the population are more frequently credit rationed because they tend to demand more loans or because they are viewed as bad credit risks by lenders.

ID RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; MODEL; WEALTH; CITY
AB We significantly extend our earlier variant of the Schelling model, incorporating a neighborhood Potential function as well as an agent wealth gain function to study the long term evolution of the economic status of neighborhoods in cities. We find that the long term patterns of neighborhood relative economic status (RES) simulated by this model reasonably replicate the empirically observed patterns from American cities. Specifically, we find that larger fractions of rich and poor neighborhoods tend to, on average, retain status for longer than lowerand upper-middle wealth neighborhoods. The use of a Potential function that measures the relative wealth of neighborhoods as the basis for agent wealth gain and agent movement appears critical to explaining these emergent patterns of neighborhood RES. This also suggests that the empirically observed RES patterns could indeed be universal and that we would expect to see these patterns repeated for cities around the world. Observing RES behavior over even longer periods of time, the model predicts that the fraction of poor neighborhoods retaining status remains almost constant over extended periods of time, while the fraction of middle-wealth and rich neighborhoods retaining status reduces significantly over time, tending to zero.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English
DT Article
ID HERD BEHAVIOR; FLUCTUATIONS; DYNAMICS; PRICE
AB We study a microscopic model for financial markets on complex networks, motivated by the dynamics of agents and their structure of interaction. The model consists of interacting agents (spins) with local ferromagnetic coupling and global antiferromagnetic coupling. In order to incorporate more realistic situations, we also introduce an external field which changes in time. From numerical simulations, we find that the model shows two-phase phenomena. When the local ferromagnetic interaction is balanced with the global antiferromagnetic interaction, the resulting return distribution satisfies a power law having a single peak at zero values of return, which corresponds to the market equilibrium phase. On the other hand, if local ferromagnetic interaction is dominant, then the return distribution becomes double peaked at nonzero values of return, which characterizes the out-of-equilibrium phase. On random networks, the crossover between two phases comes from the competition between two different interactions. However, on scale-free networks, not only the competition between the different interactions but also the heterogeneity of underlying topology causes the two-phase phenomena. Possible relationships between the critical phenomena of spin system and the two-phase phenomena are discussed.

AB Objective: To asses the role of expression of resistance phenotypes in treatment failure in patients with invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder, since P-glycoprotein and glutathione S-transferase pi (GST) expression are implicated in resistance to various chemotherapy agents in different tumors. Methods: Tumor samples from P-glycoprotein and GST-pi were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results: P-glycoprotein and GST-pi were found in 35.7 and 42.9% of the samples, respectively, In 21.4% of the samples there was simultaneous expression of both proteins, No significant impact on prediction of tumor behavior was evident on statistical analysis by any one of the protein expressions, Conclusion: Drug resistance in transitional cell carcinoma may be through different mechanisms. Although the small sample size of this study precludes firm conclusions, the assessment of P-glycoprotein or GST-pi expression appears to be of little value as a predictor of response to chemotherapy in this group of tumors.

AB We investigate the detailed dynamics of gains and losses made by agents in some kinetic models of wealth exchange. An earlier work suggested that a walk in an abstract gain-loss space can be conceived for the agents. For models in which agents do not save, or save with uniform saving propensity, the walk has diffusive behavior. For the case in which the saving propensity lambda is distributed randomly (0 <= lambda < 1), the resultant walk showed a ballistic nature (except at a particular value of lambda* approximate to 0.47). Here we consider several other features of the walk with random lambda. While some macroscopic properties of this walk are comparable to a biased random walk, at microscopic level, there are gross differences. The difference turns out to be due to an antipersistent tendency toward making a gain (loss) immediately after making a loss (gain). This correlation is in fact present in kinetic models without saving or with uniform saving as well, such that the corresponding walks are not identical to ordinary random walks. In the distributed saving case, antipersistence occurs with a simultaneous overall bias.

AB Objective: Define a role for perivascular cells during developmental retinal angiogenesis in the context of EC Notch1-DLL4 signaling at the multicellular network level.
   Methods: The retinal vasculature is highly sensitive to growth factor-mediated intercellular signaling. Although EC signaling has been explored in detail, it remains unclear how PC function to modulate these signals that lead to a diverse set of vascular network patterns in health and disease. We have developed an ABM of retinal angiogenesis that incorporates both ECs and PCs to investigate the formation of vascular network patterns as a function of pericyte coverage. We use our model to test the hypothesis that PC modulate Notch1-DLL4 signaling in endothelial cell-endothelial cell interactions.
   Results: Agent-based model (ABM) simulations that include PCs more accurately predict experimentally observed vascular network morphologies than simulations that lack PCs, suggesting that PCs may influence sprouting behaviors through physical blockade of endothelial intercellular connections.
   Conclusions: This study supports a role for PCs as a physical buffer to signal propagation during vascular network formation-a barrier that may be important for generating healthy microvascular network patterns.

TI Stylized facts from a threshold-based heterogeneous agent model
SO EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B

DT Article
ID ASSET RETURNS; VOLUME
AB A class of heterogeneous agent models is investigated where investors switch trading position whenever their motivation to do so exceeds some critical threshold. These motivations can be psychological in nature or reflect behaviour suggested by the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). By introducing different propensities into a baseline model that displays EMH behaviour, one can attempt to isolate their effects upon the market dynamics. The simulation results indicate that the introduction of a herding propensity results in excess kurtosis and power-law decay consistent with those observed in actual return distributions, but not in significant long-term volatility correlations. Possible alternatives for introducing such long-term volatility correlations are then identified and discussed.

AB Educational properties have recorded an average of 4980 structure fires between 2011 and 2015 according to US National Fire Protection Association. It has been determined that four out of five fires in schools have occurred between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m., when pupils were around. Even though the percentage of structure fires in educational properties has fallen over the years, there is still place for improvement and knowing how to react in such situations can contribute to reducing pupils' injuries and also to their lifesaving. Thus, the present paper analysis the possibility of using agent-based simulations in NetLogo for a classroom with two exits in order to increase pupils' awareness on how to act during an evacuation process caused by a fire. Based on an empirical study, it has been observed that after presenting the NetLogo evacuation simulation, the pupils' awareness has increased with up to 22.99%, having a direct result on the overall evacuation time and their safety.

AB Computational modeling is a useful tool for spelling out hypotheses in Cognitive neuroscience and testing their predictions in artificial systems. Here we describe a series of simulations involving neural networks that learned to perform their task by self-organizing their internal connections. The networks controlled artificial agents with an orienting eye and an arm. Agents saw objects with various shapes and locations and learned to press a key appropriate to their shape. The results showed the following: (1) Despite being able to see the entire visual scene without moving their eye, agents learned to orient their eye toward a peripherally presented object. (2) Neural networks whose hidden layers were previously partitioned into units dedicated to eye orienting and units dedicated to arm movements learned the identification task faster and more accurately than did nonmodular networks. (3) Nonetheless, even nonmodular networks developed a similar functional segregation through self-organization of their hidden layer. (4) After partial disconnection of the hidden layer from the input layer, the lesioned agents continued to 7 respond accurately to single stimuli, wherever they occurred, but on double simultaneous stimulation they oriented toward and responded only to the right-sided stimulus, thus simulating extinction/neglect. These results stress the generality of the advantages provided by orienting processes. Hard-wired modularity, reminiscent of the distinct cortical visual streams in the primate brain, provided further evolutionary advantages. Finally, disconnection is likely to be a mechanism of primary importance in the pathogenesis of neglect and extinction symptoms, consistent with recent evidence from animal Studies and brain-damaged patients.

AB Epithelial tissues show a particular topology where cells resemble a polygon-like shape, but some biological processes can alter this tissue topology. During cell proliferation, mitotic cell dilation deforms the tissue and modifies the tissue topology. Additionally, cells are reorganized in the epithelial layer and these rearrangements also alter the polygon distribution. We present here a computer-based hybrid framework focused on the simulation of epithelial layer dynamics that combines discrete and continuum numerical models. In this framework, we consider topological and mechanical aspects of the epithelial tissue. Individual cells in the tissue are simulated by an off-lattice agent-based model, which keeps the information of each cell. In addition, we model the cell-cell interaction forces and the cell cycle. Otherwise, we simulate the passive mechanical behaviour of the cell monolayer using a material that approximates the mechanical properties of the cell. This continuum approach is solved by the finite element method, which uses a dynamic mesh generated by the triangulation of cell polygons. Forces generated by cell-cell interaction in the agent-based model are also applied on the finite element mesh. Cell movement in the agent-based model is driven by the displacements obtained from the deformed finite element mesh of the continuum mechanical approach. We successfully compare the results of our simulations with some experiments about the topology of proliferating epithelial tissues in Drosophila. Our framework is able to model the emergent behaviour of the cell monolayer that is due to local cell-cell interactions, which have a direct influence on the dynamics of the epithelial tissue.

AB We used the model of prospective memory and habit development to derive recommendations for designing behavior-change campaigns that used prompts or household visits as reminders. We followed an exemplary procedure comprising the calibration of the model, based on 48 time series gathered during a campaign promoting recycling habits and a systematic exploration of the solution space. For the parameter estimation, an algorithm was developed that worked at two levels. A higher level algorithm optimized parameters that were set to equal values for all agents, whereas a lower level algorithm estimated the values of agent-specific parameters for each agent separately, using the parameter values of the higher level algorithm for the other parameters. This procedure resulted in an excellent fit of the model to the data (R-2 = 75%) For the systematic exploration, an indicator expressing campaign effects in one value was defined and the following findings could be derived. Activities should focus on the first week of a campaign. Follow-up visits or refreshing of prompts should be done within 4 days after the initial visit. Later activities, such as additional visits or refreshing of prompts, bring little further effects. Investing heavily in the design of the prompts for improving their salience is only worthwhile in populations with a low commitment to perform the behavior. Furthermore, covering more than 10% of the places where the target behavior should be performed with prompts mostly does not lead to additional effects to make it worthwhile.

AB Although cooperation and trust are essential features for the development of prosperous populations, they also put cooperating individuals at risk for exploitation and abuse. Empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that the solution to the problem resides in the practice of mimicry and imitation, the expectation of opponent's mimicry and the reliance on similarity indices. Here we fuse the principles of enacted and expected mimicry and condition their application on two similarity indices to produce a model of mimicry and relative similarity. Testing the model in computer simulations of behavioral niches, populated with agents that enact various strategies and learning algorithms, shows how mimicry and relative similarity outperforms all the opponent strategies it was tested against, pushes noncooperative opponents toward extinction, and promotes the development of cooperative populations. The proposed model sheds light on the evolution of cooperation and provides a blueprint for intentional induction of cooperation within and among populations. It is suggested that reducing conflict intensities among human populations necessitates (i) instigation of social initiatives that increase the perception of similarity among opponents and (ii) efficient lowering of the similarity threshold of the interaction, the minimal level of similarity that makes cooperation advisable.

AB Poly(cyclohexylene dimethylene cyclohexanedicarboxylate) (PCCE) is a kind of copolyester polymer with excellent toughness and outstanding flexibility. However, the opacity caused by crystallization limits the widespread application of PCCE in products that have transparency requirements. The effects of 1,3:2,4-Di-p-methylbenzylidene sorbitol (MDBS) on the crystallization behavior, transparency, and mechanical properties of a PCCE melt were investigated via differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), spectrophotometry, and tensile testing. The results suggest that the transparency and mechanical properties of PCCE drastically improve and that its crystallization behaviors are obviously influenced by the addition of MDBS. PCCE with 0.6 wt% MDBS was then selected as a representative sample, and its thermal behavior and crystal morphology were further investigated by DSC, hot-staged polarizing microscopy (HSPLM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The quantitative results suggest that, compared to neat PCCE resin, PCCE/MDBS has a lower isothermal and nonisothermal crystallization activation energy, which indicates a rapid crystallization process. The results also show that, compared to the pure PCCE melt, the PCCE/MDBS melt experiences a greater increase in the number of crystals and a greater decrease in the crystal size during cooling. The acceleration of the crystallization process and reduction in crystal size can be both attributed to the nucleation effect of the MDBS. In conclusion, because the addition of the nucleating agent improves the transparency and tensile properties of PCCE by adjusting and controlling its thermal and crystallization behaviors, the proposed technique of using a compounding nucleating agent to control crystallization is therefore suitable for PCCE.

TI Evolutionary dynamics of the traveler's dilemma and minimum-effort
   coordination games on complex networks
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E
LA English

ID COOPERATION; TRAGEDY; POPULATIONS; RESOLVE; ORIGIN
AB The traveler's dilemma game and the minimum-effort coordination game are social dilemmas that have received significant attention resulting from the fact that the predictions of classical game theory are inconsistent with the results found when the games are studied experimentally. Moreover, both the traveler's dilemma and the minimum-effort coordination games have potentially important applications in evolutionary biology. Interestingly, standard deterministic evolutionary game theory, as represented by the replicator dynamics in a well-mixed population, is also inadequate to account for the behavior observed in these games. Here we study the evolutionary dynamics of both these games in populations with interaction patterns described by a variety of complex network topologies. We investigate the evolutionary dynamics of these games through agent-based simulations on both model and empirical networks. In particular, we study the effects of network clustering and assortativity on the evolutionary dynamics of both games. In general, we show that the evolutionary behavior of the traveler's dilemma and minimum-effort coordination games on complex networks is in good agreement with that observed experimentally. Thus, formulating the traveler's dilemma and the minimum-effort coordination games on complex networks neatly resolves the paradoxical aspects of these games.

AB Recent research has shown that providing building occupants with eco-feedback regarding their own energy consumption and the consumption of others in their peer network can lead to substantial energy savings. While empirical eco-feedback studies have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of energy consumption behavior and building occupant peer networks, such studies have faced challenges in examining consumption behavior in larger and more complex peer networks. Computer simulation and random network models offer a solution to this scalability issue, but current random network models are limited in their ability to mimic real world building occupant networks. In this paper, we propose a refined random network model, the Block Configuration Model, and utilize it in an agent-based energy consumption simulation. Results indicate that the Block Configuration Model is more accurate than conventional models when compared to empirical data from three different eco-feedback experiments. The Block Configuration Model advances our understanding of the dynamics of occupant energy consumption and provides a tool to reduce energy consumption and associated emissions.

ID MOTION; SIMULATION
AB We present a novel technique for behavioral animation through data-driven behavior synthesis. This technique has two key features: it provides natural character behavior and has a programming-by-demonstration interface. Thus we can quickly create compelling autonomous virtual agents that exhibit stylized behavior. First, the human user demonstrates behavior for the character by specifying its high-level actions (e.g., with a joystick) during an interactive session. Each demonstration is recorded as a sequence of discrete actions. Later, the character synthesizes novel behavior by concatenating segments of action sequences. The choice of segments is guided by simulations that predict fitness. Thus our technique operates such as a cognitive model, providing a character with deliberative decision making. The actions are abstract and can be mapped to any pertinent motions, even procedurally synthesized motions. Thus our technique complements character animation algorithms. We empirically show that our O(log n) technique is scalable, robust when provided with sufficient data, produces effective behavior for a number of problem domains, and is faster than traditional planning. Also, the interface is intuitive enough that character behavior can be created by nontechnical users.

AB Ocean acidification (OA)-caused by rising concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2)-is thought to be a major threat to marine ecosystems and has been shown to induce behavioural alterations in fish. Here we show behavioural resilience to near-future OA in a commercially important and migratory marine finfish, the Sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Sea bass were raised from eggs at 19 degrees C in ambient or near-future OA (1000 mu atm pCO(2)) conditions and n = 270 fish were observed 59-68 days post-hatch using automated tracking from video. Fish reared under ambient conditions, OA conditions, and fish reared in ambient conditions but tested in OA water showed statistically similar movement patterns, and reacted to their environment and interacted with each other in comparable ways. Thus our findings indicate behavioural resilience to near-future OA in juvenile sea bass. Moreover, simulated agent-based models indicate that our analysis methods are sensitive to subtle changes in fish behaviour. It is now important to determine whether the absences of any differences persist under more ecologically relevant circumstances and in contexts which have a more direct bearing on individual fitness.

LA English
DT Article

ID TRUST
AB Reputation systems have been used to support users in making decisions under uncertainty or risk that is due to the autonomous behavior of others. Research results support the conclusion that reputation systems can protect against exploitation by unfair users, and that they have an impact on the prices and income of users. This observation leads to another question: can reputation systems be used to assure or increase the fairness of resource distribution? This question has a high relevance in social situations where, due to the absence of established authorities or institutions, agents need to rely on mutual trust relations in order to increase fairness of distribution. This question can be formulated as a hypothesis: in reputation (or trust management) systems, fairness should be an emergent property. The notion of fairness can be precisely defined and investigated based on the theory of equity. In this paper, we investigate the Fairness Emergence hypothesis in reputation systems and prove that, under certain conditions, the hypothesis is valid for open and closed systems, even in unstable system states and in the presence of adversaries. Moreover, we investigate the sensitivity of Fairness Emergence and show that an improvement of the reputation system strengthens the emergence of fairness. Our results are confirmed using a trace-driven simulation from a large Internet auction site.

AB Different neural systems are involved in animal navigation depending on the type of task. Experimental studies support the idea that the hippocampus is necessary to learn a spatial representation required to navigate toward hidden goals (place response), whereas the dorsolateral striatum is involved in the learning of stimulus-response associations when navigating toward visible (or cued) goals. These systems compete for action selection according to the characteristics of the task, previous experience (e.g. training procedure) or endogenous factors. This paper reviews both experimental data on the theory of multiple memory systems involved in navigation, and a recent computational model of action selection based on the competition of place and cue responses learnt during training. The model implements separately the two types of response, i.e. place response and stimulus response. Furthermore, competition takes place to select which behaviour will actually be performed. The model was tested in a simulated environment using a protocol analogous to those used in experiments with animals.

AB The simultaneous simulation of nucleation and growth of multiple bubbles was performed for a batch foaming process of low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polystyrene (PS) using CO2 as a foaming agent. The simulation model involved a Blander-Katz bubble nucleation rate equation and a set of bubble growth rate equations that account for the momentum balance across the bubble interface, the diffusion of dissolved gas molecules in a polymer, and the overall mass balance of the gas in bubbles and in the polymer. The present study considered the overlapping of the concentration boundary layers. The simulation results could predict the experimental results of the bubble nucleation and bubble growth behaviors of the polymers in a fairly quantitative manner. Moreover, the effects of the physical properties on bubble nucleation and bubble growth dynamics were demonstrated in a series of sensitivity studies. The effect of interfacial tension and the diffusion coefficient strongly affected the bubble nucleation and growth rates, respectively. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Tri-n-butyl phosphate (TBP) is an important extractant used in the solvent extraction process for recovering uranium and plutonium from used nuclear fuel. An atomistic molecular dynamics study was used to understand the fundamental molecular-level behavior of extracting agents in solution. Atomistic parametrization was carried out using the AMBER force field to model the TBP molecule and n-dodecane molecule, a commonly used organic solvent. Validation of the optimized force field was accomplished through various thermophysical properties of pure TBP and pure n-dodecane in the bulk liquid phase. The mass density, dipole moment, self-diffusion coefficient, and heat of vaporization were calculated from our simulations and compared favorably with experimental values. The molecular structure of TBPs in n-dodecane at a dilute TBP concentration was examined based on radial distribution functions. 1D and 2D potential mean force studies were carried out to establish the criteria for identifying TBP aggregates. The dimerization constant of TBP in the TBP/n-dodecane mixture was also obtained and matched the experimental value.

AB A vertically stirred tubular reactor is designed and studied in this work to perform the styrene batch suspension polymerization. Computational fluid dynamic techniques are applied to acquire information regarding the heat transfer and fluid flow behavior along the reactor. The simulated findings are used to support the experimental results (particle size distribution- PSD) obtained by varying the stirring system configuration, stabilizing agent concentration, and system holdup (styrene/water ratio v/v). According to the results, an efficient temperature control is attained due to the tubular geometry of the equipment. In addition, the PSD broadens by increasing the size of the shaft and the number of impellers installed along the reactor. An evaluation of the particle sedimentation throughout the reaction demonstrates that the PSD and the stirring rate play an important role in the sedimentation kinetics.

AB This paper addresses passivity-based pose synchronization in the Special Euclidean group SE(3). We first develop a passivity-based distributed velocity input law to achieve pose synchronization. We next show that the pose synchronizes exponentially fast under an assumption on the initial states of the bodies, with an exponential convergence rate given by algebraic connectivity of interconnection graphs. We also prove pose synchronization in the presence of communication delays and topology switches. We moreover give further extensions of the present law, where desirable velocities and collision avoidance are taken into account. Finally, the effectiveness of the present inputs is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experiments on a planar (2D) test bed.

   Improves the Functional Recovery of Muscle in a Young Mouse Model of

AB Background: Although muscle injuries tend to heal uneventfully in most cases, incomplete functional recovery commonly occurs as a result of scar tissue formation at the site of injury, even after treatment with muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs).
   Hypothesis: The transplantation of MDSCs in the presence of a transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1) antagonist (losartan) would result in decreased scar tissue formation and enhance muscle regeneration after contusion injuries in a mouse model.
   Study Design: Controlled laboratory study.
   Methods: An animal model of muscle contusion was developed using the tibialis anterior muscle in 48 healthy mice at 8 to 10 weeks of age. After sustaining muscle contusion injuries, the mice were divided into 4 groups: (1) saline injection group (control group; n = 15), (2) MDSC transplantation group (MDSC group; n = 15), (3) MDSC transplantation plus oral losartan group (MDSC/losartan group; n = 15), and (4) healthy uninjured group (healthy group; n = 3). Losartan was administrated systemically beginning 3 days after injury and continued until the designated endpoint (1, 2, or 4 weeks after injury). MDSCs were transplanted 4 days after injury. Muscle regeneration and fibrotic scar formation were evaluated by histology, and the expression of follistatin, MyoD, Smad7, and Smad2/3 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Functional recovery was measured via electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve.
   Results: When compared with MDSC transplantation alone, MDSC/losartan treatment resulted in significantly decreased scar formation, an increase in the number of regenerating myofibers, and improved functional recovery after muscle contusions. In support of these findings, the expression levels of Smad7 and MyoD were significantly increased in the group treated with both MDSCs and losartan.
   Conclusion: When compared with MDSCs alone, the simultaneous treatment of muscle contusions with MDSCs and losartan significantly reduced scar formation, increased the number of regenerating myofibers, and improved the functional recovery of muscle; these effects were caused, at least in part, by the losartan-mediated upregulation of Smad7 and MyoD. Increased levels of Smad7 and MyoD together reduced the deposition of scar tissue (via the inhibition of TGF-1 by Smad7) and committed the transplanted MDSCs toward a myogenic lineage (via Smad7-regulated MyoD expression).
   Clinical Relevance: The study findings contribute to the development of biological treatments to accelerate and improve the quality of muscle healing after injury.

AB Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) affects approximately 1% of the total world population. Despite incessant research and development of new therapeutic agents, management of RA is still a troublesome affair. Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) is an epigenetic regulator which play important role in pathogenesis of RA. In present study, we hypothesized that Phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a potent inhibitor of HDAC1, may ameliorate RA. Efficacy of PEITC was evaluated in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) induced arthritis model in rats. CFA (0.1 ml) was injected subplantarly in the left hind paw on day 0 to all the groups except normal control. The administration of test drug PEITC (10, 24 & 50 mg/kg) and standard drug Ibuprofen started simultaneously and was continued for 21 days. Paw edema, total arthritic index, mobility score, stair climbing ability, behavioral parameters, and bone erosion were evaluated. Further, radiographic studies, TNF-alpha as well as HDAC1 levels in synovial tissue homogenate and histological analysis were performed. Prophylactic treatment of PEITC attenuated paw edema, total arthritic index, mobility score, stair climbing ability, behavioral parameters, and bone erosion in dose dependent manner. Furthermore, there was significant decrease in TNF-alpha as well as HDAC1 levels in synovial tissue homogenate. Histological analysis revealed no cartilage damage, bone erosion, hyperplasia at synovial lining as well as infiltration of inflammatory cells in treatment group. Results of this study suggest potent anti-rheumatoid arthritis activity of Phenethyl isothiocyanate in CFA induced RA model in rats.

AB Nanodevices based on magnetite functionalized with folic acid (FA) with improved properties to be employed as theranostics in various types of cancer are here proposed. Two methodologies for FA incorporation were explored aiming to reach suitable loading efficiency as well as adequate stability of nanosystems in physiological media. To this end, simple adsorption and covalent binding of FA and some experimental conditions derived from both procedures were studied. A thorough physicochemical characterization was performed using all the formulations. The mechanism of the interaction between FA and magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs) was elucidated from characterization results supported by theoretical studies using spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT). Both data coincide in that the selective functional group of FA (pteridine group) remained available after FA binding MNPs. Such studies also demonstrated that any of FA carboxylate groups could be available to potentially link other molecule (i.e therapeutic agents). Besides, other issues that are not normally accomplished in reported articles were included; i.e the stability according to two different criteria: size evolution (expressed as hydrodynamic diameter) as a function of time in aqueous media; and the capacity FA retention in PBS, pH = 7.4. Recovered data indicated that the samples are stable at least 15 days in water and 4 h in buffer without significant modifications of their properties. The feasibility of these formulations to interact with simulated physiological fluid was also assayed. The results revealed that protein corona was formed around all the tested formulations leading to more stable nanodevices in terms of their hydrodynamic sizes and size evolution along the time. To complete the theranostic characteristic, Doxorubicin was added to the MNPs@FA by physical adsorption, to provide the therapeutic function. The satisfactory incorporation was verified by FTIR spectroscopy.

AB A mathematical model of thrombopoiesis in small rodents, principally rats, is presented. It is a compartmental model, consisting of seven compartments, which contain the following cell populations: early megakaryocyte progenitor cells, late megakaryocyte progenitor cells, megakaryocytes of ploidy classes 8N, 16N, 32N and 64N, and platelets. Signals for feedback regulation are derived from the platelet compartment and from all megakaryocyte compartments. The main characteristic of the model is its ability to simulate megakaryocyte ploidy and volume distribution. Platelet number and the ploidy distribution of megakaryocytes after acute and chronic disturbances in the platelet compartment were simulated and were found to approximate experimental data published in the literature. The kinetic parameters for the progenitor cell compartment, which were derived from published in vitro data, were sufficient to stimulate the platelet number after administration of hydroxyurea and 5-fluorouracil. The proposed model is capable of reproducing the reactions of the system to several experimental disturbances in the thromobopoietic lineage, but the action of agents such as radiation, which cause damage to the stem cells or to other lineages, cannot be simulated.

AB We explored the local motion rules used by interacting individuals in small groups of black neon tetra (Hyphessobrycon herbertaxelrodi) and zebrafish (Danio rerio) to ascertain if and how these rules underlie the fishes' global collective coordinated motion. As these 2 species show very different styles of collective motion in terms of cohesion and polarization, we expected to find differences in their individual behavioral rules. We recorded groups of 2, 3, 4, and 8 fish of each species; tracked their individual trajectories; and studied how their individual turning angles and accelerations varied as a function of heading differences, distances, and relative angles to their neighbors. We found that black neon tetra and zebrafish differed in terms of their preferential positions with respect to their neighbors, the magnitude of turning angles and accelerations, and the way these angles and accelerations are modulated by both the distance from neighbors (thus suggesting a "repulsion" zone in black neon tetra but not in zebrafish) and the heading difference and relative angle to neighbors. Our results enable us to infer that, in black neon tetra, avoiding excessive proximity and collision takes priority over cohesion, and cohesion takes priority over polarization. This provides evidence that rules are similar in species of very different genera and that differences are a matter of degree. Our results also provide substantial empirical evidence to support the theoretical assumptions made in agent-based models that simulate coordinated collective motion in many different animal species.

AB In the rank of behavioral rules, imitation-based heuristics have received special attention in economics (see Vega-Redondo, 1997; Schlag, 1998). In particular, imitative behavior explains the evidence from experimental oligopolies where the Cournot-Nash equilibrium does not emerge as unique outcome and outputs are placed, for the most part, on fairly competitive levels (see e.g. Apesteguia et al., 2006 and Oechssler et al., 2016). Here, we derive a dynamic model of a linear Cournot oligopoly with a deterministic structure where rational agents having perfect foresight and imitators are present. The Cournot-Nash equilibrium is a stationary state of our models together with a further production level that can be interpreted as the competitive equilibrium in case only imitators are present. We found that the heterogeneities among players influence the stability properties of the Cournot-Nash equilibrium and the arising dynamical scenarios are characterized by similar features as those from experimental outcomes.

AB Restrictions on gaining information may significantly affect perception of the system under study. In this paper we are concerned with mechanisms introducing epistemic constraints in the framework of ontological models and discuss a scheme leading to the minimal operational account which does not rely on the knowledge of the underlying ontology. As a case in point, we construct local ontological model which simulates behaviour of a single quantum particle in dual-rail interferometric circuits. We show that for agents analysing conceivable experimental circuits predictions of the model are indistinguishable from their quantum mechanical counterparts, that is operational account of the model is equivalent to a qubit. Note that it contrasts with the usual understanding the collapse of the wave function as non-local phenomenon, namely the model is local from the construction with any form of 'non-locality' being explained as an epistemic effect due to incomplete information about the system. This illustrates flexibility of the ontological model framework, and in particular the possibility of different interpretations behind the same operational account. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective This split-mouth randomized controlled clinical trial assessed the effect of 10% strontium chloride in combination with photobiomodulation (PBM) for the control of tooth sensitivity (TS) post-bleaching.
   Methods The upper/lower, right and left quadrants of fifty volunteers were randomized and allocated to four groups (n = 25): PLACEBO-placebo gel + simulation of PBM; Placebo + PBM; STRONTIUM-10% strontium chloride + simulation of PBM; and PBM + STRONTIUM-10% strontium chloride + PBM. All groups received tooth bleaching treatment with 35% hydrogen peroxide. For the PBM treatment, the laser tip was positioned in the apical and cervical regions of the teeth bleached in the respective hemi-arch. The laser system was operated in continuous mode, using 1.7 J of energy. A dose of 60 J/cm(2) was applied to each point for 16 seconds under 808 nm near-infrared light (100mW of power), with a point area of 0.028 cm(2). TS was assessed during a 21-day follow-up, using the modified visual analogue scale.
   Results In the intragroup assessment, the Friedman test indicated that PBM + STRONTIUM promoted the greatest reduction in TS after the second week of treatment (p <= 0.05). The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test indicated that the groups Placebo + PBM, STRONTIUM, and STRONTIUM + PBM did not differ statistically (p >= 0.05) in the first and third weeks of treatment The group PLACEBO exhibited the greatest TS in the first three days after each bleaching session.
   Conclusion The combination of 10% strontium chloride with PBM was effective in reducing post-bleaching TS; however, the combination of 10% strontium chloride with PBM was effective in reducing post-bleaching TS; however, it did not differ from the individual use of Placebo + PBM or STRONTIUM groups assessed after 21 days of follow-up.

AB This article extends the standard New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to agents who cannot smooth consumption (i.e. spenders) and are affected by external consumption habits. Although these assumptions are not new, their joint consideration strongly affects some theoretical and empirical results addressed by the recent literature. By deriving closed-form solutions, we identify different demand regimes and show that they are characterized by specific features regarding dynamic stability and monetary policy effectiveness. We also evaluate our model by stochastic simulations obtained from the Bayesian parameters estimates for the Group of Seven (G7) economies. From posterior impulse responses, we address the empirical relevance of the different regimes and provide comparative evidence on the heterogeneity of monetary policy effects among countries.

AB This study describes the in-silico design, synthesis, and evaluation of a cross-linked PVA hydrogel (CLPH) for the absorption of organophosphorus pesticide dimethoate from aqueous solutions. The crosslinking effectiveness of 14 dicarboxilic acids was evaluated through in-silico studies using semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations. According to the theoretical studies, the nanopore of PVA cross-linked with malic acid (CLPH-MA) showed the best interaction energy with dimethoate. Later, using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, three hydrogels with different proportions of PVA: MA (10: 2, 10: 4, and 10: 6) were used to evaluate their interactions with dimethoate. These results showed that the suitable crosslinking degree for improving the affinity for the pesticide was with 20% (W%) of the cross-linker. In the experimental absorption study, the synthesized CLPH-MA20 recovered 100% of dimethoate from aqueous solutions. Therefore, the theoretical data were correlated with the experimental studies. Surface morphology of CLPH-MA20 by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was analyzed. In conclusion, the ability of CLPH-MA20 to remove dimethoate could be used as a technological alternative for the treatment of contaminated water.

AB Potentiation of noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) by specific chemical contaminants and therapeutic drugs represents a distinct public health risk. Prediction of chemicals that yield such potentiation has not been successful because such agents differ markedly in structure. One mechanism for this potentiation that has garnered support is oxidative injury to the cochlea. Thus far, limited data have been published in support of this hypothesis. The current experiment was designed to further test this model using two antioxidant compounds, lipoic acid (LA) and 6-formylpterin (6-FP), and determine whether they would block potentiation of NIHL resulting from simultaneous exposures to carbon monoxide (CO) and noise in rats. Neither CO nor noise exposure at the intensity and duration selected produce persistent auditory impairment by themselves. Different groups of rats were exposed to noise alone centered at 8.0 kHz (105 dB) for 2 hours or to combined CO + noise treatment consisting of CO exposure for 1.5 hours and then exposure to CO + noise for 2 hours. Additional groups received either LA (100 mg/kg) or 6-FP (14 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to the onset of CO + noise. Cochlear function was monitored using distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and auditory thresholds were assessed using compound action potentials recorded from the round window. Histopathological evaluation of the organ of Corti provided counts of missing hair cells in each treatment group. The CO + noise-exposure group replicated previous studies in demonstrating permanent impairment of cochlear function and associated outer hair cell loss that greatly exceeded the minimal losses observed in the group treated with noise alone. Both LA and 6-FP given 30 minutes prior to the onset of CO + noise exposure reduced cochlear impairment and loss of hair cells.

AB Despite the large body of experimental work recently on biohybrid microsystems, few studies have focused on theoretical modeling of such systems, which is essential to understand their underlying functioning mechanisms and hence design them optimally for a given application task. Therefore, this study focuses on developing a mathematical model to describe the 3D motion and chemotaxis of a type of widely studied biohybrid microswimmer, where spherical microbeads are driven by multiple attached bacteria. The model is developed based on the biophysical observations of the experimental system and is validated by comparing the model simulation with experimental 3D swimming trajectories and other motility characteristics, including mean squared displacement, speed, diffusivity, and turn angle. The chemotaxis modeling results of the microswimmers also agree well with the experiments, where a collective chemotactic behavior among multiple bacteria is observed. The simulation result implies that such collective chemotaxis behavior is due to a synchronized signaling pathway across the bacteria attached to the same microswimmer. Furthermore, the dependencies of the motility and chemotaxis of the microswimmers on certain system parameters, such as the chemoattractant concentration gradient, swimmer body size, and number of attached bacteria, toward an optimized design of such biohybrid system are studied. The optimized microswimmers would be used in targeted cargo, e.g., drug, imaging agent, gene, and RNA, transport and delivery inside the stagnant or low-velocity fluids of the human body as one of their potential biomedical applications.

AB Purpose: To assess the ability of magnetic albumin nanospheres conjugated with folate (FA-MAN) to provide FR-specific enhancement of C6 glioblastoma on magnetic resonance (MR) images.
   Procedures: Active targeting effect of magnetic albumin nanospheres conjugated with folate (FA-MAN) was evaluated based on MR images and histopathological analysis. MR imaging of subcutaneously transplanted C6 glioblastomas was performed after intravenous injection of FA-MAN, non-targeted (magnetic albumin nanospheres, MAN) and FA-inhibited (magnetic albumin nanospheres conjugated with folate plus folate, FA-MAN+FA) agents at designated time points. The T-2 relaxation times in tumors were compared among different treatment groups and were correlated with histopathological findings. Prussian blue staining and in vivo toxicology assay were also performed simultaneously.
   Results: Upon MR imaging in vivo, T2 relaxation time of the tumor sites in the group administrated with FA-MAN (T2 is 49 ms, 46 ms and 45 ms at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively) has statistical difference compared to those in the groups of MAN (T2 is 56 ms, 56 ms and 61 ms at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively) and FA-MAN+FA nanospheres (T2 is 56 ms, 57 ms and 56 ms at 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively). Prussian blue-stained results demonstrated that more iron particles accumulated in the tumors of the targeted group than those of the other groups. Toxicology assay showed that no noticeable body weight losses were observed after monitoring 31 days, and the results of routine blood parameters, liver and kidney function biomarkers also demonstrated that the nanoshperes did not influence the respectively physiological index. Besides, no obvious pathological injuries on the major organs were examined.
   Conclusion: Folate-conjugated magnetic albumin nanospheres were more effective in targeting C6 glioblastoma in vivo.

AB Objective: The objective of the study was to evaluate the microtensile bond strength (mu TBS) of a composite resin to abraded or non-abraded bleached enamel after Er, Cr: YSGG laser irradiation and to observe the fracture patterns of the tested interfaces. Materials and methods: Two hundred twenty-eight bovine incisors were sectioned, resulting in 228 enamel blocks (7 x 4 x 4mm(3)) that were divided into 12 groups (n = 19) according to the factors "adhesion'' after bleaching (immediate adhesion; after 14 days; and a control group with adhesion on unbleached teeth); enamel "abrasion'' (with or without abrasion simulating cavity preparation); and "laser'' (with or without Er, Cr: YSGG laser irradiation). Bleached enamel groups were treated with 20% carbamide peroxide, 8 h/day for 21 days. Abrasion was performed with silicon carbide sandpaper. Specimens were restored with adhesive system and a composite resin (Adper Single Bond 2 and Z250; 3M ESPE). After 7 days, specimens were prepared by cutting into 1mm beans to mu TBS test performed in a universal testing machine. Fracture mode analysis was performed by using a stereoscopic loupe. The mu TBS data were statistically analyzed by three-way analysis of variance with 95% confidence level and compared by running a Tukey post hoc test (alpha = 0.05). Results: There was no statistically significant difference between triple interaction and double interactions among factors. There was no significant difference between the factors "adhesion,'' "abrasion,'' and "laser.'' Laser irradiation produced significantly lower bond strength values in irradiated groups compared with the non-irradiated ones. All groups had a high percentage of adhesive failures. Conclusions: Abrasion provided no benefit to bond strength of composite resins to bleached enamel. Er, Cr: YSGG (20 Hz, 0.5 W, 3.97 J/cm(2)) treatment reduced the bond strength of composite resins to enamel.

AB The effect of residual and diffusion-induced stresses on corrosion at the interface of coating and substrate has been analyzed within a multidisciplinary approach, i.e., material science, solid mechanics, and electrochemistry. A self-consistent equation for corrosion current density, involving the combined effect of residual stress and diffusion-induced stress is developed. The influences of temperature, moduli ratio, thickness ratio, thermal mismatch ratio, and residual stress gradient of coating and substrate on the corrosion current density are then discussed. Results indicate that when the thermal expansion of coating is greater than substrate, the decrease in temperature from fabrication temperature accounts for the same direction of both the residual and the diffusion stresses. This behavior increases the deflection of the coating-substrate system and results in the evolution of tensile residual stress in the coating. The tensile stress opens the pre-existing coating microcrack, allowing the diffusion of corrosive agents and therefore, accelerating the corrosion damage to the coating/substrate interface. The model is based on experimental observations conducted to understand the behavior of corrosion at the coating/substrate interface in the presence of tensile or compressive residual stresses. At the end, the model was validated against the experimental results showing a good quantitative agreement between the predicted theoretical and experimental trends.

AB Background: Models of hepatitis C virus (HCV) kinetics are increasingly used to estimate and to compare in vivo drug's antiviral effectiveness of new potent anti-HCV agents. Viral kinetic parameters can be estimated using non-linear mixed effect models (NLMEM). Here we aimed to evaluate the performance of this approach to precisely estimate the parameters and to evaluate the type I errors and the power of the Wald test to compare the antiviral effectiveness between two treatment groups when data are sparse and/or a large proportion of viral load (VL) are below the limit of detection (BLD).
   Methods: We performed a clinical trial simulation assuming two treatment groups with different levels of antiviral effectiveness. We evaluated the precision and the accuracy of parameter estimates obtained on 500 replication of this trial using the stochastic approximation expectation-approximation algorithm which appropriately handles BLD data. Next we evaluated the type I error and the power of the Wald test to assess a difference of antiviral effectiveness between the two groups. Standard error of the parameters and Wald test property were evaluated according to the number of patients, the number of samples per patient and the expected difference in antiviral effectiveness.
   Results: NLMEM provided precise and accurate estimates for both the fixed effects and the inter-individual variance parameters even with sparse data and large proportion of BLD data. However Wald test with small number of patients and lack of information due to BLD resulted in an inflation of the type I error as compared to the results obtained when no limit of detection of VL was considered. The corrected power of the test was very high and largely outperformed what can be obtained with empirical comparison of the mean VL decline using Wilcoxon test.
   Conclusion: This simulation study shows the benefit of viral kinetic models analyzed with NLMEM over empirical approaches used in most clinical studies. When designing a viral kinetic study, our results indicate that the enrollment of a large number of patients is to be preferred to small population sample with frequent assessments of VL.

AB Expansion of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and the increasing size and number of wildfires has policy-makers and wildfire managers seeking ways to reduce wildfire risk in communities located near fire-prone forests. It is widely acknowledged that homeowners can reduce their exposure to wildfire risk by using nonflammable building materials and reducing tree density near the home, among other actions. Although these actions can reduce the vulnerability of homes to wildfire, many homeowners do not take them. We examined the influence of risk factors on homeowners' perceived wildfire risk components using a survey of WUI homeowners in central Oregon (USA) and biophysical data that described wildfire risk as predicted by wildfire simulation models, past wildfire, and vegetation characteristics. Our analysis included homeowners' perceptions of the likelihood of wildfire and resulting damage, and examined how these factors contribute to homeowners' likelihood to conduct mitigation actions. We developed an empirical model of homeowners' risk perceptions and mitigation behavior, which served as input into an agent-based model to examine potential landscape and behavior changes over 50 years. We found homeowners' wildfire risk perceptions to be positively correlated with hazardous conditions predicted by fuel models and weakly predictive of mitigation behavior. Homeowners' perceived chance of wildfire was positively correlated with actual probability of wildfire, while their perceived chance of damage to the home was positively correlated with potential wildfire intensity. Wildfire risk perceptions also were found to be correlated with past wildfire experience. Our results suggest that homeowners may be savvy observers of landscape conditions, which act as "feedbacks" that enhance homeowners' concerns about wildfire hazard and motivate them to take mitigation action. Alternatively, homeowners living in hazardous locations are somehow receiving the message that they need to take protective measures. Mitigation compliance output from the agent-based model suggests that completion of mitigation actions is likely to increase over 50 years under various scenarios.

AB Objective. Low pH neutralization and subsequent remnant hydrophilicity can lead to hygroscopic expansion of self-adhesive resin cements (SARCs) after water storage. The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the effects of hygroscopic expansion of SARCs, used as luting and partial core build-up material, on integrity and cement gap thickness increase of all-ceramic CAD/CAM crowns.
   Methods. Human third molars (n = 48) were prepared and anatomical all-ceramic CAD/CAM crowns were manufactured (VITABLOCS Mark II, VITA Zahnfabrik). Crowns internal surfaces were HF etched and silanized. The prepared teeth with their respective crowns were divided into 6 groups (n = 8). In groups 1, 3 and 5 the coronal dentin was removed to simulate a partial core build-up. Groups 1 and 2 were luted with iCEM (Heraeus Kulzer), 3 and 4 with RelyX Unicem 2 Automix (3M), 5 and 6 with Variolink Esthetic DC (Ivoclar Vivadent). All specimens were dual cured and stored in distilled water at 37 degrees C. Crown integrity was controlled at baseline and in regular intervals until 180 days. Cement gap thickness was measured using an optical 3D scanner (ATOS Triple scan, GOM) at baseline and after 180 days. Crown integrity was statistically analysed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and cement gap thickness increase using two-way ANOVA (alpha = 0.05).
   Results. After 180 days storage, crack formation was observed in all specimens of group 1 (mean survival time of 85.5 days), in one specimen of group 2 and in two specimens of group 4. Two-way ANOVA analysis revealed a statistically significant interaction between material type and build-up on cement gap size increase for iCEM.
   Significance. Within the limits of this study, the application of SARCs with low pH neutralization as partial build-up material under CAD/CAM crowns is not recommended for clinical use. (C) 2018 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Quorum sensing (QS) is a process of bacterial communication and cooperation mediated by the release of jointly exploited signals and "public goods" into the environment. There are conflicting reports on the behavior of mutants deficient in the release of these materials. Namely, mutants that appear perfectly viable and capable of outgrowing wild type cells in a closed model system such as a culture flask, may not be viable or invasive on open surfaces such as agar plates. Here we show via agent-based computational simulations that this apparent discrepancy is due to the difference between open and closed systems. We suggest that the experimental difference is due to the fact that wild type cells can easily saturate a well-mixed culture flask with signals and public goods so QS will be not necessary after a certain time point. As a consequence, QS-deficient mutants can continue to grow even after the wild type population has vanished. This phenomenon is not likely to occur in open environments including open surfaces and agar plate models. In other words, even if QS is required for survival, QS deficient mutants may grow faster initially in short term laboratory experiments or computer simulations, while only WT cells appear stable over longer time scales, especially when adaptation to changing environments is important.

AB When the immune system responds to tumour development, patterns of immune infiltrates emerge, highlighted by the expression of immune check-point-related molecules such as PDL1 on the surface of cancer cells. Such spatial heterogeneity carries information on intrinsic characteristics of the tumour lesion for individual patients, and thus is a potential source for biomarkers for anti-tumour therapeutics. We developed a systems biology multiscale agent-based model to capture the interactions between immune cells and cancer cells, and analysed the emergent global behaviour during tumour development and immunotherapy. Using this model, we are able to reproduce temporal dynamics of cytotoxic T cells and cancer cells during tumour progression, as well as three-dimensional spatial distributions of these cells. By varying the characteristics of the neoantigen profile of individual patients, such as mutational burden and antigen strength, a spectrum of pretreatment spatial patterns of PDL1 expression is generated in our simulations, resembling immuno-architectures obtained via immunohistochemistry from patient biopsies. By correlating these spatial characteristics with in silico treatment results using immune checkpoint inhibitors, the model provides a framework for use to predict treatment/biomarker combinations in different cancer types based on cancer-specific experimental data.

AB Objective Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in adolescent patients is often characterized by poor glycemic control. This study aimed at exploring the contribution of learning with computerized simulations to support: (a) mechanistic understanding of the biochemical processes related to diabetes; (b) diabetes self-management knowledge; and (c) glycemic control. We hypothesized that learning with such simulations might support adolescents in gaining a better understanding of the biochemical processes related to glucose regulation, and consequently improve their glycemic control. Methods A prospective case-control study was conducted in 12- to 18-year-old adolescents with T1DM (n = 85) who were routinely treated at an outpatient diabetes clinic. While the control group (n = 45) received the routine face-to-face follow-up, the intervention group (n = 40) learned in addition with computerized simulations that were embedded in pedagogically supportive activities. Participants in both groups completed a set of questionnaires regarding sociodemographic characteristics, diabetes mechanistic reasoning and diabetes self-management. Clinical data and serum glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were gathered from medical records. All the data was collected at recruitment and 3 months later. Results Analysis revealed improvement HbA1c levels in the intervention group (8.7% +/- 1.7%) vs the controls (9.6% +/- 1.6%) after 3 months (P < .05). Regression analysis showed that levels of diabetes mechanistic understanding and diabetes self-management knowledge, in addition to sociodemographic parameters, accounted for 31% of the HbA1c variance (P < .001). Conclusion These results suggest that learning with computerized simulations about biochemical processes can improve adolescents' adherence to medical recommendations and result in improved glycemic control. Implementing scientific learning into the hospital educational setting is discussed.

AB Purpose: To assess the retention of glass FRC posts luted with resin cements after conditioning the canal dentin with different acidic treatments. Methods: Post spaces were prepared in six groups of eight endodontically treated extracted teeth. Glass FRC posts were luted after etching the canal dentin with phosphoric acid and/or applying ED-Primer, Clearfil New Bond or XP Bond. The groups with their respective etching time, primer and cement combinations were as follows. ED: ED-Primer only and Panavia 21; ED15: 15 seconds phosphoric acid treatment, ED-Primer and Panavia 21; NB15: 15 seconds phosphoric acid treatment, Clearfil New Bond and Panavia. 21; NB30: 30 seconds phosphoric acid treatment, Clearfil New Bond and Panavia 21; XP15: 15 seconds phosphoric acid treatment, XP Bond and Calibra; XP30: 30 seconds phosphoric acid treatment, XP Bond and Calibra. Specimens were stored in water for 30 days and subjected to simulated aging conditions. Post retention was measured in tension at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/minute. Analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple range tests were conducted for data analysis. Results: The mean (standard deviation) retention values in Newtons (N) were: ED: 180.9 (44.9); ED15: 278.3 (37.7); NB15: 283.8 (84.9); NB30: 187.7 (60.0), XP15: 216.8 (46.8), XP30: 199.6 (34.0). The retention values of ED15 and NB15 were significantly higher than those of ED and NB30 groups respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between XP Bond groups. Microscopic evaluation of post surfaces demonstrated that the debonding failure was adhesive at the cement-post and cement-dentin interfaces. (Am J Dent 2009;22:376-380).

ID MULTIOBJECTIVE EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION
AB Computational Red teaming (CRT) is a simulation-based optimization application utilized by defense analysts to uncover vulnerabilities of operational plans. In CRT, agent-based simulation models of military scenarios are automatically analyzed and modeled using evolutionary computation techniques. The CRT optimization process aims at identifying simulation models which exhibit emergent system behaviors of interest, e. g., when the adversary (called "Red") breaks the defensive ("Blue") strategies. Numerous multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have been applied to CRT; however, the elitist and converging nature of these Pareto-based optimization algorithms typically leads to the generation of optimal, with respect to the Pareto front, but poorly diversified adversarial operational plans. As a result, the near-optimal alternative strategies are omitted; this considerably limits the applicability of CRT when considering the decision makers point of view. We propose a diversity enhancement scheme for MOEAs which uses the diversity contribution of individual solutions in the aggregated (combining both the objective and decision variable spaces) space to compute the fitness assignment. This feature enables both the exploitation of Pareto-optimal solutions whilst promoting diversification of the solutions in the decision variable space. Our experimental results indicate that this diversity enhancement mechanism can effectively resolve the diversification issue and, ultimately, enhance CRT to assist decision making.

AB This article describes the development of a robust two-dimensional (2D), Group-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (G-QSAR), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and pharmacophore models and the investigation of SAR analysis of 42 triazolinone derivatives reported for angiotensin II (Ang II) AT(1) receptor antagonists using VLife MDS software. Comparing with partial least square (PLS) methodology coupled with various feature selection methods, viz., stepwise and simulated annealing (SA) are applied for the optimization and selection of suitable descriptors for the development of QSAR model for triazolinone derivatives. The study correlates activity measured as pIC(50) values of 42 structurally related triazolinone analogs to several physicochemical parameters representing spatial, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bond acceptor (HAc) and donor (HDr), thermodynamic, and topological fields. The statistically significant best 2D-QSAR model by SA coupled with PLS analysis method showed 88.7 % variation in biological activity and q (2) = 0.7817 with pred_r (2) = 0.8003 with the descriptors like SddsN (nitro) count, SdsCHcount, SsBrcount, SsNH(2)-index, and SssNHE-index. The statistically significant best G-QSAR model having correlation coefficient r (2) = 0.7764 and cross-validated squared correlation coefficient q (2) = 0.6729 with external predictive ability of pred_r (2) = 0.7141 was developed by SA-PLS method. Molecular field analysis was used to construct the best 3D-QSAR model using SA-PLS method, showing good correlative and predictive capabilities in terms q (2) = 0.7811 and pred_r (2) = 0.7597. The results indicated that the steric and spatial parameters significantly influence antagonistic activity. Electron-withdrawing group at aryl moiety R-1 and R-3 positions was found to be an essential feature for Ang II AT(1) receptor. In addition, the pharmacophore model well corroborated with kNN studies as the contours of latter were in good agreement with the 3D orientation of the pharmacophoric features. A five-point pharmacophore with three HAcs one HDr, and one AroC feature (aromatic) was obtained. This information is pertinent for the further design of new antihypertensive agent containing the triazolinone nucleus.

AB Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is considered a potential technique in fifth-generation (5G). Nevertheless, it is relatively complex when applying NOMA to a massive access scenario. Thus, in this paper, a hybrid NOMA/OMA scheme is considered for uplink wireless transmission systems where multiple cognitive users (CUs) can simultaneously transmit their data to a cognitive base station (CBS). We adopt a user-pairing algorithm in which the CUs are grouped into multiple pairs, and each group is assigned to an orthogonal sub-channel such that each user in a pair applies NOMA to transmit data to the CBS without causing interference with other groups. Subsequently, the signal transmitted by the CUs of each NOMA group can be independently retrieved by using successive interference cancellation (SIC). The CUs are assumed to harvest solar energy to maintain operations. Moreover, joint power and bandwidth allocation is taken into account at the CBS to optimize energy and spectrum efficiency in order to obtain the maximum long-term data rate for the system. To this end, we propose a deep actor-critic reinforcement learning (DACRL) algorithm to respectively model the policy function and value function for the actor and critic of the agent (i.e., the CBS), in which the actor can learn about system dynamics by interacting with the environment. Meanwhile, the critic can evaluate the action taken such that the CBS can optimally assign power and bandwidth to the CUs when the training phase finishes. Numerical results validate the superior performance of the proposed scheme, compared with other conventional schemes.

AB Objective: To probe into the effect of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) on color and translucency of human enamel during tooth bleaching. Materials and methods: Twenty enamel slabs were randomly assigned to be whitened by acidic 30% hydrogen peroxide (HP), neutral 30% HP, alkaline 30% HP, and distilled water, respectively, monitored by a colorimeter and Raman spectrometer simultaneously. Afterward, the parameter differences of color, translucency, Raman relative intensity, and LIF intensity between baseline and post-treatment of each bleaching cycle were calculated. Results: The results demonstrated that the three bleaching groups resulted in increasingly prominent whitening outcome over time compared with control group, and no statistical difference was detected between them. Accordingly, the bleaching groups also engendered a same decrease tendency in fluorescence intensity (FI). However, less demineralization effect occurred on the enamel surface in neutral HP group. The correlation analysis further excluded the effect of demineralization on all the optical parameters (p > 0.05). Besides, various degrees of dependency were detected between FI and translucency parameter (TP), masking effect (ME), C*ab, W*, b*. In addition, Delta FI was associated with parameters of Delta C*ab, Delta W*, Delta b*, Delta E, Delta a*, and Delta ME. Delta FI% was correlated with Delta C*ab, Delta b*, Delta W*, and Delta E values. Conclusions: Thirty percent HP with different pH values could result in same variation tendency of enamel color, translucency, and FI. Plus, FI showed a strong association with enamel color and translucency alteration, which is promising for future application as a nondestructive testing method to evaluate bleaching effect and might be a novel way to investigate tooth bleaching mechanism.

AB Cerebral ischemia triggers a multitude of pathophysiological and biochemical events that separately affect the evolution of focal ischemia and, therefore, stroke treatment should logically employ all known neuroprotective agents. We hypothesized that a treatment combining nimodipine and citicoline might have a potential neuroprotective effect. To assess this idea, Sprague-Dawley rats underwent transient bilateral common carotid artery ligation with simultaneous middle cerebral artery occlusion for 60 min. Four treatment groups were established. Animals received either: a) saline (control group); b) intracarotid nimodipine infusion during 30 min in the ischemia-reperfusion (nimodipine group); c) i.p. postischemic citicoline injections once daily for 7 days (citicoline group); or d) intracarotid nimodipine bolus during ischemia-reperfusion plus i.p. postichemic citicoline injections (combination group). They were killed after either 7 or 3 days after reperfusion. In the first case, the volume of the infarcted tissue was studied by a stereological procedure and in the second case, in situ end-labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) and Bcl-2 expression were employed to determine the level of apoptosis. The infarct volume was significantly reduced in both the nimodipine and the citicoline treatment groups after 7 days of reperfusion; combination of both drugs produced an additive effect. After 3 days of reperfusion, the number of Bcl-2-positive neurons was significantly increased while that of TUNEL-positive cells significantly decreased at the infarct border in the combined-treatment animals. Our findings demonstrate a neuroprotective effect from an acute single dose of nimodipine during ischemia-reperfusion and prolonged post-ischemic treatment with citicoline in a model of focal cerebral ischemia. These results suggest that a possible mechanism of neuroprotective action would be mediated by increased Bcl-2 expression and decreased apoptosis within the boundary zone of the infarct together with neutralization of the ischemia-reperfusion injury.

AB Introduction Doxorubicin (DOX) is a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent related to dose-dependent cardiomyopathy. Recent evidence suggests that erythropoietin (EPO) can play a protective role in cardiovascular diseases by non-erythropoietic effects. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that EPO may protect against DOX-induced cardiomyopathy through anti-apoptotic mechanisms both in vitro and in vivo.
   Material and methods Isolated neonatal Wistar rat cardiomyocytes were treated with vehicle, DOX with or without EPO, or EPO. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were used to determine cardiomyocyte apoptosis (TUNEL assay). Cardiomyopathy was induced in Wistar rats by intraperitoneal injections (IP) of DOX (2.5 mg/kg, six times for 2 weeks). EPO (2,500 U/kg, six times for 2 weeks) was administered simultaneously in the DOX+EPO group and the EPO group. Two weeks after the last administration, cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and invasive haemodynamic measurements. Rats were then sacrificed for histological and TUNEL analyses, with immunological detection for cardiac Troponin-T (cTnT), alpha-actinin, Bax and Bcl-2.
   Results EPO significantly ameliorated DOX-induced apoptosis of cultured cardiomyocytes as demonstrated by TUNEL assay. In the rat model, cardiac function significantly decreased in the DOX group. In contrast, the DOX+EPO group showed considerable improvement in cardiac function, inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, reduction of fibrosis, as well as up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that EPO exerts preventive cardioprotective effects on DOX-induced cardiomyopathy via anti-apoptotic pathways. The up-regulation of Bcl-2 protein expression may contribute to this.

AB Objective: Hypovolemia has been shown to decrease the dose requirement for propofol, This increased effect has been explained partially by an increased end organ sensitivity to the anesthetic effect of propofol, We used the opioid blocking agent naloxone to test the hypothesis that endogenous opioids may be involved in this increased sensitivity,
   Subjects: Thirty-two chronically instrumented rats were assigned randomly to either the hypovolemia (n = 16) or the control (n = 16) group.
   Interventions: After pretreatment of each rat in the two groups with either intravenous saline (n = 8) or naloxone (3 mg/kg; n = 8), an intravenous infusion of propofol (150 mg.kg(-1).hr(-1)) was given until 5 secs of electrical suppression of the electroencephalographic signal was observed. Return of righting reflex was used to assess depth of anesthesia, and the propofol blood concentration was determined simultaneously with high-performance liquid chromatography,
   Measurements and Main Results: The mean propofol blood concentrations at the return of righting reflex were significantly lower in the hypovolemic animals compared with the controls within both naloxone-treated (2.1 +/- 0.2 mug/mL vs, 2.9 +/- 0.2 mug/mL; p <.01) and saline-treated (2.2 <plus/minus> 0.1 vs, 3.0 +/- 0.2 mug/mL; p <.01) rats, The mean concentrations were not different between the saline- and naloxone-treated rats either within the hypovolemic group or within the control group.
   Conclusions: The results of our study indicate that it is unlikely that the increased end organ sensitivity to propofol during hypovolemia is mediated by endogenous opioids, because it was not reversed by naloxone.

ID COMPLICATIONS
AB Objective. This study aims to evaluate the frequency of microbial isolates and their susceptibility profiles cultured from clinical samples obtained from 26 simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPK) recipients suspected of infections during the early post-transplantation period.
   Patients and Methods. Data on microbiologic culture of 26 adult patients undergoing SPK were collected prospectively from 2001 to the end of 2006. Isolation and identification of cultured micro-organisms were performed according to standard microbiological procedures and commercially available tests. Susceptibility of the strains to antibacterial agents was made by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.
   Results. All the patients were followed prospectively for the first 4 weeks after surgery. In total, 263 samples from clinical materials obtained from 26 SPK recipients were cultured. Bacterial cultures were positive in 29.3% (n = 77) clinical samples. Of these, 219 microbial strains were cultured. Gram-positive bacteria were found in 64% (n = 140), Gram-negative bacteria in 22.8% (n = 50), and fungal strains were isolated in 13.2% (n = 29). Incidence rate values for subsequent isolation of micro-organisms in the sub-periods of time for decreasing the SPK were Gram-positive bacteria (102.3-18.7; I versus IV), growing the Gram-negative bacteria (14-46.1 I versus III) IV were 14, decreasing to fungi (22.1-1.6, I versus IV). Until now this early post-transplantation period was considered homogeneous time after transplantation. This study shows that this period is actually heterogenous, with statistically significant differences being observed between results obtained in consecutive 4 weeks after transplantation.
   Conclusions. The results of this study show that the incidence rate was elevated with increasing age in the SPK group of patients. In the SPK group, our data showed the highest rate of isolation of micro-organisms compared with recipients of kidneys or liver.

ID DEATH CERTIFICATES
AB Compilation of mortality statistics from death certificate data is based on international and national conventions which in certain situations result in the underlying cause-of-death other than that established and reported by the physician.
   The present study compares all fatal alcohol poisonings in 1997 as registered on forensic toxicological grounds at the accredited central laboratory and as presented in the national cause-of-death statistics, according to the underlying cause-of-death, by applying international statistical rules and principles in ICD-10. Four groups were formed, and case frequencies in each group were obtained from forensic toxicological data, group "T51" for acute poisonings due to alcohol alone, and group "Comb" for acute alcohol poisonings combined with some drug, medicament or other biological substance, and from cause-of-death statistics data, group "X45", for deaths from alcohol poisoning, and group "F102" for those medico-legal fatal alcohol poisoning deaths which at the statistics office were inferred to be due to alcoholism.
   The study shows that in Finland the officially compiled statistics on fatal alcohol poisonings, when compared with medicolegal statements based on forensic toxicological examinations, were underrepresented by 31.4% in 1997. About two-thirds of this underrepresentation is explained by preferring, as the underlying cause-of-death, alcoholism to acute alcohol poisoning, and about one-third by preferring, in cases of acute combined poisonings, the drug component to the alcohol. From 1998 onwards, more emphasis has been put on the alcohol component when coding medico-legally proven accidental deaths from simultaneous poisoning with alcohol and a medicinal agent. This change in coding practices presumably explains the subsequent decline in the annual underrepresentation rate of alcohol poisoning in mortality statistics to the level of 15-16%.
   It is concluded that the present ICD rules inevitably lead to underrepresentation of alcohol poisonings in the mortality statistics, and conceptual and practical proposals for future procedures are made. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A-RESCUE 2.0: A High-Fidelity, Parallel, Agent-Based Evacuation
   Simulator
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID NETWORK MANAGEMENT; MODEL
AB Effective evacuation of residents in hurricane-affected areas is essential in reducing the overall damage and ensuring public safety. However, traffic flow patterns in evacuation contexts is far more complex than normal traffic and is usually accompanied with severe congestion due to the presence of evacuees. In such scenarios, agent-based simulation can accurately capture evacuation traffic patterns, which can be extremely useful in evacuation management. However, existing simulators are not fully capable of simultaneously handling highly detailed household behaviors as well as large-scale traffic in evacuation contexts. In this study, we develop a parallelizable, large-scale version of A-RESCUE (an agent-based regional evacuation simulator coupled with user-enriched behavior) called A-RESCUE 2.0. Detailed household evacuation behaviors are modeled using a comprehensive decision-making module. Computation loads induced by the large number of evacuation vehicles are distributed by a parallelization scheme that involves partitioning the road network into subnetworks such that traffic updates in each subnetwork are simultaneously updated in parallel. Dynamic load balancing among different subnetworks is ensured by periodically repartitioning the network using a mutilevel graph partitioning algorithm. A predictive network-weighing scheme is developed that assigns weights (reflecting computational load) to the roads of a network based on current and predicted future network traffic loadings. An on-demand routing strategy is also developed that allows effective rerouting computation based on changing traffic patterns. A-RESCUE 2.0 is capable of representing nonevacuee background traffic, as well as uncertain events on the network like road closures. In addition, real-time monitoring of traffic patterns is made possible using a visualization module that is connected to the simulator through an efficient data communication layer. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the Miami-Dade County network to validate the applicability of the developed simulator on real-world networks. Findings from experimental tests confirm that the parallelization scheme is effective in improving computational performance.

AB Background: This article presents the results of two randomized, double-blind, controlled studies conducted to compare the efficacy and long-term safety of icodextrin and 2.5% dextrose for the once-daily long dwell in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Methods: Both studies were active-control comparisons of 7.5% icodextrin and 2.5% dextrose for the once-daily long dwell. The efficacy study was a 4-week evaluation of net ultrafiltration and peritoneal clearances of creatinine and urea nitrogen in 175 CAPD patients. The 52-week study in CAPD and APD patients examined the long-term safety of icodextrin and longer term effects, such as body weight and quality of life. Results: Mean net ultrafiltration (587.2 versus 346.2 mL, P < 0.001) and clearances of urea nitrogen (4.5 versus 4.1 mL/min, P < 0.001) and creatinine (4.0 versus 3.5 mL/min, P < 0.001) were increased significantly with icodextrin. Patients receiving icodextrin had no increase in weight after 52 weeks, in contrast to a weight gain of almost 2 kg in the dextrose group (P < 0.05). There were significantly fewer patients reporting edema in the icodextrin group compared with the dextrose group (6.3% versus 17.9%, P < 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between groups for the incidence and severity of adverse events. There were small decreases in sodium and chloride and increases in alkaline phosphatase with icodextrin. Conclusion: Icodextrin provides patients with greater fluid removal and small solute clearance, no weight gain over 52 weeks, and a decreased risk of edema.

AB Objectives. The purpose of this laboratory study was to evaluate the influence of bonding method and type of dental bonding surface on fracture resistance and survival rate of resin bonded occlusal veneers made from lithium disilicate ceramic after cyclic loading.
   Methods. Fourty-eight extracted molars were divided into three groups (N = 16) depending on the preparation: within enamel, within dentin/enamel or within enamel/composite resin filling. Lithium disilicate occlussal veneers were fabricated with a fissure-cusp thickness of 0.3-0.6 mm. Restorations were etched (5% HF), silanated and adhesively luted using a dual curing luting composite resin. Test groups were divided into two subgroups, one using a only a self-etching primer, the other additionally etching the enamel with phosphoric acid. After water storage (37 degrees C; 21 d) and thermocycling (7500 cycles; 5-55 degrees C), specimens were subjected to dynamic loading in a chewing simulator (600,000 cycles; 10 kg/2 Hz). Surviving specimens were loaded until fracture using a universal testing machine.
   Results. All specimens survived artificial aging, several specimens showed some damage. ANOVA revealed that enamel etching provided statistically significantly (p <= 0.05) higher fracture resistance than self-etching when bonding to enamel and dentin. Self-etching provided statistically significant (p <= 0.05) higher fracture resistance for the enamel-composite group than for the enamel group. Enamel etching provided statistically significant (p <= 0.05) higher fracture resistance for the enamel and dentin group than for groups enamel and enamel-composite.
   Significance. Etching enamel improved the fracture resistance of occlusal veneers when bonding to dentin and enamel and increased the survival rate when bonding to enamel. (C) 2019 The Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The concentration of MRI tracers cannot be measured directly by MRI and is commonly evaluated indirectly using their relaxation effect. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical model to describe the transverse relaxation in perfused tissue caused by intravascular tracers. The model takes into account a number of individual compartments. The signal dephasing is simulated in a semianalytical way by embedding Monte Carlo simulations in the framework of analytical theory. This approach yields a tool for fast, realistic simulation of the change in the transverse relaxation. The results indicate that the relaxivity of intravascular contrast agents depends significantly on the host tissue. This agrees with experimental data by Johnson et al. (Magn Reson Med 2000;44:909). In particular, the present results suggest a several-fold increase in the relaxivity of Gd-based contrast agents in brain tissue compared with bulk blood. The enhancement of relaxation in tissue is due to the contrast in magnetic susceptibility between blood vessels and parenchyma induced by the presence of paramagnetic tracer. Beyond the perfusion measurements, the results can be applied to quantitation of functional MRI and to vessel size imaging.

AB Silica-epoxy nanocomposite models were established to investigate the influence of silane coupling agent on the structure and thermomechanical properties of the nanocomposites through molecular dynamics simulation. Results revealed that incorporating silica nanoparticles into a polymer matrix could improve thermomechanical properties of the composites and increase their glass transition temperature and thermal conductivity. Their thermomechanical properties were further enhanced through silane coupling agent modification on the surface of fillers. Compared with that of pure epoxy, the glass transition temperatures of the silica-epoxy composites with grafting ratios of 5% and 10% increased by 17 and 28 K, respectively. The thermal conductivities of the two models at room temperature respectively increased by 60.0% and 67.1%. At higher temperature 450 K, thermal conductivity of the nanocomposite model with a high grafting ratio of 10% demonstrated a considerable increase of approximately 50% over the pure epoxy resin (EP) model. The elastic and shear modulus of the nanocomposite models decreased at temperatures below their glass transition temperatures. These observations were further addressed in the interpretation from three aspects: segmental mobility capability, radial distribution function, and free volume fraction. Our computational results are largely consistent with existing experimental data, and our simulation model got fully validated.

AB Background: Intervention measures have been implemented around the world to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding the dynamics of the disease spread and the effectiveness of the interventions is essential in predicting its future evolution.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to simulate the effect of different social distancing interventions and investigate whether their timing and stringency can lead to multiple waves (subepidemics), which can provide a better fit to the wavy behavior observed in the infected population curve in the majority of countries.
   Methods: We have designed and run agent-based simulations and a multiple wave model to fit the infected population data for many countries. We have also developed a novel Pandemic Response Index to provide a quantitative and objective way of ranking countries according to their COVID-19 response performance.
   Results: We have analyzed data from 18 countries based on the multiple wave (subepidemics) hypothesis and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and were found to describe the data better. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves. Countries imposing fast and stringent interventions exhibit multiple waves with declining peak intensities. This result strongly corroborated with agent-based simulations outcomes. We also provided an estimate of how much lower the number of infections could have been if early and strict intervention measures had been taken to stop the spread at the first wave, as actually happened for a handful of countries. A novel index, the Pandemic Response Index, was constructed, and based on the model's results, an index value was assigned to each country, quantifying in an objective manner the country's response to the pandemic.
   Conclusions: Our results support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic can be successfully modeled as a series of epidemic waves (subepidemics) and that it is possible to infer to what extent the imposition of early intervention measures can slow the spread of the disease.

AB O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is the main cause of tumor cell resistance to DNA-alkylating agents, so it is valuable to design tumor-targeted AGT inhibitors with hypoxia activation. Based on the existing benchmark inhibitor O-6-benzylguanine (O-6-BG), four derivatives with hypoxia-reduced potential and their corresponding reduction products were synthesized. A reductase system consisting of glucose/glucose oxidase, xanthine/xanthine oxidase, and catalase were constructed, and the reduction products of the hypoxia-activated prodrugs under normoxic and hypoxic conditions were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). The results showed that the reduction products produced under hypoxic conditions were significantly higher than that under normoxic condition. The amount of the reduction product yielded from ANBP (2-nitro-6-(3-amino) benzyloxypurine) under hypoxic conditions was the highest, followed by AMNBP (2-nitro-6-(3-aminomethyl)benzyloxypurine), 2-NBP (2-nitro-6-benzyloxypurine), and 3-NBG (O6-(3-nitro)benzylguanine). It should be noted that although the levels of the reduction products of 2-NBP and 3-NBG were lower than those of ANBP and AMNBP, their maximal hypoxic/normoxic ratios were higher than those of the other two prodrugs. Meanwhile, we also investigated the single electron reduction mechanism of the hypoxia-activated prodrugs using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. As a result, the reduction of the nitro group to the nitroso was proven to be a rate-limiting step. Moreover, the 2-nitro group of purine ring was more ready to be reduced than the 3-nitro group of benzyl. The energy barriers of the rate-limiting steps were 34-37 kcal/mol. The interactions between these prodrugs and nitroreductase were explored via molecular docking study, and ANBP was observed to have the highest affinity to nitroreductase, followed by AMNBP, 2-NBP, and 3-NBG. Interestingly, the theoretical results were generally in a good agreement with the experimental results. Finally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to predict the AGT-inhibitory activity of the four prodrugs and their reduction products. In summary, simultaneous consideration of reduction potential and hypoxic selectivity is necessary to ensure that such prodrugs have good hypoxic tumor targeting. This study provides insights into the hypoxia-activated mechanism of nitro-substituted prodrugs as AGT inhibitors, which may contribute to reasonable design and development of novel tumor-targeted AGT inhibitors.

TI Combination of learning from non-optimal demonstrations and feedbacks
   using inverse reinforcement learning and Bayesian policy improvement
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Teaching by demonstrations; Inverse reinforcement learning; Interactive
   learning; Human evaluative feedbacks
AB Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a powerful tool for teaching by demonstrations, provided that sufficiently diverse and optimal demonstrations are given, and learner agent correctly perceives those demonstrations. These conditions are hard to meet in practice; as a trainer cannot cover all possibilities by demonstrations, he may partially fail to follow the optimal behavior. Also, trainer and learner have different perceptions of the environment including trainer's actions. A practical way to overcome these problems is using a combination of trainer's demonstrations and feedbacks.
   We propose an interactive learning approach to overcome the challenge of non-optimal demonstrations by integrating human evaluative feedbacks with the IRL process, given sufficiently diverse demonstrations and the domain transition model. To this end, we develop a probabilistic model of human feedbacks and iteratively improve the agent policy using Bayes rule. We then integrate this information in an extended IRL algorithm to enhance the learned reward function.
   We examine the developed approach in one experimental and two simulated tasks; i.e., a grid world navigation, a highway car driving system and a navigation task by the e-puck robot. Obtained results show significant improved efficiency of the proposed approach in face of having different levels of non-optimality in demonstrations and the number of evaluative feedbacks.

AB Background: Meningococcal C (MenC) conjugate vaccines have controlled invasive diseases associated with this serogroup in countries where they are included in National Immunization Programs and also in an extensive catch-up program involving subjects up to 20 years of age. Catch-up was important, not only because it prevented disease in adolescents and young adults at risk, but also because it decreased transmission of the bacteria, since it was in this age group where the organism was circulating. Our objective is to develop a new vaccination schedule to achieve maximum seroprotection in these groups.
   Methods: A recent study has provided detailed age-structured information on the seroprotection levels against MenC in Valencia (Spain), where vaccination is routinely scheduled at 2 months and 6 months, with a booster dose at 18 months of age. A complementary catch-up campaign was also carried out in n for children from 12 months to 19 years of age. Statistical analyses of these data have provided an accurate picture on the evolution of seroprotection in the last few years.
   Results: An agent-based model has been developed to study the future evolution of the seroprotection histogram. We have shown that the optimum strategy for achieving high protection levels in all infants, toddlers and adolescents is a change to a 2 months, 12 months and 12 years of age vaccination pattern. If the new schedule were implemented in January 2014, high-risk subjects between 15-19 years of age would have very low seroprotection for the next 6 years, thereby threatening the program.
   Conclusions: High protection levels and a low incidence of meningococcal C disease can be achieved in the future by means of a cost-free change in vaccination program. However, we recommend a new catch-up program simultaneous to the change in regular vaccination program.

AB Minocycline and candesartan have both shown promise as candidate therapeutics in ischemic stroke, with multiple, and somewhat contrasting, molecular mechanisms. Minocycline is an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic agent and a known inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Yet, minocycline exerts antiangiogenic effects both in vivo and in vitro. Candesartan promotes angiogenesis and activates MMPs. Aligning these therapies with the dynamic processes of injury and repair after ischemia is likely to improve success of treatment. In this study, we hypothesize that opposing actions of minocycline and candesartan on angiogenesis, when administered simultaneously, will reduce the benefit of candesartan treatment. Therefore, we propose a sequential combination treatment regimen to yield a better outcome and preserve the proangiogenic potential of candesartan. In vitro angiogenesis was assessed using human brain endothelial cells. In vivo, Wistar rats subjected to 90-min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) were randomized into four groups: saline, candesartan, minocycline, and sequential combination of minocycline and candesartan. Neurobehavioral tests were performed 1, 3, 7, and 14 days after stroke. Brain tissue was collected on day 14 for assessment of infarct size and vascular density. Minocycline, when added simultaneously, decreased the proangiogenic effect of candesartan treatment in vitro. Sequential treatment, however, preserved the proangiogenic potential of candesartan both in vivo and in vitro, improved neurobehavioral outcome, and reduced infarct size. Sequential combination therapy with minocycline and candesartan improves long-term recovery and maintains candesartan's proangiogenic potential.

AB This paper proposes a behavior-switching control strategy of an evolutionary robot based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and genetic algorithm (GA). This method is able not only to construct the reinforcement learning models for autonomous robots and evolutionary robot modules that control behaviors and reinforcement learning environments, and but also to perform the behavior-switching control and obstacle avoidance of an evolutionary robot in the unpredictable environments with the static and moving obstacles by combining ANN and GA.
   The experimental results have demonstrated that our method can perform the decision-making strategy and parameter setup optimization of ANN and GA by learning and can effectively escape from a trap of local minima, avoid motion deadlock status of humanoid soccer robotic agents, and reduce the oscillation of the planned trajectory among the multiple obstacles by crossover and mutation. We have successfully applied some results of the proposed algorithm to our simulation humanoid robotic soccer team CIT3D which won the 1st prize of RoboCup Championship and ChinaOpen2010 and the 2nd place of the official RoboCup World Championship on 5-11, July 2011 in Istanbul, Turkey.
   In comparison with the conventional behavior network and the adaptive behavior method, our algorithm simplified the genetic encoding complexity, improved the convergence rate. and the network performance.

AB In this study, we have carried out a combined experimental and computational investigation to elucidate several bred-in-the-bone ideas standing out in rational design of novel cationic surfactants as antibacterial agents. Five 3-hydroxypyridinium salts differing in the length of N-alkyl side chain have been synthesized, analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography, tested for in vitro activity against a panel of pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains, computationally modeled in water by a SCRF B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) method, and evaluated by a systematic QSAR analysis. Given the results of this work, the hypothesis suggesting that higher positive charge of the quaternary nitrogen should increase antimicrobial efficacy can be rejected since 3-hydroxyl group does increase the positive charge on the nitrogen but, simultaneously, it significantly derogates the antimicrobial activity by lowering the lipophilicity and by escalating the desolvation energy of the compounds in comparison with non-hydroxylated analogues. Herein, the majority of the prepared 3-hydroxylated substances showed notably lower potency than the parent pyridinium structures, although compound 8 with C-12 alkyl chain proved a distinctly better antimicrobial activity in submicromolar range.

AB Magnetic core-shell Fe3O4@HAp nanoparticles (NPs) with a different HAp amount were synthesized using an original approach based on co-precipitation method combined with hydrothermal treatment (HTT) at temperatures range from 140 to 240 degrees C.
   NP morphological parameters were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electronic microscopy (TEM), specific surface area estimation (SSA), Mossbauer spectroscopy. As-prepared core-shell NPs are characterized by a narrow size distribution and the presence of magnetite and hydroxyapatite phase was shown. The trend of HAp amount - shell thickness dependence rely on HTT conditions which is probably due to the acceleration of crystallization process rate at higher temperatures. Core-shell NPs obtained at low temperatures possess a uniform shell with equal crystallinity and were further under study.
   The saturation magnetization of core-shell NPs is linearly decreasing with the increase of HAp amount from 68 emu/g (bare Fe3O4 core) to 52 emu/g (Fe3O4@20HAp). All the samples exhibited superparamagnetic behavior, the blocking temperature linear dependence on shell thickness was demonstrated.
   Computer simulation of blocking temperature dependence on shell thickness revealed the impact of the shell on the anisotropy constant and consequently on blocking temperature.
   To evaluate the efficiency of the core-shell NPs as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the samples with different HAp amount in agarose matrix were investigated. Images obtained with core-shell NPs are insignificantly less dark comparing with images obtained with bare NPs, but a higher value of T2/T1 ratio was achieved. Therefore, it can be concluded that as-prepared magnetic core-shell Fe3O4@HAp NPs can be considered as an effective contrast agent for MRI applications.

AB The present investigation was aimed to prepare inclusion complexes of a therapeutically important non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, etodolac (ETD) with hydroxypropyl-beta-cydodextrin (HP-beta-CD) and to study the effect of l-arginine (L-Arg) as an auxiliary agent on the complexation efficiency of HP-beta-CD to improve aqueous solubility and the dissolution property of ETD. The binary and ternary complexes were prepared by physical mixing, coevaporation, and spray drying methods. The complexes "were characterized using differential scanning colorimetry (DSC), Fourier transforin-infrared spectroscopy(FT-IR), and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies. The mechanism of inclusion interaction of guest and host was established through H-1 NMR, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics studies. On the basis of preliminary screening studies, L-Arg was found to be the most efficient auxiliary agent for the present research problem. The change in crystallinity of ETD was evident from DSC and PXRD studies which indicated the formation of new solid forms. A remarkable increase in apparent stability; constant (K-c) and complexation efficiency (CE) of HP-beta-CD was observed in the presence of L-Arg in ternary complexes;with improvement in solubility and dissolution of ETD than binary complexes. However, inclusion complexes of ETD obtained by computational studies is in good correlation with the results obtained through experimental methods. More stable complex formation with L-Arg was confirmed by molecular simulation studies too. Thus, the present study led to the conclusion that the ternary complex of ETD-HP-beta-CD-L-Arg could be an innovative approach to augment the solubility and dissolutiori behavior of ETD.

ID DNA NANOSTRUCTURES; SIMULATION; SETS
AB The (abstract) Tile Assembly Model (aTAM), is a mathematical paradigm for the study and algorithmic design of DNA self-assembly systems. It employs the use of so-called DNA tiles, which are abstractions of experimentally achievable DNA nanostructure complexes with similar inter-matching behaviours. To this day, there are about half-dozen different experimental implementations of DNA tiles and their sub-sequent algorithmic assembly into larger complexes, see e.g. Reif et al. (2012) [29]. In order to provide further insight into the assembly process, the aTAM model has been extended to a kinetic counterpart (kTAM). Although there is a wide abundance of different variants of the abstract model, e.g., stage, step, hierarchical, temperature-k, signal-passing, etc. (see e.g. Patitz (2012) [22]), numerical simulations of the kinetic counterpart have been performed only for a few types of these systems. This might be due to the fact that the numerical models and simulations of kTAM were almost exclusively implemented using classical stochastic simulation algorithms frameworks, which are not designed for capturing models with theoretically un-bounded number of species. In this paper we introduce an agent- and rule-based modelling approach for kTAM, and its implementation on NFsim, one of the available platfonris for such type of modelling. We show not only how the modelling of kTAM can be implemented, but we also explore the advantages of this modelling framework for kinetic simulations of kTAM and the easy way such models can be updated and modified. We present numerical comparisons both with classical numerical simulations of kTAM, as well as comparison in between four different kinetic variant of the TAM model, all implemented in NFsim as stand-alone rule-based models.

AB 1,1-bis(tert-Butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane (TMCH) is commonly used as a crosslinking agent or an initiator of the heat-curing agent for polybutadiene rubber. Metal ions that remain in the pipelines or containers of manufacturing processes may affect the thermal stability of the organic peroxides. Moreover, pipelines or metal containers may contain some metal ions because of inner corrosive chemicals or surface deterioration, which may induce a chemical reaction, while TMCH is mixed with them. To avoid these unexpected chemical reactions, we focused on the thermal hazard analysis of TMCH mixed with metal ions, such as nickel(II) bromide or copper(II) bromide. The experiments can determine thermokinetic parameters, including exothermic onset temperature (T (0)), maximum temperature (T (max)), and heat of decomposition (Delta H (d)), under non-isothermal conditions by differential scanning calorimetry. Non-isothermal experimental results combined with isoconversional kinetic analysis can acquire further safety parameters, such as apparent activation energy (E (a)) and time to maximum heating rate. The results of this study could be used as a proactive case for the storage of TMCH mixed with metal ions.

AB In the current work, a full factorial experimental design was utilized to formulate piroxicam into orodispersible films while investigating the effects of some formulation factors on the properties of the resulting films. These factors were (A) the casting solvent: water and acetone/water mixture; (B) the film-forming agent: HPMC K4M and Na-alginate; (C) the solubilization system: no solubilizer, L-arginine, poloxamer and L-arginine/poloxamer mixture. Sixteen formulation runs were prepared by solvent casting method to obtain 10 mg piroxicam dosage units. Drug particle size in the prepared formulations and dissolution efficiency at 30 min were selected as responses variables. Additionally, the prepared films from each formulation were evaluated for other characters as drug content, thickness, residual water horizontal ellipsis etc. A selected formulation was then evaluated for its in vivo disintegration, palatability and stability. Utilizing acetone in the casting solution, Na-alginate as film-forming agent or both of them resulted in formation of films with larger drug particles and slower dissolution. Combined use of L-arginine and poloxamer showed better drug dissolution than using each alone. HPMC was more favorable than Na-alginate regarding mechanical properties and moisture absorption. Films from the selected formulation showed fast in vivo disintegration and acceptable palatability. These films were stable for 6 months under accelerated storage conditions. According to the computer simulation using GastroPlus (TM), the in vitro/in vivo behavior of piroxicam in the tested formulation was similar to that of an immediate-release formulation containing BCS class I drug. The selected formulation is therefore would satisfy the WHO perquisites for applying the biowaiver.

AB In this paper, a novel swarm optimization algorithm called the Selfish Herd Optimizer (SHO) is proposed for solving global optimization problems. SHO is based on the simulation of the widely observed selfish herd behavior manifested by individuals within a herd of animals subjected to some form of predation risk. In SHO, individuals emulate the predatory interactions between groups of prey and predators by two types of search agents: the members of a selfish herd (the prey) and a pack of hungry predators. Depending on their classification as either a prey or a predator, each individual is conducted by a set of unique evolutionary operators inspired by such prey-predator relationship. These unique traits allow SHO to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation without altering the population size. To illustrate the proficiency and robustness of the proposed method, it is compared to other well-known evolutionary optimization approaches such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Differential Evolution (DE), Genetic Algorithms (GA), Crow Search Algorithm (CSA), Dragonfly Algorithm (DA), Moth-flame Optimization Algorithm (MOA) and Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA). The comparison examines several standard benchmark functions, commonly considered within the literature of evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results show the remarkable performance of our proposed approach against those of the other compared methods, and as such SHO is proven to be an excellent alternative to solve global optimization problems.

AB Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that affects 20 million people worldwide and the mortality rate is two or three times higher than the average overall population mainly due to high frequency of suicide and other associated comorbidities. The therapeutic approaches used for its treatment, besides do not combat this illness, trigger several side effects, being imperative the development of new medical countermeasures. In the search for new agents, we constructed a statistical model (model A) with a series of aripiprazole-derived using the partial least squares technique, and posteriorly we applied several validation tests to guarantee consistency of model A and its forecasting ability. In addition, molecular docking simulations were employed to extract important information on structural elements involved in the molecular recognition process from receptor-ligand complex. We designed new compounds whose biological activity values were predicted by our model. Among new designed molecules, we highlight compounds 2, 5, 9, and 11 with predicted pK(i) values over 8.5. We underline that the presence of ester moieties attached to the aromatic ring from region A is well tolerated in this position and contributes to increase the pK(i) values; otherwise it is essential that there are no bulky groups in region C. Finally, ADME/Tox properties evaluated via in silico approach for the proposed compounds shed light on their drug-likeness characteristics, indicating that they could be a reliable starting point as potent candidates to further experimental exploration (chemical synthesis, in vitro and in vivo analyses).

AB Homogenization is very efficient tool in modeling of complex phenomena in heterogeneous media due to different length scales between the characteristic length of the microstructural features and the actual macroscale dimensions. This is particularly important when dealing with voided composite structures due to the high degree of microstructural irregularity. One of the challenges in designing polymeric porous or voided structures is the absence of accurate and robust viscoelastic homogenization technique that takes into account the microstructural details. Another challenge underlies in constructing the microstructure for numerical homogenization. This work proposes reduced 3D reconstruction procedure of voided composite structures based on statistical considerations and granular mechanics. Voids' diameters and fractions of the actual microstructure were extracted with a deterministic locally adaptive thresholding technique. The diameters were categorized with Freedman-Diaconis method but preserving the overall voids' fractions. The simulation box was then created from the reduced voids' diameters and fractions with granular mechanics. Numerical experiments were conducted with periodic boundary conditions to the walls of the simulation box. Voided structures of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) were fabricated with physical foaming agent and tested for creep compliance to validate the proposed procedure. The agreement with experimental results for creep compliance is very good with maximum error of 8.62%. The contribution of the procedure is attributed to the simplicity and accuracy in developing representative voided structures from SEM images which otherwise need to be extracted from tedious processes like X-ray microtomography reconstruction.

AB Carboxyl-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs-COOH) and the amine-functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs-NH2) were incorporated into the surface sizing agent of carbon fibers respectively, for modifying the interface between the fibers and the matrix. Experimental analyses of the interfacial shear strength, flexural properties, and inter-laminar shear strength revealed the beneficial effects of the CNTs-COOH and negative impacts of the CNTs-NH2 on the interfacial and mechanical properties of the resulting composites. These results were contrary to the effects of CNTs doped into the epoxy matrix of composites. Furthermore, a molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the mechanism of these performances from the viewpoint of the molecular structure, revealing that the interface between the CNT-sized carbon fibers and the epoxy was driven by multiple factors, including the CNT-epoxy interfacial binding energy (IBE), the packing density of the molecular chains, and the steric hindrance of the functionalized CNTs. According to these analyses, two kinds of functionalized CNTs showed different effects at the interface between carbon fiber and resin: the CNTs-COOH on the surface of the carbon fiber tightly bonded to the epoxy and provided effective load transfer between the matrix and fibers, whereas the agglomeration of the CNTs-NH2, the lower IBE between the CNTs-NH2 and the epoxy resin, and the steric hindrance produced by amine functional groups of the CNTs-NH2, resulting in hardly inhibiting the crack growth of the matrix under stress.

AB Underground coal gasification (UCG) allows in situ conversion of unmineable coal deposits into a combustible gas. UCG involves a number of steps, including combustion, oxidation-reduction (REDOX) reactions, pyrolysis, and drying, within the gasification channel at high temperatures. Pyrolysis, in particular, plays a vital role in UCG. We herein investigated the pyrolysis behavior of lump lignite from Inner Mongolia, China, and investigated the influence of pyrolysis on the swelling behavior of the lump lignite. The samples (50 x 40 x 40 mm(3)) were studied at a heating rate of 3 degrees C/min. The resulting chars were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. In addition, the composition of the pyrolysis gas released from lump lignite was compared with that released from particle lignite (particle diameter =1 mm). The results showed that obvious swelling between 100 and 600 degrees C, followed by subtle swelling events between 600 and 900 degrees C. The concentrations of H-2 and CO gases in lump lignite were higher than those in particle lignite when exposed to elevated temperatures, and the main functional groups disappeared at high temperatures due to thermal cracking. Consequently, pyrolysis occurring in the gasification channel converted the coal around the channel into a highly porous char whose permeability aided the transport of gasification agents and product gases in coal seam.

AB That recommendation agents (RAs) can substantially improve consumers' decision making is well understood. Far less understood is the influence of specific design attributes of the RA interface on decision making and other outcome measures. We investigate a novel design for an RA interface that enables it to interactively demonstrate trade-offs among product attribute values (i.e., trade-off transparency feature) to improve consumers' perceived product diagnosticity and perceived enjoyment. We also examine the extent to which the trade-offs among product attribute values should be revealed to the user. Further, based on the stimulus organism-response model, we develop a theoretical model that extends the effort-accuracy framework by proposing perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity as two antecedents for perceived decision quality and perceived decision effort, respectively. In an experimental study, we find that (1) the trade-off transparency feature significantly affects perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity, (2) perceived enjoyment and perceived product diagnosticity follow an inverted U-shaped curve as the level of trade-off transparency increases, (3) although users spend more time understanding attribute trade-offs with the trade-off transparency feature, they are more efficient in selecting a product, (4) perceived enjoyment simultaneously leads to better perceived decision quality and lower perceived decision effort, and (5) perceived product diagnosticity leads to better perceived decision quality without compromising perceptions of decision effort. Theoretically, this study increases our understanding of how the design of an RA interface can improve consumers' product diagnosticity and enjoyment, and proposes two antecedents to improve perceived decision quality and reduce perceived decision effort. For design practitioners, our results indicate the importance of providing the trade-off transparency design feature to potential consumers.

AB Fibril formation by the Alzheimer's beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide in brain tissue is integral to the Alzheimer's disease pathology. Understanding the conformational properties and the mechanisms triggering aggregation of the AP peptides, at an atomic level of detail, is of crucial importance for the design of effective therapeutic agents against this disease. In this work, the conformational transitions and dynamic properties of an amyloidogenic peptide fragment (A beta(10-35)) were studied by molecular dynamics simulations in systems modeling infinite dilution and the presence of macromolecular crowding agents (CA). The model system consists of the peptide described with an atomistic force field, the CA represented by inert, quasi-hard spheres and a continuum solvent model. This combined model allowed the simulations to be extended to 100 ns each. Simulations were carried out starting from a completely extended structure, a beta-strand structure, and four nuclear magnetic resonance structures in dilute aqueous solution. For all structures, two additional simulations were performed that included the inert CA in the solution and occupied approx 30 and 40% of the volume, respectively. For two of the nuclear magnetic resonance structures, additional simulations were carried out with 35% volume fraction of CA to further examine the diffusive behavior of the peptide. The peptide adopted a collapsed coil conformation in all simulations. The results of the simulations in dilute solution showed reasonable qualitative agreement with experimental and other simulation results, whereas the presence of volume excluding agents resulted in some distinct changes in properties (e.g., an increase in the appearance of transient beta-structure or decreases in diffusivity with increasing CA concentration). At the same time, internal motion such as order parameters or atomic root mean square fluctuations showed less systematic responses to volume exclusion.

AB The sterically hindered, 1,1-disubstituted monomers di-n-butyl itaconate (DBI), dicyclobexyl itaconate (DCHI), and dimethyl itaconate (DMI) were polymerized with reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) free-radical polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Cumyl dithiobenzoate, cumyl phenyl dithioacetate, 2-eyanoprop-2-yl dithiobenzoate, 4-cyanopentanoic acid dithiobenzoate, and S-methoxycarbonylphenylmethyl dithiobenzoate were employed as RAFT agents to mediate a series of polymerizations at 60 degrees C yielding polymers ranging in their number-average molecular weight from 4500 to 60,000 g mol(-1). The RAFT polymerizations of these hindered monomers displayed hybrid living behavior (between conventional and living free-radical polymerization) of various degrees depending on the molecular structure of the initial RAFT agent. In addition, DCHI was polymerized via ATRP with a CuCl/methyl benzoate/N,N,N ',N '',N ''-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine/cyclohexanone system at 60 degrees C. Both the ATRP and RAFT polymerization of the hindered monomers displayed living characteristics; however, broader than expected molecular weight distributions were observed for the RAFT systems (polydispersity index = 1.15-3.35). To assess the cause of this broadness, chain-transfer-to-monomer constants for DMI, DBI, and DCHI were determined (1.4 x 10(-3), 1.3 X 10(-3), and 1.0 x 10(-3), respectively) at 60 degrees C. Simulations carried out with the PRE-DICI program package suggested that chain transfer to monomer contributed to the broadening process. In addition, the experimental results indicated that viscosity had a pronounced effect on the broadness of the molecular weight distributions. (c) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Most cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries exhibit a low electronic conductivity. Hence, a significant amount of conductive graphitic additives are introduced during electrode production. The mechanical stability and electronic connection of the electrode is enhanced by a mixed phase formed by the carbon and binder materials. However, this mixed phase, the carbon binder domain (CBD), hinders the transport of lithium ions through the electrolyte pore network. Thus, reducing the performance at higher currents. In this work we combine microstructure resolved simulations with impedance measurements on symmetrical cells to identify the influence of the CBD distribution. Microstructures of NMC622 electrodes are obtained through synchrotron X-ray tomography. Resolving the CBD using tomography techniques is challenging. Therefore, three different CBD distributions are incorporated via a structure generator. We present results of microstructure resolved impedance spectroscopy and lithiation simulations, which reproduce the experimental results of impedance spectroscopy and galvanostatic lithiation measurements, thus, providing a link between the spatial CBD distribution, electrode impedance, and half-cell performance. The results demonstrate the significance of the CBD distribution and enable predictive simulations for battery design. The accumulation of CBD at contact points between particles is identified as the most likely configuration in the electrodes under consideration. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Mimicry is one of the oldest concepts in biology, but it still presents many puzzles and continues to be widely debated. Simulation of wasps with a yellow-black abdominal pattern by other insects (commonly called "wasp mimicry") is traditionally considered a case of resemblance of unprofitable by profitable prey causing educated predators to avoid models and mimics to the advantage of both (Figure 1a). However, as wasps themselves are predators of insects, wasp mimicry can also be seen as a case of resemblance to one's own potential antagonist. We here propose an additional hypothesis to Batesian and Mullerian mimicry (both typically involving selection by learning vertebrate predators; cf. Table 1) that reflects another possible scenario for the evolution of multifold and in particular very accurate resemblances to wasps: an innate, visual inhibition of aggression among look-alike wasps, based on their social organization and high abundance. We argue that wasp species resembling each other need not only be Mullerian mutualists and that other insects resembling wasps need not only be Batesian mimics, but an innate ability of wasps to recognize each other during hunting is the driver in the evolution of a distinct kind of masquerade, in which model, mimic, and selecting agent belong to one or several species (Figure 1b). Wasp mimics resemble wasps not (only) to be mistaken by educated predators but rather, or in addition, to escape attack from their wasp models. Within a given ecosystem, there will be selection pressures leading to masquerade driven by wasps and/or to mimicry driven by other predators that have to learn to avoid them. Different pressures by guilds of these two types of selective agents could explain the widely differing fidelity with respect to the models in assemblages of yellow jackets and yellow jacket look-alikes.

AB Statement of problem. A consensus on whether or how to treat eroded dentin to bond to composite resins is lacking. The role of gels containing chlorhexidine (CHX), epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), and proanthocyanidin (PAC) in controlling erosive wear progression needs to be evaluated for bonding.
   Purpose. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of gels containing antiproteolytic agents (CHX or EGCG) or an antiproteolytic and also collagen crosslinking agent (PAC) to control tooth wear progression on the microtensile bond strength (mu TBS) of an adhesive system plus a composite resin to simulated eroded dentin.
   Material and methods. Superficial occlusal dentin surfaces obtained from sectioned third molars were ground with SiC paper (600-grit; 1 minute; N-normal dentin) or subsequently submitted to an initial erosive challenge (Coca-Cola; 5 minutes). They then received one of the following treatments: application of a placebo (P), a 0.12% CHX digluconate, an EGCG at 400 mu M, or a 10% PAC gel (vehicle: hydroxyethylcellulose, propylene glycol, methylparaben, imidazolidinyl urea, and deionized water; active principle: as per the experimental groups when applicable) or no treatment (C: control). Initially demineralized dentin was also submitted to pH cycling (Coca-Cola; 5 minutes, 3x/day, 5 days) to simulate eroded dentin (E). After acid etching all the specimens, adhesive Adper Single Bond 2 was applied, and composite resin (Filtek Z350 XT) was placed. After 24 hours storage in distilled water at 37 degrees C, the specimens were sectioned into beams, and the mTBS was tested at 0.5 mm/minute. The mTBS values obtained were evaluated considering each tooth as an experimental unit, and 2-way ANOVA and the Tukey post hoc test for multiple comparisons were applied (alpha=.05).
   Results. Immediate mTBS values for the eroded dentin were always lower than those for the normal dentin, irrespective of whether any of the gels were applied for wear control.
   Conclusions. CHX, EGCG, PAC, and placebo gels, applied after the initial demineralization and before the pH cycling to simulate the eroded dentin, had a similar effect on the mTBS of the adhesive system plus the composite resin to simulated eroded dentin when compared with nonapplication (control).

AB In this paper, foam-assisted CO2 EOR and anti-gas channelling technology are investigated and optimized to enhance tight oil recovery. A series of laboratory experiments, including pressure - volume - temperature, foam generation and evaluation, and coreflood tests, and phase behaviour theoretical mathematical models are performed to evaluate foam agent, analyze anti-gas channelling mechanisms and influential factors, and optimize foam-assisted CO2 EOR technique. The specific CO2 bulk fluid behaviour and phase behaviour in wellbore are determined through experimental and theoretical models. Two distinct stages are found to be divided prior to and after the CO2 gas breakthrough. Most oil productions, which is in the range of 28-40%, occur prior to the gas breakthrough, whereas only additional 5-8% oil is produced after the gas breakthrough. A higher injection rate and/or permeability ratio result in an earlier gas breakthrough and causes less oil to be produced before gas breakthrough while the oil recovery factor slightly increases after the breakthrough by increasing injection rate. Gas diffusion in water-saturated core reach equilibrium faster than that in the oil-saturated core. An overall evaluation parameter is developed to select foam agent. The optimized static condition for the selected foam agent here is approximately 9 MPa at low temperatures while dynamic performance is improved at a higher gas but lower liquid injection rate. The simultaneous water-alternating-gas injection scheme in subsequent of an initial gas injection with liquid - gas ratio of 1:1 performs better than the water-alternating-gas scheme, which is proven to be effective for the core samples with fracture width of 82.67 mu m. Finally, the oilfield surface foaming operational system is designed to upscale laboratory research to practical applications with specific operating setup and procedures, which has been applied in the target oil reservoir and performs well as expected.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that chondrocytes are more responsive to the chondroprotective agents, glucosamine (glcN) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), under in vitro conditions simulating in vivo joint stress.
   Design: Synthetic and anticatabolic activities of bovine articular cartilage were assayed using 35-sulfate labeling and assaying the specific activity of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) under the conditions of enzyme-induced matrix depletion, heat stress, mechanical compression and cytokine stress.
   Results: The response of cartilage to simulated conditions of in vivo stress varies, depending on the type stress and age of the animal. Cartilage from aged animals was more responsive to stress and to glcN and CS. Pronase-induced matrix depletion and mechanical stress increased proteoglycan synthetic activity. Exposure to glcN and CS significantly enhanced this stress response from 85 to 191% and from 40 to 1000%, respectively. Heat stress and stromelysin digestion decreased synthetic activity, which was reversed or normalized on exposure to glcN and CS. Cartilage from young joints was somewhat refractory to the level of stress imposed and to treatment with glcN and CS.
   Conclusion: The metabolic response of cartilage from aged animals to glcN and CS under simulated conditions of in vivo stress is significantly greater than that seen in nonstressed or young tissue. By enhancing the 'protective' metabolic response of chondrocytes to stress, glcN and CS may improve its ability for repair and regeneration. These observations suggest that these compounds function as biological response modifiers (BRMs), agents which boost natural protective responses of tissues under adverse environmental conditions.

AB High-throughput microarray technology has enabled the simultaneous measurement of the abundance of tens of thousands of gene-expression levels, opening up a new variety of opportunities in both basic and applied biological research. In the wealth of genomic data produced so far, the analysis of massive volume of data sets has become a challenging part of this innovative approach. In this study, a series of microarray experimental data from Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis), the etiologic agent of plague in humans, were analyzed to investigate the effect of the treatments with quorum-sensing signal molecules (autoinducer-2 and acyl-homoserine lactones) and mutation (Delta ypeIR, Delta yspIR, and Delta luxS) on the variation of gene-expression levels. The gene-expression data have been systematically analyzed to find potentially important genes for vaccine development by means of a coordinated use of statistical learning algorithms, that is, principal component analysis (PCA), gene shaving (GS), and self-organizing map (SOM). The results achieved from the respective methods, the lists of genes identified as differentially expressed, were combined to minimize the risk that might arise when using a single method. The commonly detected genes from multiple data mining methods, which reflect the linear/nonlinear dimensionality and similarity measure in gene-expression space, were taken into account as the most significant group. In conclusion, tens of potentially biologically significant genes were identified out of over 4000 genes of Y. pestis. The "active" genes discovered in this study will provide information on bacterial genetic targets important for the development of novel vaccines.

AB Osteoporosis is a bone disease characterized by brittle bone and increased fracture incidence. With ageing societies worldwide, the disease presents a high burden on health systems. Furthermore, there are limited treatments for osteoporosis with just two anabolic pharmacological agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. Healthy bones are believed to be maintained via an intricate relationship between dual biochemical and mechanical (bio-mechanical) stimulations. It is widely considered that osteoporosis emerges as a result of disturbances to said relationship. The mechanotransduction process is key to this balance, and disruption of its dynamics in bone cells plays a role in osteoporosis development. Nonetheless, the exact details and mechanisms that drive and secure the health of bones are still elusive at the cellular and molecular scales. This study examined the dual modulation of mechanical stimulation and mechanotransduction activation dynamics in an osteoblast (OB). The aim was to find patterns of mechanotransduction dynamics demonstrating a significant change that can be mapped to alterations in the OB responses, specifically at the level of gene expression and osteogenic markers such as alkaline phosphatase. This was achieved using a three-dimensional hybrid multiscale computational model simulating mechanotransduction in the OB and its interaction with the extracellular matrix, combined with a numerical analytical technique. The model and the analysis method predict that within the noise of mechanotransduction, owing to modulation of the bio-mechanical stimulus and consequent gene expression, there are unique events that provide signatures for a shift in the system's dynamics. Furthermore, the study uncovered molecular interactions that can be potential drug targets.

AB BACKGROUND; In this study, simultaneous photocatalytic degradation of four fluoroquinolone (FQ) compounds (i.e. ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin) was investigated in TiO2 suspensions under simulated solar light irradiation. Effects of experimental variables including pH, TiO2 dosage, initial substrate concentration and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the degradation processes were also investigated.
   RESULTS: The antibiotics degradation was pH-influenced. The photocatalytic reaction followed the pseudo-first-order model, with reaction rate constants (k) 0.026, 0.027, 0.022 and 0.026 min(-1) for ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, respectively. Complete elimination of four FQswas achieved in a reaction system composed of 0.5 g L-1 of TiO2 and 82.5mg L-1 of H2O2 at pH 6 after 90 min irradiation. Mineralization of FQs during TiO2 photocatalysis was slower than the FQs conversion, and the antibacterial activity of the four FQs was completely removed by TiO2 under simulated solar light irradiation.
   CONCLUSION: The four FQs can be simultaneously degraded andmineralized with commercially available TiO2 under simulated solar light irradiation. Microbiological analysis showed that the antibacterial activity of the four FQs was completely removed. These results are helpful for antibiotics removal in the environment, and for exploring new technology for wastewater treatment. (C) 2012 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Ultrasound-driven microbubbles have been used in therapeutic applications to deliver drugs across capillaries and into cells or to dissolve blood clots. Yet the performance and safety of these applications have been difficult to control. Microbubbles exposed to ultrasound not only volumetrically oscillate, but also move due to acoustic radiation, or Bjerknes, forces. The purpose of this work was to understand the extent to which microbubbles moved and clustered due to secondary Bjerknes forces. A microbubble population was exposed to a 1-MHz ultrasound pulse with a peak-rarefactional pressure of 50-100 kPa and a pulse length of 20 ms. Microbubbles exposed to low-pressure therapeutic ultrasound were observed to cluster at clustering rates of 0.01-0.02 microbubbles per duration (in ms) per initial average inter-bubble distance (in mu m), resulting in 1 to 3 clustered microbubbles per initial average inter-bubble distance (in mu m). Higher pressures caused faster clustering rates and a larger number of clustered microbubbles. Experimental data revealed clustering time scales, cluster localizations, and cluster sizes that were in reasonable agreement with simulations using a time-averaged model at low pressures. This study demonstrates that clustering of microbubbles occurs within a few milliseconds and is likely to influence the distribution of stimuli produced in therapeutic applications.

AB Statement of problem. No clinical study has evaluated the efficacy of fluoride varnish as a topical fluoride agent for the protection of overdenture abutments from dental caries.
   Purpose. This study assessed the efficacy of a fluoride varnish in protecting overdenture abutments from demineralization in an in vitro environment.
   Material and methods. Eighty caries-free, extracted teeth were sectioned and domed immediately below the cementoenamel junction, simulating overdenture abutment preparations. Acid resistant nail varnish was painted on all surfaces except for a window (1 x 4 mm) on the prepared occlusal dentin surfaces. Teeth were randomly divided into 4 groups of 20 specimens: control, washed with deionized/distilled water; Daily Gel, treated with Karigel-N (5,000 ppm) for 4 minutes daily; Weekly Gel, treated with Karigel-N for 4 minutes weekly; and Weekly Varnish, treated with Duraflor (22,600 ppm) weekly. The varnish was removed using a blade 24 hours after each application to simulate the clinical loss of the varnish. Teeth were then placed in a cycle of demineralization (2.2 mMol/L CaCl(2)2H(2)O, 2.2 mMol/L KH2PO4, and 50 mMol/L acetic acid at pH 4.3) for 6 hours and remineralization (1.5 mMol/L CaCl(2)2H(2)O,0.9 mMol/L KH2PO4, and 150 mMol/L KCl at pH 7.0 for 17 hours) for 21 days. Half the teeth in each group were brushed with no dentifrice for 10 seconds, twice daily. Teeth were sectioned at 100 +/- 10 mum buccolingually and evaluated under polarized light microscopy and contact microradiography. The depth of each lesion and the width of the remineralization bands were measured (mm). Analysis of variance models and T-tests were used to assess the effects of different treatments (alpha =.05). Duncan multiple range tests were then chosen as post hoc tests to evaluate the statistical significance of all pair-wise comparisons.
   Results. The control group had the deepest lesions (mean depth 400 +/- 39 mum). The lesions from the varnish and daily gel groups were significantly shallower than the lesions in both the control group and the weekly gel group. The remineralization bands in the varnish group were 52% wider than the control group bands. However, the daily gel group had the largest increase in band width (117% increase) compared with the control group. There were significant differences between all groups for net depth (lesion depth minus the remineralization band) (P<.0001). Daily application of fluoride gel was significantly more effective than the other treatments tested. Brushing was not a significant factor.
   Conclusion. Within the limitations of this in vitro study, treatment of overdenture abutment with various topical fluorides significantly inhibited demineralization and enhanced remineralization of cut occlusal dentin surfaces. Daily use of Karigel-N was the most effective treatment, followed by the weekly application of Duraflor varnish.

AB Dark reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) in deep waters, soils and sediments accounts for a large part of legacy Hg recycling back to the atmosphere. Natural organic matter (NOM) plays a dual role in the process, acting as an electron donor and complexation agent of Hg(II). Experimental determination of rates of dark Hg(II) reduction is complicated by the simultaneously ongoing kinetics of Hg(II) rearrangement from the abundant, relatively weakly bonding RO/N (carboxyl, amino) groups in NOM to the much stronger bonding RSH (thiol) group. In this study, kinetics of the rearrangement are accounted for and we report rates of dark Hg(II) reduction for two molecular structures in presence of humic acids (HA) extracted from three different sources. Values on the pseudo first-order rate constant for the proposed structure Hg(OR)(2) (k(red) (Hg(OR)2)) were 0.18, 0.22 and 0.35 h(-1) for Peat, Coal and Soil HA, respectively, and values on the constant for the proposed structure RSHgOR (k(red) (RSHgOR)) were 0.003 and 0.006 h(-1) for Peat and Soil HA, respectively. The Hg(SR)(2) structure is the thermodynamically most stable, but the limited time of the experiment (53 h) did not allow for a determination of the rate of the very slow reduction of Hg(II) in this structure. For two out of three HA samples the concentration of RSH groups optimized by the kinetic model (0.6 x 10(-3) RSH groups per C atoms) was in good agreement with independent estimates provided by sulfur X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (S XANES). Experiments conducted at varying concentrations of Hg(II) and HA demonstrated a positive relationship between Hg(II) reduction and concentrations of specific Hg(II) structures and electron donor groups, suggesting first order in each of these two components. The limitation of the Hg(II) reduction by electron donating groups of HA, as represented by the native reducing capacity (NRC), was demonstrated for the Coal HA sample. Normalization to NRC resulted in pseudo second-order rate constants (k(red) (Hg(OR)2/NRC) = 0.012 h(-1), k(red) (RSHgOR/NRC) = 1.9 - 2.1 x 10(-4) h(-1)) that were very similar for Soil and Peat HA.

AB Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of surface treatment and universal adhesive on the microshear bond strength of nanoparticle composite repairs.
   Methods: One hundred and forty-four specimens were built with a nanofilled composite (Filtek Supreme Ultra, 3M ESPE). The surfaces of all the specimens were polished with SiC paper and stored in distilled water at 378 degrees C for 14 days. Half of the specimens were then air abraded with Al2O3 particles and cleaned with phosphoric acid. Polished specimens (P) and polished and air-abraded specimens (A), respectively, were randomly divided into two sets of six groups (n=12) according to the following treatments: hydrophobic adhesive only (PH and AH, respectively), silane and hydrophobic adhesive (PCH, ACH), methacryloyloxydecyl dihydrogen phosphate (MDP)containing silane and hydrophobic adhesive (PMH, AMH), universal adhesive only (PU, AU), silane and universal adhesive (PCU, ACU), and MDP-containing silane and universal adhesive (PMU, AMU). A cylinder with the same composite resin (1.1-mm diameter) was bonded to the treated surfaces to simulate the repair. After 48 hours, the specimens were subjected to microshear testing in a universal testing machine. The failure area was analyzed under an optical microscope at 503 magnification to identify the failure type, and the data were analyzed by three-way analysis of variance and the Games-Howell test (alpha=0.05).
   Results: The variables "surface treatment'' and "adhesive'' showed statistically significant differences for p < 0.05. The highest mean shear bond strength was found in the ACU group but was not statistically different from the means for the other air-abraded groups except AH. All the polished groups except PU showed statistically significant differences compared with the air-abraded groups. The PU group had the highest mean among the polished groups. Cohesive failure was the most frequent failure mode in the air-abraded specimens, while mixed failure was the most common mode in the polished specimens.
   Conclusions: While air abrasion with Al2O3 particles increased the repair bond strength of the nanoparticle composite, the use of MDPcontaining silane did not lead to a statistically significant increase in bond strength. Silanecontaining universal adhesive on its own was as effective as any combination of silane and adhesive, particularly when applied on airabraded surfaces.

AB Statement of problem. The effects of bleaching on tooth-colored restorative materials remains controversial. Since previous in vitro research has been performed at different environmental temperatures, it is hypothesized that the temperature differences may be the reason for the conflicting reported results.
   Purpose. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a simulated at-home bleaching regimen on surface and subsurface microhardness of restorative materials at 2 different environmental temperatures.
   Material and methods. Seven restorative materials were tested: 4 composite resins, a polyacid-modified composite (compomer), a conventional glass-ionomer cement (CGIC), and a ceramic. For each material, 48 specimens were prepared and divided into 4 groups (n=12): bleaching group at a temperature of 25 degrees C, control group at 25 degrees C, bleaching group at 37 degrees C, and control group at 37 degrees C. The specimens from the bleaching groups were treated with 10% carbamide peroxide for an 8-hour daily test period for 14 days, while the control specimens were stored in artificial saliva for 14 days. The surface and subsurface (0.1-1.0 mm) microhardness values were determined by a Vickers microhardness tester. The surface microhardness data were analyzed with 3-way ANOVA for the effect of different materials, bleaching, and environmental temperature. The subsurface microhardness data were analyzed with repeated measures 4-way ANOVA for the effect of different materials, bleaching, environmental temperature, and subsurface depth as a repeated measure. A post hoc Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference test was used for comparisons among different groups (alpha=.05).
   Results. All of the materials showed a loss of surface microhardness, except for the ceramic after bleaching at 37 degrees C. However, only the compomer and CGIC were found to have surface softening after bleaching at 25 degrees C. For compomer and CGIC specimens, bleaching affected microhardness at different subsurface levels ranging from 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm. Bleaching at a higher temperature decreased the subsurface microhardness at deeper levels.
   Conclusions. The effects of bleaching on restorative materials were material dependent. Environmental temperature influenced the effects of bleaching on surface and subsurface microhardness of restorative materials. Bleaching at increased temperatures showed greater softening effects on the surface and subsurface layers of dental materials. (J Prosthet Dent 2011;105:100-107)

AB To assess the usefulness of Dy-DTPA-BMA-induced signal reduction, as an indicator of myocar dial viability, myocardial infarction was induced in 17 domestic pigs by ligating a diagonal branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). In 6 pigs, Dy-DTPA-BMA (1 mmol/kg b.w.) was administered 3 hours after induction of ischaemia. In 5 additional pigs, Gd-DTPA-BMA (0.3 mmol/kg b.w.) and Dy-DTPA-BMA (1 mmol/kg b.w.) were simultaneously injected after 4 hours of ischaemia to ascertain whether Dy-DTPA-BMA counteracted the signal enhancement effect of Gd DTPA-BMA. A further 6 pigs with infarctions, not administered contrast medium, served as controls. All pigs were sacrificed after 6 hours of ischaemia, and the extirpated hearts were investigated with MR (ex vivo). The concentrations of Dy and Gd were determined in tissue samples from infarcted and non-ischaemic myocardium. The extracellular concentrations of both contrast media were monitored over time during 2 hours in the double-contrast group (in vivo), using a microdialysis technique and analysed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES).
   The infarctions demonstrated a high SI in the proton density- and T2-weighted sequences, in both the Dy-DTPA-BMA and control groups, although the former group demonstrated a 3-fold greater concentration of Dy in infarcted compared with non-ischaemic myocardium. Dy-DTPA-BMA did not counteract the Gd-DTPA-BMA-induced enhancement of the infarcted tissue despite a 3-fold higher concentration. This lack of detectable susceptibility effects of Dy may be caused by a loss of cell membrane integrity in the infarcts, resulting in a homogeneous intra- and extracellular distribution of the contrast agent. This hypothesis of an expanded volume of distribution in infarcted tissue was further supported by the microdialysis data, demonstrating a similar extracellular concentration of contrast agents in infarcted and non-ischaemic myocardium, despite a proven 3-fold greater concentration in infarcted tissue samples.
   To investigate whether Gd-DTPA-BMA-enhanced MR imaging (ex vivo) permits differentiation between reperfused and non-reperfused myocardial infarction, and whether Dy-DTPA-BMA-enhanced MR imaging enables a differentiation between reversible and irreversible myocardial injury following reperfusion, myocardial infarction was induced in 24 domestic pigs (divided into 4 groups) by placing a patched ligature around a diagonal branch of the LAD. Four additional hearts were reperfused after 2 min of brief occlusion, not long enough to cause irreversible injury. Myocardial infarction was also induced in 12 pigs to ascertain whether a double-contrast method, combining a positive and a negative MR contrast agent, could improve the visualization of reperfused myocardial infarctions, compared with a single-contrast technique using Gd-DTPA-BMA alone. Radiolabelled microspheres were used to confirm ischaemia and to verify reperfusion in infarcted myocardium. The concentrations of Dy and Gd in tissue samples from infarcted, reversibly injured and non-ischaemic myocardium were determined by ICP-AES.
   The reperfused infarctions were strongly enhanced in the T1-weighted images, corresponding to a 5-fold higher Gd concentration compared with non-ischaemic myocardium. Hearts subjected to occlusion without reperfusion demonstrated only a peripheral rim enhancement of the infarctions, while the central parts demonstrated a SI and Gd content similar to that of non-ischaemic myocardium.
   In the proton density- and T2-weighted sequences, reperfused, infarcted myocardium demonstrated a high SI despite a 5-fold higher Dy-concentration compared with both non-reperfused infarcted and non-ischaemic myocardium. Reversibly injured myocardium could not be distinguished from adjacent non-ischaemic myocardium, probably due to a preserved cell membrane integrity, preventing Dy-DTPA-BMA from entering the cells. Dy-DTPA-BMA-induced signal reduction may thus serve as an indicator of myocardial viability.
   The double-contrast technique, whereby Dy-DTPA-BMA was injected in addition to Gd-DTPA-BMA, yielded a superior infarct visualization in the T2-weighted sequences, compared with the single-contrast technique using Gd-DTPA-BMA alone. This improvement of infarct visualization could be attributed to Dy-induced loss of SI, due to susceptibility effect in non-ischaemic myocardium. The double-contrast technique thus resulted in an excellent infarct visualization in both T1- and T2-weighted sequences.

AB Colonies of the ant Temnothorax (formerly Leptothorax) albipennis can collectively choose the best of several nest sites, even when many of the active ants who organize the move visit only one site. Previous studies have suggested that this ability stems from the ants' strategy of graded commitment to a potential home. On finding a site, an ant proceeds from independent assessment, to recruiting fellow active ants via slow tandem runs, to bringing the passive bulk of the colony via rapid transports. Assessment duration varies inversely with site quality, and the switch from tandem runs to transports requires that a quorum of ants first be summoned to the site. These rules may generate a collective decision, by creating and amplifying differential population growth rates among sites. We test the importance of these and other known behavioural rules by incorporating them into an agent-based model. All parameters governing individual behaviour were estimated from videotaped emigrations of individually marked ants given a single nest option of either good or mediocre quality. The time course of simulated emigrations and the distribution of behaviour across ants largely matched these observations, except for the speed with which the final transport phase was completed, and the overall emigration speed of one particularly large colony. The model also predicted the prevalence of splitting between sites when colonies had to choose between two sites of different quality, although it correctly predicted the degree of splitting in only four of six cases. It did not fully capture variance in colony performance, but it did predict the emergence of variation in individual behaviour, despite the use of identical parameter values for all ants. The model shows how, with adequate empirical data, the algorithmic form of a collective decision-making mechanism can be captured.

AB We study the emergence of bi-cluster flocking for a generalized Justh-Krishnaprasad (J-K) model and the Cucker-Smale (C-S) model with the unit speed constraint. We provide a sufficient framework for the emergence of bi-cluster flocking in terms of initial configurations and communication weights between agents. Our analytical results on bi-cluster flocking illustrate that the spatial-decay rate of communication weights is transferred to the temporal decay rate toward the bi-cluster flocking configuration. We also provide several numerical simulations and compare them to our analytical results.

AB Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a pro-fibrotic, muscle wasting disease. Reducing fibrosis is a potential therapeutic target; however, its effect on muscle regeneration is not fully understood. This study (1) used an agent-based model to predict the effect of increased fibrosis inmdxmuscle on regeneration from injury, and (2) experimentally tested the resulting model-derived hypothesis. The model predicted that increasing the area fraction of fibrosis decreased regeneration 28 days post injury due to limited growth factor diffusion and impaired cell migration. WT,mdx, and TGF beta-treatedmdxmice were used to test this experimentally. TGF beta injections increased the extracellular matrix (ECM) area fraction; however, the passive stiffness of the treated muscle, which was assumed to correlate with ECM protein density, decreased following injections, suggesting that ECM protein density was lower. Further, there was no cross-sectional area (CSA) difference during recovery between the groups. Additional simulations revealed that decreasing the ECM protein density resulted in no difference in CSA, similar to the experiment. These results suggest that increases in ECM area fraction alone are not sufficient to reduce the regenerative capacity of mdx muscle, and that fibrosis is a complex pathological condition requiring further understanding.

AB 1. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance of Campylobacter strains (C. jejuni, C. coli and C. lari) isolated from broiler carcasses processed in the State of Parana, Brazil.
   2. Rates of microbial resistance and susceptibility were assessed by both Disk Diffusion (DD) and Etest (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) techniques. Antibiotics were tested using DD (12 antibiotics) and/or MIC (7 antibiotics) methods.
   3. A total of 95.8% of the strains were resistant to at least two agents. In terms of multidrug resistance, 75% of strains were resistant to three or more groups of antibiotics. The highest rates of resistance were detected for cefalotin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid. A high rate of susceptibility of the strains to erythromycin (95.8%) was found confirming that this is considered the agent of choice for treating campylobacteriosis. Comparison of the microbial resistance and susceptibility, as determined simultaneously by the two methods, found the techniques to be statistically equivalent for 5 out of the 6 antibiotics tested.
   4. The results of this study suggest the need for adopting measures to control the use of antibiotics in broiler production to prevent multidrug resistance of Campylobacter strains and reduce the risk of serious human diseases caused by the consumption of contaminated chicken meat.

We model bidding strategies using finite automata and report results from simulations involving populations of artificial bidders who update their strategies using a genetic algorithm. Our model is shown to deliver late or early bidding behavior, depending on whether the auction has a hard- or soft-close rule in accordance with the empirical evidence.

   PRINCIPLES
AB Protein crystal growth often depends on the combination of many different factors. Some affect protein solubility directly; others may act indirectly by causing conformational changes. Systematic characterization of these factors can be important for generating good crystals. It can also provide useful insight into the biochemical behavior of the protein being crystallized. Here we focus on statistical methods to achieve these two objectives. (1) Characterization of a protein system by analyzing patterns of crystal polymorphism under different levels of biochemical parameters, such as ligands and pH. Tests of the reproducibility of crystal growth experiments indicate that quantitative scales of crystal quality can be statistically significant. Analysis of variance for a replicated, full-factorial design in which four factors were tested at two levels has been used to demonstrate highly significant, biochemically relevant, two-factor interactions strongly implicating pH and ligand-dependent conformational changes. (2) Optimization of crystal growth via response-surface methods. 'Minimum predicted variance' designs provide for efficient response-surface experiments aimed at constructing quadratic models in several dimensions. We have used such models to improve crystal size and quality significantly for three forms of Bacillus stearothermophilus tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase. In one case we can now avoid having to increase the size by repeated seeding, a difficult procedure that also produces unwanted growth of satellite crystals. Graphs of two-dimensional level surfaces reveal a number of ridges, where the same result is obtained for many combinations of the factors usually varied when trying to improve crystals. An important inference is that it may be better to sample simultaneously for the effects of protein concentration and supersaturation. For a system involving only one crystallizing agent, supersaturation can be approximated as the product of protein and precipitant concentrations. Use of this search direction significantly improves the performance of response-surface experiments. Advantages of growing crystals at stationary points of their response surfaces include better crystals and higher reproducibility, since crystal growth at stationary points is insulated from the deleterious effects of experimental fluctuations. This arises because the derivatives of the response are by definition zero with respect to the experimental variables. Quantitative analysis of appropriately designed crystal growth experiments can thus be a powerful way to characterize complex and interacting biochemical dependencies in macromolecular systems and optimize parameters important to the crystallography.

AB In rats injected s.c. with formalin, behavioural correlates of the amount and pattern of Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) (molecular responses to pain) were studied to test if early phase treatment with 75% nitrous oxide or 2% halothane, or both, suppressed subsequent spinal sensitization. Rats were allocated to four treatment groups: (1) 100% oxygen (control, n = 15), (2) 75% nitrous oxide (0.5 MAC, n = 12), (3) 2% halothane (1 MAC, n = 12), and (4) 75% nitrous oxide with 2% halothane (1.5 MAC, n = 18) for 20 min. Each rat then received a s.c. injection of 1% formalin 50 mu l into the left hindpaw and anaesthesia was maintained for another 5 min (early phase). A fifth group of rats receiving fentanyl 100 mu g kg(-1) (n = 12) 10 min before formalin injection were studied simultaneously as a positive control. Rats in all groups were killed 60 min after formalin injection and maximal counts of Fos-LI labelled neurones in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord were compared according to laminar distribution. Formalin-induced behavioural hyperalgesia during the early phase was suppressed completely by fentanyl, 75% nitrous oxide, or 2% halothane, or both. The late phase response was attenuated by all four anaesthetic regimens within 20 min after injection, whereas behavioural scores for the nitrous oxide, halothane, or both, groups were nearly identical to the control 20 min later. Fentanyl suppressed the late phase response until 30 min after formalin injection but failed to reduce it thereafter. The numbers of Fos-LI labelled neurones for groups given nitrous oxide, or halothane, or both, were identical to the control, whereas numbers for fentanyl were 47.2% less (P < 0.01). The decrease occurred predominantly in the neck of the dorsal horn (44.9% of control, P < 0.01) and also in the nucleus proprius and superficial laminae (54.4% and 56.2% of control, P < 0.05). In summary, we found that nitrous oxide, or halothane, or both, did not suppress subsequent spinal sensitization to noxious stimulation. This result supports the previous hypothesis that inhalation anaesthesia lacks pre-emptive analgesic action. Inhalation anaesthetic agents, unlike fentanyl, suppress the early and late phase response because of anaesthetic but not analgesic effects. Thus, we suggest that measuring the genetic product of c-fos proto-oncogene is a useful adjunct to pharmacological tests whenever behavioural hyperalgesia is questionable or unobtainable.

AB Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is an important validated drug target for cancer therapy. Some therapeutic agents targeting EGFR have been developed, however these are sometimes ineffective, which calls for the discovery of alternative novel anti-EGFR inhibitors. Thus, we performed ensemble molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) against multiple conformations of EGFR to identify, design and validate new analogs of erlotinib and AEE788 that have enhanced binding affinity. To achieve this, curcumin analogues with diverse groups were studied against EGFR using ensemble molecular docking and MD. Based on the preferred orientations and MM-GBSA calculations of the selected top-scoring consensus lead inhibitors, we derived the pharmacophoric features that possess maximum binding affinity for the EGFR binding site. Using these pharmacophoric properties we designed new analogues of two known co-crystallized therapeutic inhibitors of EGFR (erlotinib and AEE788). We then tested the hypothesis using MD that the identified pharmacophoric property increases binding affinity and increases the stability of the designed analogues. Our MD simulations and MM-GBSA calculations confirmed that the occupancy of sub-pocket 2 in the EGFR active site is important for tight EGFR-inhibitor binding. The study thus provides an essential pharmacophoric requirement for design and discovery of new lead candidates as EGFR inhibitors.

ID SIMULATIONS
AB This article investigates causal relationships leading to emergence in an agent-based model of human behaviour. A new method based on nonlinear structural causality is formulated and practically demonstrated. The method is based on the concept of a causal partition of a model variable which quantifies the contribution of various factors to its numerical value. Causal partitions make it possible to judge the relative importance of contributing factors over crucial early periods in which the emergent behaviour of a system begins to form. They can also serve as the predictors of emergence. The time-evolution of their predictive power and its distribution among their components hint at the deeper causes of emergence and the possibilities to control it.

AB Recognizing and understanding the actions of others is usually coupled with perceiving someone else's body movements from a third person perspective (3pp) whereas we perceive our own actions from a first person perspective (1pp). From a neural viewpoint, a recent finding is that perceiving actions from a 3pp as compared to a 1pp activates the temporoparietal junction, a brain region associated with visuospatial transformation and perspective taking but also with mental state inference and Theory of Mind (ToM). The present fMRI study characterizes the response profile of TPJ to elucidate its role in action observation. Participants observed naturalistic and pixelized object-directed actions from a 3pp and 1pp. Critically, in the pixelized condition the action goal could only be inferred from the movement kinematics. Both left and right TPJ revealed an interaction: Neural activity in TPJ was enhanced for 3pp vs. 1pp actions in the naturalistic but not pixelized condition. This finding contradicts theories proposing that TPJ is generally involved in transforming the action into the observer's perspective to match perceived body movements with visuomotor representations in the observer's motor system, which would be particularly required when actions can only be inferred from movement kinematics. Instead, our results support the theory that perceptual 3pp-selective cues trigger ToM-related processes such as detection of other agents and reasoning about an action's underlying mental states.

AB The objective of this study was to prepare protein isolate from defatted soybean and identify an optimal hydrolysis protocol to create improved hydrolysates and ascertain the optimum encapsulation technique for probiotics. Soy protein isolate (SPI) was prepared using an alkaline extraction procedure for solubility within a neutral, beverage-specific pH range. The soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) was prepared from aqueous extracted SPI using pepsin. The physicochemical properties of the SPH were investigated by solubility, degree of hydrolysis (DH), surface hydrophobicity, and electrophoresis. Hydrolysates from 2, 2.5, and 3 hr of hydrolysis time achieved the suitable DH between 2.5% to 5.0%. The 2.5 to 3 hr hydrolysates were also significantly more soluble than SPI at all pH levels from 85% to 95% solubility. Surface hydrophobicity of the hydrolysates ranged from 15 to 20S(0)values. Alginate (1%), resistant starch (2%), and probiotic culture (0.1%) were used as an encapsulation agent to protect probiotics. Alginate microcapsules were observed to be 1 mm in size using environmental scanning electron microscopy. The dried SPH and encapsulated probiotics with alginate in a dry powder formulation were tested for its gastrointestinal resistance and probiotic viability underin vitrosimulated digestion. Approximately 1-log decrease was observed for all experimental groups after simulated digestion (final log colony forming units [CFU]/mL range: 6.55 to 6.19) with free probiotics having the lowest log CFU/mL (6.10 +/- 0.10) value. No significant difference was observed among experimental groups for probiotic viability (P= 0.445). The findings of this research will provide an understanding of formulation for easily digestible protein and encapsulated probiotics. Practical Application The findings of this research provide an understanding of improved formulation for more suitable soy protein hydrolysate and viability of encapsulated probiotics in gastrointestinal environment. Probiotics with the prebiotics in an encapsulated environment provide a technology for the enhancement of probiotics viability and for applications in suitable products for health and wellness.

TI Deciphering moral intuition: How agents, deeds, and consequences
   influence moral judgment
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ETHICAL DECISION-MAKING
AB Moral evaluations occur quickly following heuristic-like intuitive processes without effortful deliberation. There are several competing explanations for this. The ADC-model predicts that moral judgment consists in concurrent evaluations of three different intuitive components: the character of a person (Agent-component, A); their actions (Deed-component, D); and the consequences brought about in the situation (Consequences-component, C). Thereby, it explains the intuitive appeal of precepts from three dominant moral theories (virtue ethics, deontology, and consequentialism), and flexible yet stable nature of moral judgment. Insistence on single-component explanations has led to many centuries of debate as to which moral precepts and theories best describe (or should guide) moral evaluation. This study consists of two large-scale experiments and provides a first empirical investigation of predictions yielded by the ADC model. We use vignettes describing different moral situations in which all components of the model are varied simultaneously. Experiment 1 (within-subject design) shows that positive descriptions of the A-, D-, and C-components of moral intuition lead to more positive moral judgments in a situation with low-stakes. Also, interaction effects between the components were discovered. Experiment 2 further investigates these results in a between-subject design. We found that the effects of the A-, D-, and Ccomponents vary in strength in a high-stakes situation. Moreover, sex, age, education, and social status had no effects. However, preferences for precepts in certain moral theories (PPIMT) partially moderated the effects of the A- and C-component. Future research on moral intuitions should consider the simultaneous three-component constitution of moral judgment.

AB We consider a model of active Brownian agents interacting via a harmonic attractive potential in a two-dimensional system in the presence of noise. By numerical simulations, we show that this model possesses a noise-induced transition characterized by the breakdown of translational motion and the onset of swarm rotation as the noise intensity is increased. Statistical properties of swarm dynamics in the weak noise limit are further analytically investigated.

AB HIV/AIDS is a growing global pandemic. A microbicide is a formulation of a pharmaceutical agent suspended in a delivery vehicle, and can be used by women to protect themselves against HIV infection during intercourse. We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) computational model of a shear-thinning power-law fluid spreading under the influence of gravity to represent the distribution of a microbicide gel over the vaginal epithelium. This model, accompanied by a new experimental methodology, is a step in developing a tool for optimizing a delivery vehicle's structure/function relationship for clinical application. We compare our model with experiments in order to identify critical considerations for simulating 3D free-surface flows of shear-thinning fluids. Here we found that neglecting lateral spreading, when modeling gravity-induced flow, resulted in up to 47% overestimation of the experimental axial spreading after 90 s. In contrast, the inclusion of lateral spreading in 3D computational models resulted in rms errors in axial spreading under 7%. In addition, the choice of the initial condition for shape in the numerical simulation influences the model's ability to describe early time spreading behavior. Finally, we present a parametric study and sensitivity analysis of the power-law parameters' influence on axial spreading, and to examine the impact of changing rheological properties as a result of dilution or formulation conditions. Both the shear-thinning index (n) and consistency (m) impacted the spreading length and deceleration of the moving front. The sensitivity analysis showed that gels with midrange m and n values (for the ranges in this study) would be most sensitive (over 8% changes in spreading length) to 10% changes (e. g., from dilution) in both rheological properties. This work is applicable to many industrial and geophysical thin-film flow applications of non-Newtonian fluids; in addition to biological applications in microbicide drug delivery.

AB We performed experiments in rats aimed at determining whether a combination of ceftriaxone (CRO) and netilmicin (NET), by using once-daily administration in rats, which simulated profiles of drug in human serum, was more effective than either agent alone in the treatment of endocarditis caused by viridans group streptococci. A programmable infusion pump system enabled the production of profiles of CRO in serum that simulate those found in humans after the intravenous administration of 2 g. The subcutaneous administration of 18 mg of NET per kg of body weight produced levels in the sera of rats comparable to those after the intravenous administration of a dose of 5 mg of NET per kg in humans. Rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were infected intravenously with two test strains, a CRO-susceptible Streptococcus sanguis strain (MICs of CRO and NET, 0.064 and 8 mg/liter, respectively) and a relatively CRO-resistant Streptococcus mitis strain (MICs of CRO and NET, 2 and 8 mg/liter, respectively). Against both strains, the combination of CRO and NET was synergistic in vitro as determined by time-kill curves. Treatment of rats was started 48 h postinfection and lasted for 3 days. CRO alone was effective against the susceptible strain (P < 0.001 compared with control animals) but was not effective against the resistant organism. A significantly enhanced antibacterial activity of the CRO-NET combination in reducing the valvular bacterial counts was observed with both test strains (P < 0.001). The synergistic effect was obtained with a single daily injection of NET which provided detectable levels in serum for only 8 h, suggesting that in vivo synergism in the treatment of infections caused by viridans group streptococci can be obtained without 24 h of aminoglycoside coverage. These experimental data might provide a rationale for clinical trials of a once-a-day dosing regimen in the treatment of streptococcal but nonenterococcal endocarditis.

AB The concern regarding sustainable utilization of available resources is growing due to its global importance. In this paper, the dyeability of cotton fabrics with natural colorant extracted from red cabbage was improved by applying cationic groups on cotton fibers. Modification of cotton was carried using acid tannic, Rewin Os, Denitex BC and Sera Fast as cationic agents. The dyeing process was done by ultrasonic energy. The effects of the cationising agent amount, the dye bath pH, the dyeing temperature and duration, on the sonicator dyeing quality were studied. The performances of this process were evaluated by measuring the colour yield (K/S) and the dyeing fastness of the coloured cotton. Besides, modified cotton fibers were characterized by morphology analysis (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and compared to untreated cotton.
   Moreover, a two-level full factorial design was employed to optimize the sonicator dyeing process. Mathematical model equation and statistical analysis were derived by computer simulation programming applying the least squares method using Minitab 15. Best dyeing conditions were found to be: 10%, pH 11, 60 min and 100 degrees C respectively for the Sera Fast amount, dye bath pH, dyeing duration and temperature. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Implant and superstructure provide a complex system, which has to withstand oral conditions. Concerning the brittleness of many ceramics, fractures are a greatly feared issue. Therefore, polymer-infiltrated ceramic networks (PICNs) were developed. Because of its low Young's modulus and high elastic modulus, the PICN crown on a one-piece zirconia implant might absorb forces to prevent the system from fracturing in order to sustain oral forces. Recommendations for the material of superstructure on zirconia implants are lacking, and only one study investigates PICN crowns on these types of implants.
   Accordingly, this study aimed to examine PICN crowns on one-piece zirconia implants regarding bond strength and surface wear after long-term chewing simulation (CS).
   Methods: Twenty-five hybrid ceramic crowns (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik) were produced using computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology and adhesively bonded (RelyX (TM) Ultimate, 3M ESPE) to zirconia implants. Twenty of the specimens underwent simultaneous mechanical loading and thermocycling simulating a 5-year clinical situation (SD Mechatronik GmbH). Wear depth and wear volume, based on X-ray micro-computed tomography volume scans (Skyscan 1172-100-50, Bruker) before and after CS, were evaluated.
   All crowns were removed from the implants using a universal testing machine (Z010, Zwick GmbH&Co.KG). Subsequently, luting agent was light microscopically localized (Stemi 2000-C, Zeiss).
   With a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Phenom (TM) G2 pro, Phenom World), the area of abrasion was assessed.
   Results:
   1. After CS, none of the tested crowns were fractured or loosened.
   2. The maximum vertical wear after CS was M=0.31 +/- 0.04 mm (mean +/- standard deviation), and the surface wear was M=0.74 +/- 0.23 mm(3).
   3. The pull-off tests revealed a 1.8 times higher bond strength of the control group compared to the experimental group (t(23) = 8.69, p < 0.001).
   4. Luting agent was mostly located in the crowns, not on the implants.
   5. The area of abrasion showed avulsion and a rough surface.
   Conclusions: PICN on one-piece zirconia implants showed high bond strength and high wear after CS.

AB We derived the critical neighborhood demand in the Schelling's segregation model by studying the conditions for which a chain reaction of migrations of unsatisfied agents occurs. The essence of Schelling dynamics was approximated in two simplified models: (1) a random walk model for the initial stage of the migrations to illustrate the power-law behavior of chain reaction lengths under critical conditions, and (2) a two-room model for the whole process to represent a non-spatial version of segregation dynamics in the Schelling model. Our theoretical results showed good agreements with numerical results obtained from agent-based simulations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

TI Universal features of information spreading efficiency on d-dimensional

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E

DT Article
AB A model for information spreading in a population of N mobile agents is extended to d-dimensional regular lattices. This model, already studied on two-dimensional lattices, also takes into account the degeneration of information as it passes from one agent to the other. Here, we find that the structure of the underlying lattice strongly affects the time tau at which the whole population has been reached by information. By comparing numerical simulations with mean-field calculations, we show that dimension d=2 is marginal for this problem and mean-field calculations become exact for d > 2. Nevertheless, the striking nonmonotonic behavior exhibited by the final degree of information with respect to N and the lattice size L appears to be geometry independent.

ID STRESS DUCTILE FRACTURE; HIGH-IMPACT POLYSTYRENE; ESSENTIAL WORK;
   POLYMERS
AB The use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) has been greatly limited in recent years because of their high ozone depletion potential (ODP) (Montreal protocol). The manufacturers of refrigerators have tried various new blowing agents for polyurethane (PU) foams used as insulating panels, and currently the chosen organic compound in Europe seems to be cyclopentane (CP), due to its acceptable insulating power and null ODP and toxicity. Unfortunately the interaction of CP with high impact polystyrene (HIPS) panels of the refrigerators produces blisters and can possibly induce environmental stress cracking (ESC). The aim of this work is, then, to explain the growth of blisters with a theoretical calculation and also to investigate the mechanical behaviour of HIPS in contact with gaseous and liquid CP, in comparison with usually used Freon(R) 11 (F11).
   By means of the group contribution one can calculate with the Flory-Huggins equation an isothermal adsorption curve for the polystyrene (PS) matrix/organic system and with the Chow equation calculate the lowering of T-g. From the calculation it is evident that the lower CP vapour pressure causes a considerable absorption, and this is simultaneous to the lesser CP amount needed to reach a 23 degrees C T-g for the PS matrix: it is then possible to state that the blisters form from a sort of micro blow-moulding, induced in the plasticized PS by the thermal treatments that are introduced in the refrigerator production cycle. The use of small amounts of acrylonitrile (AN) in the PS matrix may be sufficient to avoid this inconvenience, as it has been confirmed by lab and industrial experiences.
   From a mechanical point of view two experimental set-ups were designed in order to evaluate the ESC resistance in gaseous and liquid environment: for the first case slow crack propagation (SCP) experiments were performed in controlled atmospheres on compact tension (CT) specimens, while in the second case the essential work of fracture (EWF) technique was applied to double edge notch (DEN) specimens fully immersed in the considered liquids at different temperatures. In the first case it can be immediately concluded that the ESC produced in the presence of the same pressure of the two different agents (CP and F11) is very different, the CP one being much more aggressive than the F11. However, if the data are plotted versus the thermodynamic activity, there is no meaningful difference between CP and F11, suggesting that this parameter controls the ESC in gaseous environment for the considered blowing agents. In the case of ESC in the presence of a liquid, that could have a practical relevance in refrigerators if condensation phenomena take place, one observes that ordinary HIPS becomes rapidly brittle, while an AN modified HIPS maintains an appreciable ductility also in the presence of the liquid solvents.

AB The demand for provisioning, using, and maintaining distributed computational resources is growing hand in hand with the quest for ubiquitous services. Centralized infrastructures such as cloud computing systems provide suitable solutions for many applications, but their scalability could be limited in some scenarios, such as in the case of latency-dependent applications. The volunteer cloud paradigm aims at overcoming this limitation by encouraging clients to offer their own spare, perhaps unused, computational resources. Volunteer clouds are thus complex, large-scale, dynamic systems that demand for self-adaptive capabilities to offer effective services, as well as modeling and analysis techniques to predict their behavior. In this article, we propose a novel holistic approach for volunteer clouds supporting collaborative task execution services able to improve the quality of service of compute-intensive workloads. We instantiate our approach by extending a recently proposed ant colony optimization algorithm for distributed task execution with a workload-based partitioning of the overlay network of the volunteer cloud. Finally, we evaluate our approach using simulation-based statistical analysis techniques on a workload benchmark provided by Google. Our results show that the proposed approach outperforms some traditional distributed task scheduling algorithms in the presence of compute-intensive workloads.

AB The use of autonomous robots is appealing for tasks, which are dangerous to humans. Autonomous robots might fail to perform their tasks since they are susceptible to varied sorts of faults such as point and contextual faults. Not all faults can be known in advance, and hence, anomaly detection is required. In this paper, we present an online data-driven anomaly detection approach (ODDAD) for autonomous robots. ODDAD is suitable for the dynamic nature of autonomous robots since it declares a fault based only on data collected online. In addition, it is unsupervised, model free and domain independent. ODDAD proceeds in three steps: data filtering, attributes grouping based on dependency between attributes and outliers detection for each group. Above a calculated threshold, an anomaly is declared. We empirically evaluate ODDAD in different domains: commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a vacuum-cleaning robot, a high-fidelity flight simulator and an electrical power system of a spacecraft. We show the significance and impact of each component of ODDAD . By comparing ODDAD to other state-of-the-art competing anomaly detection algorithms, we show its advantages.

AB Observational errors can be categorized into two groups: random noise, which is altered every time when measurement is repeated, and a systematic temporally invariant error. In this paper, we propose a method to estimate the covariance structure for systematic error and random noise using a small number of repeated measurements of the signal. We model the systematic and random components as stationary Gaussian random fields and use the Bayesian approach to estimate the spatial covariance functions of these components simultaneously. The study is motivated by an application related to the diagnosis of joint diseases using contrast enhanced computer tomography (CT) measurements. The noise in the measured contrast agent concentration profiles within cartilage tissue is strongly spatially correlated and includes a systematic component. Since the estimates are significantly sensitive to all errors in modeling, the systematic error and random noise components should be characterized for reliable estimation. The method proposed in this paper can be used to construct approximative covariance matrices for the observational noise using a small number of CT measurements. The capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated using numerical simulations and also real CT data corresponding to measurements of contrast agent diffusion profile in cartilage.

AB In the age of the Internet and with the dramatic proliferation of mobile listening technologies, music has unprecedented global distribution and embeddedness in people's lives. It is a source of intense experiences of both the most intimate and solitary, and public and collective, kinds - from an individual with their smartphone and headphones, to large-scale live events and global simulcasts; and it increasingly brings together a huge range of cultures and histories, through developments in world music, sampling, the re-issue of historical recordings, and the explosion of informal and home music-making that circulates via YouTube. For many people, involvement with music can be among the most powerful and potentially transforming experiences in their lives. At the same time, there has been increasing interest in music's communicative and affective capacities, and its potential to act as an agent of social bonding and affiliation. This review critically discusses a considerable body of research and scholarship, across disciplines ranging from the neuroscience and psychology of music to cultural musicology and the sociology and anthropology of music, that provides evidence for music's capacity to promote empathy and social/cultural understanding through powerful affective, cognitive and social factors; and explores ways in which to connect and make sense of this disparate evidence (and counter-evidence). It reports the outcome of an empirical study that tests one aspect of those claims, demonstrating that 'passive' listening to the music of an unfamiliar culture can significantly change the cultural attitudes of listeners with high dispositional empathy; presents a model that brings together the primary components of the music and empathy research into a single framework; and considers both some of the applications, and some of the shortcomings and problems, of understanding music from the perspective of empathy.

AB Introduction: The aim of this study was to design new potentially antineoplastic agents by combining nitrogen mustard with steroidal skeleton, in an effort to improve specificity and simultaneously to reduce systemic toxicity. The steroidal part is aimed to act as a biological platform enabling the alkylating moiety to approach its site of action by altering its physicochemical properties. Materials and Methods: The compounds tested have, as alkylating agents, either p-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl-butyrate or p-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl) aminophenyl-acetate esterified with a modified steroidal nucleus. The four newly synthesized compounds were compared on a molar basis, regarding their ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges and modify proliferation rate indices in cultured human lymphocytes. Life span of BDF1 mice inoculated with L1210 leukemia was also estimated (antileukemic activity). Results: A compound having p-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl-acetate as the alkylator and two ketone groups in the steroidal part demonstrated the highest statistically significant enhancement of sister chromatid exchanges and suppression of proliferation rate indices, and also caused significant antineoplastic activity. The other compounds proved less active. Conclusion: These results suggest that cytogenetic and antileukemic activity of alkylating steroidal esters depends on the configuration of the whole molecule and the appropriate combination of the alkylator with the steroidal molecule.

AB The peculiar behavior of active crystals is due to the presence of evolving phase mixtures the variety of which depends on the number of coexisting phases and the multiplicity of symmetry-related variants. According to Gibbs' phase rule, the number of phases in a single-component crystal is maximal at a triple point in the p-T phase diagram. In the vicinity of this special point the number of metastable twinned microstructures will also be the highest-a desired effect for improving performance of smart materials. To illustrate the complexity of the energy landscape in the neighborhood of a triple point, and to produce a workable example for numerical simulations, in this paper we construct a generic Landau strain-energy function for a crystal with the coexisting tetragonal (t), orthorhombic (o), and monoelinic (m) phases. As a guideline, we utilize the experimental observations and crystallographic data on the t-o-m transformations of zirconia (ZrO2), a major toughening agent for ceramics. After studying the kinematics of the t-o-m phase transformations, we re-evaluate the available experimental data on zirconia polymorphs, and propose a new mechanism for the technologically important t-m transition. In particular, our proposal entails the softening of a different tetragonal modulus from the one previously considered in the literature. We derive the simplest expression for the energy function for a t-o-m crystal with a triple point as the lowest-order polynomial in the relevant strain components, exhibiting the complete set of wells associated with the t-o-m phases and their symmetry-related variants. By adding the potential of a hydrostatic loading, we study the p-T phase diagram and the energy landscape of our crystal in the vicinity of the t-o-m triple point. We show that the simplest assumptions concerning the order-parameter coupling and the temperature dependence of the Landau coefficients produce a phase diagram that is in good qualitative agreement with he experimental diagram of ZrO2.

AB A random sampling technique in which polymer molecules are sampled from an infinite number of polymer molecules in the reaction mixture is used to predict the molecular weight distribution (MWD) development during free-radical polymerization that involves polyfunctional chain transfer agents (P-CTAs). For an ideal ease where the chain transfer constant is unity and chain stoppage is dominated by chain transfer reactions, the analytical solutions for the full MWD as well as the average molecular weights can be derived in a straightforward manner. For more complex reaction systems where nonrandom history-dependent kinetics is important due to bimolecular termination reactions and the substitution effect of the P-CTAs, the Monte Carlo simulation on the basis of the random sampling technique enables one to estimate the statistical property development quite effectively. When bimolecular termination reactions and/or the substitution effects are involved, the MWD does not necessarily become narrower with polymerization in contrast with the ideal case. The decreased reactivity of the functional groups in a P-CTA due to the substitution effect may increase or decrease the average molecular weights depending on the magnitude of the chain transfer constant, concentration of P-CTA, the mode of bimolecular termination (disproportionation or combination), and the degree of the substitution effect.

AB In the colloquial Phnom Penh dialect of Khmer (Cambodian), lexical use of F-o is emerging together with an intermediate VOT category and breathy phonation following the loss of /r/ in onsets (e.g.,/kru:/'teacher' > [k(h)u]). I show how this incipient tonogenesis might arise in a series of computational simulations tracing the evolution of multivariate phonetic category distributions in a population of ideal observers. Acoustic production data from a fieldwork study conducted in Phnom Penh was used as the starting point for the simulations. After establishing that the basic framework predicted relative stability over time, two possible responses to a phonetic production bias were considered: one in which agents correctly identified the source of (and thereby compensated for) the effects of the bias, and one in which agents misattributed the acoustic effects of the bias as a property of the onset. Good qualitative fits to the empirical production data were found for the latter group of learners, while the outcome for compensating learners resembled production data from a related dialect. These results are consistent with the sudden and discontinuous nature of many sound changes, and suggest that what appear to be enhancement effects may also emerge under different assumptions about the number of cue dimensions accessible to or deemed relevant by the learner.

AB We report here the structure and electronic properties of a few typical representative molecules from a family containing more than 50 templating organic molecules which lead to the synthesis of zeolite ZSM-5. Force-field calculations were utilised to study the structural and conformational properties, while semi-empirical MNDO calculations were adopted to study the electronic properties. The conformational flexibility and the charge-compensating function were brought out as common features of these organic molecules. Furthermore, the interaction of various organic molecules with a suitable cluster model for the ZSM-5 framework was studied by MNDO calculations. The orientation of the template organic molecules and the actual conformation of the template-framework complex are derived, based on the X-ray crystal structure reports and the MNDO energetics. The influence of the nature of the functional group and the alkyl group on the electronic interaction is studied systematically. It has been shown that quantum-chemical calculations could be successfully utilised for the generalised description of the importance of several complex interactions which are mutually present.

AB One of the crucial scientific challenges of this century is characterizing the vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change. Bioenergetics models can provide a theoretical construct for addressing specific physiological and ecological hypotheses about how individuals may respond; however, many models fail to link energy deficiencies with reproductive consequences, and thus cannotbe used to predict population-level impacts. Here, we present an agent-based, ecophysiological model that simulates the energy balance of adult, female Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii). The input parameters include physiological values and population -wide ranges for the duration and phenology of life history events. Energy intake depends on foraging effort and stochastic prey availability, whereas energy expenditure is calculated from time and behavior-specific demands. The simulated seal selects an activity (forage, nurse pup, molt, rest) based on body condition and life history constraints. At the end of each timestep, the energy budget is balanced, and catabolism or anabolism occurs. Following model development and validation with empirical data, simulations were run to study the responses of individuals to: (1) baseline conditions; and (2) reduced prey availability. As expected, the model replicated the known fluctuations in energetic requirements associated with reproduction and molt. A 10% reduction in prey availability resulted in seals foraging more and resting less. At the end of the year-long simulations, animals in the baseline simulation had significantly higher body masses than animals in the perturbation simulation. The model was successfully used to explore decision-based energy allocation strategies that occur under different energetic stressors and to elucidate how extrinsic conditions can impact individual fitness. Identifying the temporal sensitivities of Weddell seals to predicted anthropogenic changes is a valuable contribution to the study of global change biology and can inform management decisions in polar regions.

AB The aim of our study was to evaluate the platelet antiaggregatory and hemodynamic effects of the stable prostacyclin analog iloprost and the NO-donor SIN-1, an active metabolite of molsidomine. The number of circulating platelets was determined in anesthetized male Wistar rats as a measure of in vivo platelet aggregation. Platelet count decreased from 648 +/- 25 to 476 +/- 15 x 10(3) platelets/mul and from 578 +/- 36 to 411 +/- 40 (mean +/- SEM) in response to two repetetive injections of collagen (70 mug/kg body weight). Treatment with SIN-1 bolus injections (0.3 or 1 mg/kg bw) and/or continous i.v. infusion of iloprost (0.2 or 0.4 mug/kg bw/min) was initiated 15 min before the second collagen bolus. As a single agent, SIN-1 did not influence platelet count. Iloprost at 0.2 mug/kg/min reduced platelet aggregation (PA) by 15.5 %, and at 0.4 mug/kg/min by 27.1 % (p = n.s.). When iloprost (0.2 mug/kg) and SIN-1 (0.3 mg/kg) were administered simultaneously, PA was suppressed by 56.2 %, iloprost at 0.4 mug/kg/min and SIN-1 at 0.3 mg/kg were even more effective and inhibited PA synergistically by 64.9 % (p < 0.05). A statistically significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was seen in response to all SIN-1 and iloprost groups. However, the vasorelaxant effect of both agents given simultaneously was not synergistic but less than additive.
   In conclusion, iloprost and SIN 1 exert synergistic platelet inhibitory effects in vivo. In contrast, the decrease in MABP is less then additive. These results are of major interest for the therapeutic regimen with NO-donors (nitrovasodilators).

TI Promising Route for the Development of a Computational Framework for
   Self-Assembly and Phase Behavior Prediction of Ionic Surfactants Using

AB Surfactants are amphiphilic molecules with multiple uses and industrial applications as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, and so forth. They can be divided into three main categories: nonionic, ionic, and zwitterionic. The development of a universal computational framework able to predict key properties such as their critical micelle concentration (cmc) and the size of the micelles they form and to ultimately extract phase diagrams for their aqueous solutions, possibly in the presence of salts and oils, using their chemical constitution as input, would provide valuable information for the design and the production of these materials. In this work, we focus on ionic surfactants and investigate a possible route toward the development of such a framework based on coarse-grained simulations using the MARTINI forcefield in two versions: its implicit solvent version, called Dry MARTINI, and its explicit solvent version, called Wet MARTINI. The surfactants considered in our efforts are the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and the three cationic cetyl, dodecyl, and octyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB, DTAB, and OTAB, respectively). First, we choose their mapping onto coarse-grained MARTINI beads. Next, we estimate their cmc's, their peak aggregation numbers, Nags, and in the case of SDS, its small angle neutron scattering pattern at low concentrations, applying the Dry MARTINI forcefield. With a single modification to the Lennard-Jones energy parameter between hydrophobic beads and invoking Ewald summation with a physically meaningful dielectric constant for electrostatic interactions, our estimates are in very good agreement with experimental results. Furthermore, we predict the phase behavior of SDS/water and CTAB/water binary solutions using Wet MARTINI and find semiquantitative agreement with experimental phase diagrams. We conclude that the MARTINI forcefield, with careful treatment of electrostatic interactions and appropriate modification of parameters for some key functional groups, can be a powerful ally in the quest for a universal computational framework for the design of new surfactants with improved properties.

AB A new financial agent-based time series model is developed and investigated by multiscale-continuum percolation system, which can be viewed as an extended version of continuum percolation system. In this financial model, for different parameters of proportion and density, two Poisson point processes (where the radii of points represent the ability of receiving or transmitting information among investors) are applied to model a random stock price process, in an attempt to investigate the fluctuation dynamics of the financial market. To validate its effectiveness and rationality, we compare the statistical behaviors and the multifractal behaviors of the simulated data derived from the proposed model with those of the real stock markets. Further, the multiscale sample entropy analysis is employed to study the complexity of the returns, and the cross-sample entropy analysis is applied to measure the degree of asynchrony of return autocorrelation time series. The empirical results indicate that the proposed financial model can simulate and reproduce some significant characteristics of the real stock markets to a certain extent. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB The present study was designed to evaluate the genotoxicity of albendazole (ABZ) in mice using the micronucleus test. Mice were treated by gavage with 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg of ABZ kg(-1) b.w., which corresponds to 1/6, 1/3, and 1/2 of the oral LD50 of ABZ. In the second part of the study, the possible protective role of vitamin C (vit. C) was investigated against the genotoxic effect of ABZ. The mice received 200 mg of vit C kg(-1) b.w. simutaneously with ABZ. Bone marrow samples were taken 48 h after the treatment. ABZ induced a statistically significant increase (P<0.001) in the percentage of micronucleaoted polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) in the 1,000 and 1,500 mg of ABZ kg(-1) b.w. treatment groups when compared with the negative control. On the other hand, the percentage of induced MNPCE was reduced at various levels in all ABZ treated groups simultaneously treated with an oral administration of vit. C. There were no statistically significant differences in the MNPCE frequency of these groups. The results of the study indicated that ABZ is a potential genotoxic agent, and that no protective effects of vit. C were observed against the genotoxicity of ABZ.

AB Japan leads advanced economies in terms of the speed and magnitude of demographic aging and has the highest debt to GDP ratio. Furthermore, public pension, medical and long-term care (LTC) expenditures are projected to far outpace revenues and create even more severe fiscal burdens. In this paper, we develop an accounting model populated with overlapping generations of individuals and incorporate social insurance programs in detail, use most recent estimates of Japanese micro data and government demographic projections to discipline the earnings and labor supply profiles of heterogeneous agents and their cohort shares, and simulate future paths of fiscal and macroeconomic indicators. Our numerical results suggest that absent any change in current policies, Japan will continue to run large pension, public health, LTC, and basic deficits and the debt to GDP ratio will continue to reach unprecedented highs, with growing interest payments. Although no single policy tool can address fiscal consolidation, a combination of policies is found to achieve sustainability: raise the retirement age to 67, cut pensions by 10%, raise copays of health and LTC insurances to at least 20% for all, and find policies to propel female employment and earnings and to narrow the gap with their male counterparts, and increase consumption tax rate to 15%. Under these changes, the debt to output ratio in 2050 would be lower than that in 2020.

AB This paper investigates how the different demographic characteristics of two countries will drive the flow of capital between them, as inhabitants of the longer-lived nation have a higher savings rate than do those with the shorter lifespan. It is motivated by the recent US experience during which its net foreign asset position declined dramatically, while simultaneously its longevity has fallen increasingly below that of other developed G7 economies. Our contribution is to address the issue by introducing empirically based survival (mortality) functions into a traditional two country macrodynamic framework. In doing so, we eliminate some of the unsatisfactory aspects associated with the traditional two country representative agent model. The sensitivity of the capital flows and the resulting net foreign assets of the two economies to key structural characteristics, and their consequences for savings are emphasized.

ID MICROSTRUCTURE; INFORMATION; BEHAVIOR; COVERAGE
AB Multiple studies presume the institutional investors to be informed investors. However, some reports argue that this view is still under debate. In this paper, to avoid the informed investors proxy bias caused by the institutional investors, we construct an agent-based continuous double auction stock market model with both informed and uninformed investors and examine whether stock price crash risk can be affected by the change of investor structure. In particular, we employ four types of investor structures by gradually increasing percentage adjustments of informed investors from 20%, 40%, 60% to 80% within the market. We find that stock clear price and return show significant improved stability coming with the rising weight of informed investors. Beyond that, we recognize the situation that stock clear price falls below 95% confidence interval as crash event and count the number of the stock price crash events within each simulation of each different investor structure. We find that consistent with growing stability of stock clear price and return, stock price crash event number drops dramatically following the higher proportion of informed investors. These findings confirm our hypothesis that the involvement of informed investors contributes to the market stability.

In this work, the thermomechanical properties and shape memory behaviors of three types of epoxy SMPs with varying curing agent contents were investigated using a molecular dynamics (MD) method. The mechanical properties under uniaxial tension at different temperatures were obtained, and the simulation results compared reasonably with experimental data. In addition, in a thermomechanical cycle, ideal shape memory effects for the three types of SMPs were revealed through the shape frozen and shape recovery responses at low and high temperatures, respectively, indicating that the recovery time is strongly influenced by the ratio of E-51 to 4,4'-Methylenedianiline.

AB Field experiment and household survey data are combined to investigate whether working in a risky occupation such as fishing makes fishermen have different risk preferences than individuals in other occupations. Prospect theory is utilized as the main analytical framework and a structural model approach is developed to simultaneously correlate the parameters of the utility function under prospect theory with other socioeconomic variables. The key finding is that working in fishing makes economic agents less risk averse than others. Fishermen also tend to be less sensitive to probability weighting changes in the experiment. It is possible that fishermen have adapted to their unique environment by using specific heuristics for decision making under conditions of uncertainty.

AB The evolution of the ratio of direct taxation (characterized by progressive rates) over indirect and payroll taxation (characterized by flat rates) is examined together with its distributional consequences for the Bottom 50%, Middle 40% and Top 10% shares of income. Oscillations of this ratio coincide with the US electoral cycles since the 1960s. We show that periods in which this ratio increases coincide with those in which Democrats rule the government and there is more redistribution from the rich (the Top 10%) to the rest of the population. Conversely, periods in which this ratio falls and Republicans hold the power are characterized by a fall in the ratio and less redistribution from the rich to the rest of the population. Based on a set of counterfactual simulations, we hypothesize that the rich, as informed economic agents, are able to protect themselves against tighter fiscal conditions, thereby curtailing the redistributive effects of enhanced tax progressivity.

AB Purpose: Knowledge of the blood pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies is crucial in deciding the optimal time for starting the administration of a "clearing agent"or using a "clearing device." The primary purpose was to investigate whether the pharmacokinetics of various antibodies labeled with the same chelator and In-111 differed significantly after i.v. injection in immunocompetent rats. A new trifunctional chelator called "1033" containing a biotin and a radiometal chelation moiety is introduced, making it possible to use only one conjugation procedure for the antibody.
   Experimental Design: Sixty-five non - tumor-bearing rats were included and divided into four groups (I-IV). The blood pharmacokinetics was investigated for rituximab, BR96, and trastuzumab labeled with 1033 and In-111 (I-III). The whole-body activity and activity uptake in muscle, liver, and kidney, which might explain differences in the early pharmacokinetics in blood, were also measured. hMN14 labeled with another chelator [1,4,7,10 -tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N'',N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)], but with the same radionuclide ((111) In-biotin-DOTA-hMN14), was studied (IV).The blood pharmacokinetics from another 15 tumor-bearing rats was compared with those of non-tumor-bearing rats (III) by injection of In-111-1033-BR96.
   Results: No statistical difference was detected between the groups regarding the blood pharmacokinetics of rituximab, BR96, or trastuzumab. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of In-111-biotin-DOTA-hMN14 exhibited a clear difference compared with others. There were no significant differences in the blood pharmacokinetics of In-111-1033-BR96 between tumor-bearing rats and non-tumor-bearing rats.
   Conclusions: Different antibodies labeled with the trifunctional chelator 1033 and In-111 did not exhibit different blood pharmacokinetics, which means that the pharmacokinetics could be predicted irrespective of the IgG1 antibody chosen. A small tumor burden did not change the pharmacokinetics of the radioimmunoconjugates.

AB Both deterministic and probabilistic load forecasting (DLF and PLF) are of critical importance to reliable and economical power system operations. However, most of the widely used statistical machine learning (ML) models are trained by optimizing the global performance, without considering the local behaviour. This paper develops a two-step short-term load forecasting (STLF) model with Q-learning based dynamic model selection (QMS), which provides reinforced deterministic and probabilistic load forecasts (DLFs and PLFs). First, a deterministic forecasting model pool (DMP) and a probabilistic forecasting model pool (PMP) are built based on 10 state-of-the-art ML DLF models and 4 predictive distribution models. Then, in the first-step of each time stamp, a Q-learning agent selects the locally-best DLF model from the DMP to provide an enhanced DLF. At last, the DLF is input to the best PLF model selected from the PMP by another Q-learning agent to perform PLF in the second-step. Numerical simulations on two-year weather and smart meter data show that the developed STLF-QMS method improves DLF and PLF by 50% and 60%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art benchmarks.

ID FREE-ENERGY PRINCIPLE
AB In this paper we investigate the active inference framework as a means to enable autonomous behavior in artificial agents. Active inference is a theoretical framework underpinning the way organisms act and observe in the real world. In active inference, agents act in order to minimize their so called free energy, or prediction error. Besides being biologically plausible, active inference has been shown to solve hard exploration problems in various simulated environments. However, these simulations typically require handcrafting a generative model for the agent. Therefore we propose to use recent advances in deep artificial neural networks to learn generative state space models from scratch, using only observation-action sequences. This way we are able to scale active inference to new and challenging problem domains, whilst still building on the theoretical backing of the free energy principle. We validate our approach on the mountain car problem to illustrate that our learnt models can indeed trade-off instrumental value and ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that generative models can also be learnt using high-dimensional pixel observations, both in the OpenAI Gym car racing environment and a real-world robotic navigation task. Finally we show that active inference based policies are an order of magnitude more sample efficient than Deep Q Networks on RL tasks.

AB This paper presents a hybrid agent-based stock-flow-consistent model featuring heterogeneous banks, purposely built to examine the effects of variations in banks' expectations formation and forecasting behaviour and to conduct policy experiments with a focus on monetary and prudential policy. The model is initialised to a deterministic stationary state and a subset of its free parameters are calibrated empirically in order to reproduce characteristics of UK macro-time-series data. Experiments carried out on the baseline focus on the expectations formation and forecasting behaviour of banks through allowing banks to switch between forecasting strategies and having them engage in least-squares learning. Overall, simple heuristics are remarkably robust in the model. In the baseline, which represents a relatively stable environment, the use of arguably more sophisticated expectations formation mechanisms makes little difference to simulation results. In a modified version of the baseline representing a less stable environment alternative heuristics may in fact be destabilising. To conclude the paper, a range of policy experiments is conducted, showing that an appropriate mix of monetary and prudential policy can considerably attenuate the macroeconomic volatility produced by the model.

AB Leverage trading, which consists of short selling and buying on margin, has been introduced into stock markets in many countries, including China. Ever since, there have been heated debates on how leverage trading influences financial markets. In this paper, an agent-based artificial market model is developed to simulate market behaviors and to analyze the influence of the leverage ratio on liquidity, volatility and price-discovery efficiency. In our artificial market, heterogeneous agents submit limit orders based on the fundamentalist or chartist strategy, and their effective supplies and demands can be increased by short selling or margin trading. Numerical analyses are performed in both one-sided and two-sided markets. We find that in one-sided markets, leverage trading can increase market liquidity and volatility, and decrease price-discovery efficiency. However, in the two-sided market, the increase of liquidity is much smaller, the volatility is decreased, and the price-discovery efficiency is improved. Generally, this model provides some meaningful results, which are supported by many other studies, and these findings underscore the necessity of building up a two-sided market when introducing leverage trading into stock markets.

AB Curcumin, an active ingredient of Curcuma longa Linn (Zingiberaceae), has shown potential antidepressant-like activity in animal studies. The objectives of this trial were to compare the efficacy and safety of curcumin with fluoxetine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Herein, 60 patients diagnosed with MDD were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio for six weeks observer-masked treatment with fluoxetine (20 mg) and curcumin (1000 mg) individually or their combination. The primary efficacy variable was response rates according to Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17-item version (HAM-D-17). The secondary efficacy variable was the mean change in HAM-D-17 score after six weeks. We observed that curcumin was well tolerated by all the patients. The proportion of responders as measured by the HAM-D-17 scale was higher in the combination group (77.8%) than in the fluoxetine (64.7%) and the curcumin (62.5%) groups; however, these data were not statistically significant (P = 0.58). Interestingly, the mean change in HAM-D-17 score at the end of six weeks was comparable in all three groups (P = 0.77). This study provides first clinical evidence that curcumin may be used as an effective and safe modality for treatment in patients with MDD without concurrent suicidal ideation or other psychotic disorders.

AB We investigate, through a kinetic-exchange model, the impact that an external field, like advertising and propaganda, has on opinion dynamics. We address the situations where two opposite alternatives can be selected but the possibility of indecision also exists. In this model, individuals influence each other through pairwise interactions, which can be of agreement or disagreement, and there are also external fields that can skew decision making. Two parameters are used to model the external interactions: one measures the sensitivity of the individuals to be influenced, another quantifies in which direction. We study this model in a fully connected social network scenario, by means of numerical simulations of the kinetic exchange dynamics and analytical results derived from the mean-field rate equations. We show how the external bias gives rise to imperfect bifurcations, and cusp catastrophes, allowing abrupt changes and hysteresis depending on the level of disagreement in interpersonal interactions and on the strength of the external influence.

AB Employing an adaptive agent-based modeling approach, the present study explored the evolvement of firms' environmental behavior and influencing factors. Using empirical data from 167 firms in China, the simulation results revealed that firms' environmental behavior followed this evolvement path: defensive behavior, preventive behavior, and enthusiastic behavior. Computational experiments indicated that with increased financial ability and level of environmental preparedness, the number of firms in all three categories of environmental behavior increased and so did their profits. With increased public pressure, the number of firms with defensive environmental behavior and their profits decreased, but the number of firms with preventive and enthusiastic environmental behavior and their profits increased. On the other hand, when managers' education level increased, the number of firms with defensive behavior deceased, but their profits increased slightly, though the number of firms with preventive and enthusiastic behavior and their profits increased sharply. In addition, with the increased regulation level, the number of firms with a different category of environmental behavior and their profits decreased. Finally, with increased financial subsidy and market share, the number of firms with different behavior and their profits were modified slightly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The greatest challenge facing the biomedical research community is the effective translation of basic mechanistic knowledge into clinically effective therapeutics. This challenge is most evident in attempts to understand and modulate "systems" processes/disorders, such as sepsis, cancer, and wound healing. Formulating an investigatory strategy for these issues requires the recognition that these are dynamic processes. Representation of the dynamic behavior of biological systems can aid in the investigation of complex pathophysiological processes by augmenting existing discovery procedures by integrating disparate information sources and knowledge. This approach is termed Translational Systems Biology. Focusing on the development of computational models capturing the behavior of mechanistic hypotheses provides a tool that bridges gaps in the understanding of a disease process by visualizing "thought experiments" to fill those gaps. Agent-based modeling is a computational method particularly well suited to the translation of mechanistic knowledge into a computational framework. Utilizing agent-based models as a means of dynamic hypothesis representation will be a vital means of describing, communicating, and integrating community-wide knowledge. The transparent representation of hypotheses in this dynamic fashion can form the basis of "knowledge ecologies," where selection between competing hypotheses will apply an evolutionary paradigm to the development of community knowledge.

AB An evolutionary algorithm based on cooperative coevolution is applied to a classification problem, the Pima Indian diabetes diagnosis problem. Previous cooperative coevolution algorithms were developed for function optimization [1], optimizing agents behaviour [2] or modelling the behaviour of a robot in an unknown environment [3]. The aim of this paper is to integrate the cooperative approach into a learning classifier system and use it for solving a real-world problem of classification. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts on applying cooperative coevolution specifically to classification. For each category of the classification problem, a sub-population evolves specific rules using a classical genetic algorithm. Sub-populations evolve simultaneously but independently; cooperation between them takes place only when the fitness of an individual in computed. Obtained experimental results encourage further investigation.

AB The focus of this study is to bring new insights on the relationship between team dynamics and performance at the systems (i.e. global) level. In this light, we describe a body of research that identifies characteristics of team dynamics and their relation to team performance. Non-linear dynamical systems methods were applied to communication and coordination behaviors of teams in two different studies: human-synthetic agent teams in a Remotely-Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) simulated task environment and human-dyads in a simulated victim locator Minecraft task environment. An inverted U-shaped model was discovered that related team coordination and team performance. Specifically, we identified that Human-Autonomy Team (HAT)s were rigid compared to all-human teams that were least stable; and the extreme stability and instability is associated with low levels of team performance. Based on this model, we hypothesize that (1) with enough training and experience, teams should become increasingly stable, ultimately reaching an optimal blend of stability and flexibility and (2) as autonomous agents become increasingly flexible and adaptive, HATs should trend toward this moderate level of stability.

AB This paper aims to contribute to the debate on the determinants of financial instability suggested by Hyman P. Minsky. In particular, we discuss the difficulties of analytically addressing his theory and the new scientific frontiers opened by agent-based modeling. Hyman Minsky's work is known as the reference point for several critical strands of standard economic theory. Through these strands, he tries to provide a "financial" interpretation of Keynes's General Theory. Minsky's main research findings converge into the financial instability hypothesis (FIH), according to which in a system based on capitalistic dynamics and characterized by growing and complex financial relations, the economy tends to move from a stable system to a frail one. What causes the economy to become more fragile is derived endogenously from inherent speculative behavior of a financial nature. However, it is not easy to formalize the FIH into a rigorous analytical model. In this regard, we present a survey of Minsky's unorthodox contribution and the recent development of simulation-agent-based models as a new research agenda that can help to model his FIH.

AB Understanding interactions between individual animals and their resources is fundamental to ecology. Agent-Based Models (ABMs) offer an opportunity to study how individuals move given the spatial distribution and characteristics of their resources. When contrasted with empirical individual-resource network data, ABMs can be a powerful method to detect the processes behind observed movement patterns, as they allow for a complete and quantitative analysis of the agent-to-environment relationships. Here we use the small-scale, within-patch movement of bumblebees (Bombes pascuorum) as a case study to demonstrate how ABMs can be combined with network statistics to provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind the interactions between individuals and their resources.
   We build an ABM that explicitly simulates the influence of distance to the nearest flowering plant (allowing minimal energy expenditure and maximum time spent foraging), plant height and number of flower heads (as a proxy of food availability) on local foraging decisions of bumblebees. The relative importance of these three elements is determined using pattern-oriented modelling (POM), where we confront the network statistics (number of visited plants, number of interactions, nestedness and modularity) of a real B. pascuorum individual-resource network with the emergent patterns of our ABM. We also explore the model results using spatial analysis.
   The model is able to reproduce the observed network statistics. Despite the complex behaviour of bumblebees, our results show a surprisingly precise match between the structure of the simulated and empirical networks after adjusting a single model parameter controlling the importance of distance to the next plant visited.
   Our study illustrates the potential of combining field data, ABMs and individual-resource networks for evaluating small-scale, within-patch movement decisions to better understand animal movements in natural habitats. We discuss the benefits of our approach when compared to more classical statistical methods, and its ability to test various scenarios in a new or altered environment.

AB The water gas shift reaction (WGSR) is an attractive process for enhancing the conversion of syngas carbon monoxide contents into carbon dioxide and hydrogen by means of steam in medium-and small-scale coal gasification power plants integrated with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies.
   Fixed bed gasifiers, in fact, may become an interesting solution for medium- and small-scale applications in distributed power generation, although a syngas with a low LHV (about 6-7 MJ/kg), high N-2 (40-45%) and low H-2 content, is generated when air is used, as usual, as oxidant. Syngas LHV can be enhanced by using oxygen (or oxygen enriched air) instead of air. However, when oxygen is used an appropriate amount of diluent agent as additional steam, recirculated syngas or CO2 is fed into the gasifier to control gasification temperature. In the case of syngas recirculation, the gasification process produces a syngas characterized by a high CO2 content, suitable for a more efficient separation.
   This paper concerns the experimental investigation and numerical simulation of carbon monoxide conversion and hydrogen generation from WGSR, when high CO2 content operating mixtures are considered. A baseline mixture was assumed that simulates the fuel gas produced by coal gasification in a small-scale air-blown updraft gasifier. During the experiments the fraction of N-2 in the baseline mixture was gradually replaced with increasing CO2 fraction in order to investigate its effects of CO2 concentration on reaction and catalysts performances. An experimental apparatus, designed and built at the Department of Mechanical Engineering of the University of Cagliari (DIMECA), was used to investigate the main performance of WGSR, using high CO2-content operating mixtures and different catalyst types (Fe/Cr or Pt/Al for high temperature and Cu/Zn or Pt/Al for low temperature), and varying fundamental parameters, such as residence time of reactants in the catalyst bed, reaction temperature and H2O/CO ratio.
   The experimental results are supported by an in-depth numerical analysis. Numerical simulations were carried out using zero-dimensional (CSTR-based equilibrium model), one-dimensional (PFR-based) and CFD two-dimensional computational models to characterize the spatial and time-dependent behavior of the process.

AB Dynamic fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) is a promising technique for the study of the metabolic process of fluorescent agents in the biological body in vivo, and the quality of the parametric images relies heavily on the accuracy of the reconstructed FMT images. In typical dynamic FMT implementations, the imaged object is continuously monitored for more than 50 minutes. During each minute, a set of the fluorescent measurements is acquired and the corresponding FMT image is reconstructed. It is difficult to manually set the regularization parameter in the reconstruction of each FMT image. In this paper, the parametric images obtained with the L-curve and U-curve methods are quantitatively evaluated through numerical simulations, phantom experiments and in vivo experiments. The results illustrate that the U-curve method obtains better accuracy, stronger robustness and higher noise-resistance in parametric imaging. Therefore, it is a promising approach to automatic selection of the regularization parameters for dynamic FMT. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America

AB A transient spherical multipole expansion-like solution for acoustic scattering from a spherical object is derived within a mesh-free and singularity-free time domain integral equation (TDIE) framework for the sound-soft, sound-rigid and penetrable cases. The method is based on an expansion of the time domain Green's function that allows independent evaluation of spatial and temporal convolutions. The TDIE system is solved by descretizing the integral equations in space and time, forming a matrix system via the method of moments, and solving the system with the marching on in time algorithm. Spatial discretization using tesseral harmonics leads to closed form expressions for spatial integrals, and use of a strictly band limited temporal interpolant permits efficient, accurate computation of temporal convolutions via numerical quadrature. The accuracy of these integrations ensures late time stability and accuracy of the deconvolution data. Results presented demonstrate the accuracy and convergence of the approach for broadband simulations compared with Fourier transformed analytical data. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.

AB When a new product enters the market, individual consumers' decision-making behavior and purchase time are uncertain. Based on the dynamics of epidemic transmission theory and agent modeling technology, this study proposes a new coupling model through the combination of the improved SEIR epidemic model and the heterogeneous agent model. This model considers consumer heterogeneity resulting from three aspects in consumers' sensitivity, network topology, and considerations of information flow received. It aims to analyze how consumer heterogeneity affects the scale and speed of new product diffusion. The proposed model showed that consumers' characteristics and behavior combination at the microlevel lead to the diversity of nonlinear diffusion curves at the macrolevel for new products. Moreover, a pilot study is conducted to simulate this model and examine how to estimate the model's parameters using aggregated data about film products. The pilot study results suggested that different consumer characteristics and behavior combinations affect the scale and speed of new product diffusion to varying degrees. In different scenarios, there were significant differences in the influence of the degree of consumer heterogeneity on diffusion, accompanied by the occurrence of threshold. The results of the empirical analysis in this study are in line with reality.

AB To increase the utilization of side-streams from the food industry more investigations of multiple protein systems could be beneficial, complementary to the extensive studies available on single sourced protein isolates. Here, high moisture content protein-rich side streams were investigated in single screw extrusion. Vegetable protein mixtures comprising potato protein, oat protein and wheat bran were considered. Potato starch and potato fibers were used as structuring agents. Microstructurally, all compositions were dominated by protein aggregates. The structural agents enhanced the interconnected starch phase and/or additionally introduced fiber aggregates, with little apparent influence on the protein aggregates size and distribution. The moisture content was found to exert a dominant influence on the shear viscosity of the compositions. In addition, a saturation behavior of the power law parameters over 45% moisture content was apparent in the presence of the structural agents. An improved knowledge of industrial side-streams processability could increase their use in novel food products and exploited to create products with improved nutritional profiles.

AB Many types of plasma processes have been investigated as potential agents for decomposing persistent organic compounds in water using hydroxyl radicals (center dot OH), and a wide range of energy efficiency in the reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) has been observed. In this study, loss mechanisms of center dot OH that limit the energy efficiency were investigated using a plasma generated over an acetic acid solution. Various experiments, including the analysis of the decomposition process, a parametric study, and a numerical simulation, revealed that there are two main loss mechanisms: (i) a self-quenching reaction that generates hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and (ii) a reaction of center dot OH with H2O2 and hydroperoxyl radicals (HO2 center dot). In the solution, center dot OH reacts with these scavengers rather than target compounds. A pulsed plasma with a low current density, low repetition rate, and short pulse duration can be utilized to achieve high efficiency. (C) 2015 The Japan Society of Applied Physics

AB The use of standard molecular dynamics simulation methods to predict the interactions of a protein with a material surface have the inherent limitations of lacking the ability to determine the most likely conformations and orientations of the adsorbed protein on the surface and to determine the level of convergence attained by the simulation. In addition, standard mixing rules are typically applied to combine the nonbonded force field parameters of the solution and solid phases of the system to represent interfacial behavior without validation. As a means to circumvent these problems, the authors demonstrate the application of an efficient advanced sampling method (TIGER2A) for the simulation of the adsorption of hen egg-white lysozyme on a crystalline (110) high-density polyethylene surface plane. Simulations are conducted to generate a Boltzmann-weighted ensemble of sampled states using force field parameters that were validated to represent interfacial behavior for this system. The resulting ensembles of sampled states were then analyzed using an in-house-developed cluster analysis method to predict the most probable orientations and conformations of the protein on the surface based on the amount of sampling performed, from which free energy differences between the adsorbed states were able to be calculated. In addition, by conducting two independent sets of TIGER2A simulations combined with cluster analyses, the authors demonstrate a method to estimate the degree of convergence achieved for a given amount of sampling. The results from these simulations demonstrate that these methods enable the most probable orientations and conformations of an adsorbed protein to be predicted and that the use of our validated interfacial force field parameter set provides closer agreement to available experimental results compared to using standard CHARMM force field parameterization to represent molecular behavior at the interface.

AB Primary care systems are a cornerstone of universally accessible health care. The planning, analysis, and adaptation of primary care systems is a highly non-trivial problem due to the systems' inherent complexity, unforeseen future events, and scarcity of data. To support the search for solutions, this paper introduces the hybrid agent-based simulation model SiM-Care. SiM-Care models and tracks the micro-interactions of patients and primary care physicians on an individual level. At the same time, it models the progression of time via the discrete-event paradigm. Thereby, it enables modelers to analyze multiple key indicators such as patient waiting times and physician utilization to assess and compare primary care systems. Moreover, SiM-Care can evaluate changes in the infrastructure, patient behavior, and service design. To showcase SiM-Care and its validation through expert input and empirical data, we present a case study for a primary care system in Germany. Specifically, we study the immanent implications of demographic change on rural primary care and investigate the effects of an aging population and a decrease in the number of physicians, as well as their combined effects.

AB The bubble evolution and dissolution process in a glass furnace is an extremely complicated physico-chemical phenomenon. Most of the huge number of bubbles, generated in molten glass during the decomposition of the glass batch, are removed during the trajectory from the charging end to the forming section, but some remain in final products. On the basis of the two mechanisms, flotation and absorption, in the bubble removing process, a numerical simulator was developed to evaluate the influence of first, glass and batch composition, including refining agents, second, geometrical tank design and third, furnace operating conditions upon the bubble quality in products. In particular, the simulator enabled the estimation of the effect of refining gases which are caused by decomposition of the refining agents. Furthermore, an index was devised to synthetically assess the numbers of bubbles in final products. In part 1, the principles of the model which composes the simulator are described in mathematical formulation. The basic equations with boundary conditions and calculation procedures for thermal flow of molten glass, gas concentration in glass melt and gas evolvement from the refining agents are presented. The calculation strategy of the bubble removing process is also described.

This idea can be simulated by the method of computer aid simulation. SWARM, which is developed by Santa Fe Institute, is such a tools kit based on the bottom-up modeling method that can be used in CAS simulation on computer. This paper presented a Swarm based simulation platform for the study on complexity in flood disaster. Its application is illustrated with a SWARM based model and program for simulating spatial and temporal emergence of flooding. This model offers virtually unlimited possibilities to simulate the emergence of flooding. Some rules have been elicited from the experimental results, which could provide useful information for the disaster reduction and management.

AB Several studies in rats support the idea of multiple neural systems competing to select the best action for reaching a goal or food location. Locale navigation strategies, necessary for reaching invisible goals, seem to be mediated by the hippocampus and the ventral and dorsomedial striatum whereas taxon strategies, applied for approaching goals in the visual field, are believed to involve the dorsolateral striatum. A computational model of action selection is presented, in which different experts, implementing locale and taxon strategies, compete in order to select the appropriate behavior for the current task. The model was tested in a simulated robot using an experimental paradigm that dissociates the use of cue and spatial information.

AB A proper traction-separation law based on the physical behaviors of the concrete-epoxy interface is needed to simulate the debonding behavior of fiber-reinforced polymers-strengthened concrete structures. However, no method is available to measure the traction-separation law of the concrete-epoxy interface under mode-I loading. To address this gap, this study proposes a novel testing method to directly measure the traction-separation law of the concrete-epoxy interface. This method uses a wedge-splitting test specimen that not only requires simple testing setups but also produces stable crack propagation in the specimen. By adopting a rigid body moment assumption, the traction in the concrete-epoxy interface is expressed as a function of the applied load and the crack opening displacement. As a result, this method can directly calculate the relationship between the traction and the separation of the concrete-epoxy interface by simply recording the crack opening displacement and the applied load during the test. The success of the new method has been confirmed through experimental study. Testing results show the traction-separation law of the concrete-epoxy interface under mode-I loading can be approximated by a tri-linear law. The new method is also used to evaluate the long-term durability of concrete-epoxy interface subjected to moisture attack. It has been found that conditioning the interface specimens in water can significantly reduce the tensile strength and fracture toughness of the interface. The effectiveness of applying silane coupling agent to enhance the durability of the concrete-epoxy interface has also been confirmed by this new testing method.

AB Feasibility of detecting intravascular flow using a catheter based endovascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) system is demonstrated in a porcine carotid model in vivo. The effects of A-line density, radial distance, signal-to-noise ratio, non-uniform rotational distortion (NURD), phase stability of the swept wavelength laser and interferometer system on Doppler shift detection limit were investigated in stationary and flow phantoms. Techniques for NURD induced phase shift artifact removal were developed by tracking the catheter sheath. Detection of high flow velocity (similar to 51 cm/s) present in the porcine carotid artery was obtained by phase unwrapping techniques and compared to numerical simulation, taking into consideration flow profile distortion by the eccentrically positioned imaging catheter. Using diluted blood in saline mixture as clearing agent, simultaneous Doppler OCT imaging of intravascular flow and structural OCT imaging of the carotid artery wall was feasible. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo demonstration of Doppler imaging and absolute measurement of intravascular flow using a rotating fiber catheter in carotid artery.

AB The mechanical properties and morphology of ternary composites based on PP-EPDM blends reinforced with natural flax fibers are analyzed. In order to evaluate the simultaneous effect of the incorporation of both elastomer and fibers, an experimental design based on a Doehlert Uniform Net has been employed. The tensile, flexural and impact behaviors of the composites are investigated, and the results show that flax fibers behave as an effective reinforcing agent in these systems. In fact, a considerable increase in the studied properties in the presence of the fibers was observed. It is interesting to note that the reinforcing effect is more noticeable as the EPDM content in the blend increases. Morphological studies by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were also carried out.

AB In this article, thermal behavior of an epoxy based thermoset polymer has been discussed using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The simulations were performed on crosslinked network of EPON-862 and curing agent-W (DETDA) using consistent valence force field (CUFF). Thermal conductivity was calculated using both equilibrium as well as non-equilibrium molecular dynamics approaches and the results were found to be in good agreement with experimental findings. Different contributions of heat flux vector towards thermal conductivity and their possible coupling are discussed in terms of various convective and virial contributions. In addition, discussion of power spectra analysis of velocity autocorrelation function for crosslinked network shows a broad distribution of low frequency vibrational modes suggesting distribution of relaxation times.

AB departments is used in times of austerity, and how insights from agency and stewardship theory can enhance the understanding of this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors distinguish two types of MC (constraining and facilitating) based on their different assumptions regarding human behavior (agent- like and steward-like). The authors empirically analyze changes in the use of these types of MC in four cases located in two municipalities. The collected data consists of 51 semi-structured interviews, desk research and multiple field observations.
   Findings - The authors find that MC at the departmental level becomes more constraining in times of austerity. The authors suggest that an overemphasis on constraining MC has negative consequences. It can, for instance, evoke agent- like, opportunistic behavior while it disregards potential steward-like behavior. These negative consequences are less prevalent when there is a simultaneous increase in emphasis on the use of facilitating MC elements.
   Originality/value - The authors acknowledge "human ambivalence," i.e. an employee's recurring choice between agent- like and steward-like behavior, and illustrate the dangers of overly relying on constraining types of MC. The authors also contemplate alternative strategic managerial responses to austerity in a public sector context.

AB Increasing returns to scale (IRS) phenomena are widely present in economies, and integrated assessment models (IAMs) for climate change generally assume constant returns to scale (CRS). This paper studies the connection between IRS in energy-intensive sectors and the regions' attitude towards climate change. In a model of detrimental (negative) externality, we proved that if some agents' activities related to externality generation exhibit IRS, their optimal target in the efficient externality provision can be very close to their inefficient non-cooperative Coumot-Nash equilibrium position. The numerical simulations in this paper confirm the analytical conclusion. The analytical results point out the potential biases of IAMs under the CRS assumption and provide a better explanation of difficulties in international climate negotiations. Finally, the paper offers some policy suggestions on climate negotiation in the presence of IRS. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   EXPOSURES; MODELS; AGENTS; RISK
AB Customized open-source software is used to characterize, exemplify, compare and critically evaluate mathematical/computational synergy analysis methods currently used in biology, and used or potentially applicable in radiobiology. As examples, we reanalyze some published results on murine Harderian gland tumors and on in vitro chromosome aberrations induced by exposure to single-ion radiations that simulate components of the galactic cosmic ray field. Baseline no-synergy/no-antagonism-mixture dose-effect relationships are calculated for corresponding mixed fields. No new experimental results are presented. Synergy analysis of effects due to a mixed radiation field whose components' individual dose-effect relationships are highly curvilinear should not consist of simply comparing to the sum of the components' effects. Such curvilinearity must often be allowed for in current radiobiology, especially when studying possible non-targeted ("bystander'') effects. Consequently, many different synergy analysis theories are currently used in biology to replace simple effect additivity. We give evidence that for most synergy experiments and observations, incremental effect additivity is the most appropriate replacement. It has a large domain of applicability, being useful even when pronounced individual dose-effect relationship curvilinearity is a confounding factor. It allows calculation of 95% confidence intervals for baseline mixture dose-effect relationships taking into account parameter correlations; if non-targeted effects are important this gives much tighter intervals than neglecting the correlations. It always obeys two consistency conditions that simple effect additivity usually fails to obey: a "mixture of mixtures principle'' and the standard "sham mixture principle''. The mixture of mixtures principle is important in radiobiology because even nominally single-ion radiations are usually mixtures when they strike the biological target, due to intervening material. It is not yet clear whether mixing galactic cosmic ray components sometimes leads to statistically significant synergy for animal tumorigenesis. The substantial limitations of synergy theories are sometimes overlooked, and they warrant further study. (C) 2018 by Radiation Research Society.

AB Cell behavior patterns that lead to distinct tissue or capillary phenotypes are difficult to identify using existing approaches. We present a strategy to characterize the form, frequency, magnitude and sequence of human endothelial cell activity when stimulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We introduce a "Rules-as-Agents" method for rapid comparison of cell behavior hypotheses to in vitro angiogenesis experiments. Endothelial cells are represented as machines that transition between finite behavior states, and their properties are explored by a search algorithm. We rank and quantify differences between competing hypotheses about cell behavior during the formation of unique capillary phenotypes. Results show the interaction of tip and stalk endothelial cells, and predict how migration, proliferation, branching, and elongation integrate to form capillary structures within a 3D matrix in the presence of varying VEGF and BDNF concentrations. This work offers the ability to understand - and ultimately control - human cell behavior at the microvasculature level. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB There is much empirical evidence that human decision-making under risk does not coincide with expected value maximization, and much effort has been invested into the development of descriptive theories of human decision-making involving risk (e. g. Prospect Theory). An open question is how behavior corresponding to these descriptive models could have been learned or arisen evolutionarily, as the described behavior differs from expected value maximization. We believe that the answer to this question lies, at least in part, in the interplay between risk-taking, sequentiality of choice, and population dynamics in evolutionary environments. In this paper, we provide the results of several evolutionary game simulations designed to study the risk behavior of agents in evolutionary environments. These include several evolutionary lottery games where sequential decisions are made between risky and safe choices, and an evolutionary version of the well-known stag hunt game. Our results show how agents that are sometimes risk-prone and sometimes risk-averse can outperform agents that make decisions solely based on the maximization of the local expected values of the outcomes, and how this can facilitate the evolution of cooperation in situations where cooperation entails risk.

TI Avalanche outbreaks emerging in cooperative contagions
SO NATURE PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EXPLOSIVE PERCOLATION; INFLUENZA
AB The spreading of contagions can exhibit a percolation transition, which separates transitory prevalence from outbreaks that reach a finite fraction of the population(1,2). Such transitions are commonly believed to be continuous, but empirical studies have shown more violent spreading modes when the participating agents are not limited to one type. Striking examples include the co-epidemic of the Spanish flu and pneumonia that occurred in 1918 (refs 3,4), and, more recently, the concurrent prevalence of HIV/AIDS and a host of diseases(5-7). It remains unclear to what extent an outbreak in the presence of interacting pathogens differs from that due to an ordinary single-agent process. Here we study a mechanistic model for understanding contagion processes involving inter-agent cooperation. Our stochastic simulations reveal the possible emergence of a massive avalanche-like outbreak right at the threshold, which is manifested as a discontinuous phase transition. Such an abrupt change arises only if the underlying network topology supports a bottleneck for cascaded mutual infections. Surprisingly, all these discontinuous transitions are accompanied by non-trivial critical behaviours, presenting a rare case of hybrid transition(8). The findings may imply the origin of catastrophic occurrences in many realistic systems, from co-epidemics to financial contagions(9).

For this purpose, the momentum equations were formulated and solved in a boundary-fitted orthogonal coordinate system. On the basis of resolved hydrodynamics of the contaminated drop, the transient mass transfer was formulated and solved in the same coordinate system. In order to check the applicability of the numerical scheme, single drop extraction experiments were conducted in a totally closed droplet file column with the terminal effect efficiently eliminated. The MIBK-acetic acid-water system was used with small quantities of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate), Triton X-100, or Tween 80 introduced into the continuous phase. For these experimental cases, the flow field and the drag coefficient of a contaminated drop were simulated first. The numerical prediction of the drag coefficient is found in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data. It illustrates that the behavior of a drop approaches that of a rigid sphere and that about 100 times higher bulk concentration of SDS than that of Triton X-100 is required for the same extent contamination of a MIBK drop of the same size. Then the information of the flow field of a contaminated MIBK drop was used in simulating the transient mass transfer of solute into the drop. The resulted extraction fraction and overall mass transfer coefficient are in reasonable coincidence with the experimental data. Both numerical results and experimental data show that overall mass transfer coefficient of a heavily contaminated drop is only about one third of that in the pure system. This can be explained well by the distribution of the local Sherwood number, which drops down abruptly along the rear stagnant surface. Also the interfacial resistance of adsorbed surfactant was incorporated in the mass transfer model and then estimated by the least square fitting the simulation with data. The numerical results also show that Tween 80 presents obvious interfacial resistance on the acetic acid diffusing across the interface, whereas SDS and Triton X-100 show no interfacial resistance. It is suggested that the numerical simulation can be resorted in some solvent extraction systems containing surfactants to conduct numerical experiments and parametric study. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Surface-active ionic liquids (SAILs) belonging to the series of N-alkylmethylimidazolium halides [C(8)mimX] (X = Br, CI, and BF4) and [C(n)mimBr] (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) were employed to understand the influence of hydrophobicity of alkyl chain length and the chaotropicity of counter-ions of SAILs on the micellization, antimicrobial action and cytotoxicity properties. The micellization phenomenon of SAILs in an aqueous environment was examined employing tensiometry and steady-state fluorescence spectrophotometry. The corresponding interfacial parameters viz., critical micelle concentration (CMC), effectiveness (gamma(CMC)), surface pressure (Pi(CMC)), maximum surface excess concentration (Gamma(max) and the minimum area engaged per molecule (A(min)) at the air- water interface were evaluated at 303.15 K. These experimental findings were monitored and geometrically optimized theoretically using Gaussian software to highlight the recent advances in this field of theoretical calculations for putative structure. The simulation descriptors correlated the micellization behavior as a function of hydrophobicity which may contribute to obtaining awareness on their ecological behavior and fate. In addition, the biological screening of all the examined SAILs was undertaken with a combined experimental and theoretical (optimized) method against bacteria and fungus. Results revealed that SAILs with the alkyl chain-length greater than C-8- act as a fair antimicrobial agent against the selected microbial strain which is attributed to the enhanced degree of SAILs hydrophobicity. The cytotoxicity of these imidazolium-based SAILs was also assessed on the cervical human cell line (HeLa) using the MTT cell viability assay and the data thus obtained were subjected to statistical analysis.

AB Global climate change and local development make water supply one of the most vulnerable sectors in Australia. The Australian government has therefore commissioned a series of projects to evaluate water availability and the sustainable use of water resources in Australia. This paper discusses a river system modelling platform that has been used in some of these nationally significant projects. The platform consists of three components: provenance, modelling engine and reporting database. The core component is the modelling engine, an agent-based hydrological simulation system called the Integrated River System Modelling Framework (IRSMF). All configuration information and inputs to IRSMF are recorded in the provenance component so that modelling processes can be reproduced and results audited. The reporting database is used to store key statistics and raw output time series data for selected key parameters. This river system modelling platform has for the first time modelled a river system at the basin level in Australia. It provides practitioners with a unique understanding of the characteristics and emergent behaviours of river systems at the basin level. Although the platform is purpose-built for the Murray-Darling Basin, it would be easy to apply it to other basins by using different river models to model agent behaviours.

AB While traditional information systems research emphasizes understanding of end users from perspectives such as cognitive fit and technology acceptance, it fails to consider the economic dimensions of their interactions with a system. When viewed as economic agents who participate in electronic markets, it is easy to see that users' preferences, behaviors, personalities, and ultimately their economic welfare are intricately linked to the design of information systems. We use a data-driven, inductive approach to develop a taxonomy of bidding behavior in online auctions. Our analysis indicates significant heterogeneity exists in the user base of these representative electronic markets. Using online auction data from 1999 and 2000, we find a stable taxonomy of bidder behavior containing five types of bidding strategies. Bidders pursue different bidding strategies that, in aggregate, realize different winning likelihoods and consumer surplus. We find that technological evolution has an impact on bidders' strategies. We demonstrate how the taxonomy of bidder behavior can be used to enhance the design of some types of information systems. These enhancements include developing user-centric bidding agents, inferring bidders' underlying valuations to facilitate real-time auction calibration, and creating low-risk computational platforms for decision making.

DT Article
DE Hopper; Sedimentation; Dredging; Hindered settling; Concentration;

ID VELOCITY
AB Hopper sedimentation is the result of precipitation of typically fine sediment from a homogenous, high-concentration mixture, which is not completely deficient of turbulence. If hopper sedimentation or loading is accomplished through a single-inflow system, or if the irregularity of the inflow concentrations is pronounced or simply terminated, then the hopper mixture will clear. Whereas turbulent mixing is redundant, when the mixture is homogeneous, it may take an active role when the mixture is clearing. The role of turbulence on hopper sedimentation has been the focus of several studies, and a common perception of turbulence (or at least of mixing) is that it delays sedimentation. Existing measurements of sedimentation rates in a closed-flume experiment, engineered to provide input to a hopper sedimentation model, revealed that turbulence in a clearing mixture is not necessarily associated with a delay in sedimentation. The experiment showed that sedimentation was boosted by adding a current to a clearing mixture, which infers that turbulence, under certain conditions, may act as a sedimentation agent on the excess sediment in suspension. Therefore, the interactions between turbulent mixing and settling in high-concentration mixtures were examined theoretically. Analytical solutions for clearance of excess concentrations were derived for the limiting cases of (1) still-water clearance and (2) clearance when the amount of turbulence is abundant. When examining these analytical solutions, a potential for enhanced sedimentation was revealed. It was found that mixing-induced dilution of concentration weakens the hindrance in settling to a degree that enhances sedimentation. The analytical findings prompted a more elaborate analysis of the mechanism using a numerical model, which encompassed time-and depth-varying turbulence. This allowed the experimental setup and the observed settling effects to be simulated. The potential of the enhancing sedimentation mechanism was analyzed under more general conditions with the numerical model. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI Surviving from garbage: the role of informal waste-pickers in a dynamic

SO ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS
LA English
DT Article
ID EXTERNALITIES; EFFICIENCY; RESOURCES; POLICY
AB In developing countries, informal waste-pickers (known as scavengers) play an important role in solid waste management systems, acting in a parallel way to formal waste collection and disposal agents. Scavengers collect, from the streets, dumpsites, or landfills, re-usable and recyclable material that can be reincorporated into the economy's production process. Despite the benefits that they generate to society, waste-pickers are ignored when waste management policies are formulated. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the role of scavengers in a dynamic model of production, consumption, and recovery, and to show that, in an economy producing solid waste, efficiency can be reached using a set of specific and complementary policies: a tax on virgin materials use, a tax on consumption and disposal, and a subsidy to the recovery of material. A numerical simulation is performed to evaluate the impact of these policies on landfill lifetime and natural resource stocks. A discussion on the implementation of these instruments is also included.

AB The long-acting local anaesthetic agent ropivacaine, S(-)-1-propyl-2',6'-pipecoloyxlidid, is characterised by lower lipid solubility and lower cardiotoxicity compared with bupivacaine. This study was designed to evaluate its clinical efficacy and motor blocking properties when using lower volumes and higher concentrations of both plain substances.
   Methods. In a randomised, double-blind study plain ropivacaine (ro) 1% (1 50 mg) and bupivacaine (bu) 0.75% (112.5 mg) were compared in 44 patients. In the lateral position, epidural anaesthesia was performed at L2/3 or L3/4 using the loss-of-resistance technique. A test dose of 3 ml was given followed by 12 ml (total volume 15 ml). Sensory blockade was registered by the pin-prick method after 2 min at 5-min intervals up to maximal levels and after the operation at 30-min intervals. Simultaneously, the motor block was determined by means of the Bromage scale. Results are given as median values.
   Results. The onset of analgesia was 6.0 min for both substances (L2), the time to level L5 16.0 and 17.0 min, respectively. The median maximum upper level of sensory analgesia was achieved after 24.5 min with ro (Th 5) and after 21.0 min (Th 7) with bu. The maximum durations (regression to L2) were 321.5 (ro) and 266.0 min (bu) (P<0.05). Times for 2-segment regression were comparable at 177.5 and 176.0 min, respectively, and for 4-segment regression at 201.3 and 222.0 min. Twenty-one of the 22 patients developed a first-degree motor block (latency 15 and 12 min); 16 patients in the ro group developed a second-degree block, as did 14 in the bu group (latency 24 and 22 min). Third-degree motor block was recorded in 3 patients (latency 45 and 38 min). The duration of first-degree motor block was 233 min and 207 min, of second-degree block 150 and 155 min, and third-degree block 135 min in both groups. The mean arterial pressures and heart rates did not differ. The diastolic pressures were lower after bu (-8.3%) than after ro (-0.4%) at 30 min. No major side effects were observed. Theodrenaline and/or dihydroergotamine (1:10 diluted) was administered to 38.6% of the patients; 34.1% received atropine for the treatment of bradycardias (decrease greater-than-or-equal-to 12%) and hypotension of more than 20%. No significant differences were found in frequency of analgesia (pin-prick) between both groups. One of 22 patients in the ro group and 6 of 22 in the bu group required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia. The difference is not statistically significant, but is of clinical relevance. With 2 patients after ro and 4 patients after bu the relaxation was insufficient for good operating conditions.
   Conclusion. Ropivacaine 1% produced a longer duration of analgesia and better clinical efficacy than bupivacaine 0.75%. The clinical difference in motor blockade was not statistically significant. The Bromage scale is not representative for a substance with good analgesic effects and moderate motor blocking properties, as has been shown in sophisticated studies on ropivacaine motor blockade.

AB OBJECTIVE We hypothesized that a combination of I-Na and I-Ca blockade may be more effective in causing loss of the epicardial action potential (AP) dome and precipitating the Brugada syndrome (BS). The present study was designed to test this hypothesis in an in vitro model of BS.
   BACKGROUND The Brugada syndrome is characterized by an ST segment elevation in the right precordial ECG leads and a high risk of sudden death. The ECG sign of BS is often concealed, but can be unmasked with potent sodium channel blockers. Using canine right ventricular (RV) wedge preparations, we previously developed an experimental model of BS using flecainide to depress the AP dome in RV epicardium.
   METHODS Intracellular APs and a transmural ECG were simultaneously recorded from canine RV wedge preparations.
   RESULTS Terfenadine (5-10 muM)-induced block of I-Ca and I-Na caused heterogeneous loss of the epicardial AP dome, resulting in ST segment elevation, phase 2 reentry (12/16), and spontaneous polymorphic VT/VF (6/16). Flecainide (less than or equal to7.5 muM), ajmaline (less than or equal to20 muM), and procainamide (less than or equal to300 muM) failed to generate polymorphic VT in any preparation except when combined with a calcium channel blocker (verapamil, less than or equal to20 muM). Terfenadine-induced ST segment elevation was normalized and arrhythmias suppressed following It. block with 4-aminopyridine (0.5-2 mM).
   CONCLUSION Our data suggest that combined sodium and calcium channel block may be more effective than sodium channel block alone in unmasking the Brugada syndrome and that pharmacologic agents that inhibit I-to may be useful in preventing lethal arrhythmias in patients with the syndrome.

ID DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS
AB Dendritic macromolecules are hyperbranched polymers that emanate from a central core, have a defined number of generations and functional end groups, and are synthesized in a stepwise process by a repetitive reaction sequence. This hyperbranched topology results in a unique series of physical and chemical properties exhibited by these molecules which, in turn, could be exploited in a number of diverse possible applications, such as nanoscale catalysis, micelle mimics, immune-diagnostic and NMR imaging agents, chemical sensors, molecular antennae, just to name a few.
   Nonetheless, if on one hand the synthesis procedure allows for control over parameters such as size, shape and reactivity (and hence, on final properties), on the other hand it really hampers the production of large quantities of these materials. Accordingly, their cost is still quite high and, therefore, the materials available for characterization is still rather limited.
   Since, however, their full application potentials (particularly in material science and engineering) will not be realized before the understanding of their physical properties is considerably more advanced, in this work we report the results obtained on structural details and related properties of several amine- and nitrile-terminated poly(propylene)imine dendrimer generations by computer simulation studies and discuss them in the light of(scarce) available experimental data.

AB BackgroundAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia which increases the risk of thromboembolic complications and impairs quality of life. An important part of a therapeutic approach for AF is sinus rhythm restoration. Antiarrhythmic agents used in pharmacological cardioversion have limited efficacy and potential risk of proarrhythmia. Simultaneously, underlying conditions of AF should be treated (e.g. electrolyte imbalance, increased blood pressure, neurohormonal disturbances, atrial volume overload). There is still the need for an effective and safe approach to increase AF cardioversion efficacy. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, superiority clinical study is performed in patients with AF in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of intravenous canrenone in sinus rhythm restoration.MethodsEighty eligible patients with an episode of AF lasting less than 48h are randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive canrenone or placebo. Patients randomized to a treatment intervention are receiving canrenone intravenously at a dose of 200mg within 2-3min. Subjects assigned to a control group obtain the same volume of 0.9% saline within the same time. The primary endpoint includes return of sinus rhythm documented in the electrocardiogram within 2h after drug or placebo administration. Other endpoints and safety outcomes analyses, due to expected lack of statistical power, are exploratory.DiscussionCurrent evidence supports renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition as an upstream therapy in AF management. Excess aldosterone secretion results in proarrhythmic effects. Among the RAAS inhibitors, only canrenone is administered intravenously. Canrenone additionally increases the plasma level of potassium, lowers blood pressure and reduces preload. It has been already used in primary and secondary hyperaldosteronism in the course of chronic liver dysfunction and in heart failure.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03536806.

AB Extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been used to investigate the intercalative binding of 9-hydroxyellipticine to the DNA oligonucleotide d(ATATATATATAT)2. Four independent simulations differing in the initial orientation of the drug at the intercalation site were carried out, and compared both with each other and a control simulation of the free DNA sequence. The structure of the latter was compared with structures obtained from x-ray crystallography and nmr spectroscopy, as well as the theoretically derived ''alternating B-DNA'' model [A. Klug et al. (1979), Journal of Molecular Biology, Vol. 131. p. 669]. The alternation of twist angles observed in experimental structures was reproduced in the simulation. All four independent simulations of the drug-DNA intercalation complex converged in placing the pyridine ring of the ellipticine chromophore in the major groove; in one case this involved a 180 degrees rotation of the drug at the intercalation site. At a more detailed level, the drug is seen to be capable of adopting several distinct orientations, each stable over a period of hundreds of pico-seconds. Despite the presence of several polar groups in the drug, however, no direct hydrogen bonding to the DNA occurs; instead, interactions between the methyl groups of the drug and the thymine bases at the intercalation site appear important in determining the orientational preferences of the drug. Comparison of the intercalation complexes with the free DNA sequence shows a degree of unwinding resulting from intercalation, in good agreement with experimental results, but spread over the three central base-pair steps, not confined to the intercalation site itself. Measurements of torsional rigidity indicate only a slight stiffening of the DNA restricted to the immediate site of intercalation. The structures obtained from the MD simulations were used to calculate theoretical CD spectra, with separate simulations giving very different results. This appears to indicate that given an accurate assignment of the main electronic transition dipole moment of the ellipticine chromophore, discrimination of the more realistic binding geometries may be possible. The relative merits of the various drug orientations observed in the simulations are discussed and a perpendicular orientation of the drug at the intercalation site is considered to be the most consistent with experimental data. While the simulations themselves represent a total of over 2 ns, however, the differences apparent between independent runs indicate that longer simulation times will be required before a complete, unequivocal view of DNA intercalation is obtained.

AB Cruzaine is the major cysteine protease of Trypanosoma cruzi. Cruzaine is involved throughout the parasite's life cycle in host cells, and is a promising target in the search for new antichagasic agents. Quantum chemical calculations based on density functional theory (DFT B3LYP/cc-pVDZ) were performed to obtain nuclear magnetic resonance data and to optimize the geometry of four dihydrochalcones. The results showed good agreement with the experimental data and were used to suggest the relative stereochemistry of one of the four dihydrochalcones studied. In addition, we evaluated the interaction of cruzaine with these new inhibitors. We used molecular dynamics simulations, free energy calculations, and a per-residue energy decomposition method. It was observed that these molecules are capable of interacting with residues important for enzymatic activity, like Cys25, His161, and Asp160. The ranking of the inhibitors obtained from the binding free energy calculations is in agreement with that experimentally reported. The evaluation of the energy components involved in these calculations demonstrated that the van der Waals term is the major contributor to the drug-receptor stabilizing interactions.

AB Betaine-modified cationic cellulose was prepared through the reaction of cellulose with betaine hydrochloride by an efficient one-step dry method. Dicyandiamide was used as a dehydrating agent to promote the formation of ester bonds between the reactants. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the cellulose betainate. Experiments showed that at a molar ratio of the cellulose glucose unit, betaine hydrochloride to dicyandiamide, of 1:1:0.5 at 150 degrees C for 3 h, the degree of substitution of the cationic group reached 0.80. The adsorption of simulated C. I. Reactive Red 24 and C. I. Reactive Red 195 wastewater on the cationic cellulose was carried out, and the effects of the adsorbent dose, initial dye concentration, and salt concentration on the dye removal efficiency were investigated. The equilibrium adsorption isotherm data of the cationic cellulose exhibited a better fit to the Langmuir isotherm model than the Freundlich one. The experimental results suggest that the prepared cationic cellulose materials show potential application for reactive dye wastewater treatment. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

AB Balloon angioplasty is an accepted treatment for arterial obstruction; however, a substantial percentage of initially successfully treated lesions recur in the first 4 to 6 months. There is increasing interest in local treatment of lesions undergoing angioplasty to prevent restenosis, and an infusion catheter has been developed for this purpose. This study compared infusion balloon angioplasty by means of saline solution with conventional balloon angioplasty in atherosclerotic iliac arteries of 18 cholesterol-fed New Zealand white rabbits. Values for minimum stenosis diameter assessed angiographically immediately after maximum infusion balloon angioplasty (2.1 +/- 0.6 mm) and after conventional balloon angioplasty (2.3 +/- 0.3 mm, p = NS) were similar. In follow-up studies up to 5 weeks after angioplasty, the angiographic minimum stenosis diameter remained similar in the two treatment groups, but the histologically assessed intimal area was greater after infusion angioplasty (1.54 +/- 0.92 mm vs 1.02 +/- 0.75 mm in conventionally treated arteries, p = 0.0001). Infusion balloon angioplasty merits further evaluation as a treatment strategy for the simultaneous dilatation of atherosclerotic lesions with delivery of therapeutic agents to minimize restenosis.

AB Purpose: To examine the effects of fluctuating oxygen levels on the hypoxic cytotoxin tirapazamine (TPZ) using theoretical predictions.
   Methods and Materials: Tirapazamine's pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic oxygen dependence has previously been characterized in vitro. Here, a one-dimensional theoretical model was used to examine the effects of fluctuating hypoxia on metabolized TPZ concentration, assuming sinusoidally fluctuating oxygen levels. TPZ concentration is changing according to published experimental data. Simulations of experimentally observed time-courses of perivascular pO(2) were also conducted.
   Results: The predicted pharmacodynamic effect of TPZ was increased with fluctuating (vs. constant) hypoxia at all frequencies (1-30 min period) and all amplitudes (1-15 mm Hg). Additionally, fluctuating oxygen resulted in more metabolized TPZ near the oxygen source as compared with the steady-state condition of the same overall average pO(2).
   Conclusions: Fluctuating pO(2) reduced the concentration of metabolized TPZ at distances farther from the source, thereby limiting its ability to reach and kill the most hypoxic cells. These results suggest that the kinetics of fluctuating oxygenation should be taken into account when considering drug designs that involve oxygen-sensitive agents. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TI Enhancement of exfoliating efficacy of L-carnitine with ion-pair method

AB Carnitine (CAR), an amino acid derivative, has great potential as a facial exfoliating agent owing to its calcium chelating property under weakly acidic or neutral conditions. However, its application is limited by its poor transdermal penetration. To optimise its exfoliation efficacy with minimal concentration, we propose the ion-pair method. The ionic interaction between CAR and a zwitterionic substance was successfully monitored by measuring conductivity. The alterations of penetration and exfoliation efficacy for CAR addition to different types of counter ions were investigated in vitro and in vivo. We found that hydrogenated soya phosphatidylcholine (HSC), an amphiphilic counter ion, significantly increases the stratum corneum penetration and exfoliation efficacy of CAR. The changes of the CAR-HSC ionic interaction in the presence of calcium ions were also investigated by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The NMR spectra for amino groups of CAR first decreased with HSC and then gradually recovered and shifted as calcium ions were added. From the results, a noble exfoliating complex of CAR with high exfoliation efficacy could be proposed. Moreover, the results demonstrate that NMR spectroscopy is useful to obtain direct experimental evidence of the molecular dynamics simulations of the alteration of an exfoliating complex as it penetrates.

AB The styrene cationic polymerization with the CumOH/BF3 initiating system in presence of water was studied. The effects of concentrations of CumOH and water on monomer conversion, polymerization rate and molecular weight of polystyrene were also investigated. An exhaustive mechanistic study of the styrene cationic polymerization in presence of water was proposed by molecular simulation and analyzing terminal structure. It is found that cationic polymerization of styrene exhibits controlled characteristic when [H2O] <= 0.11 mol/L; the content of water in solvent has no significant influence on rate of polymerization reaction, the conversion of monomer and molecular weight. However, cationic polymerization cannot be processed under a high excess of water ([H2O] > 0.11 mol/L). On the basis of calculation results of activation energy, CumOH/BF3 initiating reaction is easier to proceed comparing with CumOH/H2O initiating reaction,which is found to be in line with the experimental results. The initiation reaction of CumOH/BF3 proceeds via activation of C-O bond of ComOH to give active spieces. The water may serve here as a reversible chain transfer agent not only providing control over the polymerization reaction,but also forming hydroxy terminal groups.

ID SYSTEM
AB The technology help desk function has grown in importance as information technology has proliferated throughout the organization. The primary objective of the help desk is to resolve problems related to IT in the organization. As such, the agents in the help desk must be very knowledgeable of the information systems, applications, and technologies supported. Most efforts at improving help desk performance have been to make the current system more efficient through application of information technologies. In this paper we propose a new approach, called a knowledge management-centric help desk. The proposed knowledge management system draws upon diverse knowledge sources in the organization including databases, files, experts, knowledge bases, and group chats. The knowledge management system is designed to be incorporated into the daily operation of the help desk in order to ensure high utilization and maintenance of the knowledge stores. The benefits of the knowledge management-centric help desk are evaluated using a simulation study with actual data from a help desk. The experimental results indicate the knowledge management-centric approach would significantly reduce the time to resolve problems and improve the throughput of the help desk. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

AB Selective hits for the glutaredoxin ortholog of Brucella melitensis are determined using STD NMR and verified by trNOE and N-15-HSQC titration. The most promising hit, RK207, was docked into the target molecule using a scoring function to compare simulated poses to experimental data. After elucidating possible poses, the hit was further optimized into the lead compound by extension with an electrophilic acrylamide warhead. We believe that focusing on selectivity in this early stage of drug discovery will limit cross-reactivity that might occur with the human ortholog as the lead compound is optimized. Kinetics studies revealed that lead compound 5 modified with an ester group results in higher reactivity than an acrylamide control; however, after modification this compound shows little selectivity for bacterial protein versus the human ortholog. In contrast, hydrolysis of compound 5 to the acid form results in a decrease in the activity of the compound. Together these results suggest that more optimization is warranted for this simple chemical scaffold, and opens the door for discovery of drugs targeted against glutaredoxin proteinsa heretofore untapped reservoir for antibiotic agents.

AB This in vitro study compared the marginal and internal adaptation of bulk-filled Class I and cuspal coverage direct resin composite restorations filled with different types of adhesive restorative systems and different thicknesses of bonding agent. Seventy-two intact, caries-free, freshly extracted human molars were randomly divided into 12 groups of six teeth each, according to the type of cavity (Class I [I] or Cuspal Coverage [C]), adhesive restorative system (SE Bond/Clearfil AP-X [SE] or Prime&Bond NT/Spectrum TPH [PB]) and thickness of bonding agent (normal or thick layer) in Class I restorations. Standardized Class I and Cuspal coverage cavities with enamel outer margins were prepared and restored with the corresponding type and thickness of bonding agent and respective resin composite. The resin composite was placed and polymerized in one increment (bulk filling). Dentinal fluid was simulated using 1:3 diluted horse serum and fed into the pulp chamber both during restoration and stressing. In six of the 12 groups, the restorations were subjected to 1.2 million mechanical occlusal cycles (maximum force 49 N; frequency 1.711z) and 3,000 simultaneous thermal cycles (5-50-5 degrees C). Marginal adaptation before and after mechanical and thermal stressing was assessed by using the replica technique and quantitative evaluation under SEM at 200x magnification. The teeth were dissected in a mesio-distal direction with a slow rotating diamond disc under water cooling, and the internal adaptation was also assessed by using the replica technique under the conditions described. Statistical evaluation of the continuous margin at the external and internal interface was performed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's Studentized Range (HSD) test (p=0.05). Even though Cuspal coverage restorations (SE- C: 96.89 +/- 1.83 and PB- C: 97.15 +/- 2.93) exhibited statistically significantly better external adaptation than Class I restorations (SE- 1: 63.95 +/- 12.82 and PB- 1 64.74 +/- 14.62) before stressing, there was no statistically significant difference after mechanical and thermal stressing (SE- C: 76.35 +/- 18.53 and PB- C: 76.02 +/- 12.49 SE- 1: 54.67 +/- 10.82 and PB- 1: 59.94 +/- 15.20). After stressing, SE Bond Cuspal coverage restorations (SE- C: 96.72 +/- 3.26) exhibited superior internal adaptation compared to SE Bond Class I restorations (SE- 1: 57.83 +/- 12.91). No difference was observed in internal adaptation between Prime&Bond NT Cuspal coverage and Class I restorations (PB- C:36.46 +/- 21.82, PB- 1: 38.71 +/- 6.76). In Class I restorations, the increased thickness in bonding did not improve the marginal and internal adaptation either before or after stressing. Bulk-filled direct resin composite Cuspal coverage restorations exhibited marginal adaptation similar to bulk-filled direct resin composite Class I restorations. The internal adaptation of Cuspal coverage SE Bond/Clearfil AP-X restorations was superior to all the other groups tested.

AB We have examined the aging process of soman inhibited AChE using Density functional theory (OFT) calculations. The catalytic serine of AChE can be phosphonylated by the nerve agent soman, and subsequently can undergo an aging process. The consequences of irreversible inhibition of AChE due to the aging process is fatal for mammals. The DFT calculations shed light on some intricate features of aging process of soman inhibited AChE, which has been pondering in the literature. The OFT calculations (M05-2X/6-31G* level of theory) performed with the model systems revealed that the dealkylation of pinacolyl group and the methyl migration takes place simultaneously. The role of pre-protonation and electrostatic stabilization by histidine (His440(+)) in catalyzing the aging process of soman inhibited AChE is energetically comparable. The aging process catalyzed by the histidine (His440(+)) residue reduces the free energy of activation by similar to 14.0 kcal/mol, which is in good agreement with the reported experimental results. Further, the calculated results reveal that tryptophan residue (Trp84) of the catalytic anionic subsite (CAS) assists the rearrangement reaction in the rearrangement process via cation-pi interactions.

AB From the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential antiviral properties of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and chloroquine (CQ) against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that these drugs could be the appropriate therapeutic candidates. However, their side effects directed clinical tests towards optimizing safe utilization strategies. The noble metal nanoparticles (NP) are promising materials with antiviral and antibacterial properties that can deliver the drug to the target agent, thereby reducing the side effects. In this work, we applied both the quantum mechanical and classical atomistic molecular dynamics approaches to demonstrate the adsorption properties of HCQ/CQ on Ag, Au, AgAu, and Pt nanoparticles. We found the adsorption energies of HCQ/CQ towards nanoparticles have the following trend: PtNP>AuNP>AuAgNP>AgNP. This shows that PtNP has the highest affinity in comparison to the other types of nanoparticles. The (non)perturbative effects of this drug on the plasmonic absorption spectra of AgNP and AuNP with the time-dependent density functional theory. The effect of size and composition of NPs on the coating with HCQ and CQ were obtained to propose the appropriate candidate for drug delivery. This kind of modeling could help experimental groups to find efficient and safe therapies.

AB Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of human tuberculosis, one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. Its genome hosts the glbN and glbO genes coding for two proteins, truncated hemoglobin N (trHbN) and truncated hemoglobin O (trHbO), that belong to different groups (I and 11, respectively) of the recently discovered trHb family of hemeproteins. The different expression pattern and kinetics rates constants for ligand association and NO oxidation rate suggest different functions for these proteins. Previous experimental and theoretical studies showed that, in trHbs, ligand migration along the internal tunnel cavity system is a key issue in determining the ligand-binding characteristics. The X-ray structure of trHbO has been solved and shows several internal cavities and secondary-docking sites. In this work, we present an extensive investigation of the tunnel/cavity system of M. tuberculosis trHbO by means of computer-simulation techniques. We have computed the free-energy profiles for ligand migration along three found tunnels in the oxy and deoxy w.t. and mutant trHbO proteins. Our results show that multiple-ligand migration paths are possible and that several conserved residues such as TrpG8 play a key role in the ligand-migration regulation.

AB BB-83698 is a first potent inhibitor of peptide deformylase in this novel class to enter clinical trials. In this study, automated docking, molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy calculations with the linear interaction energy (LIE) method are first applied to investigate the binding of BB-83698 to the peptide deformylase from Bacillus stearothermophilus. The lowest docking energy structure from each cluster is selected as different representative binding modes. Compared with the experimental data, the results show that the binding of BB-83698 in Mode I is the most stable, with a binding free energy of -41.35 kJ/mol. The average structure of the Mode I complex suggests, that inhibitor interacts with Ilc59 and Gly109 by hydrogen bond interaction and with Pro47, Pro57, Ile59 and Leul46 by hydrophobic interaction are essential or the activity of BB-83698. Mode 2 represents a new binding mode. Additionally, if the hydrophilic group is introduced to the benzo-[1,3]-dioxole ring, the binding affinity of BB-83698 to the peptide deformylase from B. stearothermophilus will be greatly improved.

AB Various bacterial strains (e.g., strains belonging to the genera Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Serratia, and Salmonella) exhibit colonial branching patterns during growth on poor semisolid substrates. These patterns reflect the bacterial cooperative self-organization. A central part of the cooperation is the collective formation of a lubricant on top of the agar which enables the bacteria to swim. Hence it provides the colony means to advance towards the food. One method of modeling the colonial development is via coupled reaction-diffusion equations which describe the time evolution of the bacterial density and the concentrations of the relevant chemical fields. This idea has been pursued by a number of groups. Here we present an additional model which specifically includes an evolution equation for the lubricant excreted by the bacteria. We show that when the diffusion of the fluid is governed by a nonlinear diffusion coefficient, branching patterns evolve. We study the effect of the rates of emission and decomposition of the lubricant fluid on the observed patterns. The results are compared with experimental observations. We also include fields of chemotactic agents and food chemotaxis and conclude that these features are needed in order to explain the observations.

AB Zinc treatment in liver cirrhosis is known to prevent a number of clinical symptoms. Previous studies have also indicated that Zn has a protective effect on the development of the clinical, biochemical and morphological manifestations of hepatic injury if administered simultaneously with the noxious agent. In this study, the protective effects of zinc treatment against the development of liver cirrhosis have been tested in cirrhotic rats treated by intragastric administration of CCl4. The development of morphological lesions has been investigated by means of standardized and comparable techniques, LM, TEM, SEM, microvascular casts and measurements of liver collagen content by colorimetric determination in paraffin embedded sections. LM and EM observations showed typical morphological features of cirrhosis in all CCl4 treated rats. In the same group of animals, the microsvascular casts showed the development of the typical 'perinodular' branching and the various anastomoses of pre and post-sinusoidal vessels. Colorimetric evaluation has shown a significant increase in collagen content after CCl4 treatment. Qualitative and quantitative data of livers of CCl4 treated rats supplemented or not with zinc were significantly similar.
   In conclusion, zinc treatment influences biochemical parameters, but not the morphology of liver cirrhosis.

AB To simultaneously remove Sr and Cs from a simulated highly active liquid waste, a new ternary solid-state supramolecular adsorbent BnPC6DTXAD-7 (BnPDTX7), based on organic chelating agents 25,27-bis(1-n-propoxy)-calix[4]26,28-crown-6 (BnPC6), 4,4'(5')-di-tert-butyldicyclohexano-18-crown-6 (DT), and polymeric carrier XAD-7 was prepared for the first time. Scanning electronic microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analysis demonstrated that BnPDTX7 is a macroporous adsorbent. The adsorption of 20 metals onto BnPDTX7 were studied. Under the optimal adsorption conditions of 3.0 M HNO3, 298 K, and contact time of 60 min, the adsorption capacity toward Cs and Sr were 0.1396 mM/g and 0.1289 mM/g, respectively. The experimental data fit well with the Langmuir model, indicative of the monolayer adsorption mechanism. The thermodynamic parameters, Delta H degrees, Delta G degrees, and Delta S degrees of Cs and Sr adsorption and other valuable chemical engineering data were obtained. BnPDTX7 proves to be a promising adsorbent for the simultaneous removal of Sr and Cs because of its high selectivity, fast kinetics, and high stability.

AB We have studied the statistical mechanics of money circulation in a closed economic system. An explicit statistical formulation of the circulation velocity of money is presented for the first time by introducing the concept of holding time of money. The result indicates that the velocity is governed by behavior patterns of economic agents. Computer simulations have been carried out in order to demonstrate the shape of the holding time distribution. We find that, money circulation is a Poisson process in which the holding time probability distribution follows a type of Gamma distribution, and the velocity of money depends on the share for exchange and the number of agents.

ID COMBUSTION; WAVES; SYSTEMS
AB Silicon is produced from quartz rock in electrode-heated furnaces by using carbon as a reduction agent. We perform an asymptotic analysis of a heat and mass transfer model of an experimental pilot furnace in order to determine the dominant chemical and thermal behavior of the system. First, by prescribing a steady-state temperature profile in the furnace we explore the leading order reactions in different spatial regions, as well as early time behavior. We are able to obtain asymptotic solutions which compare well with numerical simulations. Utilizing the dominant balances found when the temperature is prescribed, we next reduce the full model to two coupled partial differential equations for the time-variable temperature profile within the furnace and the concentration of solid quartz. These equations account for diffusion, an endothermic reaction, and the external heating input to the system. A moving boundary is found and the behavior on either side of this boundary explored in the asymptotic limit of small diffusion. We note how the simplifications derived may be useful for future models and industrial furnace operation and comment on insights from the model about furnace crust formation.

AB We present a mathematical model which describes the growth of malignant gliomas in presence of immune responses by considering the role of immunotherapeutic agent T11 target structure (T11TS). The model consider five populations, namely, glioma cells, macrophages, cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, TGF - beta and IFN - gamma. The model system has highly nonlinear terms with four discrete time lags, but remains tractable. The goal of this work is to better understand the effect of multiple delays on the interaction between gliomas and immune components in conjunction with an administration of T11 target structure. Analytically, we investigate the conditions for the asymptotic stability of equilibrium points, the existence of Hopf bifurcations and the maximum value of the delay to preserve the stability of limit cycle. For the set of parameter values estimated from experimental data, time delays have hardly any influence on the system behavior. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the dynamics of the model with different values for delays with and without administration of T11 target structure.

AB During their service life reinforced concrete structures can be exposed to mechanical loads and aggressive chemical or thermal agents that produce degradation of their mechanical properties. This results in a loss of security and usually requires a prompt repair or retrofitting in order to preserve the structural serviceability. In this case, the aid of a numerical toot for the assessment of different retrofit and repair systems would be valuable. Nowadays, analytical and numerical capacity for the assessment of this type of systems is still limited.
   A numerical model that can be used for the assessment of retrofit and repair systems based on the use of FRP for reinforced concrete columns and beams is presented in this paper. A plastic damaged model that reproduces the behaviour even under high confinement pressures is used for concrete.
   Application examples concerning the behaviour of reinforced concrete columns and beams retrofitted with FRP are included in the paper. The comparison with experimental results shows the ability of the proposed model to reproduce the problem simulated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A discussion is presented of the effects of stochasticity in the decision-making of agents in the minority game. Both simulational and analytic results are reported and discussed for both additive and multiplicative noise. As a function of the ratio d of information dimension to number of agents a phase transition separates a low d non-ergodic phase from a high d ergodic phase. For additive noise the critical d, is temperature-independent but for multiplicative noise d(c) (T) decreases with T. Additive noise does not affect the asymptotic behaviour for d > d(c) but is relevant below d(c). Multiplicative noise has consequence for all d. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A crystallisation process of biological macromolecules in gel-matrix was studied by Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the results were compared with a numerical model of periodic precipitation. This investigation is focused on the coupling between transport phenomena, nucleation and crystal growth, which may lead to non-linear behaviour.
   In general, transport phenomena involve double diffusion of the two main solutes (protein and precipitant agent) and buoyant convection that may arise due to density gradients in the liquid. Both transport conditions were addressed.
   In absence of convection, in pure diffusive regime, non-uniform crystal distributions have been observed. The results can be described in terms of a modulation in space and in time of supersaturation that leads to a nucleation front that propagates inside the protein solution. The experimental data are in good agreement with numerical simulations.
   When convection is not negligible, it leads to a deformation of the diffusive solutal distribution, characterised by a periodic wave-like pattern observed by interferometry. The observed instabilities are driven by double diffusion and agree with a stability model of double diffusive systems. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Synthesis, molecular, spectroscopic (H-1 NMR and FT-IR) properties, biological evaluation, electronic structure calculations and in silico molecular docking of two sulfonamide derivates, namely the 4-Bromo-N-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide (4) and 4-Nitro-N-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide (5) were reported. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were performed using B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) to further investigate the molecular, electronic structures and to assist the spectral assignments and provide the useful structural and spectroscopic information. A conformational analysis was completed to obtain stable structures. The simulated H-1 NMR and FT-IR spectra were compared with those obtained experimentally and any observed discrepancies were discussed. The synthesized compounds were tested against one Gram-positive, Bacillus subtilis (+), and three Gram-negative, Salmonella typhi (-), Escherichia coli (-), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (-), bacteria. Results show that the compound 5 is highly active antibacterial agent. Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibition and cytotoxicity assay results refer the compounds to be a moderate inhibitor of Carbonic Anhydrase enzyme. The molecular docking results support the experimental observations. The binding affinities of 5 with all the selected enzymes were calculated to be stronger than those of 4, which is primarily due to the electrostatic interaction between NO2- moiety of 5 and NH2+ group of Lysine of the selected enzymes. The charge transfer, within the molecules and most probable sites for the electrophilic and nucleophilic attack, was explored. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Dopamine receptor D2 (D2R) plays an important role in the human central nervous system and is a focal target of antipsychotic agents. The D2(High)R and D2(Low)R dimeric models previously developed by our group are used to investigate the prediction of binding affinity of the LY404,039 ligand and its binding mechanism within the catalytic domain. The computational data obtained using molecular dynamics simulations fit well with the experimental results. The calculated binding affinities of LY404,039 using MM/PBSA for the D2(High)R and D2(Low)R targets were -12.04 and -9.11 kcal/mol, respectively. The experimental results suggest that LY404,039 binds to D2(High)R and D2L(ow)R with binding affinities (K-i) of 8.2 and 1640 nM, respectively. The high binding affinity of LY404,039 in terms of binding to [H-3]domperidone was inhibited by the presence of a guanine nucleotide, indicating an agonist action of the drug at D2(High)R. The interaction analysis demonstrated that while Asp114 was among the most critical amino acids for D2(High)R binding, residues Ser193 and Ser197 were significantly more important within the binding cavity of D2(Low)R Molecular modeling analyses are extended to ensemble docking as well as structure-based pharmacophore model (E-pharmacophore) development using the bioactive conformation of LY404,039 at the binding pocket as a template and screening of small-molecule databases with derived pharmacophore models.

AB A comprehensive assessing approach for durability of reinforced concrete structures dealing with the corrosion process of rebar subjected to the attack of aggressive agent from environment was proposed in this paper. Corrosion of rebar was suggested in the form of combination of global corrosion and pitting. Firstly, for the purposed of considering the influence of rebar's radius, a type of Plane Corrosion Model (PCM) based on uniform corrosion of rebar was introduced. By means of FE simulation approach, global corrosion process of rebar regarding PCM and LCM (Linear Corrosion Model) was regressed and compared according to the data from Laboratoire Materiaux et Durability des Constructions (LMDC). Secondly, pitting factor model of rebar in general descend law with corrosion degree was introduced in terms of existing experimental data. Finally, with the comprehensive numerical simulation, the durability of an existing arch bridge was studied in depth in deterministic way, including diffusion process and sectional strength of typical cross section of arch, crossbeam and deck slab. Evolution of structural capacity considering life-cycle rehabilitation strategy indicated the degradation law of durability of reinforced arch bridges.

AB Psychologists have studied small-group and team effectiveness for decades, and although there has been considerable progress, there remain significant challenges. Meta-analyses and systematic research have provided solid evidence for core team cognitive, motivational, affective, and behavioral processes that contribute to team effectiveness and empirical support for interventions that enhance team processes (e. g., team design, composition, training, and leadership); there has been substantial evidence for a science of team effectiveness. Nonetheless, there have also been concerns that team processes, which are inherently dynamic, have primarily been assessed as static constructs. Team-level processes and outcomes are multilevel phenomena that emerge, bottom-up from the interactions among team members over time, under the shifting demands of a work context. Thus, theoretical development that appropriately conceptualizes the multiple levels, process dynamics, and emergence of team phenomena over time are essential to advance understanding. Moreover, these conceptual advances necessitate innovative research methodologies to better capture team process dynamics. We explicate this foundation and then describe 2 promising streams of scientific inquiry-team interaction sensors and computational modeling-that are advancing new, unobtrusive measurement techniques and process-oriented research methods focused on understanding the dynamics of cohesion and cognition in teamwork. These are distinct lines of research, each endeavoring to advance the science, but doing so through the development of very different methodologies. We close by discussing the near-term research challenges and the potential long-term evolution of these innovative methods, with an eye toward the future for process-oriented theory and research on team effectiveness.

Speculators' strategy/market selections are repeated at each time step and depend on predisposition effects, herding behavior and market circumstances. Simulations reveal that our model is able to explain a number of nontrivial statistical properties of and between international stock markets, including bubbles and crashes, fat-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, persistent trading volume, coevolving stock prices and cross-correlated volatilities. Against this background, our model may be deemed to have been validated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The manuscript is part of a special tribute issue for Prof. Panos Macheras and we have chosen applications of the Monte Carlo method in the field of drug release that were pioneered by him and his research group. Thus, we focus on the investigation of diffusion based release and we present methods that go beyond the application of the classical fickian diffusion equation. We describe methods that have proven to be effective in illuminating the profound effects of the substrate heterogeneity on the drug release profiles and demonstrate some of the most powerful applications of agent based simulations and numerical methods in the field of pharmacokinetics.

AB The use of biomolecules as capping and reducing agents in the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles constitutes a promising framework to achieve desired functional properties with minimal toxicity. The system's complexity and the large number of variables involved represent a challenge for theoretical and experimental investigations aiming at devising precise synthesis protocols. In this work, we use L-asparagine (Asn), an amino acid building block of large biomolecular systems, to synthesise gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in aqueous solution at controlled pH. The use of Asn offers a primary system that allows us to understand the role of biomolecules in synthesising metallic nanoparticles. Our results indicate that AuNPs synthesised in acidic (pH 6) and basic (pH 9) environments exhibit somewhat different morphologies. We investigate these AuNPs via Raman scattering experiments and classical molecular dynamics simulations of zwitterionic and anionic Asn states adsorbing on (111)-, (100)-, (110)-, and (311)-oriented gold surfaces. A combined analysis suggests that the underlying mechanism controlling AuNPs geometry correlates with amine's preferential adsorption over ammonium groups, enhanced upon increasing pH. Our simulations reveal that Asn (both zwitterionic and anionic) adsorption on gold (111) is essentially different from adsorption on more open surfaces. Water molecules strongly interact with the gold face-centred-cubic lattice and create traps, on the more open surfaces, that prevent the Asn from diffusing. These results indicate that pH is a relevant parameter in green-synthesis protocols with the capability to control the nanoparticle's geometry, and pave the way to computational studies exploring the effect of water monolayers on the adsorption of small molecules on wet gold surfaces.

AB Hydroformylation of 1,4-diacetoxy-2-butene (DAB) was studied using [HRh(CO)(PPh3)(3)] complex catalyst tethered on alumina using phosphotungstic acid (PTA) as an anchoring agent, with the aim to understand the product distribution, selectivity, and intrinsic kinetics. It was observed that with the tethered heterogeneous catalyst a simultaneous hydroformylation followed by deacetoxylation steps was possible, which is relevant for combining two steps in the sequence of synthesis of vitamin-A intermediate [2-formyl-4-acetoxy butene (FAB)]. P-31 cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CP MAS NMR) and infrared (IR) instrumental techniques were found be the most effective techniques to establish the catalyst structure and true heterogeneity. On the basis of the spectroscopic evidence, we postulate the loss of a PPh3 group during tethering to give HRh(CO)(PPh3)(2)-PTA-Al2O3 as a heterogeneous complex catalyst. Experimental data on the concentration-time and CO/H-2 consumption-time profiles were obtained and the effects of DAB concentration, CO partial pressure, H-2 partial pressure, and catalyst loading were studied in a 50 mL stirred batch reactor over a temperature range of 338-358 K. The analysis of solid-liquid-gas mass transfer effects was investigated to ensure that the reaction was operating in the kinetic regime Various models were developed, and the best model was chosen by a model discrimination procedure. The agreement between the model prediction and the experimental data was found to be excellent. The activation energies for the hydroformylation and deacetoxylation steps were found to be 42.5 and 80.2 kJ/mol.

AB The potential of bacteriophages as alternative treatment for multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae-related infections has recently gained much interest. The purpose of this research was to isolate and characterize a K. pneumoniae-specific lytic phage with the potential to treat experimental lobar pneumonia induced by K. pneumoniae in mice. A lytic phage was isolated from an urban wastewater sample in Tehran and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermal, pH, and chloroform stability before being employed for treatment of mice infected with K. pneumoniae in an experimental model of lobar pneumonia. BALB/C mice were challenged by intranasal inoculation with 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU/ml) of K. pneumoniae ATCC 10031 followed by an intraperitoneal injection of the isolated phage using 10(10) and 10(9) plaque-forming units (PFU/ml) simultaneously or 24 h post infection. Control groups of mice received bacteria or bacteriophage alone. Mice were euthanized daily up to 7 days post infection and examined for abnormality in their lungs and livers followed by determining the number of phages and bacteria in plasma and lung homogenates. The isolated phage (vB_KpnM-Teh.1) belonged to the Myoviridae family, was stable at 37 degrees C, pH 7, and was resistant to chloroform. Treatment of mice with a single dose of phage simultaneously at the time of infection, or 24 h post infection, resulted in seven and five logs decrease of CFU/ml in the lung homogenates up to 3 days after phage administration, respectively. The isolated phage may have the potential as a therapeutic agent against K. pneumoniae infections.

AB This study aimed to investigate the fluoride release properties and the effect on bond strength of two experimental adhesive cements. Synthesized particles of nano-fluorapatite (nano-FA) or nano-fluorohydroxyapatite (nano-FHA) were incorporated into a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Fuji Ortho LC) and characterized using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Blocks with six different concentrations of nano-FA or nano-FHA were manufactured and their fluoride release properties evaluated by ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The unaltered glass ionomer cement Fuji Ortho LC (GC, control) and the two experimental cements with the highest fluoride release capacities (nano-FA + Fuji Ortho LC (GFA) and nano-FHA + Fuji Ortho LC (GFHA)) were used to bond composite blocks and orthodontic brackets to human enamel. After 24 h water storage all specimens were debonded, measuring the micro-tensile bond strength (mu TBS) and the shear bond strength (5135), respectively. The optimal concentration of added nano-FA and nano-FHA for maximum fluoride release was 25 wt.%, which nearly tripled fluoride release after 70 days compared with the control group. GC exhibited a significantly higher SBS than GFHA/GFA, with GFHA and GFA not differing significantly (P>0.05). The mu TBS of GC and GFA were significantly higher than that of GFHA (P <= 0.05). The results seem to indicate that the fluoride release properties of Fuji Ortho LC are improved by incorporating nano-FA or nano-FHA, simultaneously maintaining a clinically sufficient bond strength when nano-FA was added.

AB The relationship between various molecular descriptors and transport of drugs across the intestinal epithelium was evaluated. The monolayer permeability (P-c) of human intestinal Caco-2 cells to a series of nine beta-receptor-blocking agents was investigated in vitro. The dynamic polar molecular surface area (PSA(d)) of the compounds was calculated from all low-energy conformations identified in molecular mechanics calculations in vacuum and in simulated chloroform and water environments. For most of the investigated drugs, the effects of the different environments on PSA(d) were small. The exception was H 216/44, which is a large flexible compound containing several functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding (PSA(d,chloroform) = 70.8 Angstrom(2) and PSA(d,water) = 116.6 Angstrom(2)). The relationship between P-c and PSA(d) was stronger than those between P-c and the calculated octanol/water distribution coefficients (log D-calc) or the experimentally determined immobilized liposome chromatography (ILC) retention. P-c values for two new practolol analogues and H 216/44 were predicted from the structure-permeability relationships of a subset of the nine compounds and compared with experimental values. The P-c values of the two practolol analogues were predicted well from both PSA(d) calculations and ILC retention studies. The P-c value of H 216/44 was reasonably well-predicted only from the PSA(d) of conformations preferred in vacuum and in water. The other descriptors overestimated the P-c of H 216/44 100-500-fold.

AB The commute of residents in a big city often brings tidal traffic pressure or congestions. Understanding the causes behind this phenomenon is of great significance for urban space optimization. Various spatial big data make the fine description of urban residents' travel behaviors possible, and bring new approaches to related studies. The present study focuses on two aspects: one is to obtain relatively accurate features of commuting behaviors by using mobile phone data, and the other is to simulate commuting behaviors of residents through the agent-based model and inducing backward the causes of congestion. Taking the Baishazhou area of Wuhan, a local area of a mega city in China, as a case study, we simulated the travel behaviors of commuters: the spatial context of the model is set up using the existing urban road network and by dividing the area into space units. Then, using the mobile phone call detail records of a month, statistics of residents' travel during the four time slots in working day mornings are acquired and then used to generate the Origin-Destination matrix of travels at different time slots, and the data are imported into the model for simulation. Under the preset rules of congestion, the agent-based model can effectively simulate the traffic conditions of each traffic intersection, and can induce backward the causes of traffic congestion using the simulation results and the Origin-Destination matrix. Finally, the model is used for the evaluation of road network optimization, which shows evident effects of the optimizing measures adopted in relieving congestion, and thus also proves the value of this method in urban studies.

AB Polymers and polymeric composites are used in many engineering applications, but these materials can spontaneously lose structural integrity as a result of microdamage caused by stress peaks during service. This internal microdamage is hard to detect and nearly impossible to repair. To extend the lifetime of such materials and save maintenance costs, self-healing mechanisms can be applied that are able to repair internal microdamage during the usual service load. This can be realized, for example, by incorporating microcapsules filled with monomer and dispersed catalysts into the polymeric matrix material. If a crack occurs, the monomer flows into the crack, reacts with the catalysts, and closes the crack.
   This contribution focuses on the development of a thermodynamically consistent constitutive model that is able to describe the damage and healing behavior of a microcapsule-based self-healing material. The material under investigation is an epoxy matrix with microencapsulated dicyclopentadiene healing agents and dispersed Grubbs' catalysts. The simulation of such a multiphase material is numerically very expensive if the microstructure is to be completely resolved. To overcome this, a homogenization technique can be applied to decrease the computational costs of the simulation. Here, the theoretical framework is based on the theory of porous media, which is a macroscopic continuum mechanical homogenization approach. The developed five-phase model consists of solid matrix material with dispersed catalysts, liquid healing agents, solidified healed material, and gas phase. A discontinuous damage model is used for the description of the damage behavior, and healing is simulated by a phase transition between the liquid-like healing agents and the solidified healed material. Applicability of the developed model is shown by means of numerical simulations of the global damage and healing behavior of a tapered double cantilever beam, as well as simulations of the flow behavior of the healing agents at the microscale.

AB Premise of the study: Herbivory can affect a plant's fi tness in a variety of ways, including modifying the biotic interactions of the plant. In particular, when herbivory infl uences fl oral display, we hypothesize that pollinator visitation will be altered accordingly. Here we studied the indirect effects of feeding by two beetles, Neogalerucella calmariensis and N. pusilla, released as a biological control, on plant-pollinator interactions and fi tness in the invasive plant, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria).
   Methods: Two herbivory treatments (ambient and simulated) were applied to plants in a naturally occurring population of purple loosestrife. During fl owering, traits of plants in the treatment and control groups were recorded. Data on pollinator visitation behavior was then collected after intense larval herbivory had ended.
   Key results: Plants exposed to herbivory treatments produced more fl owers and infl orescences but fl owered signifi cantly later than those in the control group. Moreover, we found a signifi cant, positive association of herbivory with the number of fl owers probed by bumblebees and with the number of times a foraging pollinator moved among infl orescences on a single plant. No differences in female fi tness (fruit or seed production) were detected.
   Conclusions: We conclude that herbivore-mediated differences in fl oral display traits impacted pollinator visitation behavior. However, as we discuss, differences in pollinator visitation did not translate into detectable differences in female reproductive success.

AB The current status of the Haplosporidia is reviewed as well as recent information on Haplosporidium nelsoni, the causative agent of MSX disease in oysters. Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses with greatly increased taxon sampling support monophyly of the Haplosporidia and hypothesize placement of the group as sister taxon to the phylum Cercozoa. Oyster pathogens in the genus Bonamia should be considered haplosporidians based on molecular sequence data. Thus, the group contains 4 genera: Uropsoridium, Haplosporidium, Bonamia and Minchinia. Molecular phylogenetic analyses support monophyly of Urosporidium, Bonamia and Minchinia, but Haplosporidium forms a paraphyletic clade. Reports of haplosporidia worldwide are reviewed. Molecular detection assays have greatly increased our ability to rapidly and specifically diagnose important pathogens in the phylum and have also improved our understanding of the distribution and biology of H. nelsoni and H. costale. Much of the data available for H. nelsoni has been integrated into a mathematical model of host/parasite/environment interactions. Model simulations support hypotheses that recent H. nelsoni outbreaks in the NE United States are related to increased winter temperatures, and that a host other than oysters is involved in the life cycle. Evidence is presented that natural resistance to H. nelsoni has developed in oysters in Delaware Bay, USA. However, in Chesapeake Bay, USA H. nelsoni has intensified in historically low salinity areas where salinities have increased because of recent drought conditions. Efforts to mitigate the impact of H. nelsoni involve selective breeding programs for disease resistance and the evaluation of disease resistant non-native oysters.

AB An agent-based model (ABM) representing snare trapping of blue duikers (Cephalophus monticola) was co-designed and used with local populations to raise their awareness about the sustainability of bushmeat hunting activities in the region of the Korup National Park (South-West Cameroon). Village meetings based on interactive simulations with a stylized scale model were structured in three successive steps. During the first step, an abstract representation of a village surrounded by a portion of forest was co-designed by directly manipulating the computer interface displaying a spatial grid. Then, knowledge about the live-cycle traits and the behavior of blue duikers was shared through the demonstration of the individual-based population dynamics module of the ABM. The objective of the second step, introducing the hunting module of the ABM, was to elicit snare trapping practices through interactive simulation and to calibrate the hunting module by setting a value for the probability of a blue duiker to be caught by a snare trap. In a third step, a more realistic version of the ABM was introduced. The seven villages included in the process were located in the GIS-based spatial representation, and the number of 'Hunter' agents for each village in the ABM was set according to the results of a survey. The demonstration of this realistic version triggered discussion about possible management scenarios, whose results obtained with the finalized version of the ABM will be discussed during next round of village meetings. We present the pros and cons of the method consisting in using at an early stage of theprocess interactive simulations with stylized scale models to specify empirically-based agent-based models.

ID ERROR ESTIMATION
AB In cancer therapy, the thermal ablation of diseased cells by embedded nanoparticles is one of the known therapies. It is based on the absorption of the energy of the illuminating laser by nanoparticles. The resulting heating of nanoparticles kills the cell where these photothermal agents are embedded. One of the main constraints of this therapy is preserving the surrounding healthy cells. Therefore, two parameters are of interest. The first one is the thermal ablation characteristic length, which corresponds to an action distance around the nanoparticles for which the temperature exceeds the ablation threshold. This critical geometric parameter is related to the expected conservation of the body temperature in the surroundings of the diseased cell. The second parameter is the temperature that should be reached to achieve active thermal agents. The temperature depends on the power of the illuminating laser, on the size of nanoparticles and on their physical properties. The purpose of this paper is to propose behavior laws under the constraints of both the body temperature at the boundary of the cell to preserve surrounding cells and an acceptable range of temperature in the target cell. The behavior laws are deduced from the finite element method, which is able to model aggregates of nanoparticles. We deduce sensitivities to the laser power and to the particle size. We show that the tuning of the temperature elevation and of the distance of action of a single nanoparticle is not significantly affected by variations of the particle size and of the laser power. Aggregates of nanoparticles are much more efficient, but represent a potential risk to the surrounding cells. Fortunately, by tuning the laser power, the thermal ablation characteristic length can be controlled.

AB Human awareness under different circumstances is complex and non-trivial to understand. Nevertheless, due to the importance of awareness for safety and efficiency in many domains (e.g., the aviation domain), it is necessary to study the processes behind situation awareness, to eliminate possible errors in action selection that may lead to disasters. Interesting models for situation awareness have been presented, mainly from an ecological psychology perspective, but they are debatable with respect to the latest neurocognitive evidences. With the developments in brain imaging and recording techniques, more and more detailed information on complex cognitive processes becomes available. This provides room to further investigate the mechanisms behind many cognitive phenomena, including situation awareness. This paper presents a computational cognitive agent model for situation awareness from the perspective of action selection, which is inspired by neurocognitive evidences. The model integrates bottom-up and top-down cognitive processes, related to various cognitive states: perception, desires, attention, intention, (prior and retrospective) awareness, ownership, feeling, and communication. Based on the model, various cognitive effects can be explained, such as perceptual load, predictive processes, inferential processes, cognitive controlling, unconscious bias, and conscious bias. A model like this will be useful in domains that benefit from complex simulations of socio-technical systems (e.g. the aviation domain) based on computational models of human behaviour. In such domains, existing agent-based simulations are limited, since most of the agent models do not include realistic nature-inspired processes. The validity of the model is illustrated based on simulations for the aviation domain, focusing on a particular situation where an agent has biased perception, poor comprehension, habitual driven projection, and conflict between prior and retrospective effects on action execution.

AB Background: One objective of regional chemotherapy is to achieve therapeutic drug levels in local tissues and primary nodal drainage fields, while minimizing systemic drug toxicity. The composition of the drug-delivery vehicle may influence local drug absorption and thereby modulate both tissue drug levels and systemic toxicity. Purpose: We evaluated the effect of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a drug-delivery vehicle on regional and systemic levels of doxorubicin (DOX) and on the cytotoxicity of DOX following continuous intravesical administration in an invasive rat transitional cell bladder carcinoma model. Methods: F344 rats received continuous intravesical DOX infusion for a 7-day period using a regional drug administration system. A constant dose of DOX was adnministered in one of three DMSO concentrations (0%, 10%, or 50%) to groups of animals (N = 20 per group). These concentrations corresponded to target urinary concentrations of 0%, 0.1%, and 0.5%, respectively. DOX levels in urine, serum, muscle, liver, bladder wall, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes were measured using a fluorescence assay on experimental days 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 (N = four animals/group per day). In vitro assays evaluated the effect of DMSO concentration on the cytotoxicity of DOX against six transitional cell carcinoma cell lines. A final experiment on rats with established bladder tumors compared the cytoreductive effect of continuous intravesical infusion of DOX in 50% DMSO with that of DOX alone and with that in a sham-treated control group; there were 20 rats in each group. Results: Mean and peak tissue and serum levels of DOX increased as a direct function of DMSO concentration. Compared with the results in controls, mean concentrations of DOX in the bladder were increased 7.1-fold and 12.1-fold in the groups given 10% and 50% DMSO, respectively. Average drug concentrations in the lymph nodes were increased 9.6-fold and 9.3-fold in the groups given 10% and 50% DMSO, respectively. In vitro, DMSO synergistically enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX in two of the six cell lines studied. Solubilizing the test agent in 5 % DMSO reduced the IC50 (drug concentration required to reduce cell viability to 50% of control values) to an average of 56 +/- 41 % (+/- SD) of control values; 10% DMSO further decreased the average IC50 to 20% +/- 18% (+/- SD) of control values. The mean bladder tumor weight of animals treated with the combination of DOX and DMSO was 0.52 g. This compared with a mean tumor-bearing bladder weight of 2.69 g in the control group (P = .012) and 0.80 g in the group treated with DOX alone (P = .0544). Conclusions: These results suggest that the use of DMSO as a solvent vehicle for DOX improves drug absorption while simultaneously potentiating DOX cytotoxicity. The use of DMSO as a drug carrier merits further evaluation as a way of enhancing the efficacy of regional chemotherapy regimens.

AB Incorporation of hydrophilic and hydrophobic agents into a polymer backbone is an effective approach to control its interfacial characteristics. Segmented polyurethanes (PUs) are easy-fabricating and cost-effective candidates in this respect. In this work, we have synthesized polycarbonate (PC)-based PUs containing hydrophilic Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and hydrophobic Polyhedral Oligomeric Silsesquioxane (POSS) in the lab as well as in molecular dynamics simulations. We employed several experimental techniques and a coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) method to evaluate the morphology and microphase arrangement of PUs. We successfully synthesized superior hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings by replacing some parts of the soft segment (PC) with PEG and the chain extender (1,4-butandiol) with POSS, respectively. Our CG MD simulations showed that POSS is dispersed in PC uniformly, while PEG is completely phase separated from PC and formed a lamellar structure. This was also confirmed by experimental thermal analysis. Eventually, water contact angle (WCA) measurements proved development of very hydrophilic (PU-PEG), slightly hydrophilic (PU), and very hydrophobic (PU-POSS) coatings. The surface free energy analysis indicated that POSS decreases polar and apolar components of surface free energy, while PU-PEG exhibits omniphilic behavior. The presence of PEG and POSS on the surface was also confirmed by contact angle and AFM measurements. According to MTT and LDH assays, PEG and POSS incorporation significantly enhanced the biocompatibility of PU such that PU-PEG and PU-POSS coatings become prospective candidates for biomedical applications.

AB In the present study, the expression of microRNA (miR)-365 and interleukin (IL)-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum from patients with sepsis following multiple trauma has been investigated. A total of 26 patients with sepsis following multiple trauma were included as the experimental group, whereas 21 contemporaneous patients without sepsis following multiple trauma were included as the negative control group. The expression of IL-6 mRNA and miR-365 was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis was used to measure IL-6 protein expression. ELISA was performed to determine the secretion of IL-6 protein. Following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 h, THP-1 cells were used to examine the expression of miR-365 and the levels of IL-6 protein and mRNA in cells simulating sepsis. A dual luciferase reporter assay revealed that IL-6 mRNA was a direct target of miR-365. Patients with sepsis following multiple trauma exhibited significantly higher IL-6 mRNA and protein levels than patients without sepsis (P<0.05). In addition, miR-365 expression in patients with sepsis following trauma was significantly lower than in patients without sepsis (P<0.05). Similar effects were observed in THP-1 cells treated with LPS. The present study demonstrated that increased expression of IL-6 in patients with sepsis following multiple trauma is associated with decreased expression of miR-365. miR-365 may regulate the occurrence and immune response of sepsis following multiple trauma via IL-6. These results may elucidate agents for clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease.

AB Objectives: Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) are repeatable over time at lower frequencies (<= 8 kHz) and higher frequencies (> 8 kHz) in healthy, normal-hearing subjects. The purpose of this study was to examine the repeatability of DPOAEs measured with high-frequency (HF) stimuli in a patient population. It was hypothesized that HF DPOAEs would be repeatable over four trials.
   Design: DPOAEs were measured in 40 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients (17 females and 23 males) with measurable behavioral thresholds and present DPOAEs for at least 2 of the high frequencies tested (8 to 16 kHz). A depth-compensated simulator sound pressure level (SPL) method of calibration was utilized. Each patient attended four trials, in which a complete set of data were collected. At each trial, three different DPOAE paradigms were completed. First, a discrete frequency sweep was measured between 8 and 16 kHz with a ratio (f(2)/f(1)) of 1.2 and levels of 65/50 dB SPL for L-1/L-2. Next, ratio and level sweeps were obtained at the two highest frequencies with a present DPOAE determined from the discrete frequency sweep, and the results were used to calculate DPOAE group delay and DPOAE detection thresholds, respectively. Ratio sweeps were collected with f(2)/f(1) varied from 1.1 to 1.3 and stimulus levels of 60/45 dB SPL (L-1/L-2). Level sweeps were collected with an f(2)/f(1) of 1.22 and L-2 = 50 and L-1 varied between 20 and 70 dB SPL. Differences and correlations between trials, SE of the measurement, and confidence intervals were calculated, as well as a repeated-measures analysis of variance.
   Results: DPOAE response and behavioral threshold variability in CF patients were not significantly different across four trials. It can be expected in 95% of CF patients that differences between trials of DPOAE levels, group delay, and detection thresholds and behavioral thresholds are less than 6.26 dB, 0.87 msec, 9.34 dB, and 9.60 dB, respectively.
   Conclusions: HF DPOAEs were repeatable across four test trials for all three paradigms measured in a group of CF patients. These results are encouraging for the measurement of HF DPOAEs to be monitored in those exposed to ototoxic agents.

AB Panax quinquefoliumsaponin (PQS) composed of 45% pseudo-ginsenoside F11 (PF11), is a natural mixture of sterol compounds obtained from the American ginseng plant, having numerous promising benefits for health. However, low solubility and permeability limit the development of PQS as a therapeutic agent for oral administration. In this study, PQS liposomes (PQS-Lips) were prepared by thin layer hydration, anin situsingle-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) model was used to verify the improvement of membrane permeability of PQS-Lips. PQS-Lips had a high encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 65%similar to 70%, a particle size about 100.0 nm, and a zeta potential of -60 mV with regular spherical surface. FTIR and DSC showed the PQS in liposomes were amorphous, indicating that hydrogen bonds formed between one or several hydroxyl groups in PQS and C-O group at the phospholipid polar terminal. In addition, PQS-Lips showed sustained releasein vitrothan PQS at pH 1.2 and pH 6.8, and PQS-Lips had good stability in simulated gastric and intestinal fluid. Then, the absorption rate (K-a) and effective permeability coefficient (P-eff) of PQS-Lips in the whole small intestine were significantly higher than those in PQS solution (PQS-Sol), which proved that the PQS-Lips could significantly increase the membrane permeability of PQS and promote its absorption in the small intestine. From the experimental results, it could be known that liposome technology could effectively improve the absorption of PQS in the small intestine.

AB Soil contamination by heavy metals constitutes a serious global environmental problem, and numerous remediation technologies have been developed. In this study, a novel soil remediation agent, namely composite hydrogel (leftover rice-g-poly(acrylic acid)/montmorillonite/Urea, LR-g-PAA/MMT/urea), was prepared based on free radical polymerization cross-linking technology. Experimental results indicated that the LR-g-PAA/MMT/urea dosage increased from 0% to 10%, the oxidizable state proportions of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in contaminated soil increased from 8.3%, 23.7%, 54.0% and 11.4%e71.3%, 61.0%, 76.5%, and 27.9%, respectively. Compared with control experiment, the residue state growth rate were 56.6%, 23.4% and 39.8% for Cu, Pb and Zn respectively with 10% dosage of composite hydrogel. Simultaneously, the LR-g-PAA/MMT/urea was also seen to enhance soil fertility, including organic matter content, cation exchange capacity, and N and P contents. Pot experiments for biological toxicity suggested that the addition of hydrogel weakened the toxic effect of heavy metals on cotton seeds, and the action effect was increasingly visible with the increase of hydrogel dosage. The analysis of the mechanism involved suggested that the organic matter and its possessed characteristic functional groups could weaken the biological toxicity via complexation, adsorption, and ion exchange. Overall, the synthesized composite hydrogel exhibits great potential for the simultaneous remediation and fertility improvement of heavy metal contaminated soil. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose. This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the biologic effects of microbubble destruction with pulse-inversion harmonic imaging on rabbit liver parenchyma.
   Methods. The livers of 6 albino rabbits were examined sonographically by a single investigator. Three rabbits underwent contrast-enhanced sonography, with scanning starting 5 seconds after injection by using pulseinversion harmonic imaging with a mechanical index of 1.2. Four time-triggered images were recorded at a rate of 1 frame every 2 seconds. For comparison, 3 control rabbits had pulse-inversion harmonic imaging with a mechanical index of 1.2 only, without contrast medium. Immediately after sonography, the animals were killed and uninterrupted, thin serial sections of the liver from both groups were analyzed by energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy.
   Results. The hepatic parenchyma of rabbits exposed to contrast agents had ultrastructural damage: mitochondria with fragmented crests; interrupted rough endoplasmic reticulum; enlarged intercellular spaces; highly vacuolized cytoplasmic areas; dilated sinusoids, sometimes with an irregular and interrupted endothelial wall; fragmented hepatocyte microvilli in dilated spaces of Disse; fragmented or missing microvilli in bile canaliculi; vacuolated and lysosome-deprived hepatic cytoplasm around the bile canaliculi; markedly injured or fragmented enclothelium in larger vessels; and damaged basal membrane. Control-group results indicated that exposure to ultrasound alone did not cause ultrastructural damage to hepatic cells.
   Conclusions. Simultaneous exposure to contrast administration and pulse-inversion harmonic imaging with a high mechanical index causes uitrastructural damage in the rabbit liver.
